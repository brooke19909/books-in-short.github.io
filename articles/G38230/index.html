Decorative ornaments in the form of blacksmith tools, sickles and hammers, sparks from the anvil are hung on the walls of the tracks.  And the column structures made in the form of arcades evoke associations with Roman aqueducts or ancient bridges. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.7614779" data-lng="37.62433999999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/8/3/483.png"></div><h2>  Brief description of the station </h2><p>  The Kuznetsky Most metro station was opened in 1975, along with Pushkinskaya.

It is located on the seventh branch of the Moscow metro - the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya line. </p><p>  Due to the high functionality of the layout, beautiful decoration and the optimal ratio of space and light, this station is one of the exemplary architecture objects of the Moscow Metro.
