Moreover, these feelings were often far from positive.  For many Frenchmen, the Eiffel Tower in Paris caused deep indignation and rejection of the very fact of its existence.  Moreover, these people were far from marginal.  The rejection of this project caused a significant part of the French intellectual elite of the second half of the nineteenth century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eiffel tower in paris" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/263395.jpg" width="289"></div>

    <p>  A bit of history </p><p>  The Eiffel Tower in Paris was inaugurated in the spring of 1889.  The process of its construction took about two years.  The author of the unique building was the talented and already at that time French engineer Alexander Gustave Eiffel who had already earned a worthy reputation.  According to his projects, several stations were built in European cities and very complex bridge crossings through deep mountain canyons.  Arched metal structures were his favorite constructive element.  And the Eiffel Tower in Paris eventually became his most famous work.  Not everyone knows that the Eiffel project was originally planned for implementation in Barcelona.  And only financial difficulties prevented the city authorities from accepting it for implementation.  But in Paris, the erection of this hitherto unprecedented creation of engineering turned out to be appropriate and was timed to coincide with the opening of the world trade and industry exhibition.  The Eiffel Tower in Paris has gained great popularity since the very first days of its existence.  She instantly acquired the status of one of the main city attractions.  People deliberately traveled from far away to look at a structure unprecedented in Europe at that time.  <span>The height of the Eiffel Tower</span> in Paris exceeded three hundred meters.  This made a strong impression on the public.  Especially the observation deck and two restaurants inside the tower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the eiffel tower in paris" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/263396.jpg" width="499"></div>

Her visit is strictly necessary, and immediately after arrival, tourists begin to find out the question of where the Eiffel Tower is in Paris.  And it stands in its former place, where there was an entrance portal to an international exhibition, twenty years after the closure of which it was planned to dismantle the tower.  But this intention has long been abandoned.  And the creation of the Eiffel celebrates the second century of its existence.  She survived several unprincipled reconstructions, modernizations and restorations.  The tower became higher due to the add-on of radio antennas.  The number of visitors to its viewing platform and two restaurants has recently exceeded the 250 millionth mark. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eiffel tower height in paris" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/263394.jpg" width="496"></div>  On the tickets sold alone, the municipality of Paris earned a lot of money.  So the project of Alexander <span>Gustave Eiffel</span> was extremely successful not only technically, but also very profitable and commercially successful.  Do not forget about the symbolic significance of this architectural monument, which has become one of the most famous within our planet.  No one remembers that the Eiffel Tower in Paris was built as a temporary structure.
