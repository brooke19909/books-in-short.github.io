  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Car alarm Pandora LX 3257: specifications, instructions and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Buying a new car is a serious enough investment.  And it is not surprising that the owner of a new car tries in its absence to provide protection against various types of threats: theft, damage caused by damage, theft of wheels and other similar troubles. </p><p>  There are several ways to protect the car: insurance, secure parking, garage.  But the most common tool today is to install a car alarm.  Giving preference to one or another security complex, the motorist is guided primarily by the quality, price, reliability and guarantees of the manufacturer.  But the key role in the choice is played by the reputation of the manufacturer of car alarms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.access1alarm.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lock opening attempt" class="if uuid-3177054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135533/3177054.jpg"></div><p>  Today, Pandora security systems are recognized as the absolute market leader, and the Pandora LX 3257 car alarm is the most popular in the budget line. </p><h2>  Types of security complexes </h2><p>  All modern car alarms are divided into two types. </p><p>  With one way communication.  This system is installed by the automaker and allows you to remotely control the central lock, open and close the hood, windows, trunk.  Some models have an engine lock function and a built-in shock sensor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Two way communication.  It is installed in addition to the standard system and is additionally equipped with a key fob with a display on which notifications about the status of the system and extraneous interventions are displayed. </p><p>  Alarm systems Pandora, manufactured by Alarm Trade, are a two-way communication system.  For 15 years, the company has become a leader in the production of car alarms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mcgrp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car Alarm Kit" class="if uuid-3179778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135533/3179778.jpg"></div><p>  Pandora LX 3257 of the popular budget LX line is installed mainly on domestic models, as well as cars that are not equipped with a digital CAN-bus.  The system uses the manufacturer‚Äôs proprietary dialog code, which ensures the highest level of car security. </p><h2>  Features and Features </h2><p>  At a fairly modest cost (about ten thousand rubles), the system is equipped with all the necessary security and service functions.  The Pandora LX 3257 car alarm, tilt, and tilt sensors monitor 11 security zones. </p><p>  The kit includes the function of such an now popular option as remote engine start or automatic timer start.  It allows you to start the engine in advance and warm the interior in cold weather or cool it with air conditioning in the summer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ayarushop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Remote engine start" class="if uuid-3177229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135533/3177229.jpg"></div><p>  The Pandora LX 3257 Intelligent Alarm Turbo Timer feature helps extend the life of your turbocharged engines.  After turning off the ignition, the system leaves the engine idling for the time required to cool the turbine.  Thus, its premature destruction due to overheating is prevented. </p><p>  A USB port is provided for downloading updates on the base unit. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The system kit includes: </p><ul><li>  base unit; </li><li>  RF module; </li><li>  two key fobs: the main keychain with an LCD display and an additional one with three buttons. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="auto-chips.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alarm base unit" class="if uuid-3178380" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135533/3178380.jpg"></div><p>  Unlike its predecessor LX 3250, the system is additionally equipped with a temperature sensor for the full implementation of the autostart function.  Relays located in the base unit can be used to program various interlocks and control startup. </p><h2>  Trinket </h2><p>  <span>Keychain with LCD display is the main means of switching the</span> owner of the car with a security system.  With its help, the system is armed and disarmed remotely, monitoring security zones and programming functions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pandorainfo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pandora Car Alarm Keychain" class="if uuid-3179797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135533/3179797.jpg"></div><p>  16 different melodies are used to identify events: each has its own.  Also for this purpose, the keychain is equipped with two LEDs: </p><ul><li>  SEND indicator is green, indicates the absence of alarm events; </li><li>  the ALARM indicator is red, lights up when there are any notifications, or when communication with the base unit is lost. </li></ul><p>  The AAA battery provides up to six months of uninterrupted operation of the key fob.  The declared communication range with the base unit in an open area is 1800 m. On the display of the remote control you can see: </p><ul><li>  battery indication; </li><li>  engine and interior temperature; </li><li>  battery level; </li><li>  current time and alarm time; </li><li>  ten recent events indicating the exact time. </li></ul><p>  The key fob allows you to remotely adjust the sensitivity of shock and motion sensors. </p><h2>  Alarm setting </h2><p>  Since this system is complex electronic equipment, its installation and connection should be carried out only by a specialist electrician, preferably in a specialized auto repair center. </p><p>  General installation requirements for Pandora LX 3257: </p><ol><li>  Installation of the base unit, RF module, as well as sensors powered by the base unit, is carried out only inside the car. </li><li>  For the shock sensor to work correctly, the base unit must be rigidly fixed to the car body. </li><li>  Elements of the security system will be operated in conditions of increased vibration and significant temperature differences.  When placing them, it is necessary to provide for the most rigid fixation. </li><li>  The system indicator must be located in a place that provides unobstructed observation.  If you wish, you can disassemble the indicator housing and integrate the LED into the casing of the top of the dashboard or windshield. </li><li>  When placing the RF module, you need to remember: metal elements on the windshield and electric heating can significantly reduce the range of signal reception and transmission. </li><li>  All installation and connection of car alarms should be carried out with the "negative" battery terminal removed and the system connectors disconnected. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Installing the system on a car" class="if uuid-3177396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135533/3177396.jpg"></div><h2>  Operation manual and instruction </h2><p>  The scope of delivery includes the operating and installation instructions for the Pandora LX 3257. The instructions describe in detail: </p><ul><li>  safety requirements for system installation; </li><li>  installation requirements; </li><li>  arrangement of system elements; </li><li>  connection schemes of individual modules; </li><li>  implementation of engine control modes: "ignition support" and "turbo timer". </li></ul><p>  The instruction manual contains a detailed description of the system and its elements.  Separate sections highlight system control, programming modes, and setting alerts. </p><h2>  Pandora LX 3257 Reviews </h2><p>  A distinctive feature of Pandora car alarms of any model range, from the most expensive to the cheapest, is the same reliability.  Thanks to the proprietary development of Alarm Trade, an interactive code at 2.4 GHz, electronic hacking becomes impossible. </p><p>  Preferring Pandora LX 3257, car owners say: </p><ul><li>  budget cost; </li><li>  reliability; </li><li>  convenience and ease of use; </li><li>  the presence in this model of the autostart function. </li></ul><p>  To implement the latter, owners of cars with a standard immobilizer will additionally need to install a bypass module. </p><p>  Reviews about car alarms Pandora LX 3257 speak for themselves: over the years of operation, the model has established itself as a trouble-free system that has all the necessary functionality.  Recently, however, it has given way to more modern models with the ability to determine vehicle coordinates using GPS and GLONASS, as well as with control via applications for Android and iOs. </p>
