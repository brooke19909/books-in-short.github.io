    <h2>  Prague Castle </h2><p>  Perhaps the first thing worth mentioning is Prague Castle - the most famous place in the Czech capital.  This historical monument used to be the residence of all the rulers and kings of the state.  In addition, it is the oldest castle in the world.  In fact, Prague Castle consists of palace gardens, courtyards and <span>St. Vitus Cathedral.</span>  The latter is the main shrine in Prague, and also the most recognizable building, because its spiers are visible from almost anywhere in the city.  The most remarkable thing is that this entire architectural ensemble was built over six centuries. </p><h2>  Square </h2><p>  As a rule, the squares attract tourists with the convenient location of souvenir shops, cozy cafes where you can taste not only local dishes, but also famous Czech beer.  Old Town Square is famous for the St. Nicholas Church, where there is a chandelier donated by the last emperor of the Russian Empire, Nicholas II, as well as the Church of St. Mary and the monument to Jan Hus.  But the main attraction is the amazing <span>astronomical clock.</span>  On another, no less famous, Wenceslas Square, you can satisfy not only gastronomic interest, but also cultural interest by visiting the National Museum. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Promenade </h2>

    <p>  Like many other cities, Prague was built on the river, whose name is Vltava - along it a promenade is built.  Choose a separate day for a walk along it, the main thing is to choose the right weather to ride a catamaran in plenty.  If you are sure that there is nothing to see in the winter in Prague on the embankment, then I hasten to reassure you.  Even in the cold season, wonderful views can be enjoyed from here.  You can not only spend time with pleasure, but also make a huge number of successful photos. </p><p>  A walk along the promenade will lead you to another famous attraction, to Vysehrad.  This place is connected with the oldest legends and traditions of the Czech Republic, because there is a rotunda built in the Middle Ages, and the church of Saints Peter and Paul.  In addition, a magnificent panorama opens from the large Vysehrad garden - the whole of Prague is in full view. </p><h2>  Charles Bridge, Voyanovy Gardens and Petrshin </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Continuing the conversation about what to see in Prague, one cannot but mention the Charles Bridge.  This is the most popular place for tourists.  Once here, you can feel that you are on the Tower of Babel, because from everywhere you can hear speech in all languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world.  Here you will meet artists who will paint your portrait for a small price, as well as a huge number of musicians and souvenir sellers.  After the noise and din of Charles Bridge, be sure to go to relax in the Voyanovy Gardens - it‚Äôs quiet and calm here, except for the permanent inhabitants of this place - peacocks that make funny sounds.  Petrin Mountain is also worth your very close attention.  You can climb it both on the funicular and on foot.  Moreover, the latter option will allow you to see much more.  At the top are a relatively small garden and a viewing tower, the entrance to which is paid, but it's worth it!  After viewing the panorama of the city, you can go down to the amazingly beautiful ponds and waterfalls.  If you travel in the summer, here you can hide from the heat. </p><h2>  Gastronomic journey </h2><p>  So, we found out that it is necessary to see in Prague, however, going to the Czech Republic, get ready not only to watch, but also to try.  Some travel agencies offer so-called <span>gastronomic tours.</span>  They are prepared in such a way that all excursions pass through places famous for their dishes or drinks.  The Czech Republic is no exception.  The first thing to remember is that vegetarians will have a hard time, as Czech cuisine consists mainly of meat dishes.  Also forget about counting calories - these works of culinary art are worthy of moving away from the diet for the duration of the trip.  So, let's start with the famous pork shank: do not be surprised that you will receive one and a half kilograms of meat, so do not try to order one.  Soups are of particular interest, any cafe in a huge assortment can offer them to you, but preference should be given to dishes with a traditional serving, that is, in a plate made of bread.  Do not ignore the brawn, the so-called fried sausages with all kinds of tastes, which have very strange names, for example, "Drowned".  The Hungarian goulash dish has gained popularity in the Czech Republic, they only serve it with traditional dumplings, which are more like soaked bread. </p>

    <h2>  Beer </h2><p>  This drink is of particular importance for the Czech Republic, and even if you are not a beer lover, being in Prague you simply have to try it.  In addition, most Czech dishes are created exclusively as a snack for a foamy drink.  So if you are a beer lover, then in the list of what to see in Prague, you should definitely include such establishments as ‚ÄúAt Fleck‚Äù, ‚ÄúAt St. Thomas‚Äù and also the famous PIVOVARSKY DUM.  The first brasserie on the list is perhaps the most popular, built already in the 15th century.  Very often excursions take place precisely <br>  through it, and tourists are offered a free cup of foam.  Do not deny yourself the pleasure of tasting a caramel bread drink. </p>

    <h2>  <span>A trip to the Czech Republic on</span> its own </h2><p>  This type of travel has recently become very popular mainly due to the relatively low cost.  You think through the whole route yourself and do not wait until the whole group gathers.  However, without a preliminary analysis and collection of information, the trip may not take place.  The main question that tourists ask themselves: how and what to see in Prague on their own?  The most remarkable thing is that you, armed only with a guide, can safely walk around the city until your legs fall off.  But guided tours are even more tiring, because they take a lot of time to view one attraction, because you have to wait until everyone takes pictures.  And here you are left to your own devices: the first day you can start with a simple walk through the cozy streets that sooner or later will lead you to monuments, squares, parks or magnificent architectural buildings.  At the beginning of the article is a list of places that should be visited first, but while you get to them, you can meet many other wonders of architecture: cathedrals, of which there are a huge number, bridges that are distinguished by their unique style.  It‚Äôs better to plan your walks in advance and create your own list of what you can see in Prague. </p><h2>  How to make a route </h2><p>  Thanks to the features of the city, it will not be difficult to draw up your hiking scheme.  Almost the entire old city is one huge attraction.  Walking there, you will surely stumble upon one of the places that is indicated in your guidebook.  By the way, this is an indispensable thing for a traveler, because not only is there a map of the city with marks where you can eat or relax after a long walk, but also all the places to visit are painted with a detailed description of the route. </p><p>  Do not forget that universities in Prague are worth special attention because they are historical buildings of unimaginable beauty.  You can only envy the students who study there.  Of course, you can always take a tour along one of the most popular routes, but this is not the most comfortable way to explore the Czech capital. </p>

    <h2>  Seven day tour </h2><p>  Most tours are designed specifically for the week, because this is the most optimal time for which you can see the maximum number of attractions.  Of course, for many this will not be enough, which is not surprising: each building looks like a work of art.  This is the case in almost any European city, and Prague is no exception.  What to see in a week in the Czech capital?  The first day you can just enjoy an unhurried walk, get comfortable, go to the Old Town Square and wait for the famous astronomical clock to strike at noon.  Give the second day in full to the Prague Castle and adjacent parks and gardens, Golden Lane and other attractions in the area.  Spend a separate day visiting museums such as the Czech Museum of Music or the Kafka Museum.  In one of the allotted seven days, you can go on an excursion outside of Prague, for example, in Karlovy Vary or look at medieval castles.  Do not deny yourself a trip, because even the most popular places will not be able to fully show the cultural wealth that Prague and the Czech Republic possess.  What to see, where to go and what to try - do not limit yourself to the instructions in the guidebooks alone, walk on your own and have fun! </p>
