    <h2>  Hotel Infrastructure </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the Petrograd Fort Hotel (Dzhemete) does not offer too many amenities on the territory of its guests.  2014 was, for example, for this hotel, apparently, not too profitable.  Tourists having a rest at that time in the hotel often left not particularly flattering reviews about it.  The fact is that in the complex at that time there was a lot of unfinished construction.  Unfortunately, most infrastructure facilities are not ready at this hotel until now (2016).  It concerns, for example, the pool and the scene. </p><p>  Of the facilities on site, only parking and laundry with ironing facilities are provided.  Also, tourists, if desired, can order here a transfer from the airport and buy plane tickets. </p><h2>  Petrogradsky Fort Hotel (Dzhemete): guest reviews on the rooms </h2><p>  The opinion about the accommodation rented at this hotel by tourists has been mixed.  The rooms here are quite spacious.  Also, the advantages of the hotel, many tourists include the responsiveness of the administration. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, there are not very good reviews about furniture and bed linen at this hotel on the Web.  The beds here are old and not particularly comfortable, and the sheets and pillowcases are worn out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure Opinion </h2><p>  The service provided at the Petrograd Fort Hotel has earned mostly not very good reviews from guests.  There are too few services for tourists on site.  The absence of a pool and a playground, most vacationers, of course, are attributed to the huge disadvantages of this complex. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  The dining room at the Petrograd Fort Hotel has its own.  The opinion about the dishes served here was quite good for the guests.  The cook of the hotel, according to most vacationers, is simply excellent.  Meals in the dining room are always delicious and fresh. </p><p>  Many tourists consider only a not very convenient schedule as some drawback of the hotel buffet.  But in any case, quite good infrastructure is offered to vacationers by the resorts of Anapa, Dzhemete.  Petrogradsky Fort is located in this regard in a fairly convenient location.  Near this hotel is not only a lot of shops, mini markets and supermarkets, but also canteens.  If desired, the guests of the complex can eat at any of these catering establishments. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  Many tourists are sure that the most beautiful and comfortable beaches are located in this part of the Black Sea coast, namely in Dzhemete.  The Petrograd Fort, as already mentioned, is located just a couple of steps from the sea.  Unfortunately, this complex does not have a private beach.  The guests of the hotel visit the public zone of the coast belonging to the village. </p>
