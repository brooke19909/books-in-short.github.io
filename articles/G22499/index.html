But usually they arrange skiers of various levels.  The first track is intended for those who first started skiing.  The second is suitable for those who want more serious descents, but are not yet ready for extreme sports.  The last track is the most difficult and made so that it will appeal to experienced athletes. </p><p>  Those who want to ride a cheesecake use a separate descent. </p><p>  All routes with which Eagle Mountain is equipped do not stand out for their particular duration or for too steep slopes and elevations.  Basically, they are intended so that you can study, train and improve your skills a little.  That is, the park is equipped to enjoy the simple skiing. </p><p>  The slopes are always in good snow condition thanks to special equipment.
