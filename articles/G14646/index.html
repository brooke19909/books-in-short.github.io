  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to restore a laptop or car battery</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Often there are situations in which people after a relatively short use of a laptop begin to wonder how to restore the battery.  This is due to the fact that during constant <span>use the</span> laptop <span>battery</span> gradually loses its charge, and after some time it starts to ‚Äúsit down‚Äù very quickly.  In this case, many go to the store in order to buy a new one.  However, this is not necessary.  After all, it is now known how to restore the battery.  It will take a little more time, but it will save you money. </p><p>  Before you <span>restore the</span> laptop <span>battery</span> , you need to figure out what type it is.  The most commonly used lithium-ion and nickel-metal hydride batteries.  Which type your part belongs directly to can be read on its case (Li-ion, NiMh). </p><p>  The recovery process must begin with the disassembly of the batteries.  Most often, their designs are not collapsible, so it is necessary to carefully disconnect the body glued from two parts with a knife.  It is important not to damage the internal elements.  Then you should determine the <span>rated voltage of the</span> battery.  If you have nickel-metal hydride, then you need to multiply the number of its elements by 1.2 V.  After that, using a multimeter, we measure the voltage at the extreme terminals of the group of elements having a serial connection (a light from the car should be connected to the load).  If the device displays a voltage equal to the rated voltage, but the <span>laptop does not turn on,</span> then the battery controller is faulty.  If the voltage is less than necessary, then measure it on each individual element.  Then, in order, we completely discharge each element by connecting a light bulb.  Then we charge using a car light and a laptop power supply.  In series with the elements we connect the light bulb and the power supply, wait until the voltage on each element becomes 1.1 V, after which we connect the standard device for charging.  We perform such discharge-charge actions three times and check the battery operation in the laptop.  If everything you have done does not help and the battery does not come to life, then buying a new one is inevitable. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before telling how to restore a <span>lithium-ion battery,</span> it is worth noting that this type requires special care during the repair.  The principle of checking the voltage is similar to the previous one, only it should reach 3.7-4.1 V in each element.  At the terminals we measure the voltage with the load of a car bulb.  3.7 V multiplied by the number of elements.  Compare the results.  If they are equal, it is necessary to repair the controller.  If the total voltage is less than the proper level, we proceed to measure it on each individual element.  Before measurements, parallel units should be separated and soldered off the battery controller.  We identify non-working elements and change them to working ones.  Before assembling and connecting the elements, they must be discharged.  You can also do this with a car bulb.  After the battery has been restored, it is necessary to reassemble its body, gluing it with glue for reliability. </p><p>  Sometimes a similar situation occurs with the car.  The battery fails over and over again, but there is no money for a new one yet.  In this case, it will be useful to know how to restore the car battery.  The reason for its failure most often becomes a decrease in capacity, which occurred as a result of prolonged discharge.  In this situation, a long discharge-charge cycle helps.  To do this, drain the old electrolyte and rinse the battery with distilled water.  Then you need to dilute the desulphating additive with electrolyte and pour into the battery.  When these steps are completed, connect the charger in the automatic mode of the charge-discharge cycle until the voltage rises to 14 V. After that, the charging cycle should be performed to the rated voltage.  The battery is ready for use. </p>
