    <p>  The central boulevard of the city smoothly passes into the terrace of Richard Wagner.  It is not at all surprising that the bewitching sounds of his music are sung here by local musicians. </p><h2>  Salerno </h2><p>  And at the end of our short trip, we will visit the pulsating heart of the coast - the beautiful Salerno, which is famous for its very beautiful promenade, historical center and medical school (active) of the late Middle Ages.

And in Areca Castle you can see the medieval water supply system that has survived to this day. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  The Amalfi coast of Italy, reviews of which are really only enthusiastic, is a magnificent nature, comfortable living conditions, excellent service.  Here lovers of nightly entertainment and fans of a quiet pastime comfortably relax.  The organizers of resorts from families with children deserve a lot of kind words.  Rest of little tourists is thought out here to the smallest detail.  And educational excursions are interesting not only for adults, but also for teenagers. </p><p>  Most tourists note that these small resorts delight in their originality.  Bright small cities with very narrow streets seem unusual to Russians.  Many note the benevolence of the local population.  If you even speak a little Italian, they will tell you in detail how to get to the attractions of interest to you.  And of course, the main share of positive reviews relates to well-equipped and well-groomed beaches. <br><br></p>
