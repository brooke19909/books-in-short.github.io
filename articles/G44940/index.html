Solotvino (Transcarpathia, Ukraine)</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On the eve of the holiday season, all people are puzzled by the question of where to go.  In addition to popular options (warm seas, abroad), there is another direction - medical tourism.  To improve their health, people choose the Dead Sea (Israel), the Caucasus with numerous sources of mineral waters, and the Hungarian baths.  But there is a place much closer that can give both treatment and relaxation: Solotvino is a village located in Ukrainian Transcarpathia.  Other names for it are Slatina, Aknaslatina, Maramoroshskoy Solotvino, Slatinski Doli. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest solotvino" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/798764.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Amazing corner </h2><p>  So, the place where we spend our virtual vacation is Solotvino.  This is a very picturesque area: on one side the turbulent river Tisza flows its waters, and on the other, the mighty slopes of the Carpathians rise.  Solotvino is an amazing, albeit a very small village, located near the <span>state border of</span> Ukraine with Romania.  A modest, at first glance, village is considered to be a true Transcarpathian health resort, since it has a whole complex of thermal <span>salt lakes.</span>  The settlement itself arose a very long time ago, and solely salt-diggers lived here with their families.  You can learn about its development from the expositions of the Museum of the History of Salt Mines. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Salt in ancient times was valued dearly, but because the owners of the mines were very influential people.  When the supply of resources was exhausted, the place was chosen by doctors who are developing <span>salt treatment</span> methods <span>that</span> have no analogues.  One of the most popular is the speleotherapy method used in the local allergological hospital.  With its help, minor disorders of the <span>respiratory system</span> and more serious illnesses (tuberculosis, bronchitis, asthma) are treated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in the Carpathians solotvino" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/798763.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  For health - in Transcarpathia </h2><p>  A sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpositive emotions and an ocean of joy is able to give <span>rest in the Carpathians.</span>  Solotvino also offers to improve his health.  Here is a small list of diseases that vacationers on salt lakes successfully fight against.  It: </p><ul><li>  diseases of the respiratory system (asthma, tuberculosis); </li><li>  allergy; </li><li>  various skin diseases (psoriasis, eczema); </li><li>  disorders of the nervous system, arthritis, sciatica; </li><li>  diseases of the cardiovascular system; </li><li>  urological disorders; </li><li>  diseases of the musculoskeletal system, fractures, etc. </li></ul><p>  Of the methods here, doctors practice speleotherapy, mud therapy, halotherapy, hydrotherapy (both external procedures and internal use). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Carpathians solotvino rest" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/798765.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  In addition to the abandoned <span>salt mines,</span> another vacation is also popular in the village: Solotvino has several reservoirs on its territory that can easily compete with the Dead Sea in terms of water saturation with useful substances.  And from the bottom of the ponds you can get healing mud, which should be smeared with the whole body and allowed to dry.  Such a mask makes the skin very smooth, heals wounds and relieves inflammatory processes in tissues. </p><p>  What are the other attractive Carpathians?  Solotvino, a vacation in which will help restore vitality, is considered the cultural center of Ukrainians, Hungarians and Romanians.  At the end of July, every year in the village is the ethnic festival "Melodies of Salt Lakes."  The scene of the festivities is the shore of the largest salt lake Kunigunda, where they set up a large stage for performances. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  What else is worth knowing for travelers who are going on vacation?  Solotvino, despite the fact that annually receives thousands of guests from all over the world, is still not as famous as the resorts of Hungary.  There is not enough state support, advertising, infrastructure is not well developed.  However, there is more than one recreation center.  Solotvino has a wide selection of establishments where you can relax in comfort, and also offers small wooden houses, ideal for families with children or a large, friendly company. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center solotvino" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/798766.jpg" width="224"></div>

    <p>  For more economical travelers, a budget option is offered.  This is a private sector where you can find a modest room or real royal chambers.  All, of course, envy the thickness of the traveler‚Äôs wallet.  It is worth considering that housing located near the lakes is slightly more expensive than that from which you still need to get to healing ponds.  You can also go to Solotvino savages.  In the village, not far from the salt lakes, there are places where you can put a tent and a car in the parking lot.  Entrance to the reservoirs is paid, but the ticket price is low. </p><p>  In the immediate vicinity of the ponds there are trays where you can buy bathing suits, slippers, clothes, <span>lifebuoys</span> and toys for children.  A little further - the food market with very affordable prices for goods.  There are several food establishments in Solotvino, hotel complexes, sanatoriums, recreation centers. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Tourists can be reached by rail and by car (bus).  There are two railway stations in Solotvino: Solotvino 1 and Solotvino Hospital.  A bus from Uzhgorod will arrive in the village in three hours (route Uzhhorod ‚Äì Rakhiv). </p>
