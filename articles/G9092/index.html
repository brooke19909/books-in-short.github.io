    <p>  The village of Miskhor on the map of Crimea is part of the southern coast, where the Mediterranean climate prevails.  A special influence on its formation is exerted by such factors as the sea and mountains.  The first, warming up over the summer, softens winter weather, and in summer cools the coast, reducing heat.  Here is a special air in which the aromas of the sea and coniferous forest are mixed.  The beach season lasts a very long time, so the rest will be beautiful not only in the summer, but also in early autumn and late spring.  In this fertile climate, a wide variety of plants grow and bloom all year round, pleasing to the eye and filling the air with oxygen and a delicious aroma. </p><h2>  History of Mishor </h2>

The name itself, translated from Greek, means "middle settlement", as it is located between the larger villages of Koreiz and Gaspra.  Now Miskhor is territorially united with Koreiz.  Since not far from this area is Livadia, which was chosen by Russian emperors in the nineteenth century, Mishor began to attract the attention of representatives of the upper classes who built their residences here.  Many modern sanatoriums are located in the territories and in the buildings of the former noble estates.  In the Soviet period, the state took care of its citizens, creating conditions that ensure them a quality vacation in the Crimea.  Miskhor became the place where several trade unions of large industries built their health resorts.

In fact, it has long merged with Yalta, so the movement through the village and into the city is perfectly carried out by road and water.  It should be noted that on the Crimean peninsula Miskhor is considered an elite recreation area, because it combines elements of urban infrastructure and beautiful nature.  A large beach with a length of seven kilometers is replaced by a strip of estates and sanatoriums, and then a green river of coniferous forest spreads over which Ai-Petri Mountain rises.  Thus, vacationers can visit several natural areas for a short time, which eliminates the monotony.  To Ai-Petri laid the longest mounted unsupported cable car in Europe.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During the rest of Crimea (Miskhor in particular) will allow you to enjoy amazing beauties and historical monuments.  There is an opportunity to visit the picturesque landscape park, founded in the seventeenth century and stretching almost along the entire coast.  More than a hundred different species of exotic plants will be a real aesthetic discovery for visitors.  In the evening, the park illuminates the color music fountain.  On the territory of Miskhor are several palaces built in the nineteenth - early twentieth century.  It: </p><p>  - <span>Yusupov Palace,</span> created in the new Romanesque style. </p><p>  - The Charax Estate, whose architect reproduced the motives of Scottish architecture. </p><p>  - Palace "Dulber" ("beautiful") in Koreiz, imitating the Arab canons. </p><p>  - The Galician Palace, which is now called "Yasnaya Polyana" in memory of Leo Tolstoy, who visited there at the beginning of the last century. </p><p>  Locals will tell the legend underlying the stunning monuments of sculpture: the group "Bronze Mermaid with a Child" and "Fountain", created in the early twentieth century.  Not far from Miskhor is the Swallow's Nest, a park in Livadia and other attractions of the surroundings. <strong></strong></p><h2>  Sanatorium rest </h2><p>  They go south not only to relax by the sea, but also to improve their health.  Although the sun, water and air are the best doctors in and of themselves, sometimes this is not enough.  Examination by professional doctors, massage services and the implementation of some procedures will combine business with pleasure.  Therefore, one of the options for vacation spots is a sanatorium.  Miskhor (Crimea) is a resort where several of the largest, well-equipped hospitals are located.  One of them is called "Ukraine".  This is a modern palace, towering above the greenery of the park and standing directly above the sea.  It has several buildings with one-, three-room rooms.  On its territory there are pools, a post office, a beauty salon. </p><p>  In the palace of the nineteenth century the sanatorium of the same name "Dyulber" is equipped, providing an exquisite rest in combination with medical services.  A unique medical base based on state-of-the-art medical equipment was created in the Pine Grove hospital located near the sea.  Patients with asthma, ischemia, varicose veins with great pleasure visit the Crimea, the <span>sanatorium "Miskhor".</span>  The prices in it are quite liberal and are fully compensated by the medical services received. </p><h2>  Miskhor Hotels </h2>

Miskhor is a place where there are a huge number of hotels of various levels and for every taste.  Most of them are located in the upper part of the village, but this is not so important, since its entire length is very small.  From anywhere you can reach the beach in minutes.  Although the word "hotel" often does not cause us pleasant associations, hotel owners do everything possible to make the stay of guests in their possessions interesting and varied.  Of course, the level of service is inferior to the European one, but the conditions for a quiet high-quality rest are created.  So, in many places there are playgrounds and rooms where professional educators deal with kids, bars and saunas, swimming pools, picnic areas and much more.  At your service are the hotels "1001 Nights", "Marat", "Renaissance", "Gloria", "Elena", "Prince's Castle", Villa "Sosnovy Bor" and others.

    <p>  At the foot of Mount Ai-Petri is the Renaissance Hotel.  It is interesting in that it is located in a 19th-century estate building, renovated in 2004 and combining the sophistication of the century before last with modern service.  In the center of Miskhor, at the very entrance to the old park, a luxurious hotel with the fabulous name "Thousand and One Nights" hospitably opens its doors to guests.  There are cheaper options.  For example, the villa-hotel "Prince's Castle", the hotel "Nest".  Their cozy rooms have everything for a complete comfortable stay. </p><h2>  Ai-petri </h2><p>  More than 1200 meters above sea level rises the most popular peak among tourists in the Crimea.  Mount Ai-Petri takes its name from the Greek monastery of St. Peter, once located on its plateau.  The weathering of the calcareous rocks that make up the massif created the battlements on its top, which became the symbol of the Crimea.  The breathtaking view becomes a reward for anyone who dares to climb the mountain.  It should be remembered that from the subtropical climate you will find yourself in a completely different temperature regime, so it is not out of place to take a jacket or a windbreaker with you.  You can climb Ai-Petri by car or by <span>cable car.</span>  The latter is additional impressions, so to speak, bonuses, and no less interesting than the hill itself. </p><h2>  Price and quality </h2>

The natural question is the price of all this pleasure.  As stated earlier, Miskhor is an elite vacation.  Being, in fact, part of Big Yalta, it combines the purity, silence and beauty of amazing nature in the best frames of human activity with the ability to plunge into the noisy and vibrant life of the resort town at any time: visit the promenade, visit theaters, concert halls, restaurants , movies and more.  So, speaking about the price, it is worth noting that this is not the cheapest pleasure, but high quality.  In addition, in the village of Miskhor <span>hotels, inns,</span> pensions and resorts vary in price depending on the level of rooms and services provided, so an economical option is also quite possible.  Although most visitors to the resort are still wealthy people.

    <p>  This season, due to well-known political upheavals, prices for holidays in the Crimea as a whole, and in Yalta in particular, are much lower than before.  Much more depends on the time of year.  The highest prices are in July-August, while the improvement and relaxation in this area are good all year round.  The first autumn months, the so-called velvet season, provide special opportunities.  Sanatorium treatment with accommodation and services this year will cost from one thousand rubles a day per person to 6-8 thousand, the cost of hotel accommodation depends on the level of service, but, of course, cheaper. </p><h2>  How to get to Mishor </h2>
