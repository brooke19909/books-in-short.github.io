  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Great geographical discoveries</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The 15-17th centuries left a significant imprint on the history and economy of all mankind.  In this era, great geographical discoveries take place, which were a prerequisite for the development of the bourgeois <span>mode of production.</span>  They were caused primarily by the active growth of the <span>productive forces of</span> medieval society and the development of monetary relations, in which it became necessary to find new partners for trade, materials and gold. </p><p>  The significance of great geographical discoveries cannot be underestimated.  The Europeans, by opening new sea routes and lands, contributed to the establishment of cultural and trade contacts between countries, the acquisition of new economic and natural resources, and expanded ideas about the life of people in other countries and continents. </p><p>  To make great geographical discoveries became possible thanks to the active development of science and technology.  During this period, powerful sailing ships suitable for ocean navigation were built, navigation instruments improved, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe sphericity of planets was approved, navigation was developing in eastern countries. </p><p>  The impetus for Europeans to search for new routes to the East was the obstacles and restrictions that created the Turks and Arabs on the way to India.  In this regard, a plan is being developed to reach the front East around Africa by sea. </p><p>  Only powerful centralized Western European monarchical states could afford to equip complex and costly expeditions.  Spain and Portugal are the first countries to send their ships to conquer the ocean.  In 1486, Mediterranean sailors circled the southern part of the African continent, already in 1498 the <span>famous traveler</span> Vasco da Gamma managed to reach the coast of India.  However, Portugal blocked for other states the path along Africa. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Christopher Columbus,</span> having received the support of Spain, went on a journey across the <span>Atlantic Ocean</span> in a westerly direction.  The result of the expedition was the discovery of the American continent. </p><p>  Describing the great geographical discoveries, one cannot fail to mention the trip around the world, led by Fernando Magellan.  It laid the foundation for the development of the expanses of the Pacific Ocean. </p><p>  In the 16-17th century, discoveries were made by French and English travelers in North America and Russian sailors in Northeast Asia, who came ashore in the Pacific Ocean. </p><p>  Great geographical discoveries and their consequences. </p><p>  The result of VGO was the expansion of the world market, the rivalry of nations in the desire to get Asian treasures and a rigid <span>colonial system.</span>  The centers of trade routes from this moment become England, Portugal, Spain, France and the Netherlands. </p><p>  As a result of colonial policy, large quantities of silver and gold began to be delivered to Europe from subordinate countries.  The result was a price revolution (a sharp increase in the value of agricultural and industrial products).  In Spain, there was a four-fold increase in price, in Holland, France and England - 2.5.  This situation led to the fact that in these countries a prosperous bourgeois stratum of society was formed quite quickly. </p><p>  Great geographical discoveries contributed to the expansion of the global market and the increase in the number of goods.  New products are becoming known: coffee, tobacco, cocoa, tea, corn, cotton, etc. </p><p>  Colonies for the industry of European countries from this moment are capacious foreign markets.  Failure to fully satisfy the increased <span>demand for goods</span> leads to a crisis in the guild system.  Instead of craftsmanship, a capitalist manufactory appears, which, thanks to the division of labor, significantly increases production volumes.  As a result, commercial and industrial capital is concentrated in the hands of a new class - the bourgeoisie. </p><p>  It is safe to say that the VGO facilitated the transition from the feudal to the capitalist mode of production. </p>
