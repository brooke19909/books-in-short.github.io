By the way, the Park Hotel Stavropol does not often open vacancies, and it‚Äôs not easy to get an interview, as the staff requirements are high.  This indicates that the hotel cares about its reputation.  Only those who have the best qualities and are ready to provide guests with a comfortable stay can work here. </p><p>  Pleasantly surprised by the presence of Wi-Fi, gym, hairdresser.  The windows have a wonderful view, and the restaurant has panoramic windows, the opportunity to see the city in full view. </p><p>  And I also liked, judging by the reviews, the spacious parking and the ability to wash the car, taking advantage of the additional services provided by the hotel. </p><p>  But the guests did not like the fact that the gym is always full.  It is also visited by locals.  There is no horizontal bar and it is incredibly crowded, which makes it impossible to engage and enjoy the workout. </p><p>  Be sure to come to visit the Park Hotel Stavropol.  How to get there  It will not be difficult.  After all, the hotel is a 20-minute drive from <span>Stavropol airport.</span>  You can take a taxi or use the shuttle.  The hotel is 5 kilometers from the railway station.  Here you are waiting for an unforgettable experience, cosiness, comfort, friendly staff, delicious cuisine, excellent service and many other additional services. </p>
