    <h2>  Doreta Beach Resort &amp; SPA 4 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  Since it is very important for many vacationers to find out the opinions of other travelers about a particular hotel, we decided to summarize the main reviews of our compatriots who recently stayed at Doreta Beach. </p><p>  In general, tourists in most cases were satisfied with the value for money in this hotel.  Of the advantages, the proximity of the beach and the constant availability of free sunbeds and umbrellas, an excellent swimming pool with slides, interesting and varied animation, as well as efficient and helpful staff, are noted.  In general, tourists considered this hotel more suitable for a relaxing family vacation with children than for active pastime. </p><p>  The disadvantages of ‚ÄúDoreta Beach‚Äù are not always distinguished by good repair in the rooms, insufficient variety of dishes, a rare change of linen and towels.
