Gelendzhik is one of the most popular resort towns of the coast.  Millions of tourists visit it annually.  There are many interesting sights, magnificent bars and restaurants, night clubs and, of course, hotels.  Some accommodation facilities are classified as urban: they are located in the center or close to it and have a small cozy area.  Others are located on the first, second or third coastline, have a large area.  Hotel "Cruise" in Gelendzhik belongs to the coastal accommodation facilities, the distance to the sea is only 50 m. We will dwell on it in more detail in the article. </p><h2>  "White bride" </h2><p>  Scientists claim that the name of this popular resort of federal significance from the Turkic language is translated exactly that.  Among the Caucasus Mountains, overgrown with lush vegetation, a beautiful city stands on a wide coastal strip.  Today it is difficult to imagine that in modern times this modern resort was a commercial slave settlement.  Turkish Pasha took goryanka, beautiful potential brides for their harems from the Gelendzhik Bay.  This is where the name of the future city came from. </p>

    <p>  The beaches of Gelendzhik deserve special attention.  The most important, pebble, is located in the city center, others are sandy, pebble-sandy.  The quiet harbor of the bay guards the coast from northern winds, strong storms.  The sea is very clean, transparent, warms up well.  This city is loved by families with children.  Well-developed infrastructure, a lot of cultural and leisure facilities and magnificent hotels attract many tourists.  I would like to talk about one of the best hotels in the city in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel "Cruise" (Gelendzhik): location and features </h2><p>  In one of the prestigious areas of the city, which is beautifully called "Magnolia", there is a hotel complex of international level.  Tourists appreciate primarily the excellent location of the hotel: close to the center and only 2-3 minutes to the sea.  The building resembles the famous liner of the same name.  The Cruise Hotel in Gelendzhik is famous for its very high level of service, comfortable accommodation in modern rooms decorated according to European standards. </p>

    <p>  The hotel is positioned as a family and business.  Many parents come here with their children and leave in ecstasy.  By the way, children under 4 years can stay here for free (without providing additional space).  For many businessmen, there is no question of choosing a hotel when planning a business visit to Gelendzhik.  According to reviews, the Cruise Hotel is the most popular venue for seminars, conferences and other important events.  Young and energetic party-goers may find it boring here. </p><h2>  The wonders of infrastructure </h2><p>  The main building has six floors.  The architects thought up the layout very interestingly: if you look at the Cruise hotel in Gelendzhik a little from the side, its upper part is very similar to the bow and the deck of the famous ocean liner.  At this place is a respectable panoramic suite, which covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 100 m <sup>2</sup> .  The cost of such accommodation per day is about 9,000 rubles.  There are more economical options at affordable prices, but more on that later. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The hotel management appreciates the opinion of its customers, so every year there are various renovations.  For example, in 2017, a multifunctional conference room was improved.  Now it is possible to arrange business events in it (meetings, seminars, trainings, team briefings), celebrations, etc. </p><p>  The Cruise Hotel on Serafimovich (Gelendzhik) belongs to the same well-known hotel brand Kompass Hotels.  This branch is a little more modest and is rated at 3 *, but the quality of service and license plate is also at the highest level. </p><h2>  We are comfortable </h2><p>  This is a completely new hotel, the interior of which takes into account the smallest needs of customers for comfort.  The entire room fund of the Cruise Hotel in Gelendzhik is made in the style of classical minimalism: there is nothing superfluous, everything is strict, modern and functional.  The lighting system allows you to adjust the built-in lights and the main chandelier.  Comfortable for the body temperature, each guest can adjust independently with the help of individual air conditioners and heating devices. </p><p>  The room categories at the Compass Cruise Hotel Gelendzhik 4 * are divided into the categories Standard, 18.5 m <sup>2</sup> and 20 m <sup>2</sup> , Studio (25 m to 35 m <sup>2</sup> ) with balconies, Suite ( 40 m <sup>2</sup> ) and Panoramic Suite (109 m <sup>2</sup> ).  As can be seen from the description, the types of accommodation differ in area and the presence or absence of balconies.  The "Studio" is divided into sleeping and living areas, the "Suite" has two rooms, and the "Panoramic Suite" ... Better look at the photo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>
