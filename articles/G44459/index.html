Tsokkos Protaras Beach 4 *</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Cyprus resort of Protaras has recently become a favorite vacation spot for many Russian tourists.  Here, away from the bustle of the city, life becomes calm and measured, and time flows unnoticed.  <span>Protaras</span> favorably distinguishes itself from other resorts of <span>Cyprus</span> in a leisurely atmosphere.  This small town in the southeast of the island is located just one hour from Larnaca Airport.  Today one cannot even believe that not so long ago there was a deserted coast covered with shrubs and fig groves.  Thanks to the rapid development of infrastructure, in the last decade, modern Protaras resembles Las Vegas rather than a Greek settlement. </p>

    <p>  Attracted by Protaras and numerous divers from around the world, this is one of the most interesting places to study the underwater life of the Mediterranean Sea.  The coastline here is very indented, while diving with a scuba diving and mask you can see unusual underwater caves and rocks. </p><h2>  Beaches and hotels of Protaras </h2><p><strong></strong>  A small resort town famous for its beaches, they are rightly considered a landmark of Protaras, the best, well-maintained and clean in Cyprus.  Many of them are marked with the Blue Flag.  In addition, in the summer the Mediterranean Sea is calm, and therefore even the sandy beaches of the village boast clear water.  Each of them has a convenient entry into the sea.  The most famous is the beach in Fig Three Bay, in the center of the resort village, it is named because of the fig trees growing here.  Konnos Bay is considered the best for a secluded holiday, for visiting with children a small Scoutari Beach is only 50 meters long, and Louma Beach is a larger beach (400 meters), but the latter is a few kilometers from the shops and taverns of the center of Protaras.  For diving enthusiasts, Pernera Beach is the place to go.  This beach offers not only relaxation by the sea, but also service in any of the five restaurants located on its territory.  Not only professionals, but also beginners can dive here, there are instructors.  However, the beach is not suitable for families with children because of the rather steep bottom. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Protaras is ready to offer guests of the island a lot of comfortable options for accommodation - from relatively budget to luxury.  Those who are going on vacation to <span>Cyprus (Protaras), reviews of</span> tourists about hotels will be useful to study.  After all, as you know, the main thing that determines the choice of a hotel is the ratio of price and quality.  From this point of view, four-star hotels are of interest.  These are very comfortable complexes located right on the coast (maximum 7 minutes walk), with optimal prices.  Most of the beaches in the village are municipal, but 4-star hotels have their own beaches.  Tourists visiting Cyprus (Protaras) 4 * hotels can choose based on prices and their own preferences.  However, it should be remembered that the prices here vary depending on the season, the comfort of the room and the location of the hotel relative to the center of the resort town.  So, on average, room prices in hotels of this category start from 15 thousand rubles per night.  However, for example, in the <span>Crystal Springs Beach Hotel</span> 4 *, the most distant from the center (3 km), you can find a room worth more than 5 thousand rubles.  Central hotels such as Sunrise Beach Hotel, Anastasia Beach Hotel, Sunrise Pearl Hotel &amp; SPA, offer more expensive rooms. </p><h2>  Tsokkos Protaras Beach 4 * </h2><p>  Among the comfortable and cozy hotels of Protaras, it is undoubtedly worth considering the luxurious complex belonging to the Tsokkos chain.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, the hotel Tsokkos Beach 4 * deserves attention.  The comfortable hotel complex is located in the very center of the town, close to shops, but a little distance from the noisy boulevard, due to this there is an atmosphere of peace and tranquility.  From Larnaca Airport Tsokkos Beach 4 * (on the map you can see the route) is 60 km away, the bus ride will take about an hour.  And the famous tourist center of Ayia Napa is 15 km from the hotel.  The complex was built in 1988, the last major overhaul was made recently, in 2013. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p><strong></strong>  Protaras beaches are mostly paid, but guests of Tsokkos Beach 4 * use the private beach of Odessa Hotel, as it belongs to the same owner.  This luxurious beach is one of the best on the coast.  Also, reviews often mention the magnificent pool in the area with a pressure-jet, the excellent work of the animators, the incredibly clear sea and the pool on the territory, the convenient location of the hotel: three minutes walk to the sea and the same to the nearest supermarkets. </p><p>  Among the minuses, some tourists noted insufficient food and noise in rooms with street views until late at night, as there are entertainment venues nearby.  However, the choice of the room is for the vacationers, you can always change it to the one whose windows face the courtyard, the pool. </p><p>  Some guests say that their favorite place in the hotel was a huge veranda of the restaurant, from which a stunning view of the sea opens up to the eye.  You can have dinner or lunch here, but since it‚Äôs quite hot during the day, many people prefer to spend the evening on the veranda with a glass of tequila or a glass of wine.  Tourists also note the quality of local beer, both dark and light: unpasteurized, draft, draft and heavy.  The guests also liked the fact that neither the maids nor the waiters took a tip, no matter how much they were offered, was not accepted here.  But you can still thank the staff for the quick and high-quality service; the staff are very happy with Russian souvenirs. </p><p>  Vacationers called almost the most pleasant surprise that awaited them at the hotel, daily ice cream, which is offered on an all-inclusive basis, and various: chocolate, vanilla, strawberries.  I was also pleased that the kind bartenders in the pool bar prepare a variety of cocktails for guests absolutely free of charge, there are about 25 items.  Although, of course, there were some complaints about the specifics of local cuisine.  Breakfast at the hotel is traditionally served European, but most of the dishes prepared for lunch and dinner are seasoned with specific sauces.  Some believe that these delicacies are an amateur, while others, on the contrary, liked the flavor of local cuisine. </p><p> Many vacationers at the hotel advise taking a car at a rental point on the territory to travel around the island on their own, and the hotel staff will help to develop a tourist route.  They also note that there is a very well-developed bus service, and many interesting places to visit in the vicinity are easily accessible by public transport.  Guests at the complex recommend a visit to the Church of St. Elijah, located nearby on the mountain.  At the top of the mountain there is a wish tree, where tourists traditionally leave ribbons.  They say that the plan will certainly come true. </p><p>  In general, our compatriots leave rather warm reviews about their holidays in Protaras, considering the town the most comfortable and calm resort of the island with luxurious beaches.  Many tourists say that they would like to return to Tsokkos Beach 4 *, Protaras gave them great memories. </p>
