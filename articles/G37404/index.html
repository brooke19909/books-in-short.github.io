First of all, it was during this period that the patriarchate was established on the territory of the current state.  Also, Moscow was visited by the eastern patriarch Jeremiah during the reign of Tsar Theodore Ioannovich.  The first patriarch was Job, who at that time had reached several posts in the church diocese.  For the ministers of the <span>Russian Orthodox Church,</span> such an event became one of the main stages in the formation of independent Orthodoxy. </p><h2>  1589: event in Russia </h2><p>  In February 1589, during the reign of the son of Ivan the Terrible, a patriarchate was created.  At that time, the Council of Russian Bishops, along with the decision of the Patriarch of Constantinople Jeremiah II, unanimously elected Metropolitan Job. </p><p>  It should be noted that up to this point the Orthodox Church of Russia was not separate and independent, and also did not have the right to make any decisions.  She had to completely and unquestioningly submit to <span>the Patriarchate of Constantinople.</span>  Based on this, we can note the first formation of Russian Orthodoxy as an independent industry. </p>

    <p>  In February 1589, a canonical resolution of the first Orthodox Russian patriarch took place in the Assumption Cathedral of the Kremlin.  In the Charter, which legalized the act of creating a patriarchate, the creation of the Church of the Third Rome was noted.  She was one of the most influential institutions both in grandeur and in world domination. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Short biography of Job (John) </h2><p>  Job (in the people of John) was born in the 30s of the 16th century in a small family in the city of Staritsa.  Most of his youthful years passed in the Staritsky Assumption Monastery, where he received his education at the request of his father.  The boy showed good knowledge in the field of history and literature.  He was also respected by his peers because of his good heart and listening ability.  It was in this monastery that he tonsured monks and acquired the new name Job.  After some time, Job received the rank of archimandrite for perseverance and achievement. </p>
