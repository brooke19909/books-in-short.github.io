By the standards of Russia from Moscow, Kazan is located at a short distance, only 800 kilometers.  Although the citizens of many European countries, this distance seems very significant. </p><h2>  How to get to Kazan </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.7882198" data-lng="49.10006910000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="7"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/6/3/2/4/6324.png"></div><p>  When planning a trip to Kazan, it can be difficult to choose a comfortable mode of transport.

It is optimal to go along the M7 federal highway, from Moscow to the outskirts of Kazan, about 818 meters. </p><p>  The advantage of this type of movement is the ability to additionally explore the interesting places encountered along the road.  And there are a great many of these in our country. </p><p>  In addition, it is convenient to travel around Kazan by car.  Many visitors to the city note the perfect condition of roads in the city, good marking and intuitive road signs. </p><p>  Although some motorists warn that local drivers are very famously driving and are advised to be careful. </p><p>  When planning a trip to Kazan by car, it is better to choose a hotel with parking in advance, because Kazan is a dynamic and densely populated city, so it‚Äôs very difficult to attach a car on the street. </p><h2>  Unusual sights of Kazan </h2><div class="photo" data-original="wozap.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tatar State Puppet Theater &quot;Ekiyat&quot;" class="if uuid-2665617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2665617.jpg"></div><p>  Kazan is an ancient city in which the traditions of different peoples are bizarrely mixed.  An example of this is the unique Temple of all religions, located on the outskirts of the city.  In the future, the Center for Spiritual Unity will work here, and while the building is under construction.  It is worth not taking the time to see this unusual building, in the architecture of which there are elements of sixteen world religions.  There is definitely no second such thing! </p><p>  A truly fabulous castle looks like the Tatar Puppet Theater "Ekiyat", working in an old building built in 1934.  After the reconstruction, which took place over several years, it began to look like a real castle from children's fairy tales: snow-white towers, a figured facade, a hall with numerous columns.  And on the open terrace there is a statue of the Little Prince - a symbol of eternal childhood. </p><p>  One of the most beautiful places in Kazan - Lake Lebyazhye, is located right in the city.  This is a favorite place for outdoor recreation among residents and visitors of the city.  The lake is surrounded by centuries-old pine trees, its depth is relatively small, up to 4 meters.  Here you can relax with children.  And for the kids next to the lake, Polyana created fairy tales with characters from Russian and Tatar stories. </p><h2>  Wishful monuments </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tokzn.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Kot Kazan" class="if uuid-2665625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2665625.jpg"></div><p>  Local residents assure that if you support the falling tower of Queen Suyumbike for at least a few minutes, then success in business is guaranteed.  Historians still do not know the approximate date of construction of this tower, nor its purpose.  But it is definitely an unusual decoration of the Kazan Kremlin! </p><p>  And also in Kazan there are several unique monuments.  In the center of Bauman Street, on the bronze bench, the impudent Kazan Cat fell apart, bringing good luck to those who rubbed its thick tummy.  And nearby is an exact bronze copy of the carriage of Empress Catherine II.  If you sit down in a carriage and imagine a place where you really want to go, this trip will definitely happen. </p><h2>  Impressions from a visit to the city </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.avenutver.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple of all religions in Kazan" class="if uuid-2665621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2665621.jpg"></div><p>  In their many reviews, guests who visited the capital of Tatarstan admire the unique color and beauty of the city.  Here you can get acquainted with the history and monuments of architecture or have fun in the numerous parks of the city. </p><p>  The most enthusiastic reviews are about traveling to Kazan on your own, because you can visit more interesting places this way.  For greater comfort, you can issue a KazanCityPass guest card.  It gives you the right to free access to five museums of your choice, five trips by public transport and a city tour.  You can buy a card at the airport, at any of the railway stations or at the tourist information centers of Kazan. </p>
