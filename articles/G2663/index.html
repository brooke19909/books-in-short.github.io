Due to the fact that the world is so diverse, people have an incentive to travel, to discover new countries, cities and corners, to become part of another society and its culture.  The leisure industry is based on this.  Travel packages, <span>resorts, motels</span> and hotels - all this rests on the desire of people to relax from their everyday life, to see part of the world still unknown to them and to get new impressions.  When arranging a period of relaxation and rest, you should pay attention to the place of temporary stay, because uncomfortable beds, lack of hot water and tasteless food can overshadow all the positive emotions that hotels can cause.  <span>Wide Beam</span> offers a variety of options for rooms and services, and therefore everyone will be able to choose what he needs. </p><h2>  Hotel "Chernomor" </h2><p>  Hotels in the Wide Beam (Novorossiysk) open their doors to guests at any time of the year.
