This happened at the end of the 19th century thanks to the efforts of the famous Russian philanthropist Lev Golitsyn.  In 1894, the first wine cellar was laid in Massandra. </p><h2>  Untouched by time </h2><p>  <span>The Massandra</span> Wine <span>Factory</span> is a domestic enterprise that has not been affected by historical upheavals and even war.  The factory today looks like on the opening day. </p><p>  Crimean Massandra is a place with a unique microclimate.  It is warm and humid just as much as the vine needs.  And wine material needs low stable temperatures.  For this, a huge wine cellar was laid in the rocks.  The adits were cut down manually.  Today they amaze with their size: 150 m in length, and 5 m in height.  The work was carried out colossal: in the cellars for more than a century, even in the heat of about + 15Ãä C. </p>

    <p>  The end of the 19th century - the middle of the 20th - is the period of the formation of winemaking in the village of Massandra.  Today everyone can visit the tasting room.  Here are many photographs of the Crimea and Massandra's vineyards, and grape brushes can be seen on the walls.  This is a tribute to the hard work of planting the first vines brought from Europe. </p><h2>  Excursion programs </h2><p>  Several tourist routes have been developed around the Massandra factory.  Small excursion lasts 45-50 minutes.  Guests get acquainted with the exposition of the museum, then go to the middle cellar.  There they inspect the workshop in which <span>collection wines are</span> aged <span>.</span>  A large tour lasts almost an hour.  It begins as a Small Excursion, and ends with a visit to the Royal Cellar.  It shows guests the pride of Massandra - a gallery of collection wines. </p><p>  There are guided tours tailored to individual orders, ending with a mandatory tasting of nine types of vintage wines.  The sample offers the best samples from port and dry wines to nutmegs. </p><p>  In the production association "Massandra" the tasting room works according to a certain schedule.  VIP excursions take place only in the tasting complex and are agreed in advance. </p><p>  Tasting after the tour begins with "Saperavi".  This red dry wine is served on the aperitif.  Then the men are treated to "Sherry".  After four years of noble aging, he leaves in the language notes of red- <span>hot walnut</span> and grated almond.  The female half is served "Madera".  Due to the taste of vanilla sugar and dried fruits, this wine was once used as a perfume. </p>
