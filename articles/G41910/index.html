Nicholas II: biography, politics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nikolai 2 Alexandrovich (May 6, 1868 - July 17, 1918) - the last Russian emperor who ruled from 1894 to 1917, the eldest son of Alexander 3 and Maria Fedorovna, was an honorary member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences.  In the Soviet historiographic tradition, he was assigned the epithet "Bloody".  The life of Nicholas 2 and his reign are described in this article. </p><h2>  Briefly about the reign of Nicholas 2 </h2><p>  During the <span>reign of Nicholas 2</span> was an active economic development of.  With this sovereign, the country lost in the Russian-Japanese war of 1904-1905, which was one of the reasons for the revolutionary events of 1905-1907, in particular the adoption of the Manifesto on October 17, 1905, according to which the creation of various political parties was allowed, and also formed The State Duma.  According to the same manifesto <span>, Stolypin's</span> agrarian <span>reform began.</span>  In 1907, Russia became a member of the Entente and in its composition participated in the First World War.  In August 1915, Nicholas 2 Romanov became supreme commander.  During the <span>February Revolution</span> of March 2, 1917, the sovereign abdicated.  He and his whole family were shot.  The Russian Orthodox Church canonized them in 2000. </p><h2>  Childhood, youth </h2><div class="photo" data-author="" data-original=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-572980" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/572980.jpg?1562918652"></div><p>  When Nikolai Alexandrovich was 8 years old, his home education began.  The program included a general education course lasting eight years.  And then - a course of higher sciences lasting five years.  It was based on a classical gymnasium program.  But instead of Greek and Latin languages, the future king mastered botany, mineralogy, anatomy, zoology and physiology.  The courses of Russian literature, history and foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãwere extended.  In addition, the higher education program included the study of law, political economy and military affairs (strategy, jurisprudence, General Staff services, geography).  Nikolay 2 was also involved in fencing, vaulting, music, and painting.  Alexander 3 and his wife Maria Fedorovna themselves chose for the future tsar of mentors and teachers.  Among them were military and statesmen, scientists: N. Kh. Bunge, K. P. Pobedonostsev, N. N. Obruchev, M. I. Dragomirov, N. K. Girs, A. R. Drenteln. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Carier start </h2><p>  From childhood, the future Emperor Nicholas 2 was interested in military affairs: he perfectly knew the <span>military regulations</span> and traditions of the officer environment, the soldier did not shy, recognizing himself as their patron mentor, easily endured the inconveniences of army life at camp maneuvers and gatherings. </p><div class="photo" data-author="" data-original=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-572973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/572973.jpg?1562918652"></div><p>  Immediately after the birth of the future sovereign, they were recorded in several guards regiments and made commander of the 65th Moscow Infantry Regiment.  At the age of five, Nicholas 2 (reign dates 1894-1917) was appointed commander of the life guard of the Reserve Infantry Regiment, and a little later, in 1875, the Erivan Regiment.  The future sovereign received his first military rank (ensign) in December 1875, and in 1880 he was promoted to second lieutenant, and four years later - to be promoted to lieutenant. </p><p>  Nikolai 2 entered the active military service in 1884, and since July 1887 he served in the <span>Preobrazhensky regiment</span> and reached the rank of staff captain.  He becomes captain in 1891, and a year later - colonel. </p><h2>  The beginning of the reign </h2><p>  After a long illness, Alexander 3 died, and Nikolai 2 on the same day accepted the rule in Moscow, at the age of 26, on October 20, 1894. </p><div class="photo" data-author="" data-original=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-572958" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/572958.jpg?1562918652"></div><p>  During his ceremonial official coronation on May 18, 1896, dramatic events took place on the Khodynsky field.  Riots took place, thousands of people died and were injured in an elemental crush. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Khodynka field was not previously intended for festivities, since it was a training base for the troops, and therefore it was undeveloped.  There was a ravine right next to the field, and it itself was covered with numerous pits.  On the occasion of the celebration, pits and a ravine were covered with boards and covered with sand, and benches, booths, and stalls were set up around the perimeter to distribute free vodka and products.  When people, attracted by rumors about the distribution of money and gifts, rushed to the buildings, the floorings that covered the pits collapsed, and people fell, not having time to stand on their feet: a crowd was already running along them.  The police, swept away by the wave, could do nothing.  Only after reinforcements arrived did the crowd gradually disperse, leaving the bodies of mutilated and trampled people in the square. </p><h2>  The first years of the reign </h2><p>  In the first years of the reign of Nicholas 2, a general census of the country and monetary reform were conducted.  Russia during the reign of this monarch became an agrarian-industrial state: railways were built, cities grew, industrial enterprises arose.  The sovereign made decisions aimed at the social and economic modernization of Russia: the golden circulation of the ruble was introduced, several laws on insurance of workers, the agricultural reform of Stolypin was carried out, laws on religious tolerance and universal primary education were adopted. </p><h2>  Main events </h2><p>  The years of the reign of Nicholas 2 were marked by a sharp aggravation in the domestic political life of Russia, as well as by a difficult foreign political situation (the events of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, the Revolution of 1905-1907 in our country, the First World War, and the February Revolution in 1917) . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Russo-Japanese War, which began in 1904, although it did not cause much damage to the country, however, the sovereign's credibility was significantly shaken.  After numerous failures and losses in 1905, the Tsushima battle ended in the devastating defeat of the Russian fleet. </p><h2>  The revolution of 1905-1907 </h2><p>  January 9, 1905 the revolution began, this date is called Bloody Sunday.  Government forces shot down a workers ‚Äôdemonstration organized, as is commonly believed, by George <span>Gapon, priest of a</span> transit prison in St. Petersburg.  The shootings killed more than a thousand demonstrators who participated in a peaceful march to the Winter Palace in order to submit a petition to the sovereign about the needs of workers. </p><p>  After this uprising swept many other Russian cities.  Armed performances were in the navy and in the army.  So, on June 14, 1905, sailors took possession of the battleship "Potemkin", brought him to Odessa, where at that time there was a general strike.  However, the sailors did not dare to land on the shore to support the workers.  "Potemkin" went to Romania and surrendered to the authorities.  Numerous speeches forced the king to sign the Manifesto on October 17, 1905, which granted civil liberties to residents. </p><p>  Not being his reformer by nature, the king was forced to carry out reforms that did not correspond to his convictions.  He believed that in Russia the time had not yet come for freedom of speech, constitution, universal suffrage.  However, Nicholas 2 (whose photo is presented in the article) was forced to sign the Manifesto on October 17, 1905, as an active social movement for political transformation began. </p><div class="photo" data-author="" data-original=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-572956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/572956.jpg?1562918652"></div><h2>  Establishment of the State Duma </h2><p>  The imperial manifesto of 1906 established the State Duma.  For the first time in Russian history, the emperor began to rule in the presence of a representative elective body from the population.  That is, Russia is gradually becoming a constitutional monarchy.  However, despite these changes, during the reign of Nicholas 2, the emperor still had enormous power: he issued laws in the form of decrees, appointed ministers and a prime minister accountable only to him, was the head of the court, army and patron of the Church, and determined foreign policy course of our country. </p><p>  The first revolution of 1905-1907 showed the deep crisis that existed at that time in the Russian state. </p><h2>  Personality of Nicholas 2 </h2><p>  From the point of view of contemporaries, his personality, main character traits, advantages and disadvantages were very ambiguous and sometimes provoked conflicting assessments.  According to many of them, Nicholas 2 was characterized by such an important feature as weak-willed.  However, there is plenty of evidence that the sovereign stubbornly sought to implement his ideas and undertakings, sometimes reaching stubbornness (only once, when signing the Manifesto on October 17, 1905, he was forced to submit to someone else's will). </p><p>  In contrast to his father, Alexander 3, Nikolai 2 (see his photo below) did not create the impression of a strong personality.  However, according to people who were close acquaintances with him, he had exceptional composure, sometimes interpreted as indifference to the fate of people and the country (for example, with composure, affecting the sovereign‚Äôs surroundings, he met the news of the fall of Port Arthur and the defeat of the Russian army in World War I war). </p><div class="photo" data-author="" data-original=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-572970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/572970.jpg?1562918652"></div><p>  While engaging in state affairs, Tsar Nicholas 2 showed ‚Äúextraordinary perseverance‚Äù, as well as attentiveness and accuracy (for example, he never had a personal secretary, and he set all the seals on letters with his own hand).  Although in general the management of a huge power was still a ‚Äúheavy burden‚Äù for him.  According to contemporaries, Tsar Nicholas 2 had a tenacious memory, observation, in communication was an affable, modest and sensitive person.  At the same time, he cherished most of all his habits, peace, health, and especially the well-being of his own family. </p><h2>  Nicholas 2 and his family </h2><div class="photo" data-author="" data-original=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-572963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/572963.jpg?1562918652"></div><p>  The emperor was supported by his family.  Alexandra Fedorovna was not just a wife for him, but also an adviser, a friend.  Their wedding took place on November 14, 1894.  The interests, ideas and habits of the spouses often did not coincide, largely due to cultural differences, because the empress was a German princess.  However, this did not interfere with family consent.  The spouses had five children: Olga, Tatyana, Maria, Anastasia and Alexei. </p><p>  The drama of the royal family was caused by the ailment of Alexei, who suffered from hemophilia (blood clotting).  It was this disease that caused the appearance in the royal house of Grigory Rasputin, famous for the gift of healing and foresight.  He often helped Alexei cope with bouts of illness. </p><div class="photo" data-author="" data-original=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-572965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/572965.jpg?1562918652"></div><h2>  World War I </h2><p>  1914 was a turning point in the fate of Nicholas 2. It was at this time that the First World War began.  The sovereign did not want this war, trying to the very last moment to avoid the bloody massacre.  But on July 19 (August 1), 1914, Germany nevertheless decided to start a war with Russia. </p><p>  In August 1915, marked by a series of military setbacks, Nicholas 2, whose history was already approaching the finale, took on the role of commander in chief of the Russian army.  Previously, she was assigned to Prince Nikolai Nikolaevich (the Younger).  Since then, the sovereign only occasionally came to the capital, spending most of his time in Mogilev, at the headquarters of the Supreme Commander. </p><p>  The First World War intensified Russia's internal problems.  The main culprit of the defeats and the protracted campaign began to be considered the king and his entourage.  It was believed that the Russian government "breeds treason."  The military command of the country, led by the emperor, in early 1917 created a general offensive plan, according to which it was planned to end the confrontation by the summer of 1917. </p><h2>  The abdication of Nicholas 2 </h2><p>  However, at the end of February of the same year, unrest began in Petrograd, which, due to the lack of strong opposition from the authorities, grew a few days later into mass political protests against the Tsar‚Äôs dynasty and the government.  At first, Nicholas 2 planned with the help of force to achieve order in the capital, but, having understood the true scale of the protests, he abandoned this plan, fearing even more bloodshed that he might cause.  Some of the senior officials, politicians and members of the sovereign's retinue convinced him that to suppress the unrest, a change of government was necessary, and Nicholas 2 abdicated. </p><p>  After painful thoughts on March 2, 1917 in Pskov, while traveling on an imperial train, Nikolai 2 decided to sign the act of abdication, transferring the rule to his brother, Prince Mikhail Alexandrovich.  However, he refused to accept the crown.  The abdication of Nicholas 2, thus, signified the end of the dynasty. </p><h2>  The last months of life </h2><p>  Nicholas 2 and his family were arrested on March 9 of the same year.  First, for five months they were under guard in Tsarskoye Selo, and in August 1917 they were sent to Tobolsk.  Then, in April 1918, the Bolsheviks transported Nicholas and his family to Yekaterinburg.  Here, on the night of July 17, 1918, in the center of the city, in the basement <span>of Ipatiev‚Äôs house,</span> in which the prisoners were imprisoned, Emperor Nicholas 2, five of his children, his wife, as well as several czar‚Äôs close associates, including Botkin‚Äôs family doctor and servant, without any trial, they were shot.  A total of eleven people were killed. </p><p>  In 2000, by the decision of the Church, Nikolai 2 Romanov, as well as his entire family, were canonized, and an Orthodox church was erected on the site of Ipatiev‚Äôs house. </p>
