    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  As in many hotels in Turkey, in Alara kum hotel 5 * - "all inclusive".  In a relatively small area of ​​the hotel there are 2 restaurants and 4 bars. </p><p>  The main restaurant "Cleopatra" works according to the "buffet".

Reviews warn about monotonous, not always tasty food, the same thing is served for breakfast every day, salads and some cold table dishes are windy and stale, in the evening you have to take a table 20 minutes before dinner, otherwise you will need 20-25 minutes hold in line.  The most delicious dishes are prepared in the grill bar near the main restaurant, but there is only one roasting pan, so you need to wait 20-30 minutes until the order is prepared.  There are also many complaints of poorly washed dishes and stains on tablecloths and linen napkins.  Dietary and children's dishes are practically absent. </p><p>  Of the advantages - quick and polite waiters, a delicious grill menu (there are dishes of meat, fish and vegetables). </p>

    <h2>  Adult leisure </h2><p>  Adults will also find something to do.  In the morning, aqua aerobics is performed by the animators in the pool, and gymnastics with yoga elements is performed on the beach.  After lunch, you can go to fitness or play tennis (after sunset, at the request of guests, they include court lighting here for an additional fee).  In the afternoons, you can play table tennis or practice your darts accuracy.  There is also a sauna, which is open from 12 to 22 hours. </p><p>  On the beach you can play volleyball, a large area allows you to arrange real competitions between hotels. </p><p>  After dinner, the amphitheater hosts a disco with an evening show program: fakir performances, oriental dances, comedy shows, competitions and much more. </p><p>  Guests note that the animation in the hotel is unobtrusive, but there are complaints about its monotony and expressionlessness, as well as vulgarity of the gum show. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Turkey is not only a beach holiday.  Alara kum hotel 5 * has its own tour desk offering a large selection of trips.  The most popular are jeep tours, a trip to the white city - Pamukkale - and to the St. Nicholas Church (with a yacht trip over the sunken city), a marine park (a representation of fur seals and dolphins, a pool filled with water from the Red Sea and its inhabitants) and shopping tours where you can profitably buy Turkish textiles and leather items. </p><p>  There is an excursion bureau "Zahara" on the beach, the choice of trips is about the same as in the hotel, the prices are slightly lower.  If you take several excursions at once, then they make discounts. </p>

    <h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  Many tourists in their reviews leave small recommendations for those who are going to this hotel. </p><p>  Firstly, a warning to those who are going to travel with children under 3 years old - think in advance what the child will eat, since there is practically no dietary food in the restaurant.  Most of the dishes are too fat for such kids or are abundantly seasoned with spices. </p><p>  Secondly, take the number better in the main building, away from the disco, otherwise it will be difficult to fall asleep due to loud music. </p><p>  Thirdly, if you go to the hammam, then do not pay attention to the obsessive offers of employees to purchase any services for an additional payment: the quality of these services leaves much to be desired, and the amounts are called quite considerable for them. </p><p>  Fourthly, it is better to take sun loungers on the beach and near the pool early (before breakfast), so that later there will be no unpleasant surprises in the form of an unsuccessful place or a broken sunbed. </p><p>  Fifth, it’s better to take not two, but three vouchers with you, since the first will be picked up at the hotel, the second at Anex Tour, you can return <span>this voucher</span> only if you get an excursion from them, and this is more expensive than in other places. </p><p>  And finally.  Excursions are advised to take on the beach: prices are lower, excursions are longer.  The exception is a jeep ride (the cars are old, they often break down and the program of this excursion in the Anex Tour is more interesting and rich). </p><p>  Hotel Alara hotels kum 5 *, according to many tourists, does not correspond to the stars assigned to it.  The main advantage of this institution is its magnificent beach and close proximity to coniferous mountains.  But there are a lot of complaints about the rudeness of the staff, poor cleaning of the rooms and the monotonous menu.  If you are going to Turkey for a beach holiday and excursions, this hotel is perfect for these purposes, but if you plan a first-class vacation on the ultra all-inclusive system, then you should pay attention to other hotels. </p>
