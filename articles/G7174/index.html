Bibirevo metro station</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To the question about what is Bibirevo, “Metro and residential area of ​​the capital”, - the indigenous inhabitants of the main city of our country will answer.  And, of course, they will be right.  This is the name of the well-known traffic intersection and the whole massif, inhabited by more than one thousand people. </p><p>  However, is this knowledge too superficial?  Indeed, you must admit that “Bibirevo” on the metro map is noticeable almost immediately, and this automatically means the fact that it is really impossible to overestimate the importance and necessity of such a node. </p><p>  In this article, we will talk about this Moscow metro station.  Readers will learn in more detail not only about the metro station “Bibirevo”, but also about its history, characteristic features and design of the underground stop.  Do not forget that the ground infrastructure available at this place also deserves a share of attention. </p><h2>  Section 1. General description of the object </h2>

Today it is the 149th stop of the entire Moscow Metro and is located between the Altufevo and Otradnoye stations.

The rest had to be closed, either because of their accident rate, or because of unprofitability. </p><p>  In principle, it immediately becomes clear that “Bibirevo” is a metro that is named after the nearby eponymous district. </p><p>  Earlier, just a few years ago, it was the last stop.  Such a metro station "Bibirevo" was built initially, but after a while the line was extended.  Technically, this was not so difficult: a little further than its premises was the so-called exit or dead end, along which the wagons were turned back.  Here he had to, of course, be removed. </p><p>  Moscow has many different stations, both deep and very superficial.  The Bibirevo metro was laid at a shallow depth, a little less than ten meters. </p><h2>  Section 2. History of the station itself and its name </h2>

And later, the city administration was also forced to extend the existing line to the north.

If you think logically, then purely from a geographical point of view, this stop and Altufevo would need to be interchanged. </p><h2>  <strong>Section 3. Design Features</strong> </h2>

    <p>  In general, we can say with confidence that Bibirevo is a subway almost completely made of white marble.  True, partly, at the very bottom and a bit above, he was faced with a special look - Ufalean. </p><p>  The floor is gray, and in the center you can see squares of red granite. </p><p>  Many visitors note that the interior elements are very successfully combined, and the colors are incredibly harmonious with each other. </p><p>  But that is not all.  Once at the station, go a little deeper.  Here is another small attraction: in the turnstile hall there are various compositions of such famous artists as A. M. Ladur and D. A. Ladur. </p><h2>  Section 4. Specifications </h2>

Although the architects note the not-so-usual station bookmark.  The fact is that it is located at a depth of only ten meters.

    <p>  By the way, it should be noted that glass was not involved in the design of the ground lobby. </p><p>  For most of the day, the stop is quite deserted.  This is due to its location in the so-called <span>sleeping area of ​​the</span> city.  When are there passengers?  It is logical to assume that only in the morning and in the evening. </p><p>  In normal times, when locals do not go to work or return home, the wagons are mostly half empty. </p><p>  It is pleasant to note that the attendants are trying in every possible way to make life easier for their passengers: the wonderfully illuminated signs will help to get to the train without problems and difficulties, and each car is carefully numbered. </p><h2>  Section 5.

    <p>  The southern exit can lead travelers to such streets as Bibirevskaya, Prishvina and Pleshcheeva.  It is also associated with an escalator and platform. </p><p>  But through the ground lobby you can get to the station itself.  It is made in dark colors, the brown roof rests on small cylindrical columns decorated in black colors. </p><h2>  Section 6. Surface Attractions </h2><p>  Russia ... Moscow ... Bibirevo Metro ... Do you know that these three places are united in the best way possible?  The abundance of cultural monuments! </p><p>  As for the attractions of this part of the city, there are three of them here: </p><ul><li>  Cinema "Hour of Cinema".  In total, this establishment has four halls, two of which are equipped with 3D technologies.  540 people can enjoy a single session.  Visitors especially praise comfortable chairs that can take on body shapes, as well as new equipment that delivers incredible viewing pleasure.  All films are shown on a huge screen. </li><li>  Cinema "Mars".  Alas, the institution is closed today.  Honestly, it did not work very long.  Soon after the grand opening, it had to be closed due to unprofitability.  Now the owners use the building for their own purposes, but there is an assumption that it will eventually be rebuilt into a large entertainment complex. </li><li>  The historical museum called "Fatherland".  This exposition was built to store various items related to the history of the native land.  All visitors can familiarize themselves with each of them without any problems.  Most often, school-age children and students come here, who are usually called patriotic youth.  The history of this museum is quite interesting.  It all began, as often happens, with ordinary collecting.  The teacher of the local school No. 139 kept the exhibits in her office.  But gradually their number grew, and the place simply ceased to be enough.  It was then that it was decided to open a real museum, which later turned into a well-known local attraction. </li></ul><h2>  Section 7. Ground Infrastructure </h2>

    <p>  A university is located within a radius of 800 meters from the Bibirevo station.  In the evenings, young people can easily relax in one of the nightclubs. </p><p>  It offers lovers of an active lifestyle at once several sports clubs and gyms. </p><p>  No wonder housewives and senior citizens consider Bibirevo an ideal place to live.  There are lots of shops, boutiques, and markets, including spontaneous.  Shopping center, offering everything from food to furniture, works until late and almost seven days a week. </p><h2>  Section 8. Useful Information </h2><p>  Perhaps the most important thing that every traveler needs to know is the station’s opening hours.  Here they are agreed taking into account the wishes of local residents.  Subway lobby opens quite early, at 5:35.  However, you should pay attention to the fact that after one in the morning you can’t get here. </p><p>  Now for mobile operators.  Only three operators support good communication: these are MTS, Beeline and MegaFon.  You can make the necessary call or browse the Internet using your mobile phone with virtually no problems, unlike, for example, the stations located inside the Garden Ring of the capital.  All this happens not so much thanks to the installed amplification equipment, but because of the shallow laying of the station. </p><p>  The area, located near the metro station "Bibirevo", is famous for its excellent interchange for ground transportation.  Buses to different parts of the neighborhood depart almost around the clock. </p>
