How much does a primary school teacher get?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  More recently, a couple of years ago, the teaching profession was associated with school, classroom walls, a whiteboard on the entire wall of the office, and lessons for young students of lectures.  Now this is a much broader activity than you might imagine.  Teachers in our lives can find work everywhere.  These include the very teachers of school and gymnasium buildings, and lecturers with professors of technical schools, colleges, and also higher educational institutions.  In addition, there are now a huge number of courses, preparatory sections, advanced training centers, a huge number of Internet academies and training sites, and even the same fitness, yoga and dance instructors can consider themselves real teachers. </p><p>  In this article, we will analyze what specialties of this profession require what knowledge and qualities, and also consider how many teachers of various kinds receive in different cities of Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Teacher profession </h2><p>  Teachers are the people we face throughout our lives.  It seems that they were next to us only when we were sitting at a school desk, but this is not so.  We learn something all the time and quite often prefer to do it under the guidance of a true professional who, by virtue of his official obligations and experience, will provide us with information in an accessible and easy way. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Teachers have a rather difficult profession.  Still, after all, they have to work with people.  With many different people.  It is necessary to find an approach to each, the essence of the training material must be conveyed to each.  In addition, complex personalities happen in the life of teachers who not only do not want to understand the subject of their work, but also try to offend the teacher himself. </p><p>  Especially often, this behavior is observed among an audience aged 7 to 20 years.  That is just a school and colleges.  One should only be surprised at the endurance of our heroes of labor.  And how much a primary school teacher gets, for example, does not at all fit in with the titanic work that he does in his professional activities. </p>

    <h2>  Personal qualities of teachers </h2><p>  As already explained above, the teacher‚Äôs work is closely connected with society.  So, the main qualities of a teacher (of any orientation) are the ability to understand this very society, not pay attention to the stress factor, be prepared for a huge amount of communication.  A person in the role of a teacher must have a certain degree of charisma in order to be listened to.  Peacefulness and tranquility, the ability to control oneself are also important for such a specialty. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Teacher Education </h2><p>  Work in educational institutions involved in the education of children and adolescents requires <span>teacher education.</span>  Together with specialized subjects in pedagogical institutes, future teachers learn the subtleties of the psychology of children of this age.  Technical schools, colleges and higher educational institutions no longer require knowledge of pedagogy from their teachers, since there they are already dealing with almost adults or really adults.  The main thing here is perfect knowledge of one‚Äôs own subject, as well as understanding of one‚Äôs students.  That is, without psychology, the teacher really can not do anywhere. </p>

    <h2>  Workplaces for teachers and teachers </h2><p>  To begin with, a teacher can work both in a state institution (municipal schools, gymnasiums, lyceums, colleges and technical schools, universities under state accreditation), and in commercial institutions.  In the first case, the salary will be established by the relevant authority, in the second case - the director of the organization.  There is a third option.  The teacher can provide tutoring services at home or away.  How much teachers who carry out different working methods receive, we will consider below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  What determines the salary of teachers </h2><p>  In educational institutions of secondary general, secondary vocational and higher professional education there is a salary.  How much teachers get at school depends on the salary and the number of lessons they took above the norm.  They are respectively fixed and paid separately.  In commercial training centers, the situation is somewhat different.  How much teachers get depends on the number of students who paid for their lessons, the duration and number of classes, as well as the cost of a particular direction that they undertook to teach.  The work of tutors is not much different from this option in terms of salary.  How much tutors get also depends on all these parameters.  They only get their honestly earned money not from the employer, but from customers directly. </p>

    <h2>  Work in government </h2><p>  Work in state educational institutions has some advantages.  How much a teacher should receive depends not only on the size of the salary and the number of extracurricular activities, but also on various bonuses.  In addition, there are some guarantees that a commercial organization does not always offer.  For example, in commercial training centers, very often a large part of the salary goes under the heading ‚Äúblack‚Äù.  That is, there are very few funds for retirement and social security contributions, which will certainly make itself felt during the period of sick leave, holidays, maternity payments or retirement.  State structures are obliged to pay salaries officially. </p>

    <h2>  Commercial structures </h2><p>  Commercial structures are also good in some ways.  The salary there is usually several times higher.

The higher the <span>demand for services,</span> the more his teachers earn.  And thanks to this very ‚Äúblack‚Äù salary, the tax on personal income is deducted much less than for people who receive only a <span>‚Äúwhite‚Äù salary.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Premiums and Prizes for Teachers </h2><p>  Currently, there are three types of supplementary payments for teachers of state educational institutions: remuneration, allowances, bonuses.  Payment is made in two ways.  In the first, the director himself decides what interest rates and during what period incentive payments should be made; in the second, the payment is a one-time payment. </p><p>  So, why pay extra to teachers?  All of these payments are regulated by the Ministry of Education.  Among them, encouragement for attracting new teachers and young specialists to the educational institution, assessing students in the Unified State Examination, preparing students for various contests, testing, contests, attracting parental assistance to the school, increasing academic performance, implementing pre-profile training and additional classes, creating their own methods, extra-curricular activities with gifted children, as well as advanced training of the teacher himself. </p><h2>  Salaries of teachers in different cities </h2><p>  How much does a primary school teacher get?  In most cases, the vacancy is marked "By arrangement."  This means that the salary will depend on the competence and length of service of the applicant.  Accordingly, the better the specialist, the higher his salary will be.  In <span>St. Petersburg, a primary school teacher</span> will receive at least 20 thousand rubles.  Basically, the cost of labor of a teacher in this city fluctuates between 35 and 50 thousand. </p><p>  How much teachers in Moscow receive is another question.  Everyone knows that in the capital, salaries are much higher than in other regions.  In Moscow, this figure starts at 60 thousand rubles.  There are marks in seventy and eighty thousand.  For a public school teacher, this is a good <span>salary.</span>  In commercial institutions, the mark reaches one hundred thousand. </p><p>  In Volgograd, the amount of contentment of a primary school teacher is simply ridiculous compared to Moscow and St. Petersburg.  There, the teacher will receive from 11 to 20 thousand.  The average amount is 15 thousand rubles.  In Rostov-on-Don, <span>wages are</span> slightly higher, but still very far from the desired.  In this city, it is from 15 to 25 thousand on average. </p><p>  How much does a physical education teacher get in different cities?  In Moscow, this amount is an average of 50 thousand rubles.  In St. Petersburg, the same specialist will receive from 20 thousand rubles.  In Crimea, a physical education teacher will receive from 20 to 35 thousand rubles.  In Rostov-on-Don, the same specialty is estimated at 20 thousand. </p><p>  How much do math teachers get?  In Moscow, this specialist will work for a salary of fifty thousand rubles.  In St. Petersburg, his work will be estimated at around 35 thousand.  In Volgograd, again, the salary is ridiculous - from 10 to 15 thousand.  In Rostov-on-Don, again a figure in the region of 20 thousand rubles. </p><p>  From all this we can conclude that decent salaries in government agencies at teachers only in Moscow.  In other cities, teachers have to work a lot overtime and sometimes in several positions at once. </p>
