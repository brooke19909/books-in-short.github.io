The city's attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is unlikely that any other ancient city can boast of such an exact date of the first mention in the annals as Pinsk, the sights of which we will consider in the article.  An old parchment dated November 5, 1097, mentions a city founded by the Slavic tribe Dregovichi.  Pinsk's extremely rich history is reflected in many attractions. </p><h2>  Temples </h2><p>  What is worth seeing to someone who came to Pinsk.  Attractions, of course.  As in many <span>cities of Belarus,</span> in Pinsk there are churches of various faiths.  At the same time, the buildings themselves over the course of many centuries of history have been visited by parishioners of various faiths.  An example of this is the St. Barbara Cathedral.  Founded at the very beginning of the sixteenth century, when the city belonged to the Polish king.  Many buildings were wooden.  But by the end of the sixteenth century, the shrine was transferred to the Uniates, then the Orthodox monks left the monastery.  In the thirties of the nineteenth century, the church again returned to Orthodox parishioners. </p>

    <p>  The greatest values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are stored in the monastery are the relics of <span>St. Barbara</span> and her icon.  Fifty years later, the inhabitants of the temple were relocated to the Transfiguration Monastery, located in Minsk.  The building itself was converted into a city hospital.  In the very first year of Belarus‚Äôs independence, the monastery was again given to believers and a Sunday school was opened in it.  The change of denominations affected the architecture of the temple.  Now it is a beautiful and modest white building. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another Orthodox shrine is St. Fedorovsky Cathedral.  This modern building, built about fifteen years ago, is made in a retrospective Russian style. </p><h2>  Jesuit College </h2><p>  A very beautiful, well-groomed architectural ensemble is the Jesuit College.  This is the building that deserves the attention of a tourist who came to Pinsk.  Photos here can be made incredibly beautiful.  A Jesuit collegium was built in the middle of the seventeenth century.  It is a small but very well fortified fortress.  The Jesuits built their temple complex in such a way that they could withstand the most serious siege. </p>

    <p>  The walls have a thickness of about two meters, the depth of the foundation is five meters, there are many underground passages, the cellars perfectly served to store provisions.  The white building itself (a little peach hue, with dark red roofs) is made in the Renaissance and Baroque style.  The amazing beauty of the building cannot be described in words, you can endlessly admire it.  Since the sixties of the last century, the building has housed a magnificent art gallery.  Now there is a museum of the Belarusian Polesye, the exhibits are not inferior in beauty and antiquity to the building itself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Epiphany Fraternal Monastery </h2><p>  What is worth seeing for those who visited Pinsk?  Attractions worthy of the attention of tourists.  Especially worth noting is the Epiphany Fraternal Monastery, built at the end of the sixteenth century.  Since its foundation, the temple has been <span>an apple of contention</span> between the Orthodox, Catholic and Uniate religions.  Representatives of each denomination argue that it was founded by supporters of their faith.  The debate has not subsided to this day. </p><h2>  Pinsk.  sights </h2><p>  Of the Catholic shrines in Pinsk, you definitely need to visit the Franciscan church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary.  The architecture of the building is very rich in a variety of decorations.  But the interior is striking in its grandeur, especially pulpit.  And also here are unique murals by outstanding masters of the past. </p><p>  One of the greatest architectural monuments is the Butrimovich Palace.  A magnificent building in the style of classicism and baroque.  When laying its foundation, in 1784, the King of Poland Stanislav August Poniatowski was present.  It was built by a prominent public and political figure, who did a lot to improve Polesie, the nobleman Mateusz Butrimovich.  Subsequently, the palace passed into the ownership of the most noble and respected families of the region.  In Soviet times, the building housed the Palace of Pioneers.  Since independence, the Wedding Palace has been opened here.  Wedding ceremonies look especially magnificent and impressive against the background of old interiors. </p><h2>  Memorial estate of Tadeusz Kosciuszko </h2><p>  Not far from Pinsk there is a museum-estate Kosciuszko.  This is the leader of the national liberation movement in Poland, one of the most famous fighters for the independence of the United States of America. </p>

    <p>  Kociuszko is a national hero of the USA, Poland, Belarus, Lithuania and France, one of the most advanced people of his time.  The estate is an ordinary and nondescript wooden one-story house with a <span>beautiful porch</span> in the form of a portico.
