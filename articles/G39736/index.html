This is what they told us in childhood, and that is what even the <span>customers of banks</span> tell us about <span>.</span>  And, to be honest, many financial organizations have a reputation for 50% of the rumors and opinions of users.  However, there is one thing.  It is one thing when there is a positive rumor about the company that you don‚Äôt even want to refute, and it‚Äôs completely different if far from flattering things are said about the bank.  In our opinion, Rosenergobank became the victim of such statements.  Revocation of a license is one of the main topics that is discussed daily at various financial forums and social networks.  But will she be recalled?  Or will the bank, as in the recent 2008, manage to get out of the water dry? </p>

    <h2>  General information about the current bank </h2><p>  So, the topic of numerous discussions was <em> </em>  notorious "Rosenergobank".  This organization, like any other financial institution, had problems from time to time.  But, despite this, he is afloat today.  This is one of the largest financial institutions in Russia, working in the field of lending and servicing accounts of representatives of small and medium-sized businesses. </p><h2>  Clients of a financial institution: who are they? </h2><p>  Clients of the organization at the moment are several large commercial structures, including those working in the fuel and energy sector.  The main source of financing the bank today is the deposits of the population.  Moreover, a commercial institute actively participates in tenders in the market of conversion operations and securities.  By the way, the regulator recently extended several licenses related to the market trading of a financial organization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What are the reasons for panic in the public? </h2><p>  The most common cause of panic is fear from one or more clients of a credit institution.  Their fear is usually associated with certain problems that they managed to face.  For example, imagine a situation where Rosenergobank does not make payments.  More precisely, such a nuisance happened with the accounts of several people who panicked and began to spread their fears along the chain.  And then other users, who begin to share their thoughts with other residents of the Russian Federation, pick up the malicious virus ‚Äúbank fear‚Äù. </p><p>  Actually, such a situation has recently happened with Rosenergobank.  As a result of the rising panic, distrust of the bank increased, rumors spread that he would soon lose his license.  But is there any reason for concern? </p>

    <h2>  A brief digression into the past </h2><p>  Given the fact that the regulator ruthlessly cuts heads left and right, depriving banks of licenses in bulk, the possibility of a possible bankruptcy cannot be completely ruled out.  However, it is worth recalling the difficult situation faced by Rosenergobank (Russia) <em> </em>  in not so distant 2008.  At that time, this financial institution did suffer certain losses and was on the verge of losing its license.  Outraged users immediately started complaining about the freezing of payments and the lack of reaction from the bank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But even this influx of panic, representatives of the financial institution managed to repay.  The ideal option at that time for a commercial organization was the use of a bill of exchange scheme.  Its essence was as follows: the bank's customers were offered to replace the unfulfilled obligations of the organization with special bills.  In particular, Rosenergobank (the license was revoked in this case, but managed to avoid it) offered the majority of its customers to purchase 90% of the hanging amount of bills and take 10% in cash. </p><p>  According to lawyers, this approach made it possible to completely eliminate the file of delinquent payers (it is here that non-executors of client orders, including tax obligations, usually fit in).  And the absence of such a card file, in turn, deprived the regulator of a formal basis for using an extreme measure in the form of revoking a license. </p>

    <h2>  What is the whole fuss because of? </h2><p>  Currently, reviews of Rosenergobank (user opinions) are associated with new concerns about its financial instability.  There are several reasons for this: </p><ul><li>  artificial panic organized by competing banks; </li><li>  panic in the network created by users themselves; </li><li>  hype in the press; </li><li>  opinions of analysts; </li><li>  visible discrepancies in the publicly available financial statements. </li></ul><p>  Among the main causes of panic can be called the presence of real gaps in reporting, open to users. </p><p>  According to analysts, the only way to avoid lowering the rating of a credit institution is to not show reports that could cause a negative reaction from customers.  Apparently, Rosenergobank itself adheres to the same opinion (reviews on the bank in this case confirm this theory), since it posted its statements for the last time in August this year.  Therefore, data for September and the next two months are not available on the regulator‚Äôs website. </p>

    <p>  Taking into account the concealment of financial statements, many users, including financial experts and critics, made conclusions about the instability of the bank.  But is there reason to panic? </p><h2>  Rosenergobank, license revocation: what do the experts say? </h2><p>  According to experts, it‚Äôs not worth panicking, but it‚Äôs worth considering the current situation.  For example, many answers to questions regarding the financial situation of a financial organization can be found on its official website, rosenergobank.ru. </p><p>  It was on it that the representatives of the bank very accurately describe the essence of the real state of affairs.  So, you can compare the amount of equity of the organization, published in early October and September.  In the first case, it amounted to 8.9 billion rubles, and in the second - 10.6 billion.  From this we can conclude that in just a month there was a reduction in the amount of capital by as much as 16%.  And this only means that the joint-stock company experienced a sharp increase in losses. </p><p>  Further, the regulator himself in early October reports his fears about reducing the permissible value of the bank‚Äôs personal capital.  According to this information, this value goes into minus, and then decreases to 5.125% and below.  As a result, a financial institution has problems with subordinated debt. </p>

    <p>  However, they managed to cope with them when the shareholders decided to convert the debt into shares of the bank.  It was due to this that the restoration of the standard of capital adequacy took place.  In other words, no matter what financial problems Rosenergobank experiences, license revocation <em> </em>  he has not yet been threatened.  Although it is not worth excluding the influence of other factors independent of the representatives of a financial institution. </p><p>  In a word, withholding information provides a new occasion for speculation and speculation.  And most importantly, it negatively affects the reputation of a financial organization. </p>

    <h2>  What do users think? </h2><p>  Clients of a credit institution often describe problems with cash withdrawals, talk about ‚Äúhung‚Äù payments and predict the bankruptcy of the organization soon.  Others, on the contrary, speak of new advantages of cooperation with the bank.  For example, one of such innovations is considered a promotion for UnionPay International cardholders.  According to its terms, when paying with a card for a variety of goods and services abroad, Rosenergobank customers will be able to receive up to 30% discounts. </p>

    <h2>  What are the employees talking about? </h2><p>  Often, the financial instability of a credit institution is said by the employees themselves.  This is also evidenced by the huge staff turnover.  In order to understand this, you do not need to be an expert or analyst.  It is enough to enter Rosenergobank.  Employee Reviews <em> </em>  about the organization will also play an important role.  But first, you need to look around.  According to customers, the situation in any of the departments is quite mundane.  The service is stable and there is no sign of panic.  The organization‚Äôs employees themselves say that they don‚Äôt plan to leave anywhere.  They like the team, leadership and working principle. </p><p>  In a word, the site is working, employees are not running, money operations are being performed.  This means that instability, and even more so about the revocation of the license, is out of the question. </p>
