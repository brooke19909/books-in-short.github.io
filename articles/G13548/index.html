The USSR is a once powerful superpower that at one time made a considerable contribution to the development of society.  One of the cornerstones of the life of Soviet citizens was the five-year plan.  Based on their results, historians can judge the industrialization of the country, compare the achievements of the past and the present, find out how far our generation has technologically gone and what else to strive for.  So, the topic of this article is the five-year plan in the USSR.  The table below will help you structure your knowledge in a logical order. </p><h2>  The First Five-Year Plan (1928‚Äì1932) </h2><p>  So, the <span>first five-year plan</span> began in the name of building socialism.  After the revolution, the country needed industrialization in order to keep pace with the leading European powers.  Moreover, only with the help of accelerated building up of industrial potential was it possible to unite the country and bring the USSR to a new military level, as well as increase the level of agriculture throughout the vast territory.  According to the government, a strict and impeccable plan was needed. </p><p>  Thus, the main goal was to build up military power as quickly as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="five-year plan in the ussr table" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41281/1254098.jpg" width="351"></div>

Of course, there were people who expressed an ardent protest, but the opinion of the majority he was suppressed.  Stalin himself became interested in leading the country into the leaders in the first five-year period, placing him first in the production of metallurgy.  So, the process of industrialization had to go through 4 stages: </p><ol><li>  The revival of transport infrastructure. </li><li>  Expansion of industries related to the extraction of materials and agriculture. </li><li>  Redistribution of state-owned enterprises across the territory. </li><li>  Changing the work of the energy complex. </li></ol><p>  All four processes did not take place alternately, but intricately intertwined.  Thus began the first five-year period of the country's industrialization. </p><p>  It was not possible to realize all the ideas, however, the production of heavy industry grew almost 3 times, and machine building - 20 times.  Naturally, such a successful completion of the project caused the quite natural joy of the government.  Of course, the first five-year plans in the USSR were hard for people.  A table with the results of the first of them would contain the following words as a slogan or subtitle: "The main thing is to start!" </p><p>  It was at this time that a lot of draft posters appeared reflecting the main goal and originality of the Soviet people. </p><p>  The main construction sites at that time were coal mines in the Donbass and Kuzbass, Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works.  Thanks to this, it was possible to achieve financial independence of the USSR.  The most prominent construction is DneproGES.  The year 1932 was marked by the end of not only the first five-year plan, but also the most important construction industry for the heavy industry. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The new power is strengthening its status in Europe by leaps and bounds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="1 five-year plan" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41281/1254082.jpg" width="381"></div>

    <h2>  Five Year Plan Number Two (1933-1937) </h2><p>  The second five-year plan in high circles was called the "five-year plan of collectivization" or "public education."  It was approved by the VII Congress of the CPSU (b).  After heavy industry, the country needed to develop the national economy.  It was this sphere that became the main goal of the second five-year plan. </p><h2>  The main directions of the second five-year plan </h2><p>  The main forces and finances of the government at the beginning of the "five-year period of collectivization" were directed to the construction of metallurgical plants.  The Ural-Kuzbass appeared, launched the first current of DneproGES.  The country did not lag behind in scientific achievements.  So, the second five-year plan was marked by the first landing at the North Pole of the Papanin expedition; the polar station SP-1 appeared.  Actively built subway. </p><p>  At this time, great emphasis was placed on <span>socialist competitions</span> among workers.  The most famous drummer of the five-year plan is Aleksey Stakhanov.  In 1935, he set a new record by fulfilling the norm of 14 shifts per shift. </p><h2>  The Third Five-Year Plan (1938-1942) </h2><p>  The beginning of the third five-year period was marked by the slogan: "Catch up and overtake production per capita of developed <span>capitalist countries!"</span>  The main efforts of the government were aimed at improving the country's defense capability, as well as in the first five-year plan, which caused the production of consumer goods to suffer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Directions of the Third Five-Year Plan </h2><p>  By the beginning of 1941, almost half (43%) of the country's investment was aimed at raising the level of heavy industry.  In anticipation of the war in the USSR, in the Urals and in Siberia, fuel and energy bases developed rapidly.  It was necessary for the government to create a ‚Äúsecond Baku‚Äù - a new oil production area, which was supposed to appear between the Volga and the Urals. </p><p>  Particular attention was paid to tank, aircraft and other plants of this kind.  The production of ammunition and artillery increased significantly.  However, the armament of the USSR was still lagging behind the western, in particular from the German, but they were not in a hurry with the release of new weapons even in the first months of the war. </p><h2>  The Fourth Five-Year Plan (1946-1950) </h2><p>  After the war, all countries had to revive their production and economy, the USSR was able to do this almost completely in the late 40s, when the fourth term began.  The five-year plan did not imply the buildup of military power, as before, but the revival of society lost in all areas of life during the war. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4 five-year plan" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41281/1254069.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Key achievements of the Fourth Five-Year Plan </h2><p>  Just two years later, the same level of industrial production was achieved as in the pre-war period, even though the plans of the second and third five-year plans put forward harsh working standards.  In 1950, the main production assets returned to the level of 1940.  When the four five-year period ended, industry grew by 41%, and construction of buildings - by 141%. </p><p>  The new DneproGES again came into operation, all the mines of Donbass were restored.  On this note, four five-year plans ended. </p><h2>  The Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) </h2><p>  During the fifth five-year plan, atomic weapons became widespread, the <span>world's first nuclear power plant</span> in Obninsk appeared, and at the beginning of 1953, N. S. Khrushchev took the post of head of state instead of I. V. Stalin. </p><h2>  Key achievements of the fifth five-year period </h2><p>  Since capital investments in industry doubled, the volume of output also increased (by 71%), and in agriculture - by 25%.  Soon new metallurgical plants were built - Caucasian and Cherepovets.  The Tsimlyansk and Gorky hydroelectric power stations, in whole or in part, appeared on the front page.  And at the end of the fifth five-year plan, science heard about atomic and hydrogen bombs. </p><p>  Finally, the first <span>Volga-Don Canal</span> and the Omsk Oil Refinery were built, and the pace of coal production increased significantly.  And 12.5 million hectares of new land entered into circulation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="five years" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41281/1254092.jpg" width="329"></div>

    <h2>  Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) </h2><p>  More than 2,500 major enterprises came into operation when the sixth five-year plan began.  At the end of it, in 1959, a parallel seven-year plan began.  The country's national income increased by 50%.  Investment at this time doubled again, which led to the widespread development of light industry. </p><h2>  The main achievements of the sixth five-year plan </h2><p>  Gross industrial and agricultural output grew by more than 60%.  The Gorky, Volzhskaya, Kuibyshev and <span>Irkutsk hydroelectric</span> stations were completed <span>.</span>  By the end of the five-year plan, the world's largest worsted plant in Ivanovo was rebuilt.  In Kazakhstan, the active development of virgin land has begun.  The USSR finally got a nuclear missile shield. </p><p>  The first satellite in the world was launched on October 4, 1957.  Incredible efforts developed heavy industry.  However, there were more failures, so the government organized a seven-year plan, which includes the seventh five-year plan and the last two years the sixth. </p><h2>  Seventh Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) </h2><p>  As you know, in April 1961, the first man in the world flew into space.  This event marked the beginning of the seventh five-year period.  The country's national income continues to grow rapidly and over the next five years increases by almost 60%.  The level of gross industrial production increased by 83%, agriculture - by 15%. </p><p>  By mid-1965, the USSR had taken a leading position in the extraction of coal and iron ore, as well as in the production of cement, and this is not surprising.  The country was still actively developing heavy industry and the construction industry, cities were growing before our eyes, and strong buildings needed cement. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="five-year drummer" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41281/1254103.jpg" width="346"></div>

    <h2>  The Eighth Five-Year Plan (1966-1970) </h2><p>  The five-year plan did not imply the production of materials, but the construction of new buildings and factories.  Cities continue to expand.  On the post of head of state takes L. I. Brezhnev.  During these five years, there are many metro stations, the West Siberian and Karaganda metallurgical plants, the first automobile plant VAZ (production: 600 thousand cars a year), Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Power Station - the largest station in the world at that time. </p><p>  Active housing construction solved the problem of deprivation (the echo of the war was still responding in big cities).  At the end of 1969, more than 5 million residents received new apartments.  After the flight of Yu. A. Gagarin into space, astronomy made a great leap forward, the first lunar rover was created, soil was brought from the moon, and the machines reached the surface of Venus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="five-year construction sites" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41281/1254089.jpg" width="356"></div>

    <h2>  Ninth Five-Year Plan (1971-1975) </h2><p>  During the ninth five-year plan, more than a thousand industrial enterprises were built, the gross industrial output grew by 45%, and the rural - by 15%.  Automotive industry is actively developing, cars and railways are being repaired.  Capital investments exceeded 300 billion rubles a year. </p><p>  The development of oil and gas wells in Western Siberia led to the construction of many enterprises, the laying of oil pipelines.  Since the level of the employed population increased with the advent of a large number of factories, the ‚ÄúDrummer of the Ninth Five-Year Plan‚Äù sign was established (for the difference in labor and production). </p><h2>  The Tenth Five-Year Plan (1976-1980) </h2><p>  Active increase in national income and industrial output is beginning to decline.  Now the country does not need a huge growth of enterprises, but the stable development of all areas of industry is always necessary. </p><p>  Oil production came to the fore, so in five years many oil pipelines were built, stretching across Western Siberia, where hundreds of stations have deployed their work.  Significantly increased the number of working equipment: tractors, combines, trucks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="five-year results" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41281/1254119.jpg" width="449"></div>

    <h2>  Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981-1985) </h2><p>  An extremely turbulent time began for the USSR.  Everyone in the government felt the crisis, for which there were many reasons: internal, external, political and economic.  At one time, it was possible to change the structure of power without abandoning socialism, but none of this was produced.  Due to the crisis, people holding the dominant posts of the state were replaced very quickly.  So, L. I. Brezhnev remained secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU until 11/10/1982, Yu. V. Andropov held this position until 02/13/1984, K. U. Chernenko - until 10/03/1985. </p><p>  Gas transportation from Western Siberia to Western Europe continues to develop.  The 4,500 km-long Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhhorod oil pipeline crossing the Ural Range and hundreds of rivers was built. </p>

    <h2>  Twelfth Five-Year Plan (1986-1990) </h2><p>  The last five-year plan for the USSR.  During its time, it was planned to implement a long-term economic strategy, but the plans were not destined to come true.  At this time, many received the sign of the drummer of the twelfth five-year plan: collective farmers, workers, specialists of enterprises, engineers ...

Yes, not everything was done.  The sixth five-year plan had to be "extended" due to the seven-year plan. </p><p>  Although the five-year plans were difficult in the USSR (the table is a direct confirmation of this), the Soviet people steadily coped with all the norms and even exceeded plans.  The main slogan of all five-year plans was: ‚ÄúFive-year plan in four years!‚Äù </p>
