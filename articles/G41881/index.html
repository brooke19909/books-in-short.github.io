An ancient state with an interesting history and distinctive culture boasts interesting sights, but Pakistan is not the most popular destination for foreign travelers. </p><p>  This is due to the security problems of the guests of the Muslim country fighting the Islamic Taliban movement, but those who dared to visit the land of once prosperous civilizations in the Indus Valley are enthusiastic about the amazing adventure. </p><h2>  The economic center of the state </h2><p>  The metropolis, which will be discussed today, is one of the largest cities in the world, and several years ago there were more than 13 million inhabitants.  Beautiful Karachi is the largest city in Pakistan, where the country's largest enterprises and corporations are located.  This is the commercial and economic center of the state, which until 1958 was its capital. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Karachi Pakistan" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1520449.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  The country's climate, formed under the influence of monsoons, is characterized by sweltering heat and high humidity in the summer.  The best time to visit the city is traditionally considered winter (from late November to February), when the average temperature is at around 16–20 degrees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Picturesque place </h2><p>  Architectural monuments located in the territory of Karachi (Pakistan) will introduce you to the amazing history of the largest port city, spread on the coast of the Arabian Sea.  Its sights cannot be called ancient, but they are of great interest to tourists.  The picturesque corner, where several religions are in contact at the same time, evokes a sense of admiration, and luxurious mosques and magnificent temples capture the spirit of everyone who gets acquainted with exotic Karachi. </p><p>  Pakistan, which borders Afghanistan and is in a state of secret war with it, accepts refugees from other countries.  If we talk about the metropolis, then the largest ethnic group are the Muhajirs (immigrants), and due to such a diversity of nationalities, the city does not have an official language.  Residents speak Urdu, Sindhi, Punjabi, but almost everyone understands English, so tourists will not have communication problems. </p><h2>  Important sea gate </h2><p>  The modern port of Karachi (Pakistan) is the country's main naval base, receiving up to 30 ships daily.  The sea gates of the state are equipped with special equipment for loading and unloading ships of any class.  One of the largest ports in the Indian Ocean provides export of goods. </p><h2>  Metropolitan Markets </h2><p>  Locals call Karachi (Pakistan) “the city of lights” because life is in full swing here day and night.  The busiest corners are the local markets, which are more like a huge cave of Aladdin, filled with various treasures.  Here you can buy everything that only your heart desires, from fruit to household tools. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Karachi is the largest city of Pakistan" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1520450.jpg" width="600"></div>

In addition to the rows in the open air there are pavilions in which there are 200 shops.  The Zeynab Market is famous for a large selection of souvenirs, and tourists go to the Bohri Bazaar for handmade jewelry. </p><h2>  Tombs of the Chowkondi </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of Karachi (Pakistan) is the ancient burial of the XV-XVIII centuries.  Unusual sandstone graves are distinguished by exquisite stone carvings and consist of six plates that completely cover the sarcophagus.  The tombs of Chaukhandi are decorated with both abstract patterns and images of hunting scenes, galloping horsemen, weapons.  Near the necropolis are stone arbors where various rites were held. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="port karachi pakistan" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1520418.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Necropolis "Maclee Hill" </h2><p>  Karachi has <span>the largest necropolis in the world with a</span> length of about eight kilometers.  The tombs where the rulers of the country are buried differ in their architecture, as they appeared at different periods of time.  The mausoleums of the royal dynasty will amaze even experienced tourists: two-story brick buildings are decorated with domes and balconies. </p><h2>  What else to see in the city? </h2><p>  The unique monument “Three Swords”, symbolizing the teachings of the Muslim politician Muhammad Jinn, glorified the original city in Pakistan for the whole world. </p><p>  Karachi is the place where the founder of national statehood is buried.  The mausoleum of Djinn, made of white marble, with entrances in the form of Moorish arches is a symbol of the metropolis, and thousands of residents come to the monument every day to pay tribute to the great politician. </p><p>  The gothic temple of the Roman Catholic Church is one of Pakistan's oldest religious buildings.  St. Patrick's Cathedral with a spacious terrace, a picturesque courtyard garden, a complex of 15 fountains attracts the attention of curious tourists who admire the amazing creation. </p><p>  The elegant Mohatta Palace, built on the orders of a well-known businessman, delights with its unique appearance and luxurious decoration.  And the main feature of the architectural masterpiece is the tunnels built for the safe passage of the wealthy family. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ​​in pakistan" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1520428.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A relatively young city, which grew out of a small settlement, delights foreign travelers with special color and stunning sights.  Guests are only concerned about the difficult security situation, since Pakistan is a country with a high degree of risk for tourists. </p>
