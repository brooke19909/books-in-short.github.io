    <h2>  Device niche </h2><p>  As noted earlier, the ThL 4000 is an entry-level device.  Accordingly, you should not expect a high level of performance from it.  But here it is perfect for solving ordinary everyday tasks.  This is reading books, and browsing Internet resources, and listening to music, and playing video files.  Even simple entry-level games on it will go without problems.  That is, this device is for every day with a basic set of functions.  If you need just such a gadget, then you can take a closer look at this particular smartphone model. </p><h2>  Gadget kit </h2><p>  Of course, the strength of this device is a fairly rich configuration.  In addition to the mobile device itself, it includes a wired stereo headset, a charger, an interface cord, and a 4000mAh battery.  The list of complete documentation is presented with a <span>warranty card</span> and user manual.  Also in the boxed version of this smartphone there is an additional protective film and a silicone case - a bumper.  Cases for ThL 4000 to purchase today is not difficult, but much nicer if it is included in the package.  The only thing that is missing in the configuration of this mobile device is an external flash card.  In principle, for some time, the newly made owner of this gadget will be able to do without it, but still it is better to immediately increase the memory subsystem and then forget about the numerous problems associated with its shortage for a long time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Smartphone design </h2><p>  ThL 4000 is a smartphone made in the form of a candy bar with touch input support.  On the front panel of the device is a 4.7-inch display.  Below, a standard three-button panel for controlling a smartphone is displayed.  Above the screen, a speaker, a <span>front camera</span> and sensors are displayed.  On the top edge of the gadget are all wired interface ports.  This is a 3.5 mm audio port for connecting wired external speakers, and micro-USB, which allows the device to synchronize with a stationary PC or laptop.  It also charges the battery.  On the right side there are mechanical buttons for volume control and phone lock.  On the left edge of the device there are no communication and control elements.  On the back cover of the smartphone there is a loud speaker and a main camera with backlight.  The manufacturer‚Äôs logo is also located here. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  A reliable and energy-efficient processor is used in the ThL 4000 - MTK6582 from Mediatek.  This is a 4-core chip.  Each of its modules is based on an architecture codenamed ‚ÄúCortex-A7‚Äù.  In the highest load mode, each core can operate at a frequency of 1.3 GHz.  This semiconductor crystal is manufactured according to the standards of 28 nm process technology.  All this indicates a high level of energy efficiency of this processor solution.  But the lack of performance is compensated by the presence of 4 computing modules. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But here it is important to make one significant reservation.  In order to maximize the use of this chip, the software running on this gadget has been optimized for multi-threaded processors.  Two years ago, there were certain problems with this, but now almost all application software meets these requirements.  It should also be noted that this CPU is 32-bit.  As a result, the latest, most recent applications based on 64-bit computing on it will not be able to start.  But this is also natural: the processor was introduced more than 2 years ago, and at that time there was no talk of 64-bit applications. </p>

    <h2>  Graphics Accelerator </h2><p>  As a video accelerator, this phone uses ‚ÄúMali-400MP2‚Äù.  This is a time-tested solution that has managed to prove itself from the best side.  But if this graphics accelerator were installed on the device 2 years ago, then it would automatically relate to mid-range solutions.  Now, solutions based on the Snapdragon 410 and MTK 6752 have supplanted him from this niche. Accordingly, this graphic card sank into the segment of budget-class solutions.  The performance of "Mali-400MP2" is enough to solve a wide range of problems.  From <span>viewing photos</span> and reading books to simple entry-level games, he can handle all of this without any problems.  But the latest gaming solutions on this smart phone will definitely not work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The ThL 4000 is equipped with a 4.7-inch display.  Its matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using IPS technology, and its viewing angles are quite close to 180 degrees.  The screen resolution is 540x960, and the pixel density in this case is 275ppi.  A single pixel with such a diagonal to the naked eye is almost impossible to distinguish.  Accordingly, the picture on the display is not grainy.  The brightness and contrast in this device are also at an acceptable level. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The ThL 4000 smartphone is equipped, as expected, with two cameras.  The main one, as noted earlier, is on the back of the gadget.  It is based on a 5MP matrix.  Additionally, it implements autofocus technology and there is a single LED backlight.  With a good level of lighting, photos are of acceptable quality.  But in the dark or with a lack of lighting, even satisfactory quality cannot be expected.  One of the main advantages of the main camera in this case is the ability to record video in Full HD format.  Of course, the recorded videos are of average quality, but you can‚Äôt expect the best from an entry-level smartphone.  A more modest sensor in the front camera is only 2 megapixels.  And far from the best quality.  Most likely, a 1.3 megapixel matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãused here, which then, using interpolation at the program level, turns into 2 megapixels.  Therefore, the front camera in this device is perfect for making video calls.  And for a selfie, its capabilities will be clearly not enough.  But you can‚Äôt expect more from the economy class gadget.  For these purposes, you need a more expensive smartphone, which costs many times more. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  A well-organized memory subsystem in ThL 4000. Reviews indicate a sufficient amount for comfortable RAM.  More specifically, we are talking about 1 GB of RAM.  System processes initially occupy about 640 MB, and the user can use the remaining 360 MB to start their own processes.  The capacity of the internal drive is 8 GB.  Of these, 3 GB is occupied by preinstalled system software.  2 GB can be used to install programs from the "Play Store".  The remaining 3 GB, the owner of the smartphone can use to store personal information.  This can be test documents, and spreadsheets, and photos, and video, and music.  Of course, the indicated amount of memory is clearly not enough for comfortable work.  Therefore, it will be difficult to do without an additional flash card.  There is a slot for installing an external drive in this device, and here you can install an additional 32 GB.  The smartphone also supports OTG technology.  Therefore, it will be enough to purchase the necessary cord, and you can connect a conventional USB flash drive to this device.  Another way to solve the memory shortage problem is to use cloud services, for example, Yandex Disk or Mail.ru Cloud. </p>

    <h2>  Battery and autonomy </h2><p>  One of the main features is the battery in the ThL 4000. It has a removable battery and its capacity is 4000 mAh (this is where the designation of this gadget model most likely comes from).  This value will be enough for six days of battery life with an average level of use.  Even if you download this device to the maximum, you can safely count on the fact that it can stretch 2-3 days without recharging.  Well, if you turn your smartphone into a regular ‚Äúdialer‚Äù with text messages, it will work for 8 days.  Therefore, from the standpoint of autonomy, this smart phone in the segment of budget solutions is beyond competition.  Now about charging the battery.  A complete charging adapter at the output can produce 1 A. Accordingly, for its full charge it will take 4000mAh / 1A = 4Ah / 1A = 4 hours.  On the one hand, this is a lot, but on the other hand, the owners of this device will not perform such a procedure very often. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  All the most relevant communication technologies are implemented in ThL 4000. A review of its specifications indicates the support of such standards: </p><ul><li>  Support for the most common GSM and 3G networks to date.  In the second case, the information transfer speed allows you to quickly download large files (for example, a movie) or even make a video call. </li><li>  The device also has a wifi transmitter.  It is a worthy alternative to 3G and allows you to download even larger files and, of course, make video calls. </li><li>  ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù, in turn, is indispensable in cases where you need to connect a wireless stereo headset with a microphone to your smartphone or share photos, videos or other important information in small quantities with a similar gadget. </li><li>  For navigation, the device is equipped with a GPS sensor and can additionally use the A-GPS system for these purposes.  Due to this, turning it into a full-fledged navigator is not difficult.  It is also worth noting that the quality of the system for determining the location of the device is not satisfactory. </li><li>  A micro-USB port is used to synchronize with a computer and charge the battery.  It is located, as noted earlier, on the upper edge of the smartphone. </li><li>  A wired stereo headset can be connected to this unit using a 3.5 mm audio port.  It is just like the micro-USB port, brought to the top edge of the gadget. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  The OS is Android in ThL 4000. Its firmware is based on version 4.4.  There is no additional shell on it.  Therefore, the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù on this device is as close as possible to the branded devices of the ‚ÄúNexus‚Äù series from ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù.  The rest of the software is quite standard.  Typical built-in applications in the OS - ‚ÄúCalculator‚Äù, ‚ÄúOrganizer‚Äù, ‚ÄúGallery‚Äù, ‚ÄúCalendar‚Äù and more.  There are also clients of international social networks: Twitter, Facebook and Google +.  Well, the developers did not forget about the typical set of utilities from Google (this is Chrome, news service, and so on).  After the purchase, everything else will have to be additionally installed on the smartphone from the branded application store called ‚ÄúPlay Market‚Äù. </p><h2>  Smartphone price </h2><p>  Thl 4000 was priced at <span>$ 100</span> in domestic online stores. Its price on foreign trading floors is slightly lower - $ 95.  You can, of course, save these $ 5 by buying a device.  But on the other hand, if you purchase this gadget in a domestic online store, then you get a guarantee.  Accordingly, in the event of a breakdown, you will be required to provide a free warranty repair.  But in the second case, you will have to pay extra for this repair. </p><h2>  The opinion of the owners of the device </h2><p>  The price is fully consistent with the quality and specifications of the ThL 4000. The feedback from the owners of this smart phone only confirms this.  For $ 100, you get a completely ready-to-use gadget.  There is even a case and an additional protective film.  The built-in memory is enough for working and installing applications, but it is better to immediately purchase a memory card.  This will completely solve the problem with the small size of the internal drive.  One of the main advantages of the device is its autonomy.  The battery capacity is 4000 mAh, and this, with a reasonable approach, allows you to do without a charger for 5-6 days. </p>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Thus, the ThL 4000 smartphone is an excellent device for every day.  He will easily cope with most everyday tasks.  There is certainly nothing more to expect from an entry-level phone for $ 100.  Its main advantage is a high degree of autonomy, which is provided by a high battery capacity and an energy-efficient processor.  If you need just such a device, then a worthy alternative to this gadget today in the segment of entry-level smartphones simply does not exist. </p>
