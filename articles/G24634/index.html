    <p>  There are many dangerous soldiers in Metal Gear Solid.  Revolver (Shalashaska) Ocelot - the codename of a soldier who specializes in torture, interrogation.  Another characteristic that distinguishes him from other fighters is the skillful handling of pistols.  It is thanks to this skill that he will receive his nickname - Ocelot Revolver.  It is also worth noting that this character has telepathic abilities, which more than once saved his life.  Adamsk (real name of the character) is one of the main characters in the series.  He was one of the few who personally knew Big Boss and his clones.  As a rule, Ocelot Revolver acted as a double or triple agent, acting for the benefit of organizations such as the Philosophers, the GRU, the CIA, and the Patriots. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Revolver Ocelot: biography </h2><p>  Revolver Ocelot was born on June 6, 1944 in northern <span>France, Normandy.</span>  Adamsky's mother was a girl soldier Joy (later she became better known under the nickname Boss).  The birth took place during the <span>operation "Overlord."</span>  Joy was injured, so she had to have a cesarean section.  Fortunately, the child was not injured, however, after the procedure, Ocelot's mother left a huge scar that stretched across the entire body.  As it turned out in MGS3, Ocelot's father was a soldier named Sorrow.  It was from him that Adamsk inherited his telepathic abilities.  Soon the child was stolen by agents of the Philosophers. </p><p>  When Adamsk matured, he was placed in the organization of the NSA (National Security Agency).  He worked there as a decoder.  But soon Ocelot sided with the USSR and began to work in the special forces, led by Evgeny Borisovich Volgin.  A little later, Ocelot, thanks to a relationship with the legendary Boss, received his personal squad.  In the 60s, Adamsk became a secret agent.  He worked not only for the GRU, but also for the KGB with the CIA. </p><h2>  Operation Snake Eater </h2>

    <p>  In the operation "Snake Eater" Ocelot played a significant role.  Performing this mission, Adamska repeatedly came across Naked Snake (later nicknamed Big Boss).  Being a ‚Äúmole‚Äù in the GRU (USSR), Ocelot Revolver, by order of the CIA (USA), was supposed to help Snake in his mission.  And everything went pretty well.  Thanks to the help of Ocelot, Snack managed to destroy the ‚ÄúShaghodok‚Äù and Grozny Grad.  It is also worth noting that it was Adamsk who deprived Snake of his eyes during torture.  In addition, Shalashaski had another secret mission, the essence of which was revealed only at the end of MGS 3. It turns out that initially the main goal of Ocelot was the ‚ÄúLegacy of the Philosophers‚Äù (a huge money fund).  And the Revolver did an excellent job.  Thanks to him, the United States received part of the same "Heritage". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Further activities </h2>

    <p>  Chalashaska was unhappy with the way the government acted with the money of the Philosophers.  It is for this reason that, with the support of Zero, he created the Patriots organization.  Soon Big Boss joined her.  However, this did not last long.  Zero secretly began work on the project ‚ÄúTerrible Children‚Äù.  Its essence was to create clones of genetically ideal soldiers based on Snake‚Äôs DNA.  When Big Boss found out about this, he left the organization in a rage.  Ocelot was also not enthusiastic about the action of Zero.  But he did not leave the organization immediately and continued to work as a secret agent. </p><p>  Ocelot later attempted to rebuild Outer Haven, but was killed by Solid Snake (one of the Big Boss clones and the protagonist of the game series). </p><h2>  Relationship with the Big Boss </h2>

    <p>  The relationship between Big Boss and Ocelot is quite complicated, confusing and not completely understood.  But still, most fans believe that Adamsk and Snake are connected by "brotherly ties."  And this is quite logical.  Indeed, throughout the game they have one and the same goal - to realize the dream of the Boss, who for the characters of both was a mentor, mother.  And the death of Ocelot is not as simple as it seemed at first glance.  The true purpose of the Revolver was to awaken the Big Boss and free the world from the power of the "Patriots".  And he managed to do this only with his own valuable life. </p>
