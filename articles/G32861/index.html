  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 kopecks in 2000: history and value</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At the beginning of the new millennium, the Moscow <span>Mint,</span> in cooperation with the St. Petersburg Mint, minted a coin of 10 kopecks.  The cost of 10 kopecks in 2000 is not more than 10 rubles, and this taking into account the fact that the coin is in excellent condition.  Otherwise, the price will fall to 5 rubles, or even less. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aeol.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="10 kopecks in 2000 cost" class="if uuid-2482547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/2482547.jpg"></div><p>  There are a lot of copies of 10 kopecks in 2000, so such a low cost.  The coin was made of steel and covered with a small layer of yellow metal, but later coins were honored and minted from brass. </p><p>  In this article, we will discuss some characteristics of this coin and learn how to find a couple of differences that you cannot immediately notice. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The weight of 10 kopecks in 2000 can be about 1.95 grams, the diameter is 17.5 mm, and the thickness is 1.25 mm.  The lateral strip (edge) is covered with a small pitch corrugation - as a result, 98 strips can be counted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nonews.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coin 10 kopecks" class="if uuid-2482548" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/2482548.jpg"></div><p>  On one side (reverse) is the image of St. George slaying the dragon.  His cloak is the main difference that can be seen in many copies.  As a rule, there are vertical folds on it, but there are several coins where these folds were minted differently - horizontally.  But do not think that 10 kopecks in 2000, on which there are rare horizontal folds, will cost you a round sum.  Its maximum price does not exceed 20 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Obverse and reverse </h2><p>  Now let's talk about the sides of the coin.  On the obverse is a beautifully arranged composition from the famous painting ‚ÄúThe Miracle of George about the Serpent,‚Äù authored by renowned artist Raphael.  You can clearly see how George pierces the evil dragon with the tip of his spear.  If you look closely, then under the left hoof you can see the trademark of a particular mint. </p><p>  On the bottom of the coin is the year of issue - 2000. The inscription ‚ÄúBANK OF RUSSIA‚Äù is placed in capital letters on the right and left side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="meshok.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="one coin" class="if uuid-2483484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43230/2483484.jpg"></div><p>  On the reverse is the face value of the coin - the number 10. It is shifted slightly to the side.  You may notice that on some coins the denomination may be closer to the left edge, so the plant painting will look a little on the right side. </p><p>  10 kopecks in 2000 have an ornament that consists of two branches.  Under the numbers there is an inscription in capital letters, which indicates the face value of the coin - ‚ÄúKOPEEK‚Äù. </p><h2>  Soviet symbols </h2><p>  The Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic minted several coins with a nominal value of 10 kopecks, which depict the coat of arms of the USSR.  This is very rare, but, unfortunately, the cost of 10 kopecks in 2000 does not change from this.  Such a copy can be bought at many auctions for 15-20 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The star in the upper part of the coin and the composition in the form of several ears that consist of grape leaves underwent changes.  The name of the <span>republic (Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic)</span> and the year of issue of the coin (2000) are embossed around the coin circumference.  All the inscriptions that are minted on it are distributed strictly in the center and are not shifted in different directions, as can be seen on the coin of St. George. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.avito.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="three coins" class="if uuid-2483482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43230/2483482.jpg"></div><p>  The coin is made mainly of aluminum, and this is one of its main differences.  Many entrepreneurs try to cash in on this coin, putting it up for auction at an incredibly high price (100-150 rubles), but it is not so rare and expensive to give exorbitantly big money for it.  As mentioned above, the highest possible price for which it can be redeemed is 15-20 rubles. </p><p>  <span>The PMR coin</span> with Soviet symbols has no visual differences, like on George‚Äôs cloak.  That is why all copies are so cheap and very common. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So ... the Moscow and St. Petersburg mints in 2000 issued a coin with a nominal value of 10 kopecks, which depicts St. George slaying a dragon.  These coins are not considered rare, so their price is from 10 to 20 rubles. </p><p>  We also found out that this coin has a special difference.  If you look closely, you can see that there are horizontal folds on the developing coat of George.  But there are several coins on which folds are minted vertically.  The cost of such an instance may increase by only a couple of rubles. </p><p>  The 10 kopeck coin of 2000, issued by the Transdniestrian Moldavian Republic, is armed with Soviet symbols.  The reverse shows the emblem of the USSR, as well as the tools - the sickle and hammer.  This coin has no differences, so if you are trying to sell a ‚Äúunique‚Äù instance, then you should not believe this.  All of them are the same and cost no more than 20 rubles. </p>
