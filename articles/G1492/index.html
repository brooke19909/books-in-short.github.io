    <h2>  Karcher SV 1802 </h2><p>  Studying Karcher steam cleaners, it is necessary to talk about the SV 1802. Although it has some negative aspects, all the positive ones justify the cost.  Customers praise the device for its ability to steam clean, as well as the fact that with just one nozzle you can carry out large-scale cleaning.  The garbage container will have to be washed often, since its volume is only 0.6 liters. </p><p>  Filter installed in the device, type HEPA.  Like many other Karcher steam cleaners, this one weighs impressive - almost 9 kg.  Prices for the device are high.  They vary between $ 650- $ 800.  Noise during operation is not strong.  That is what it attracts many potential buyers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="karcher sv 1902" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1484188.jpg" width="500"></div>

Its main advantage is versatility.  You can use this model as a steam cleaner or as a normal technique for dry garbage collection. </p><p>  The water filter holds dust and dirt.  It should be noted that thanks to the special technology, you do not have to constantly replace the liquid, making a long cleaning.  The disadvantages include the following nuances: </p><ul><li>  installed HEPA filter; </li><li>  high price (over $ 700). </li></ul><p>  Often, this model is chosen by those who need to clean fairly large areas.  But it is worth considering - although you do not have to spend money on the purchase of household chemicals, you will need to constantly purchase new HEPA filters, since they quickly become clogged. </p><p>  Electricity consumption is low, so saving money with the SV 7 will be easy.  This is exactly what Karcher emphasized when designing the device.  A steam cleaner, the instructions for which are provided with the most important information, consumes only 2.2 kW.  In order to heat the water, the device needs to spend about 5 minutes.  At the same time, the steam generator has a very small power - only 1.1 kW.  This is a definite plus.  However, this model weighs a little more than 9 kg, which is a negative criterion for some consumers. </p><h2>  Review of Karcher SV 1902 </h2><p>  This device has several useful functions.  In particular, steam cleaning, suction of garbage are available.  In fact, acquiring the described model, a person receives several devices at once: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  A vacuum cleaner with an aquafilter that is able to carry out dry cleaning.  It also has a special antifoam. </li><li>  Vacuum cleaner for cleaning surfaces. </li><li>  A steam cleaner that can fight dirt, grease, soot, etc. All substances are immediately absorbed by a steam vacuum cleaner.  Such a device will be quite useful in the kitchen or in the bathroom. </li></ul><p>  Speaking about the benefits of Karcher SV 1902, you need to clarify that it will be useful in eliminating bad odors.  This model is safe, environmentally friendly, economical, efficient and quite convenient.  It is inexpensive, unpretentious in maintenance, and also able to be stored anywhere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="steam cleaner k√§rcher reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1484192.jpg" width="600"></div>
