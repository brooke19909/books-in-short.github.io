However, after the earthquake on the <span>island of Haiti</span> , many had concerns.  Is the Dominican Republic safe enough?  Photos of the destruction caused by the elements of the neighboring state spread throughout the world.  But here's the oddity: the eastern part of the island, which is occupied by the Dominican Republic, neither the earthquake nor the typhoons hit.  The same striking contrasts are observed in the economies of neighboring countries.  When poverty reigns in the <span>Republic of Haiti</span> , an atmosphere of endless Caribbean festivals and holidays reigns in the Dominican Republic.  Rest here will not be lackluster! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic photo" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/456191.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Dominican Republic on a world map </h2><p>  When the independent republic was still a Spanish colony, it was called Santa Domingo, in honor of its holy patron, Dominic de Guzm√°n.  The church canonized this founder of the monastic order, despite his dubious moral qualities.  The inhabitants of the colony began to be called Dominicans.  After gaining independence, the revolutionaries wanted the new name to indicate that the country belongs to the people.  Therefore, it became known as the Dominican Republic.  The state occupies the eastern part of the island of Haiti, in the Greater Antilles archipelago.  The population is less than ten million.  The capital of the country is the city of Santa Domingo.  It attracts rich lovers of sandy beaches, turquoise lagoons and <span>coral reefs</span> from around the world.  Dominican Republic - photos confirm this - a real tropical paradise.  Coconut palms on a snow-white shore, as in the Bounty advertisement, bright fish and top-notch service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic on the map" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/456192.jpg" width="466"></div>

For citizens of the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, a visa is not required.  Provided, of course, that your vacation in the country will not exceed the period of 30 days.  Reviews indicate that it is better to fly to the Dominican Republic from Moscow.  Aeroflot and Transaero planes fly to the main resort city of Punta Cana from there.  The flight is long - about thirteen and a half hours.  If you get to Punta Cana from Ukraine, Belarus or Kazakhstan with connecting flights to European capitals, you will be left all day on the road.  But the torment is worth it: after all, exhausted tourists are waiting for a first-class vacation in the Dominican Republic!  Car rental prices bite here.  In addition, local drivers quite freely interpret the rules of the road.  Between cities it is better to travel in buses, minibuses, which are called "gua-gua" here, or taxi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in Dominican Republic" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/456193.jpg" width="430"></div>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  When is the "peak of the season" in tropical eden called "Dominican Republic"?  Photos taken at different times of the year indicate that it is always comfortable to relax here.  Unless from May to September there are rains.  But they sweep so fast, and the equatorial sun burns so violently that after ten minutes you can‚Äôt even remember the rain.  Despite heavy rains, the temperature in August (the hottest month on the island of Haiti) does not fall below + 33 ¬∞ C.  The peak of the season falls in the winter - especially January-February.  At this time, it is comfortable +25 ¬∞ C, clear skies and a warm, quiet world.  Due to the characteristic features of the coast, the <span>ebbs and flows</span> in local resorts are insignificant. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotels in Dominican Republic </h2><p>  This country is not for budget tourists.  It is difficult to find a hotel with three stars.  Mostly 4 *, 5 * and "5 * Deluxe" hotels prevail.  A characteristic feature of the Dominican Republic hotel complexes is not too high-rise buildings.  The lion's share of hotels are bungalows with several rooms.  Therefore, electric vehicles or mini-trains run along the large green territory of such complexes.  Reviews praise the animation, both adult and child.  With regard to food, then in most resort hotels practiced the system "All inclusive".  Fighting for the clientele, hotels go to great and expensive delights: a single visit to a la carte restaurants, spa treatments or any alcohol in the bar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in the Dominican Republic prices" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/456195.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Resorts Dominican Republic </h2><p>  The capital of Santa Domingo is full of interesting historical sights, but there are no beaches here.  But they are abundantly present in other resorts of the country.  Each of them has the necessary not only a set of services for elite relaxation, but also some zest.  Such a many-sided Dominican Republic!  Photos of resorts allow you to choose a place for a vacation to your taste.  Punta Cana is suitable for those who want to relax and forget for a while that there is a stressful office life somewhere thousands of kilometers from here.  La Romana is a resort for VIP tourists.  There are many golf courses, yacht clubs and the like.  Puerto Plata is suitable for newlyweds and couples in love.  Among the romantic surroundings, the spirit of old Spain with its colonial palaces has been preserved.  Puerto Plata is appreciated by surfers for the excellent long wave of its surf.  Juan Dolio and Boca Chica - places for families with children - the depths of the lagoons do not exceed one and a half meters.  And Bayahibe, Samana and Cap Cana are suitable for active tourists. </p>
