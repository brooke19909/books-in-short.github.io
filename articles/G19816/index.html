    <h2>  What it is </h2><p>  Many users of a personal computer are familiar with things such as notifications from a system or anti-virus program that alert you to a problem.  Such alerts usually appear in the lower right corner of the screen.  These are the very first push messages.  Later, developers of mobile operating systems transferred this idea to mobile devices.  So a push message was created.  <span>What is it?</span>  <span>This is a</span> short notification that usually appears at the top of the screen of a tablet or smartphone. </p><h2>  Who sends messages </h2><p>  Naturally, applications.  They notify the user of an event, fact or problem.  For example, games most often report the appearance of new stocks or the replenishment of a player‚Äôs energy.  The user himself decides which applications can send push messages and which cannot be done.  Configuring these notifications is not as difficult as it might seem. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Operating Systems </h2><p>  So, the push message (what it is, we‚Äôve already figured it out a bit) is most often used on mobile platforms.  Which ones?  First of all, on Android, which is the most popular mobile operating system to date.  By the way, it was <span>Google,</span> which is the developer of Android, who was the first to launch a push message.  What does this mean?  It was the owners of tablets and smartphones <span>running the Android</span> mobile <span>operating system that</span> were the first to experience the charm of instant notifications from applications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="push messages" class="if" height="442" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/965572.jpg" width="347"></div>

    <h2>  Apple and iOs </h2><p>  As for the famous American ‚Äúapple‚Äù brand, they are not far behind their competitors.  A year after introducing instant alerts on Android, Apple also launched this useful option on iOs 3.0.  It is noteworthy that a little later it was also implemented by the company's specialists on the OS X operating system. That is, all "apple" laptops ("Macbooks") can also receive instant alerts in the notification area.  For example, from social networks.  This is convenient, because you can, without going into the application, reply to a message to friends or track the latest news of your page.  And on mobile devices this is often used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wap push messages" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/965573.jpg" width="250"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Wap push messages </h2><p>  This is also one of the varieties of notifications.  But their main difference from instant messages from applications is that links to various Internet resources are displayed in these messages.  Having opened such a notification, the operating system suggests choosing a browser with which you can open the page.  Unless, of course, the user has previously defined a browser as standard.  By default, in this case, all links from wap push messages open in it.  Many companies that send newsletters to their customers have already switched to this notification method.  This is convenient for both users who do not need to read text canvases and senders, who thus increase their client base and views on the site. </p><h2>  Apple  How to enable push? </h2><p>  Having appreciated the charm of instant alerts, many are wondering how to turn them on.  It is not so difficult.  So, how to enable push notifications on iPhone, iPad, iPod?  Everything is pretty simple.  First you need to enter the settings (the gear icon on the device‚Äôs desktop).  Then scroll to the area where all installed applications are displayed.  After choosing the right one, the settings of the selected program will be displayed on the right side of the screen.  There is always an area where you can choose a notification method.  On the contrary, push you need to stretch the scrolling until it changes its color to green.  Additionally, you can set the settings and sound so that notifications are not only displayed on the screen, but also emit a signal that can be heard if the device, for example, is in your pocket.  It is noteworthy that all push notifications can be viewed by stretching the top of the screen down.  This is true when there are a lot of alerts from various applications, and the user does not have time to read them for some reason.  Disabling push notifications can be done in the same way as turning it on.  All manipulations are performed from the notification center, which is located in the settings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="push notifications android" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/965574.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Android gadgets </h2><p>  Most of the users of mobile devices are familiar with them, so for many it is not a secret how to enable push notifications.  Android lets you send an instant message from almost every application.  There are, of course, exceptions, but this depends not so much on the system itself as on the developers of the program.  Or due to the fact that the old version of the application is installed, where there simply was not this option yet.  Having opened the necessary program, the user needs to go into the settings (most often they are displayed as three horizontal stripes or gears), go to the part where notifications are described.  This is where push messages are turned on or off. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to enable push notifications" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/965575.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Is this really necessary? </h2><p>  Many users do not want to receive a lot of notifications from secondary and not very popular applications.  Therefore, you can simply turn off push messages in the settings so that they do not bother.  But in useful and popular applications, on the contrary - turn it on.  So, notifications from social networks, email programs, and some games are most often in demand. </p>
