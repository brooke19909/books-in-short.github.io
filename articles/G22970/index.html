An original country is capable of captivating the imagination with the gilded spiers of buildings and the monumental architecture of Ashgabat, the Karakum canal, dug among the golden sands of the desert, the cordiality of local residents and the unusual European cuisine.  But, of course, the heart of the tourism industry are the resorts of the Caspian Sea. </p><h2>  Legacy of the First President </h2><p>  Turkmenistan is a Central Asian country that, until recently, pursued an isolationist policy.  Having gained independence after the collapse of the USSR in 1991, the authorities emphasized raising national identity.  In 1995, after the election of Saparmurat Niyazov as president (who later received the title of Turkmenbashi - “father of the Turkmens”), contacts with the outside world were as limited as possible.  It was not so easy to get a visa to Turkmenistan. </p><p>  The era of Niyazov was remembered for the active development of hydrocarbons and the construction of state-of-the-art ultra-modern residential neighborhoods, luxurious government offices and giant monuments.  Thanks to the activities of the first president, Ashgabat has become one of the brightest (literally and figuratively) capitals of the world.  Gilded spiers and statues, snow-white high-rise buildings towering to the sky, wide avenues and an abundance of greenery (uncharacteristic of the desert area) became the hallmark of the city.  However, rest in Turkmenistan was not given as much attention as we would like.  Mysterious and beautiful Ashgabat could be seen only in the pictures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ttnotes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours to Turkmenistan" class="if uuid-2539829" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2539829.jpg"></div><h2>  The wind of change </h2><p>  After the death of the permanent Turkmenbashi, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov was elected to the post of head of state by popular vote.  The new leader of the nation rediscovered the country for peace.  Moreover, on his behalf, the construction of a world-class luxury resort on the Caspian Sea has begun. </p><p>  Since 2008, currency exchange offices closed by Niyazov began to work again.  In 2013, censorship in the media was canceled.  First, curious journalists came to the country, and then tourists.  Rest in Turkmenistan has become more affordable.  <span>The residents of Turkmenistan,</span> in turn, got the opportunity to fly abroad, study abroad, and strengthened diplomatic and economic ties. </p><p>  Today, the country has national tourism development programs.  Attention is paid not only to the Caspian resorts and the capital, but also to the creation of attractive conditions for recreation in the regions.  Fortunately, the country has a 3-thousand-year history and largely untouched nature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="voicepress.az" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ashgabat, Turkmenistan" class="if uuid-2539842" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2539842.jpg"></div><h2>  Ashgabat </h2><p>  Going on vacation to Turkmenistan, first of all, tourists fly to Ashgabat.  This is the cultural, industrial and political center of the country, the record holder of the Guinness Book as the settlement with the largest number of buildings (over 500), lined with white marble.  Despite such a high status, the city is young - it was founded only in 1881.  According to various estimates, its area is 700-830 km <sup>2</sup> , and the number of inhabitants has exceeded one million. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Ashgabat survived the terrible earthquake in 1948, which actually destroyed the settlement.  It was rebuilt according to the master plan of 1949-1959, in which modern ideas about architecture and planning were introduced.  Wide streets are arranged in an ordered radial-rectangular pattern, so it is impossible to get lost in the city.  Among the most important sights, their beauty and size stand out: </p><ul><li>  Monument of Neutrality (1998).  A 95-meter arch crowned with a statue of Saparmurat Turkmenbashi in pure gold.  The structure rotates in the direction of the sun and serves as a viewing platform. </li><li>  Independence Monument (2001).  The sculpture and park complex, in the central part of which there is a gilded statue of Niyazov and a 118-meter spire.  At the base, stylized as a Turkmen yurt, the Museum of Sovereignty operates. </li><li>  Archaeological complex "Nisa" (UNESCO site).  The ruins of one of the capitals of the Parthian kingdom, founded in the III century BC.  e. </li><li>  Presidential residence "Oguzhan" (2011).  The area of ​​the 45-meter white-marble palace, crowned with golden domes, exceeds 16,000 m <sup>2</sup> .  According to some reports, $ 80 million was spent on its construction. </li><li>  Palace of Arts "Ruhiet" (2007).  Serves for holding government official events, negotiations, meetings of delegations, conferences, concerts, etc. The highlight of the interior is a giant carpet weighing 1.1 tons, 21 meters long and 14 meters wide. </li><li>  Amusement park "World of Fairy Tales" (2006).  The largest leisure and recreation center in Turkmenistan.  On an area of ​​33 hectares there are about 100 modern attractions, including a roller coaster.  Divided into thematic zones. </li><li>  Market “Altyn Asyr” (2011).  The fifth largest in Central Asia and the largest in the country.  It features a convenient layout, telephone and computerization.  There is a hotel. </li><li>  The center of culture and rest "Alem" (2012).  The heart of the 95-meter complex is an integrated Ferris wheel with a diameter of 57 m, making it one of the largest in the world. </li><li>  Turkmenbashi Rukhi (2004) is the largest single-domed mosque on the planet. </li></ul><p>  This is only a small part of the miracles worthy of attention. </p><div class="photo" data-original="angrybirdsriogame.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cities of Turkmenistan" class="if uuid-2539847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2539847.jpg"></div><h2>  Cities older than Rome </h2><p>  Traces of the Bactrian-Margian civilization of the Bronze Age dating back to the 3rd millennium BC were found on the territory of the country.  Later, the region was influenced by Media, Parthia, Persia, and ultimately conquered by Alexander the Great.  Many cities of Turkmenistan were built during this historical period: </p><ul><li>  Annau.  Today it is a 30-thousandth settlement, which previously had great strategic importance.  The remains of dwellings that are about 7000 years old are found.  The local Ak Bugdai Museum holds valuable relics of antiquity, as well as an exposition dedicated to growing wheat. </li><li>  Mary.  The heart of Central Turkmenistan.  It arose on the site of the ancient city of Merv, whose age exceeds 3,000 years (its ruins are preserved quite well).  Experts advise travelers when planning a tour to Turkmenistan to visit this colorful city with a well-developed infrastructure.  The pride of the settlement is the Karakum Canal. </li><li>  Turkmenabad (Chardzhou).  The second most populated area of ​​the country (about 300,000 inhabitants).  Located in the east of Turkmenistan, on the banks of the Amu Darya.  The fortress Amul-Chardzhuy testifies to its 2-thousand-year history. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.theapricity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays on the Caspian Sea" class="if uuid-2540292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/2540292.jpg"></div><h2>  The Caspian </h2><p>  Holidays in Turkmenistan on the Caspian Sea are in no way inferior to the well-known resorts of India, the Persian Gulf, Southeast Asia, and China.  Due to the lower concentration of salt, sea water does not irritate the skin and is more pleasant for swimming. </p><p>  In 2007, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov initiated the construction of the Avaza tourist zone of national importance.  As a result, ultramodern resort hotels, pools, park areas have grown on the Caspian coast.  A navigable canal with an equipped promenade and man-made geysers up to 100 m high passes through the complex. Today, the resort has international hotels, sanatorium rest homes, and children's health resorts.  A new airport has been opened. </p><div class="photo" data-original="caspiannews.com" data-author=": Vusala Abbasova, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkmen cuisine" class="if uuid-2539930" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2539930.jpg"></div><h2>  Turkmen cuisine </h2><p>  National cuisine is closely connected with the gastronomic traditions of other peoples of Central and Central Asia.  The most popular dishes are: </p><ul><li>  dograma (beshbarmak); </li><li>  börök (dumplings); </li><li>  manty (manty); </li><li>  palow (pilaf). </li></ul><p>  The basis of the Turkmen cuisine is meat (camel, lamb, game) and bakery products.  The most important fruits are gourds, pomegranates, apricots, grapes, which in the region ripen incredibly fragrant and sweet.  Sour-milk products are commonly used: garfish, agaran, sykman, chal, teleme, karagurt.  In the western regions, sturgeon fish species occupy an important place on the menu. </p><div class="photo" data-original="forum.nationstates.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Visa to Turkmenistan" class="if uuid-2539954" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2539954.jpg"></div><h2>  Visas to Turkmenistan </h2><p>  Despite the ongoing policy of openness, getting into the country is not so simple.  It is possible to apply for permission in two ways: by applying personally to the Embassy in Moscow, or directly at the airport. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="38.969719" data-lng="59.55627800000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="5"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/2/9/5/4295.png"></div><p>  The consular fee in the first case will be $ 35 (for a 10-day visa), in the second - $ 155 (which is more expensive than in the USA).  Among the documents you need a voucher (or invitation), a passport (with a 6-month margin of validity), 2 photocopies of it, a photograph, application form, medical insurance policy.  A full list of documents is available at the consulate. </p>
