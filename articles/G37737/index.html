To truly relax, soak up in the gentle rays of the sun, splash in clean water, breathe in fresh air - all that a city dweller can dream of.  Fortunately, now you do not have to leave far from Barnaul.  Sunny Beach is a quarter hour drive from the city.  You can have a great time with the whole family, you can enjoy all the delights of a quality, and most importantly - a safe beach holiday every weekend. </p><div class="photo" data-original="altapress.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunny Beach is the best beach in Siberia" class="if uuid-2493553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60875/2493553.jpg"></div><h2>  The best </h2><p>  The beach is considered the best not only by visitors.  According to experts and representatives of Rospotrebnadzor, Sanepidnadzor and EMERCOM of Russia in the Altai Territory, Solnechny beach in Barnaul is an indicative beach in Pervomaisky district.  In 2017, just before the opening of the swimming season, a thorough repair was carried out on the beach, outdated equipment was replaced.  The most important change that could not be overlooked and not appreciated was the concrete work at the water's edge and the installation of a special artificial turf resembling a lawn.  They performed cleaning work in the pond itself. </p><p>  The entire recreation area is in perfect cleanliness.  You do not have to worry about children who love to tinker with in the sand so much - cleaning is carried out daily. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the beach "Solnechny" in Barnaul, an emergency room operates.  There is everything you need for first aid.  For the safety of vacationers, qualified rescuers work. </p><p>  Vigilant guard takes care of a serene pastime on the beach.  Drunk people with stocks of alcoholic beverages are not allowed into the territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="solnechniy.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunny Beach in Barnaul" class="if uuid-2493547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60875/2493547.jpg"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  In order to avoid poisoning, bringing food with you is not allowed, but no one will remain hungry.  There are cafes and bars.  If earlier it was possible to be content only with beach fast food, now the cuisine pleases with a healthier and more varied menu.  Set lunches, fresh salads, barbecue, sweets and other goodies are available. </p><p>  Vacationers can use sunbeds, umbrellas, water rides for free.  For fans to actively relax on the Barnaulsky beach "Solnechny" volleyball and basketball courts are adapted.  A play area for the youngest guests is located on the sidelines.  For babies there is also a separate bathing place, fenced off from all sides. </p><p>  All types of massage services are available. </p><p>  Other facilities, such as a birch grove with gazebos, and rides for children, are also being arranged. </p><p>  There is a minus on the beach "Sunny" in Barnaul.  In reviews of regular visitors, too small parking is mentioned.  On weekends, when it is especially crowded, visitors on cars have to look for empty seats. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amic.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park Hotel Sunny&quot;" class="if uuid-2493549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60875/2493549.jpg"></div><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  Since the summer of 2017, the price for a stay in the territory has significantly decreased.  300 rubles will have to be paid for a ticket for an adult, and children under 3 years old are skipped for free.  The beach is open from 10am to 9pm. </p><p>  You can use the sunbeds, rides, parking. </p><p>  If you want to spend more than one day on the lake, you can stay at the Solnechny Park Hotel.  There are grocery stores, cafes and gas stations nearby. </p><p>  On the photo of Barnaulsky beach "Solnechny" you can notice a part of the hotel building. </p><p>  You can get from Barnaul to the village of Solnechny by shuttle buses at numbers 203 and 269 from the bus station or from Spartak Square, 2 on the 20th.  A shuttle bus runs at Novoaltaysk at number 202. </p>
