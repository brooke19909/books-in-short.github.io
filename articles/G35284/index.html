Let us take a closer look at its features, binding to other transport communications and various attractions located in the immediate vicinity of it. </p><h2>  From the history </h2><p>  The first passengers metro station "Timiryazevskaya" took in the spring of 1991.  It entered into operation as part of the launch site between the Otradnoye and Savyolovskaya stations.  On the Serpukhov-Timiryazevskaya line, it is located between the Petrovsko-Razumovskaya and Dmitrovskaya stations.  The station is not part of the interchange nodes, and therefore the daily flow of passengers passing through its lobby is quite moderate.  It is not planned to lay new metro lines through this area, and it is not destined to become the interchange "Timiryazevskaya".  No plans for a radical reconstruction of the station currently exist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro timiryazevskaya" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/390425.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <h2>  Architectural features </h2><p>  In terms of its constructive type, the Timiryazevskaya metro station is a one-arch deep station.  Typically, stations at such depths are designed and constructed according to a three-vaulted scheme.  And in this sense, Timiryazevskaya is unique.  In addition, it was erected in a closed way, and this type of construction is rarely used in the construction of single-vault structures of the underground type.  During the construction of this station, Moscow metro builders worked out construction technologies, which were subsequently successfully applied at other facilities.  The metro station "Timiryazevskaya" is one of the deepest in the entire Moscow metro.  The main station hall is very elongated.  In general, the architectural appearance of the station is quite restrained and does not pretend to have an external effect.  Ground structures were not provided for by the project; access to the city is through an <span>underpass</span> system on Dmitrovskoye Shosse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow metro Timiryazevskaya" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/390428.jpg?1399376320691" width="496"></div>

This is displayed both in the name of the transport object and in the name of the entire northern direction of the given metro line.  The interior decoration is dominated by light-colored marble and granite.  The floor is tiled with dark granite with lighter-tone marble implications.  The track walls are faced <span>with light green marble</span> .  The entire color scheme, in which the interior is designed, contains a reference to the works of the famous Russian scientist, whose name the station is named.  The interior of the central hall, existing today, was significantly damaged during one of the repairs.  For unknown reasons, the Timiryazevskaya metro station lost its decorative composition on plant themes, which was originally located in the end part of the hall.  Along the center line of the hall is a row of columns with <span>fluorescent lights.</span>  The columns end at the top with stylized metallic colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro timiryazevskaya line" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/390426.jpg?1399376372651" width="496"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Moscow:</span> Timiryazevskaya <span>metro</span> in urban infrastructure </h2><p>  The station is located on Dmitrovskoye Shosse, one of the main highways of the capital, heading north.  This is a very busy place in the business and commercial life of Moscow.  In addition to large housing estates, many administrative institutions, trade and service structures are located in this area.  In addition to the Dmitrov highway, from the station you can get to the street Yablochkova.  For those who are heading out of town, this place is traditionally considered convenient for a train transfer from the subway.  The Timiryazevskaya line here comes close to the railway platform of the same name, located on the Savyolovsky direction of the Moscow Railway.  The platform "Timiryazevskaya" exit through the underpass. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro station timiryazevskaya" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/390427.jpg?1399376433432" width="496"></div>

    <h2>  Monorail Transplant </h2><p>  But you can transfer from the metro station not only to the commuter train, going in the direction of the region from the <span>Savyolovsky station.</span>  So there were urban circumstances that the toponym "Timiryazevskaya" in Moscow designated as many as three objects of urban <span>transport infrastructure.</span>  In addition to the metro station and the railway platform, the name "Timiryazevskaya" is also the terminal station of the <span>Moscow monorail transport system.</span>  It is located immediately behind the railway line.  This kind of transport communication in Moscow is still available in one copy, and nothing is yet known about whether this system will somehow develop in the future.  There are reasonable doubts about its technical and economic feasibility.  Currently, the monorail line is completely unprofitable.  Its operation not only does not pay for itself, but also requires a constant investment of significant financial resources to maintain the already built infrastructure in working condition. </p>
