One likes bright, funny, long-deserved fame Antalya, Kemer, Marmaris.  Others choose less developed and less noisy places, for example, Kizilot.  The hotels here are new, modern, with a wide range of services at affordable prices.  Cenger <span>Beach Resort SPA Hotel</span> is considered one of the best.  Its rich infrastructure and special location make it possible for everyone who is tired of the busy rhythm of life, fuss, endless worries and troubles to get a good rest.  The hotel staff takes care of all this. </p><h2>  Where is the location description </h2><p>  The five-star Cenger Beach Resort (Turkey) is located a few dozen steps from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, in the new and still slightly developed resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKizilot.  This is approximately on the border with the resort of Alania, which has long been chosen by Russian tourists.  Manavgat, famous for its waterfalls and canyons, is only 13 km from the hotel.  This is the third largest city by area and population in the region.  By public transport, the trip there takes about 15-20 minutes, depending on how many stops there will be at the request of passengers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cenger beach resort" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/707608.jpg" width="455"></div>

    <p>  A little further, literally 5 minutes from Manavgat, is the ancient city-museum of Side.  The nearest airport is Antalya, about 90 km from Cenger Beach Resort.  If you use motor transport, the journey will take about 2 hours, which should be taken into account by tourists with kids.  Excellent asphalt highway stretches along the coast almost all the time.  The windows of the car or bus offer sea views on one side and hills with rare groups of trees on the other.  Arriving guests are immediately struck by some privacy of the hotel.  In other resorts, sometimes from the windows of the rooms you can observe what is happening in the rooms of neighboring hotels - they are so close.  This is not here, so you can enjoy a real vacation from worldly fuss.  Even the nearest store is a 7-8 minute walk.  But the highway is very close.  Dolmushi regularly ‚Äúruns around‚Äù here, so it is very easy to get where your heart desires.  In addition to cities, there are a couple of villages near the hotel with small shops and taverns.  The nearest is Kizilot (3 km to it).  The second is Okurcalar (4 km to it).  You can walk to them if the weather permits. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description of the Territory </h2><p>  Since there are no other land contenders nearby, the Cenger Beach Resort hotel is quietly located on a vast territory - 12 thousand square meters.  Wonderful flowers are fragrant here, palm trees, junipers and rhododendrons green all year round.  The impressive lawns with emerald grass are also pleasing to the eye.  The solid area made it possible to conveniently place two magnificent buildings on the territory, a wonderful adult pool with an island in the center, a mini water park, a bar, a children's pool, tennis courts, sports grounds, and a parking lot.  There is even its own amphitheater, where concerts of touring artists, competitions and quizzes organized by animators take place. </p><h2>  Description of hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Cenger Beach Resort is still brand new.  It was put into operation in 2011.  It consists of two stylish five-story buildings, between which there is a covered passage.  The lobby of both buildings is spacious and bright.  In one there is a reception desk, where there is a paid safe.  Here you can also order dry cleaning, washing and ironing services, exchange currency, solve the issue of renting a vehicle.  There are corners in the lobby where comfortable soft chairs are installed, beautiful lighting is arranged, and there is a lobby bar.  Wireless internet works best here too. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cenger beach resort 5" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/707382.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The windows overlook either the sea or the hotel grounds.  The design of the rooms is not a throw, everything is in soft pastel colors, on the walls - paintings harmoniously fit into the overall interior. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Cenger Beach Resort SPA Hotel offers 3 restaurants for its guests.  The main and largest (for 600 people) is called "Pamphylia."  Its covered part can accommodate up to 450 people at a time, and 150 on the terrace, which offers wonderful views. </p><p>  Pamphylia hosts breakfast, lunch, dinner.  The cook is a top class master.  He and his assistants literally surprise and delight guests with new dishes literally every day.  The menu includes meat (chicken, veal, beef, lamb, turkey), fish (including grilled), dozens of salads and side dishes, delicious sweets.  All this is superbly served and beautifully decorated.  The food here is not only delicious, but also plentiful.  And no one counts how much the tourist took for himself food (buffet-style meals), doesn‚Äôt monitor if anyone has taken anything to his room.  You can eat from 7 in the morning, when breakfast begins, and until 11 in the evening.  The approximate dinner time is from 9 pm.  In addition, during the day, a second breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack with pastries and drinks, free ice cream are provided.

    <p>  In addition, Cenger Beach Resort (hotel) in its infrastructure has 4 bars - in the lobby, near the pool, on the beach and in the disco club.  It offers a variety of drinks and cocktails, seven types of which can be taken for free.  You do not have to pay for Turkish alcoholic drinks.  In addition, you can have a snack in the beach bar.  There are even a few hot dishes on the menu. </p><h2>  Sea, weather conditions in Kizilot </h2><p>  Cenger Beach Resort SPA is very close to its own beach.  Before him, you need to walk 400 meters through the tunnel.  The sea in this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKizilot is crystal clear, but open to all winds, so there are waves here.  On the one hand, this is a small problem for vacationers with young children, on the other - a paradise for surfers.  Sunbeds and umbrellas on the beach are free, which is not often found in Turkey.  Staff at the Cenger Beach Resort SPA hotel also provides clean <span>beach towels</span> every day for free <span>.</span>  A feature of this section of the coast is that the beaches here are not sandy, but pebble.  There are even large stones, so it is advisable for vacationers to have special bathing shoes on their feet.  Sunset at sea is not particularly gentle, which some like, but not others. </p><p>  In addition to the beach bar, there are many activities, such as riding a banana, on boats with a transparent bottom.  Yacht and scooter rentals are also available. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cenger Beach Resort SPA Hotel" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/707384.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The weather conditions in this region allow you to have a great rest from May to September inclusive.  In summer, there is practically no rain, it is very hot (quite often the mercury column rises above 30 degrees Celsius, and in some years it generally froze at around +45).  The sea off the coast during these months warms up well: the water temperature is from 25 to 28 degrees Celsius.  In May and September it is comparatively ‚Äúcool‚Äù: +25 ... +30 <sup></sup> . Even in April and October it is relatively warm (during the day the air temperature varies between + 22-26 degrees).  The sea warms up to +20 ¬∞ C and above.  The only minus of rest in these months is precipitation, ‚Äúpleasing‚Äù literally every week.  However, this does not interfere with a great vacation, because there is still no big influx of tourists, and prices are not as high as during the peak season. </p><h2>  Leisure on site </h2><p>  The Cenger Beach Resort SPA 5 * hotel boasts a very large (over 1000 sq. Meters) outdoor pool with an island in the center.  Two pretty bridges lead to it.  On the island and around the pool there are many sunbeds and umbrellas.  Towels are provided free of charge.  Near the pool there is a free mini-water park with two water slides.  There is also a smaller heated indoor pool. </p><p>  The hotel can offer its guests a wonderful spa complex, which provides the following services: </p><p>  - aromatherapy; </p><p>  - a sauna; </p><p>  - hamam; </p><p>  - Jacuzzi; </p><p>  - paid massage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cenger Beach Resort Hotel" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/707380.jpg" width="500"></div>

If necessary, parents can order a nanny. </p><h2>  Leisure outside the hotel </h2><p>  Active vacationers have no time to be bored at the Cenger Beach Resort 5 * hotel.  Kizilot, although it can‚Äôt boast a single attraction, is only 20 minutes away from the unique Side.  This museum city was founded in the 7th century BC.  The Greeks built it, so many of the unique <span>historical monuments that have</span> survived to our time are made in the classical Greek style.  You can see the Agora, the temples of Apollo and Artemis, the bishop's palace, the Nymphaeum fountain and much more, visit museums or just walk along the ancient streets.  In addition, guests of Cenger Beach Resort Side will find it interesting for its amazing beaches, many shops, bars and restaurants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cenger Beach Resort Turkey" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/707449.jpg" width="473"></div>

    <p>  Another entertaining excursion can be made to Manavgat.  This is a very large city with well-developed infrastructure.  Here you can find a wide variety of entertainment, and in addition, take a trip to admire the man-made waterfall, Lake Titreegn√∂l, the ruins of Seleucia, a mosque, <span>K√∂pr√ºl√º canyon.</span>  <span>A ticket</span> there costs 3 y.  e., to Side - a little more expensive (2014 prices).  The most restless and curious tourists can visit Alanya.  The road there will take 40-50 minutes, the fare is 10 y.  e. In Alanya, you can not only admire the unique historical monuments, but also profitably stint. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  The modern five-star hotel Cenger Beach Resort SPA (Side, Kizilot) is ideal for those who prefer a relaxing comfortable stay.  It is located at some distance from shopping centers and all kinds of entertainment venues.  All that is needed for leisure activities is available on site.  Those who wish to make excursions to neighboring cities can use dolmushi (stop right in front of the complex) or rent a car.  This service is provided by the hotel. </p><p>  The main contingent of holidaymakers at Cenger Beach Resort are Germans and Turks, so all staff is focused on knowledge of the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof these countries.  Even the front desk staff do not speak English very well.  Only some employees know the Russian language. </p><p>  The rooms in the hotel are modern, bright and quite spacious, but extra beds are not available for adults, only cots.  Children under 6 years old (without a separate berth) are free of charge.  Also, a cot for babies up to 2 years is not paid. </p><p>  Pets are allowed in the hotel only with the permission of the administration. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Most tourists vacationing at Cenger Beach Resort SPA leave positive reviews.
