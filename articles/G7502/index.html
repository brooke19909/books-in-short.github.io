Reviews in 2016 indicate the following flaws: </p><ul><li>  despite the fact that in the evenings the hotel is relatively quiet, music from the neighboring hotel will not let you fall asleep; </li><li>  cosmetic repairs needed; </li><li>  with a probability of 90% you will be accommodated in a room with a poor view from the window or some kind of malfunction, then to relocate for an additional fee; </li><li>  Using wireless Internet is almost impossible (speed is very low); </li><li>  due to poor ventilation and high humidity, mold appears on the walls of the rooms; </li><li>  in many rooms the sockets are out of order (they literally fall out of the wall); </li><li>  a lot of breakdowns in the rooms. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Given the fact that the prices for accommodation and related services at the hotel are quite budgetary, guests turn a blind eye to many shortcomings.  In addition, this option is mainly chosen by active tourists, for whom the hotel is a convenient starting point for exploring local attractions.  And of course, having appreciated all the beauty of nature surrounding the hotel, you will forget about shabby furniture and other flaws.  And there are a lot of them, by the way.  All of them are mainly related to the fact that the hotel requires cosmetic (or better - overhaul) repairs. </p><p>  One of the main advantages of this hotel is its huge beach area.  Most importantly, it is kept in perfect cleanliness.  Of course, if tourists were more neat, the situation would be ideal.  And so employees have to pick up garbage from the sand all day.  The same thing can be observed on the territory: everyone is cleaning, washing, decorating something. </p><p>  As for nutrition, it is quite acceptable.  The dishes are tasty and varied (and sweets deserve special attention).  Guests enjoy almost 24-hour access to food and drinks.  But the animation is boring (although the entertainment for children is very interesting). </p>
