Poems such as "Mom."  reflect all the charm and proximity of their relationship.  The boy studied at the gymnasium in Chernivtsi, where teaching was conducted in German.  Then this area was under the leadership of Austria-Hungary.  Speaking at the lessons was difficult for him.

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  At school, the guy had a friendly relationship with Aron Pumnul, who participated in the revolutionary actions of 1848 and taught the Romanian language.  It was thanks to him that Eminescu Mihai became a patriot, drawing from the doctrine many strong ideas.  He dedicated the first verse to his mentor.  At that moment, a poetic biography begins.  Mihai Eminescu in Romanian expressed his mourning in the verse ‚ÄúAt the grave of Aron Pumnul‚Äù.  It was subsequently published in the publication ‚ÄúTears of Lyceum Students‚Äù.  The semantic load of the work consists in a call to grief, which was supposed to disperse throughout Bukovina, because one of the country's best teachers died. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The publication of the first famous work, which was written by Eminescu Mihai, took place in 1866.  Then he managed to create "Corruption of a Young Man", after which several more of his creations were brought to the attention of the public in the journal "Family".  For his creative achievements and patriotism, the appearance of the poet is depicted in national currency.  The banknote with his portrait "walks" under the face value of 500 monetary units. </p>

    <h2>  Change of place of education </h2><p>  Education in Chernivtsi was not yet completed, but the young man was forced to leave the gymnasium.  He entered another educational institution located in Vienna.  That was his father's wish.  There Eminescu Mihai acquired the status of a volunteer with the right to study philology, the history of philosophy, as well as jurisprudence.  Then his creative activity does not slow down, but, on the contrary, is gaining new momentum.  What poetry was written by Mihai Eminescu, it becomes clear if you get acquainted with the numerous creations of that time.  One of them is the wonderful poem Epigones. </p>

    <h2>  Bias in thoughts </h2><p>  With the onset of autumn 1872, he moves to Berlin.  Within the walls of the local university, he attended lectures ending in September 1874.  He was engaged in translation activities, working with the works of Confucius and Kant.  Patriotic ideas captured his mind, permeating creativity.  Such a character is the work of "The Angel and the Demon", as well as "The Emperor and the Proletarian."  Thanks to the <span>Paris Commune</span> , fundamental changes took place in his thinking and attitude.  Each line is imbued with the spirit of love for the native land.  ‚ÄúWhat I wish you, sweet Romania‚Äù is proof of that.  This verse is considered one of the author‚Äôs best creations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Creative twist </h2><p>  When the poet moved to Berlin, he rethought the concept of poetry itself.  From patriotism, Mihai inclines to love lyrics, singing subtle and sublime feelings in such creations as ‚ÄúBlue Flower‚Äù or ‚ÄúCesar‚Äù.  Reading these lines, one can grasp the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãholiness and the inviolability of true feelings.  Sometimes, of course, this does not fit in with everyday difficulties and realistic events that can break this thin and ghostly veil. </p>

Realism often triumphs over romanticism, but this does not mean at all that one should forget about sublime emotions.  Man is a complex creature, called to find a balance between his instincts, animal nature, the desire to know the world and spiritual superiority.  It is to a delicate and careful attitude to feelings that Mihai Eminescu calls for.

    <h2>  In search of funds </h2><p>  In 1874, the poet moved to Iasi, where he planned to make money.  He found a job as a teacher and a librarian in a gymnasium.  He also takes on the duties of a school inspector.  During this period, the poem "Calin" was completed.  Allegorically, unity with the motherland is glorified here.  Some time after the move, the poet created works bearing a philosophical load.  In 1877, he received an invitation from the newspaper Vremya, which was published by the Conservative Party.  The poet moves to the territory of Bucharest.  From this, of course, it does not become easier for him financially, he has to earn extra money. </p>

One of the peaks of his creative activity can be called the poem "Morning Star".  It is permeated with a romantic mood and at the same time full of realism.  The share of the genius who was rejected is highlighted.  Here there is some resentment that his talent was not fully recognized during his lifetime.

    <h2>  The fading of the mind and the dawn of a career </h2><p>  This creator really was a genius, of whom there are few.  So his lyrical hero did not have enough space for himself on earth.  The main value in the lines of this work proclaims peace.  However, his searches take a lot of energy against the backdrop of a worrying and noisy external world.  From this, fatigue arises, which can be understood by reading the text of the verse.  Notes of atheistic views are present in the work "I do not believe ...".  However, against the background of this, a demonic image is used in a separate poem.  The poet considers the world from different angles, makes assumptions, reflects and allows the reader to think with him. </p><p>  Eminescu's life was clouded by a mental illness that developed in 1883.  The treatment gave some improvements, however, it was still not possible to completely eradicate the disease; he pursued the creator to death.  During his lifetime, Mikhail paid little tribute.  But in the same year, the only book published while he was alive.  He was recognized and loved, he became a respected man, but it happened too late.  The poet's mind was clouded by ailment.  The death occurred on a bed in a psychiatric hospital in 1889 in Bucharest. </p>

However, their feat can be called all the more magnificent.  After all, this poet held fast to his views, not staggering from the blows of fate.  For all his sensuality and creative outlook on life, he kept a fire in himself to go through all the barriers.  And only at the end of his life he gave slack and allowed the disease to overcome himself.  He is worthy of eternal memory and respect.  Today, grateful descendants honor him.
