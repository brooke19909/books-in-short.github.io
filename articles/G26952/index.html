    <h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  In accordance with the <span>internal rules of the</span> hotel complex, the arrival of tourists to the rooms they booked is made from 14:00.  In case of early arrival at the hotel, employees will do their best to populate you right away.  However, in the midst of the tourist season, the Sherwood Greenwood Resort 4 * hotel complex is often 100% full, so you will have to wait until the previous guests leave the room and clean the maids.  In this case, you can leave your things in the luggage room and stroll around the hotel, have a bite to eat in the restaurant, take a dip in the pool or go straight to the beach.  On the day of departure, the room must be vacated before noon.  Also, at discharge, you should make a calculation for the time spent in the hotel and the use of various services.  If you have already paid for the stay with the travel agency through which you booked a ticket, then at checkout you will only have to make money for using additional services (if you, of course, resorted to them).  In this case, both cash and plastic cards of the Visa or Mastercard systems are accepted for payment.  Payment by cards and other systems is possible, however, this issue should be clarified in advance with the administration of Sherwood Greenwood Resort.  Also note that if you book a hotel room via the Internet, the hotel may withhold prepayment from you.  In this case, at the time of discharge you will only have to pay the rest of the cost of living. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
