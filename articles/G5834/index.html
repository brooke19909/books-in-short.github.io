  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Construction schedule and its features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The construction schedule is one of the most important documents in organizing, planning and managing the design of construction projects.  This document describes the installation and construction work and their main sequence, in accordance with the necessary terms of their implementation, as well as the <span>types of work</span> and volumes. </p><p>  Construction schedule <strong> </strong>  It has a single main purpose, which greatly simplifies the process of work planning.  A construction schedule is created that identifies and technologically links the various types of work carried out by different teams, taking into account the correct, timely and rational provision of these teams with the necessary technical or material resources, mechanized equipment.  Also, such a schedule allows you to achieve strict adherence to the deadlines for the work, remember the exact time of <span>commissioning.</span>  In addition, construction production is provided with constant material and technical support for the entire period of construction work. </p><p>  During the construction of entire residential areas, neighborhoods and individual complexes, a construction schedule <strong> </strong>  always must take into account the construction of individual residential buildings or other buildings in conjunction with special facilities that provide constant service to people.  Also, work must be carried out on all engineering communications, landscaping, in accordance with the development project, which was approved. </p><p>  During the preparation of the construction schedule, the entire range of installation and construction works is taken into account in a generalized form.  If there is only one construction object, then all auxiliary and adjoining buildings are calculated, as well as existing highways, roads, <span>engineering networks</span> and other communications.  Also taken into account the presence of a landscaped area around the object, its landscaping. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Consider the basic data and conditions necessary for the preparation of the work schedule: </p><p>  1. The conditions under which the construction of facilities and the installation of individual structures are carried out. </p><p>  2. The basic source materials of the project, for example, a master plan or a survey of the area, budget documentation, construction and technological drawings. </p><p>  3. Accurate knowledge of the time required to complete all work. </p><p>  4. A clear concept of the volume of work and their cost. </p><p>  5. The availability of basic building materials and structures, without which construction and <span>installation works</span> are impossible <span>.</span>  As well as an agreement on their delivery to the facilities. </p><p>  6. The presence of agreed parts of construction projects within the organization and coordination of the project with various authorities. </p><p>  7. The presence of the necessary regulatory, reference documentation and literature. </p><p>  8. Issuance of a building permit. </p><p>  When drawing up a <span>work schedule,</span> first of all, it is necessary to clearly detail the work that will be carried out during construction.  The main thing that is needed is to select absolutely all the auxiliary buildings adjacent to the building under construction, as well as temporary structures that are built only for the construction period. </p><p>  You also need to consider the pricing policy of the work, their volume, the need for building materials, special structures.  Based on all the above components, as well as taking into account the workforce for calculating man-hours, the first, left part of the calendar plan for the construction of any object or group of objects is filled out. </p><p>  The construction schedule is a very important document, and its proper preparation can many times increase the efficiency of the construction project. </p>
