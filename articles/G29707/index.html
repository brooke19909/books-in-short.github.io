But with the advent of the times of the USSR, it was converted into a sanatorium, which it has remained to this day.  It was built at the end of the nineteenth century. </p><h2>  Sch√∂nborn Castle in Mukachevo </h2><p>  This building has a unique design.  A huge number of different small towers, which are covered with excellent tiles, adorn the main building.  The building is made in the style of Austria-Hungary.  The castle itself is located on the territory of the Carpathians (Transcarpathian region, Ukraine).  This sanatorium has been bearing the same name for many years. </p>

    <p>  The history of the family estate began in 1840, when a wooden building stood on the site of the castle.  This building was included in the numerous possessions of Count Sch√∂nborn.  He and his friends loved to hunt, so he often visited the estate.  After not so much deliberation, it was decided to build a full-fledged estate, in which you could relax after the hunt and boast of trophies.  No one then suspected that subsequently this estate would become the legendary pearl of the whole Transcarpathian region. </p><h2>  The beginning of the construction of the castle </h2><p>  Sch√∂nborn Castle was built in 1892.  As with most castles of that time, the count decided to use the astronomical structure of the building so that it does not stand out from other castles around the world.  The count very painstakingly reacted to his estate, so there are 365 windows in it, which symbolizes the number of days in one year.  Fifty-two rooms symbolize the number of weeks in a year.  And twelve separate entrances are associated with the number of months. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  This design creation is entirely brick built.  The roofs of its many towers are covered with curly tiles, which at that time only rich landowners could afford.  Due to the fact that all four towers are made in various styles, it seems that this is not one whole building, but several structures that grow literally from the rock.  Thanks to this technology, Sch√∂nborn Castle is in perfect harmony with the surrounding landscape and terrain. </p><h2>  Interior decoration </h2><p>  In addition to the amazing beauty of the facade of the castle, it is quite attractive inside.  Luxury is not at all hidden here.  She is maximally put on display for all guests.  Here are presented: </p><ul><li>  solid oak stairs; </li><li>  luxurious fireplaces made of natural stone; </li><li>  heraldic heads of lions. </li></ul><p>  If you visit the chapel, which is located on the second floor of a magnificent castle, you can enjoy the beauty of stained-glass windows, which are decorated with ornaments in the form of numerous emblems of the family and crosses.  Glass doors and windows that are located above them were decorated with biblical-themed paintings.  The Sch√∂nborn Castle itself is located in the very center of the <span>English park,</span> which occupies nineteen hectares of land in its area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Castle location </h2><p>  The architects who were involved in the construction of the castle were able to find a great place to build.  Thanks to this, it was not at all necessary to make changes to the surroundings of the castle.  After all, nature was able to independently make sure that the species pleased the eyes of any guest. </p><p>  It is worth noting that this park contains unique species of trees that were brought here from almost all corners of the earth.  Here are collected more than forty varieties of deciduous and coniferous trees.  Among the rarest, one can distinguish the following: </p><ul><li>  Catalpa. </li><li>  Chinese cherry. </li><li>  Boxwood. </li><li>  Canadian spruce. </li><li>  Pink beech. </li></ul><p>  Due to such a wide variety, in those days, as in ours, this park was considered the most amazing in the whole country, and Transcarpathian region became known throughout the world. </p><h2>  Original tree planting </h2><p>  Tree seating was also at the highest level.  Due to the fact that they are planted in separate groups of inflorescences, you can enjoy the beauties of a separate species at any time of the year.  But at the same time, you can admire the rest of the trees and compare their beauty against the background of others.  The pond, which is located on the territory of the park, in its outline clearly resembles the borders of the Habsburg empire. </p>

    <p>  In the very center of the garden is a source of crystal clear water.  If you believe the ancient legends, then everyone who tastes the water from it will receive an extraordinary surge of vigor and strength for a whole year.  Thanks to all these advantages and beauty, the fame of the castle spread literally all over the world. </p><p>  At the beginning of 1938, the Sch√∂nborn castle was seriously interested in a man named <span>Hermann Goering,</span> who at that time held the post of Reich Marshal in Germany.  Representatives of this influential man have been negotiating with the owner of the castle for a long time about the possibility of acquiring it.  But despite the excellent price they offered, sales were refused. </p><h2>  Reconstruction in the sanatorium </h2><p>  Since the beginning of 1946, the Sch√∂nborn Castle, stunning in its beauty, began to be considered a sanatorium.  It can simultaneously accommodate 650 visitors in its walls, which can be located in three bedroom buildings.  Also on the territory of the current sanatorium there are: </p><ul><li>  concert hall; </li><li>  swimming pool; </li><li>  arboretum. </li></ul><p>  These are exactly the benefits that are needed to treat people with pathologies of the heart system and respiratory organs. </p><h2>  Sch√∂nborn Castle: how to get there by car </h2><p>  Of course, the most exciting travel option will be to drive your own car.  Indeed, from Mukachevo (Ukraine) to the castle on your way you will meet indescribable beauty of the area, as well as various attractions.  The only negative on this trip is that you have to look for these places yourself.  After all, there are no signposts of attractions on the roads. </p>

    <p>  In order to visit all the surroundings, you need to buy a map in advance, mark places on it with bold dots.  If you have a powerful navigator, you can load a map into it so that you don‚Äôt lose your way during the trip. </p><p>  Therefore, you should be very careful not to slip a turn that will lead you to this beautiful castle.  In order not to stray from the route, you need to look for a sign on the road with the inscription ‚ÄúCarpathians‚Äù.  There are two of them on your way.  The first will indicate the name of the village, but the second will directly indicate to you the desired turn to the castle.  It will be on the right side, so you need not to miss it. </p><p>  As soon as you turn around, after a few kilometers of the way, a tower will appear on the horizon, which is made in pink.  This is a train station.  Near the STOP sign, turn left where the car parking is located.  You can pay for an entrance ticket there, and a kind cashier will explain in detail how to get to the castle. </p><h2>  By train or minibus </h2><p>  But if you don‚Äôt have your own car, then you can use the train, which will give you a ride right to the entrance to the sanatorium.  An electric train runs every day in this direction from the Mukachevo station (Ukraine). </p>
