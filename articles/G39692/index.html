The sights and history of this city are impressive.  Lugansk has always been the largest industrial <span>center of Ukraine.</span>  Today it is not going through the best of times, but nevertheless the city has not lost its past cultural significance.  Sights of Lugansk and Lugansk region once led the list of the best places to visit in all of Ukraine.  What was so interesting about Lugansk that the people considered these places to be the best? </p><h2>  The house-museum of V.I. Dahl </h2><p>  V.I. Dahl was a native of Lugansk, therefore it was here that a literary museum was opened in honor of the writer.  The museum was opened in 1986 on November 22.  The museum building itself is an architectural monument of the early 19th century.  The exposition is located on 60 square meters.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe museum is 100 square meters.  In the center of a cozy courtyard stands a bust of the writer.  The art project was created by the forces of N. A. Monastyrskaya.  In the exhibition, she was able to present various eras.  Household items date back to the 19th century, and rare manuscripts and publications of past centuries are presented here.  You can also appreciate the creations of talented artists of modern Lugansk region. </p><h2>  Natural attractions.  Lugansk </h2><p>  There is an opinion that Eastern Ukraine is not so rich in natural diversity, so there‚Äôs nothing to look at.  But this is not so.  And a good example of this is the <span>Lugansk region.</span>  Attractions here are abundant, especially natural masterpieces.  Here you can look at the rocks along which glaciers once moved, and at earthworks that are older than the pyramids in Egypt.  Of particular interest are the numerous nature reserves and parks for recreation.  These are not all the sights of Lugansk.  A description of some of them will be given below. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mergel ridge </h2>

    <p>  This attraction is also called "Lugansk Stonehenge".  This monument of ancient archeology dates back to the Bronze Age.  The huge sanctuary is lined with slabs, under which there are burial places.  Mounds look impressive. </p><p>  The history of the formation of this complex is not fully known.  One legend says that it was a place of worship of the sun of an ancient settlement. </p><p>  The monument is located near the village of Stepanovka in the Perevalsky district.  It is not so far to get to it, as, for example, to Stonehenge or to the Egyptian pyramids, but you can get the same impressions. </p><h2>  Kiseleva beam </h2>

    <p>  What sights in Lugansk deserve special attention?  Stanichno-Lugansk region is famous for the place where a real miracle once happened.  In this place, a blind child saw his sight many years ago.  Later, in 1924, many pilgrims passing by saw the image of the Virgin Mary in heaven.  Ten years later, this phenomenon repeated.  Then it began to repeat more and more.  There are many healing springs in this place.  The tract is located in the steppe and is completely overgrown with forest.  This is a kind of oasis. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the early morning, when the sun only rises, each source emits its own unique sound.  One gets the impression that the whole choir comes from under the ground.  Underground keys form acidic and salty streams.  One heals from internal diseases (salty), and the other from diseases of the musculoskeletal system.  In the place of convergence of the two streams built a bath.  Water here never changes its temperature.  Kiseleva beam became famous not only throughout Ukraine, it is known in the countries of the near abroad.  The people of Kiselev beam is called real Jerusalem. </p><h2>  The estate of Msikhikhovsky </h2>

    <p>  The architectural structure dating from the 19th century is located in the small village of Lugansk region - Seleznevka.  Nearby is Alchevsk.  The village was founded by Kazimir Msikhikhovsky.  It was he who was the last who owned the estate, and also was the developer of all the buildings of the architectural complex. </p><p>  The estate was designed by architect Sergey Ginger.  This is his most successful creation.  The estate was built in the style of an Italian villa in 1840. </p><p>  The estate is located in a once picturesque park.  Today, his condition is running.  However, some species of rare vegetation are still preserved.  The park itself is a monument of garden art. </p><p>  Initially, the park was looked after by the fellow countryman Msikhikhovsky - Marcin Khubetskiy.  With his hands the <span>park</span> was erected <span>.</span>  <span>The gardener</span> devoted his life to his work and did not even get married.  He was buried in the estate. </p><p>  During perestroika, the estate was badly damaged by the actions of looters.  They took it apart in literal terms.  But something nevertheless remained and worthy of the attention of a tourist who wants to visit all the attractions of the Lugansk region. </p><h2>  Park of stone statues </h2><p>  The Museum of Polovtsian women or a monument of stone sculptures is considered one of the main attractions of Lugansk.  You can see the monument by visiting the Lugansk National University, in whose territory it is located.  The sculpture monument is a collection of stone statues of the 12th century. </p><p>  These sculptures were collected from all over the region, because this is a unique opportunity to see a huge number of antiquities in one place.  Initially, the sculptures were on the hills.  Legends say that they built their ancient peoples. </p><p>  The Park Museum will tell you about ancient heroes, gods, who were believed by past generations, as well as about the life of ancient peoples.  This is an amazing chance to open the door of the past and find out how the ancient disappeared people lived. </p><h2>  Lugansk nature reserve </h2>

    <p>  Rich in Lugansk land and monuments to famous personalities.  One of these is Prince Igor.  The monument was opened relatively recently, in 2003.  It is located in the small village of Stanichno-Lugansk.  A monument is dedicated to the 65th anniversary of the formation of the <span>Lugansk region.</span>  Why was Prince Igor chosen to commemorate this event?  It was from this steppe that his campaign began, described in the work "The Word about Igor's Regiment". </p><p>  The 14-meter high monument is made of concrete, covered with bronze paint on top.  It is mounted on an elevation, so it is difficult not to notice it.  The monument is a visiting card of Lugansk.  It symbolizes the valor, friendship and brotherhood of the Slavic people. </p><h2>  Monument to Bender </h2>

    <p>  The story of Ostap Bender and <span>Kisa Vorobyaninov</span> began precisely with the Luhansk region.  The city of Starobelsk of the Luhansk region is a prototype of Stargorod.  There, in 2008, a monument was erected to Ostap Bender.  Opposite the monument is a former female gymnasium.  Today it is one of the faculties of Lugansk National University. </p><p>  The authorship of the monument belongs to Andrei Borovoy.  This is not just a monument - it is a whole composition that displays a picture of the appearance of Bender in Stargorod and his communication with the homeless. </p><p>  The monument to Vorobyaninov is located in the same city, in the square, in front of the arch of the corner building of the main street.  The monument was opened in 2011. </p><h2>  Lugansk art museum </h2>

    <p>  The museum is located on Postal Street in Lugansk.  The museum building dates from the second half of the 19th century.  The house itself, in which the museum is located, belonged to the Venderovichs - famous industrialists. </p><p>  The museum was founded in 1920. A cultural monument appeared thanks to the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãUkrainian art historians Volsky and Istomin.  Exhibits for the museum were imported from all over Ukraine and neighboring countries.  Among them there is antique furniture, and objects of art, and kitchen utensils, and even products made of semiprecious metals. </p><p>  The museum went through several stages of its development.  At first it was a museum of painting, later - the Social Museum of Donbass.  Then it was transformed into a museum of local lore.  During the Second World War, most of the exhibits of the museum suffered. </p><p>  After the war, it was decided to create a museum of fine art in Lugansk.  At first it was mobile in nature, but in 1951 the museum was given its premises, and it began to be actively filled with exhibits. </p><p>  Such interesting places are famous for Lugansk and Lugansk region.  There is much more to tell about the region, whose history is rich in various events. </p><p>  The name of the city did not appear by chance.  The river Lugan flows through vast meadows.  She is a viviparous source for this earth.  The banks of this river began to be inhabited by people back in the Stone Age.  These were the first settlements that today turned into a whole regional center - Lugansk.  The city is famous for its industrial achievements.  Most of the factories and industrial enterprises of Eastern Ukraine are concentrated here.  The very emergence of the city began with the construction of an iron foundry on this land by decree of Catherine II.  The date of the decree is considered the official date of foundation of the city. </p><p>  It is worth a visit to the city of Lugansk.  Its attractions in the current conditions are not as accessible as before, but still something else can be seen. </p>
