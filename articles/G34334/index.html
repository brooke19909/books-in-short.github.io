  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chess: history, classic checkmate, checkmate in 2 moves</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Chess is a board game for those who wish to develop logical thinking.  Two people play it with special pieces on a board consisting of sixty-four cells, one half of which is black and the other white (in the classic version).  Chess is a combination of game, sport and art, which is why they are so popular today.  The whole gameplay comes down to putting the check to the opponent, that is, driving him into a dead end.  Chess art virtuosos know how to checkmate in 2 moves - and this is a sign of undoubted skill. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs impossible to believe it, but the age of the game so beloved by contemporaries is one and a half thousand years.  Of course, initially the rules of chess were different.  They varied depending on the region of distribution.  So, the game migrated from India, its historical homeland, to the Arab East, then to Africa and Europe.  By the fifteenth century, the canons of chess were almost formed, but the final standardization did not occur until the nineteenth century, when the first international tournaments began to take place. </p><h2>  Chess checkmate </h2><p>  The word "mat" in Arabic means "died."  This is the name of the chess position, in which the king‚Äôs figure has already been declared a check, and he has no way to escape.  The king at a dead end is the end of the game, and this is exactly what players strive for when playing chess.  In order to quickly beat an opponent, one should study various positions on a checkmate in 1 move, checkmate in 2 moves, and so on. </p><h2>  Mat for one move </h2><p>  This position is called classic.  Here the black king is put to a standstill, who does not have the opportunity to escape.  Cells c7, d7 and e7 are reliably protected by the white king, while cells c8 and e8 can be attacked by a white rook. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mat in 2 moves" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44268/1700066.jpg" width="372"></div>

    <h2>  Mat in 2 moves </h2><p>  This alignment is called "stupid," or "fool mate."  This position is considered the fastest of all possible layouts of chess games.  Players who know how to play it can "fool" their opponent and win a quick and easy victory.  So, how does a mate play out in 2 moves: </p><ol><li>  The player with white pieces places the pawn on the f3 square, the opponent responds with the pawn move to e5. </li><li>  The opponent makes the move g4, and his opponent puts a checkmate, pushing the queen to position h4. </li><li>  Checkmate! <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="checkmate in 2 turns of the task" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44268/1700098.jpg" width="372"></div></li></ol><h2>  Everything ingenious is simple </h2><p>  As it turned out, putting a "stupid checkmate" is not difficult.  However, in chess the main thing is not knowledge, but the ability to apply it.  Seeing the board and the confident expression on the opponent‚Äôs face, many are lost and cannot even put a simple mate in 2 moves.  The challenges abounded by online resources can help hone the skill of the game and gain many worthy victories. </p>
