Hotel "Azimut" 4 * (Adler): reviews, prices</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each person needs at least once a year to relax from work and worries.  His further activities depend on the quality of the vacation, on whether he was able to fully relax, relax and calm his nerves.  For most people, the best place to spend a vacation is the sea coast.  Pleasant climate, gentle sea, lushly flowering vegetation, fresh and slightly brackish air - all this contributes to relaxation, immersion in the atmosphere of bliss and peace.  Of course, recently, many Russians choose distant countries, warm seas for recreation.  However, our Black Sea resorts do not lose their relevance, especially after extra-class hotel complexes appeared in them, which in their organization are in no way inferior to the ‚Äúoverseas‚Äù ones.  So, for example, the hotel "Azimut 4 stars" (Adler) can compete with hotels in different countries of the world both in terms of its structure and the level of service provided.  But before proceeding with its description, I would like to conduct a small review of the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSochi, in particular Adler. </p>

    <h2>  The best Russian Black Sea resort </h2><p>  Why every year hundreds of thousands of tourists choose a <span>vacation in Sochi,</span> Adler and other nearby resort areas?  Firstly, one can find quite reasonable housing prices here, including in hotels (for example, the Azimut 4 * hotel (Adler)), and other services, and secondly, the southern air gate of the Russian Black Sea coast is located here thirdly, here you can not only have a wonderful rest on endless beaches, but also do wellness procedures, fourthly, these places are rich in various entertainments for every taste and budget.  Once Adler was considered an appendage of Sochi.  After all, it is only 24 km from it.  However, in recent years, it has emerged as a fully formed independent resort with a developed tourist infrastructure.  Its biggest plus is the duration of the beach season - 7 months.  However, in the winter months the flow of tourists does not dry out.  These months are the time to tackle the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="azimut hotel sochi" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/548200.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, the date of foundation of the town is still considered 1869.  By that time, no more than one hundred people lived on this cape.  During the First World War, the nobility began to come to the coast, in evacuation.  In this regard, guest houses, restaurants and other entertainment and trade establishments began to be built here.  In the Soviet period, localization was affected by these places, and the village gradually began to turn into a city with multi-storey buildings, large hotels and resorts.  This process does not stop to this day.  Each year, under the starry sky of Adler, thousands of lights of hotel-skyscrapers are lit.  So, by the new 2014, right before the opening of the Sochi Olympics, the Azimut Hotel Sochi hotel complex opened its doors to tourists.  At this resort, special attention is paid to arranging the beach.  After all, most vacationers come here precisely for a quality beach holiday, for water activities, sea mini-trips, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="azimuth hotel adler reviews" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/548210.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The beauty of landscapes </h2><p>  Lovers of natural beauties will especially like Adler.  In this respect, it is simply paradise.  No matter where you settle in the town, a magnificent landscape will open in front of you from the window of your temporary home - a panorama either of the Caucasus snow-capped ridges, or of the azure expanse of the sea, or of an emerald green forest belt.  Yes, the picture is truly magnificent!  By the way, no matter how strange it sounds, Adler is the most northern subtropical resort in the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  Those who are going to visit Adler for the first time, naturally, are interested in how to get there.  Annually, or rather, during the holiday season, a multithousand stream of cars of various brands, with license plates of almost all regions of our vast Motherland, and neighboring countries, is sent to the Black Sea resorts of Russia.  Yes, many tourists prefer to go to the seas in their own cars.  After all, this makes it possible to freely move along the coast in search of interesting sights and picturesque beaches.  However, the roads in these parts, although well-equipped, are not everyone‚Äôs strength to overcome the numerous serpentines.  After all, the path was laid among mountains and picturesque gorges.  Such tourists, of course, prefer to go to the sea coast either by air or by rail.  Since 1946, that is, immediately after the Second World War, an airport was built in the village of Adler - the only air gate of Greater Sochi and neighboring Abkhazia.  During the Winter Olympics 2014, the Adler Airport proved that it can operate at full strength and accept flights from all over the world.  So if you prefer comfort, then buy a ticket and fly to Adler.  By the way, a ticket from Moscow to Sochi costs about 5,500 rubles (both ways).  As a rule, the Azimut Hotel provides its guests with comfortable delivery from the airport terminal to the territory of the hotel complex.  At the same time, the transfer cost is from 1-2 thousand rubles, depending on the chosen transport option (car or minibus).  But the track ‚ÄúFormula 1‚Äù is located in 1.5 thousand kilometers.  From here it is quite convenient to get to the ski resorts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  General description of Azimut Hotels </h2><p>  This fashionable resort is owned by the Azimut chain.

However, by the beginning of the 2014 Olympics in this area, there was a need for the construction of premium hotels, and the brand owners decided to give Adler a complex of such a high level, with a magnificent park area, SPA center, beaches and entertainment facilities.  And the proximity to the Olympic Park added popularity to the hotel among Russians and guests from different countries who decided to come to Adler.  The Azimut Hotel, as already noted, was inaugurated in December 2013.  Its biggest advantage is its location on the first beach line in the <span>Imereti Bay.</span>  Indeed, many tourists who come to the coast choose complexes located in the immediate vicinity of the sea in order to relax to the measured sound of the surf, to enjoy its magnificent picture, etc.  Hotel Azimut occupies an area of ‚Äã‚Äã11 hectares.
