    <p>  The modern village has a well-developed tourist infrastructure, there are many entertainment venues.  For this reason, you are unlikely to have to live ‚Äúoff the beaten path‚Äù.  Guest houses (Dagomys) receive visitors, usually throughout the year.  The price of accommodation is formed according to the same criteria as on the entire coast: the cost of living is higher in houses located closer to the sea. </p><p>  The price reaches its peak in late July - early August.  In May, June, September, prices are more affordable, it is more profitable to rest at this time because there is not a large influx of spa residents, and the weather in these months is softer and more comfortable for a beach holiday.  Guest houses (Dagomys) are distinguished by cleanliness, well-groomed, benevolence and hospitality of the owners, proximity to the sea, affordable prices.  We will introduce you to some of them in this article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Amber" (Armavirskaya St., 16) </h2><p>  Guest House "Yantar" (Dagomys) is located in the center of the village, near the beach.

The gentle breeze from the mountains brings coolness and incredible aromas of herbs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="guest houses dagomys" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1576444.jpg" width="600"></div>
