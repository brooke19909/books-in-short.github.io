In 1827, stars were introduced to distinguish between ranks, which were attached to epaulettes.  Major General wore two stars on his epaulettes. </p><p>  The Chin was abolished in 1917 when the decree of the <span>Council of People's Commissars of the</span> RSFSR ‚ÄúOn the Equation of All Military Personnel in Rights‚Äù came into effect.  It was restored in 1940.  If a soldier or citizen has a military specialty of a legal profile, then the word "justice" is added;  medical profile, then - "medical service".  The word "stock" is added for those in stock;  the word "retired" - for someone who is retired. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="major general" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12625/230982.jpg" width="250"></div></h3><p>  According to the explanatory dictionary of the Russian language by S.
