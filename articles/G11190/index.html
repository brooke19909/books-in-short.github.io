If you wondered how to learn to take pictures, then you have already taken the first step in this direction.  Of course, it is very important to deal with your camera, find out what functions and features it has.  In addition, it‚Äôs important to have <span>creative thinking in</span> order to get successful shots <span>.</span> </p><p>  <strong>Some tips for taking beautiful shots</strong> </p><p>  If you want to learn <span>how to photograph</span> people <span>correctly</span> , first you will need to familiarize yourself with the basic principles of shooting. </p><p>  1. Often, especially when we go somewhere to relax, we want to photograph or, on the contrary, to be photographed on the background of some kind of attraction.  This desire is commendable, but it is important to make sure that later you want to look at the pictures and remember the pleasantly spent minutes.  Many people try to get as close to a known object as possible, while a person with a camera, on the contrary, is asked to move as far as possible, thinking that this way the picture will be the most advantageous.  But it's not right! </p><p>  And here a legitimate question should arise about how to photograph people correctly against the background of large objects.  Everything is not as complicated as it may seem.  In order for a person to fit in the frame, and on the background of what he wants to be photographed, you need to move away from the object to the one who is being shot and the one who does it.  And for a person to fit completely into the frame, the photographer needs to shoot him from the floor. </p><p>  2. In a situation where you need to capture an elongated object, it is better to position the camera vertically, but if the subject is wide, then horizontally. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  3. So that the frame does not look dark, you can not take pictures against a light source.  However, as with any rule, there is an exception to this.  In some cases, objects photographed opposite the light are unusually interesting.  But such frames are built on purpose.  In other cases, it is better to adhere to the above advice. </p><p>  <strong>How to photograph people?</strong> </p><p>  When shooting a person, all the above general rules must be taken into account.  But there are also a few more that need to be taken into account in a situation where a person becomes the subject of shooting. </p><p>  1. A common mistake can be called that when shooting outdoors, too much earth or sky gets into the frame.  Sometimes, of <span>course, it is</span> justified.  So, for example, if there is a lot of sky in the photo, then a person needs to be shot with his face raised up, and his gaze should be directed upwards, and not at the camera. </p><p>  2. In the case when the model has a growth lower than that of the photographer, the latter is better to shoot from a lower point.  So the figure of a person visually stretches somewhat upward. </p><p>  3. When shooting a person in a sitting position, it is better if he is located half a turn to the camera.  So the legs will not look more massive than they really are. </p><p>  4. In a situation where it is necessary to visually lighten the lower part of the face of the model, it is worth photographing it somewhat from above, and the face should look directly. </p><p>  5. Also, to get beautiful pictures with people, it is advisable to make sure that they are not tense, but, on the contrary, are relaxed and behave naturally. </p><p>  6. When shooting takes place in the dark, do not try to capture the background, focus on the main subject.  Since the flash is still only enough for a short distance. </p><p>  7. Often, for a beautiful portrait, it is better to blur the background.  To do this, you need to open a wider aperture - enough to sufficiently reduce the <span>depth of field.</span>  In this case, you will get a clear image of the face and a blurry background.  In this case, it is better to choose a more uniform background. </p><p>  8. A separate question is how to photograph people in groups correctly.  After all, often they differ in height.  If you are shooting objects to the waist, it is better to ask a tall person to crouch or, on the contrary, a low person to stand on some kind of elevation. </p><p>  After reading the rules above, you can understand how to photograph people.  And then you need to improve your skills in practice.  Only in this way can you learn to take pictures! </p>
