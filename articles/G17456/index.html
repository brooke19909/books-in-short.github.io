    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists from Russia and other CIS countries, the Yadis Djerba Golf Thalasso &amp; Spa 5 * hotel can be proud of its staff.  So, according to the guests, the hotel‚Äôs employees are doing everything to make travelers feel as comfortable as possible during their holidays.  Here you will always be greeted with a smile and make every effort to solve any problem.  True, our compatriots warn that the hotel staff practically do not speak Russian.  In English, the staff also speaks very mediocre.  However, almost all workers here are fluent in French and Italian.  But, as travelers note, since now more and more vacationers are coming from Russia and other countries of the former USSR to Tunisia, the staff will gradually master the Russian language, which will make the stay of guests at the hotel even more pleasant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yadis jerba golf thalasso spa" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1509084.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  As for the service in the hotel in question, the tourists had practically no complaints.  So, according to the guests, the cleaning of the rooms here is carried out every day and make it very quality.  Moreover, its quality is completely unaffected by the fact that you leave a tip to the maid or not.  Towels (both for the bathroom and the beach) are updated every day.  Maids change bedding several times a week.  So guests have no complaints about cleanliness here. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  Many tourists in their reviews are pleased to note the fact that, despite the fact that officially room keys are only issued to arriving guests after 14:00, this rule is often not followed.  Therefore, even if you arrive at the Yadis Djerba Golf Thalasso &amp; Spa 5 * hotel early in the morning, then most likely you will be able to check into the room almost immediately, without having to wait for the set hour. </p>

However, many say that local beers and wines are somewhat unusual for our compatriots.  There were no complaints about stronger drinks.  In addition, you can always ask the bartender to make you a cocktail to your taste. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  One of the main advantages of Yadis Djerba Golf Thalasso &amp; Spa 5 * (Tunisia, about Djerba), of course, is the presence of a large private beach.  Despite the fact that the hotel is located on the first line, the journey from the main building to the sea takes about five minutes at a leisurely pace.  The beach here is clean, with a fine pleasant snow-white sand.  The entrance to the sea is gentle, to the depth you need to go forty meters.  Therefore, it is quite safe to relax with children here.  Algae are found near the coast.  However, beach workers regularly cleanse them of water.  There is a bar on the beach where you can enjoy drinks and snacks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yadis djerba golf thalasso spa 5" class="if" height="271" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1509082.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  In general, according to tourists, this hotel is a great place for people who rely mainly on beach vacations.  Swimming in the sea and sunbathing can be combined with playing sports - playing golf, soccer, volleyball, archery, visiting the fitness center.  Also, guests really liked the large outdoor pool.  It has different depths, so it will be comfortable and safe here for both small children and poorly swimming people, and everyone else. </p><p>  As for animation, tourists from Russia have a number of complaints about its organization.  According to them, all the shows were of the same type and did not cause much excitement.  Evenings were impressed by the evenings of live music in one of the hotel bars. </p>
