The distance to the coast is approximately 250 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel club lella meriam 4 pics" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1482168.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has its own beach, equipped with sun loungers and parasols.  The shore has a sand cover, which is convenient for children.  There is also a hotel bar where you can refresh yourself with drinks.  On the coast you can go surfing and other water sports. </p><h2>  About the resort ... </h2><p>  Those who are going to visit Tunisia for the first time should learn a little about the place where the Lella Meriam Hotel Club (Zarzis) 4 * is located.  Zarzis is a small resort town in the south-east of the country.  It has become popular as a resort thanks to white sandy beaches, wild palm trees and a shimmering turquoise sea.  Zarzis is a good place where you can spend your entire vacation carefree, as well as get acquainted with the color of southern Tunisia. </p><p>  There are not many attractions in the town itself.  The most important of them are the shipyard and the archaeological museum, where you can see the main exhibits of the excavations.  Zarzis Harbor is a market trading place on Fridays.  There you can look at fishing schooners and ride on pirate ships built specifically for vacationers.  Tourists can also visit the Zarzis oasis, which grows 700,000 olive trees and 100,000 olive palm trees.  This oasis is of great economic importance not only for the city, but also for Tunisia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lella meriam hotel club zarzis 4 zarzis" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1482169.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As in other resorts of the country, in Zarzis you can buy souvenirs for relatives.  Most of them are represented by textiles and ceramics, which are much cheaper here than in other regions.  All goods produced in Tunisia are inexpensive (pistachios, local sweets, olive oil and much more). </p><p>  One of the advantages of Zarzis is the proximity of the town to the Sahara.  Local guides offer cross-country or camel rides in the desert.  Near the village there are Barbary settlements where you can see the life of nomads live. </p><p>  Zarzis is good for relaxing in the economy class.  Here you will not find fashionable hotels and expensive restaurants.  All hotels in the town are 3-4-star establishments, and local cafes prepare inexpensive and tasty dishes.  As for night entertainment, here they are not at all.  Those vacationers who seek to find a quiet and peaceful place for a vacation away from the hustle and bustle come to Zarzis. </p><h2>  Tours and attractions </h2><p>  If you relax in Zarzis and consider yourself an active tourist, then be sure to visit the island of Djerba.  It is not very popular among our compatriots, since our travel agencies more orient holidaymakers to Hammamet and Sousse.  Nevertheless, it is Djerba that is the tourist center of the whole country.  There is a huge number of hotels, mosques, museums, there is an ancient fortress and its own medina.  On the island you can visit the crocodile nursery and the ancient synagogue.  In addition, there are several diving centers on Djerba, which offer to see not only the underwater world, but also to see the sunken ships.  The island is full of vibrant nights at night, there are many nightclubs and discos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel lella meriam hotel club zarzis 4" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1482174.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On Djerba, real flamingo birds live, which you can see in their natural habitat, well, and animal lovers can go to the Phrygia zoo. </p><p>  In Zarzis itself and not far from it you can visit: </p><ol><li>  The country of Ksarov - villages and granaries of nomads in the heart of the desert. </li><li>  Sandy desert (Big Erg). </li><li>  Crater-shaped troglodytes houses surrounded by a network of underground rooms. </li><li>  Archaeological site of Gigtis. </li><li>  Gabes is a large oasis on the coast that has become famous for henna and the spice market. </li></ol><h2>  Hotel Club Lella Meriam 4 * (Zarzis): reviews </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, I would like to refer to the reviews of tourists who rested in this hotel.  In general, all vacationers are satisfied with Hotel Club Lella Meriam 4 * (Zarzis).  Reviews about this complex are mostly positive, which indicates its worthy level. </p><p>  First of all, I want to note the good territory of the hotel.  It is not too big, but well-groomed and green, there are many palm trees and flowers around.  The staff is constantly cleaning it. </p><p>  The rooms of the hotel complex, according to tourists, are very good.  The hotel has been operating for only three years, so it can be safely attributed to the young complexes.  The furniture in the apartment is solid, in some places there are scuffs, if you look too closely, but this is not so important.  Air conditioning and plumbing work properly.  Rooms at the hotel are cleaned by male workers, the quality of cleaning is a human factor.  Someone does it better, and someone worse.  But overall the rooms are clean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel club lella meriam 4 tunisia zarzis" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1482175.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  I would like to pay special attention to nutrition, as this is one of the most controversial issues in reviews of any hotel.  So, the buffet in the hotel corresponds to the four-star status of the hotel.  According to vacationers, breakfast does not differ in variety, although a quite standard set of dishes is served: yogurts, eggs, omelets, sausages, natural cheese, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãvegetables and fruits.  For dinner and lunch, the food is more varied, meat dishes and sweets are very tasty, of which there are a lot.  You can eat both in the main restaurant and in the √† la carte restaurant, which is no different.  It is necessary to register in advance at the reception, the waiter serves you there, but you need to pay for drinks, unlike the main institution. </p><p>  The hotel has a large swimming pool, divided into two parts.  It is cleaned once every few days.  Near it is a large recreation area with enough sunbeds.  Every day, animators conduct entertainment in and around the pool.  In the evenings, discos are organized here, a lot of Russian music.  Only here the repertoire of the local DJ is not very diverse. </p><p>  The hotel, as we have already mentioned, is not located on the first line, but on the second.  But at the same time go to the coast very close.  The beach of the complex is one of the best on the sandy coast.  A small problem in this area is algae that regularly appears in the water.  So the hotel staff, unlike other hotels, pulls them out and stacks them on the shore.  This does not interfere with swimming.  But they are not allowed to be exported, as this can cause coastal erosion.  The hotel's beach is well maintained, and the water is very clean and, of course, warm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lella meriam hotel club 4 reviews" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1482177.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  All hotels in Zarzis are built along the coast, and therefore some of them are located far from the city, like Lella Meriam Hotel Club 4 * (tourist reviews confirm this fact).  Tour operators are always silent about this.  You can take a taxi to get to the center of Zarzis.  Locals advise using machines with a counter, but they are difficult to find.  There are not many attractions in the town itself, so if you want to see something interesting, you need to book excursions with local guides.  Unfortunately, there is no way to get to interesting places on your own, they are all located either in the desert or in Djerba, so you have to use the services of companies.  In general, all excursions are very interesting, such as a jeep safari, from which tourists are always delighted, but a sightseeing trip to Djerba is too limited in time, so there is no way to carefully watch and take pictures on your own. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Lella Meriam Hotel Club 4 * is a good hotel in southeast Tunisia, which can be a great option for a vacation on the sea.  However, when purchasing a tour, one should take into account the moment that the complex is located in a quiet and calm town.  If you like an active nightlife or love to visit the sights, then perhaps you should look for a different place, since the local resort is focused on a quiet family vacation. <strong> </strong></p>
