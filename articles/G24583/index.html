a titan from ancient Greek mythology.</span>  <span>Examining written sources, some scholars hypothesized that the fire thief could be chained for his sin not to Elbrus, but to Big Utrish (the initial rock of the Caucasus Range).</span>  <span>Prometheus brought fire to people, for which he paid with his cruel punishment.</span>  <span>A predatory eagle (translated from the Adyghe language) - "Nyabedzhay" - pecked out the hero‚Äôs liver, subjected him to terrible agony.</span>  <span>From this word comes the name of the mountain.</span> </p><p>  <span>The Circassians were one of the most ancient inhabitants of these lands, and the valley owes their name and a beautiful legend to them.</span>  <span>Even then, pilgrims came here from afar.</span>  <span>Gradually, the coast of the Black Sea and the lands of the Caucasus began to inhabit other nations.</span>  <span>Most actively, this process began in the 19th century, after reunification with the Russian Empire.</span>  <span>Around the crystal clear springs, people built settlements, chapels and cultivated fields.</span>  <span>This land seemed favorable and even holy to them.</span> </p><p>  <span>But not all the time around the holy springs reigned an atmosphere of grace.</span>  <span>During the persecution of the Christian faith in the Soviet republics, the <span>glory of the</span> Neberjay <span>Valley</span> was violated.</span>  <span>The need to build a railway for the oil industry almost buried one of the main sources - the Holy Pen.</span>  <span>However, the water has broken its way up, and now the complex is completely restored.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holy pen" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45985/1564530.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Healing properties of water </h2><p>  <span>The picturesque nature of the complex and the purity of the springs has a scientifically proven beneficial effect.</span>  <span>The water of the Orthodox complex was investigated at the Pyatigorsk Research Institute of Balneology, where a conclusion was made about its healing properties.</span>  <span>An excursion to Neberdzhai, the Holy Springs, is suitable for people with diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, the initial stage of diabetes and just anyone who wants to improve overall well-being.</span>  <span>Water from the springs belongs to the mineral table and medical drinks.</span>  <span>It is saturated with silver ions, and this has a healing and regenerating effect for internal organs.</span> </p><h2>  Five sources - five saints </h2><p>  <span>In the Neberjay Valley, the holy sources of the complex have symbolic Christian names.</span>  <span>At the source of St. Nicholas, you can say a prayer to him, just like at the spring of John the Baptist, ask for health for yourself and your relatives.</span>  <span>Another spring bears the name of the supreme Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, who sacrificed their lives for the preaching of Christ's covenants.</span>  <span>The remaining two sources are named after the Holy <span>Great Martyr Barbara</span> and the Virgin, the latter is also called the ‚ÄúHoly Pen‚Äù.</span>  <span>It is also customary among the faithful to pray to the Great Martyr Barbara and the Mother of God in order to receive healing.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="neberjay holy sources" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45985/1564525.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Complex "Holy pen" </h2><p>  <span>The source of the name of the Blessed Virgin Mary suffered various disasters, but nevertheless by the forces of believers it became a famous center of pilgrimage.</span>  <span>Now several chapels have been built here, the necessary infrastructure for tourists has been created.</span>  <span>Attentive residents at one time discovered the similarity of the silhouette of the spring with a female hand, and this name was fixed.</span>  <span>Everyone can read the prayer to the Virgin and drink water from the spring, improve their health and let go of all the hardships of life, and receive peace.</span> </p>

    <p>  <span>In 2005, Patriarch Alexy honored the landmark with his visit, blessed this place.</span>  <span>It is amazing that when in 2012 a terrible element approached the <span>coast of Anapa</span> , the sea level rose, waterfalls flowed from the mountains to the springs, landslides began, the entire complex did not receive any damage.</span>  <span>As if some invisible hand saved this holy place from destruction.</span>  <span>Miracles do not stop here, each healer writes his story in a thank-you book, and over many years of such stories more than a dozen have gathered.</span>  <span>Believing Christians can also pray in Neberjaya in one of the chapels or take bath in the font, in which the temperature is always the same - 10 degrees.</span> </p>

    <p>  <span>For tourists in a private car from more distant areas who want to visit Neberdzhai, the Sacred Springs, it is better to specify the address using a map.</span>  <span>You should move along the highway Kursk - Novorossiysk, and in the direction of the sources on the road you can find a sign that says "Holy pen".</span>  <span>On the way from Novorossiysk there is no sign, so you should turn right to the village of Neberdzhaevskaya.</span>  <span>Drive 3 km straight, then, without turning into the village, turn from the main road to the left.</span>  <span>Another 15 km along a straight road - and you are at your destination.</span>  <span>Have a nice trip!</span> </p>
