Against the background of universally developing technologies, this niche could not maintain its former appearance, which attracted the attention of new fans of amateur piloting.  Four-propeller drones are especially popular.  As a rule, these are devices with a simple design and simple control, but, thanks to an optimized filling, their functional abilities have noticeably increased.  It is enough to note the possibilities of photo and video shooting.  On the market, this device is presented in various versions.  There are options in which emphasis is placed on aerodynamic abilities, and there are practical models that can be used to solve specific problems of researching the terrain, etc. Of course, the range of models is not limited to these devices, so you should make a wider overview of mini quadrocopters for choosing the best option. </p><h2>  Key Features of Mini Quadrocopters </h2>

    <p>  First of all, experts in such technology pay attention to the duration of the flight of drones.  This indicator can vary from 3 to 10 minutes.  Of course, compared to more massive devices, this time seems excessively short, but the user is dealing with a compact and very convenient device.  The second important point concerns the distance over which the remote control acts.  Here, indicators are also not spoiled - a standard mini quadrocopter maintains communication at a distance of 40-50 m. At the same time, there are drones that can be controlled both at 20 m and at 80 m - this is the maximum range.  The next important characteristic is charging time.  It can be up to 1 hour, but in most cases varies in the range of 30-40 minutes.  And another significant parameter is the dimensions.  There are no strict boundaries for the segment of mini-copters, so the sizes can vary greatly.  For example, there are models with approximate parameters of 4x4x2.5 cm, and there are twice as many devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Functionality and capabilities of video shooting </h2>

    <p>  Copters, of course, are high-tech devices, so the range of functions in them is constantly expanding.  Of the recent additions, it is worth highlighting the presence of an accelerometer and a gyroscope, several modes of high-speed rotation of screws, axial stabilization and the ability to perform 3D tricks.  The most attractive option is considered to be a video camera, with which the user can fix the "picture", available for viewing by the drone itself.  Of course, a high-quality image and video material with excellent resolution will not provide a mini quadrocopter with a camera, but there are certain shifts in this direction.  Representatives of the initial class are still equipped with 0.3 megapixel modules, but in older versions, cameras of 2 megapixels or more are increasingly appearing.  There are also attempts to realize the possibility of live broadcasting, but in this case, the dimensions of the copter also increase. </p><h2>  Model Hubsan X4 </h2>

    <p>  It‚Äôs worth starting the review with the inexpensive but functional Hubsan X4 drone.  The model has a medium-capacity LiPo-battery, which supports the activity of the device for 7-10 minutes.  The model‚Äôs equipment includes an SDHC memory card, brushless motors and a video camera.  True, belonging to the younger group still left its mark on the capabilities of the camera - its matrix has only 0.3 megapixels.  But the mini quadrocopter works on the control panel with four channels and a liquid crystal display.  The user can adjust the normal and professional flight modes.  The range of the device is 50 m. This is not the most outstanding result even for the initial level, but, as users note, the communication between the remote and the copter is realized stably and with good noise immunity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, the owners of this device note low power consumption.  As for the reliability of the case itself, it is reliably protected by strong, but lightweight materials - practice shows that it is able to withstand both falls and collisions without serious consequences for the filling. </p><h2>  Model Cheerson CX-10 </h2><p>  The device represents the initial level of mini-copters in terms of size.  But in terms of functionality, it is able to compete with larger-sized drones.  For the flight characteristics of the CX-10, a six-axis gyroscope is responsible, the function of which is supported by a four-channel control panel.  Although the battery capacity in this case is only 100 mAh, the device is able to stay in air for 8 minutes.  In this case, the communication reception radius reaches 50 m. As for user feedback, the Cheerson mini quadrocopter causes more positive impressions.  It effectively manifests itself both indoors and outdoors.  But here it is important to take into account objective operating factors - small sizes do not contribute to the safety of the device during flights outside the home.  Therefore, this model of a mini-copter is recommended to be used indoors, especially if it is planned to perform various feints. </p><h2>  Model Blade Nano QX </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This option is suitable for beginners.  This is a small, even by the standards of a mini-copter, apparatus, the hallmark of which is the Safe option, which allows to maintain stability and maneuverability through the sensor sensors of the controller.  However, in terms of characteristics, this model of the drone is not so impressive.  Performance is provided by a 150 mAh LiPo battery, which allows you to use the mini quadrocopter in flight for 8 minutes.  The engine is represented by a brushless device with a hollow core, which, however, gives the model a very decent maneuverability - as users say, Nano QX can be subjected to coups without fear of losing control.  Also, many owners of the device praise its ability to hang in place - for this you need to lower the levers on the four-channel control panel.  It is recommended to use this opportunity not only for entertainment, but also in difficult situations when you need to quickly make decisions about responsible maneuvers. </p><h2>  Model Happy Sun X6 </h2><p>  Many users criticize the creators of this copter model for duplicating Hubsan products.  However, in this case, there are significant differences.  But first, it is worth noting the general similarities.  In particular, equipment with a frequency of 2.4 GHz is used, which reliably protects against interference, as well as a four-channel control panel.  The difference lies in the very modest dimensions of the X6 - in essence, this is a pocket quadrocopter.  The mini-device at the same time provides good operating capabilities.  According to the owners of the device, this is a sensitive drone that is capable of performing any tricks both indoors and outdoors.  The ability to operate the model on a single charge for 10 minutes adds to it advantages over more massive competitors. </p><h2>  Model Syma X12 </h2>

    <p>  Another representative of the class of miniature quadrocopters, which at the same time differs in a rather strong case.  Appearance also attracts with its original design - users note the presence of red and green indicators based on LED lamps.  A white indication is also provided in the front part, thanks to which it is possible to recognize the sides of the device during the flight.  However, the technical and operational characteristics of the X12 are quite average.  This mini quadrocopter can stay in the air for 5-6 minutes, and it takes about an hour to charge.  In any case, the users themselves are talking about such data.  But these shortcomings are partly offset by a wide package, which includes a set of propellers, a USB cable and a screwdriver. </p><h2>  Best options </h2><p>  It is difficult to single out the best option, since each device has its own pros and cons.  If we approach the assessment of performance and operational capabilities together, the Hubsan X4 version may become the leader.  First of all, this drone is allocated with a capacious battery, thanks to which the drone is able to be in the air for up to 10 minutes.  In addition, it is the best mini quadrocopter in terms of functional additions.  This is evidenced by the presence of a camera, and quite good opportunities for adjusting flight modes.  A good contender for leadership is Nano QX.  For a sophisticated drone enthusiast, this model may seem uninteresting, but for a beginner, it is attractive for its reliability, ease of operation and good performance. </p><h2>  How to make a mini quadrocopter do it yourself? </h2>

    <p>  It should be noted right away that it is unlikely that it will be possible to assemble such an apparatus without at least basic knowledge of radio engineering.  If you have the necessary skills, you need to stock up on a copter frame, a controller, propeller elements, a motor, propellers and an engine regulator.  You will also need a soldering iron and a set of miniature screwdrivers.  The entire assembly procedure consists of several stages.  To understand how to construct a <span>mini-quadrocopter with your own hands, it</span> will not be superfluous to refer to the schemes of branded devices.  First of all, the frame is assembled to which the hardware components are attached - its basis is the controller board.  Next, the most crucial stage is performed - wiring, for which supporting plates should be used.  After that, the motor complex, the screw part and auxiliary accessories are fixed. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  There are a lot of different types of radio-controlled devices on the market.  In turn, quadrocopters noticeably stand out against the general background due to a number of unique advantages.  It is enough to note the operation of the four screws, which is controlled by the user.  And flights of mini-copters are especially attractive, the modest sizes of which allow using them even in a small room without external interference. </p>
