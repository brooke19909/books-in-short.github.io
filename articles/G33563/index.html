Weather in Tunisia in November</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tunis is truly unique and very attractive country.  In November, the beach season in this region of North Africa officially closes, but this does not mean at all that you cannot go here for new experiences and a whole host of spa treatments.  Just because the temperature in November in Tunisia drops very much compared to the summer months, prices are reduced for everything from plane tickets to wellness treatments and meals.  Therefore, now we will consider in detail what can be done in this late autumn period in this exotic Arab country. </p><h2>  Briefly about Tunisia itself </h2><p>  Tunisia is a small state located in North Africa, between Libya and Algeria.  During the existence and prosperity of the Roman Empire, Carthage, a city-state that waged constant wars with the Romans, referred to in the history of the Punic, was located on these lands.  Later, in the 19th century, after an Arab ethnic group with its traditions, religion and other characteristics had already formed on the territory of this power, the French came here.  For a long time, these European people ruled here, due to which the traditions of East and West are tightly mixed.  Today, thanks to all these historical events, on the territory of the state you can find both unique ancient mosques and colonial buildings made in a purely European spirit, both the long golden dunes of the local deserts and the ruins of the terms that the Romans and Carthaginians erected here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia in November" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/483706.jpg" width="600"></div>

In the last <span>autumn month,</span> air and water temperatures decrease, winds rise, and humidity level rises.  Of course, you can spend a few sunny days here, sunbathe, and even plunge a little into the sea, however, the weather will not please you every day.  On average, the air temperature rises to 25 degrees, the sea does not heat up by more than 20. Very high humidity, due to which heavy rains can occur, which sometimes drag on for a whole day.  A vacation in Tunisia in November is ideal for windsurfers, as well as for walruses.  Fans of this sport claim that you can catch very high waves here, but they warn that if you are afraid of the cold, you need to stock up on a special suit. </p>

    <h2>  Features of the local climate </h2><p>  As diverse as the culture of this country is, the weather is not the same here.  Tunisia, although small, but lies in two climatic zones.  Subtropical, Mediterranean, typical of northern cities.  It is always cold and windy here in autumn, because tourists who come here prefer spa treatments and excursions to famous places.  The southern cities of the country, which are located in the bay, are more sunny and welcoming.  Our compatriots having a rest in this region assure us that sometimes you can even swim in the calm sea in the autumn, sunbathe, enjoy the velvet season.  The local climate is tropical and very dry, as the desert is located very close by.  It is from the southern starting points, such as the island of Djerba, Zarzis and Gabes, that jeep safari is sent, as well as camel rides through the local gold dunes, which Russian tourists like so much because of their exoticism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in tunisia in november" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/483695.jpg" width="600"></div>

The reviews of tourists who have been here can tell us about the best routes that can be made within this country.  Mostly, everyone is advised to go to ancient Carthage first.  There are preserved ancient temples, amphitheaters, aqueducts, and even thermae.  The most famous amphitheater in the city is considered to be El Jem, which amazes with its size and splendor.  Slavs lived in its basements in those days, and today you can walk around these places.  On the top floor there is an observation deck with beautiful views of the city and the countryside.  Also in Carthage are monuments to three Roman deities - Jupiter, Juno and Minevre.  Well, not far from Carthage is another ancient city - Dugga, where the beautiful temple of Juno Celeste stands.  As for the sights of the capital of the country - the city of Tunisia, then two magnificent palaces were built here - Dar al-Beiy and Dar-bin-Abdallah. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temperature in november in tunisia" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/483700.jpg" width="280"></div>

    <h2>  November shopping </h2><p>  Most tourists are attracted by the fact that Tunisia in November is a place where you can very cheaply not only relax, but also stint stardom.  It was during this period that in almost all regions of the country, mass gatherings of dates, olives, eucalyptus and various tropical fruits take place.  All of them are brought to local markets, and sold to those who wish for almost a pittance.  Next to them you can find various trinkets, jewelry and home accessories, made in the Arabic style.  Well, fans of traditional shopping can always go to one of the gigantic local markets that are located in European cities of the country.  Low prices for branded clothes and shoes are another asset that Tunisia was characterized in November.  The reviews of people who shopped here say that every thing is no worse than the goods that can be purchased in expensive boutiques in Paris, Milan and other European cities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather tunisia" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/483698.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  SPA country, meet vacationers </h2><p>  Tunisia is one of those countries in which thalassotherapy is the most developed and widespread service.  Local doctors and cosmetologists have long learned how to skillfully use the gifts of the local sea, underground minerals and other natural assets.  They became the basis for natural cosmetics, which allows you to rejuvenate, recover from various ailments of the skin and the body as a whole, or simply put yourself in order after a series of stressful everyday life.  The time you spend in local SPA salons can be almost unlimited, since prices at the end of autumn here fall to a minimum. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, Tunisia in November is not a typical summer resort.  Here, although there are palm trees, the sea, long beaches and expensive hotels, the weather at the beginning of winter becomes quite cool.  Therefore, being satisfied only with the warmth and light breeze, you can go to explore both the local architectural sights and the wonders of African nature. </p>
