About what is the minimum <span>insurance</span> period <span>for OSAGO</span> in 2015, will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Categories for insurance </h2><p>  There are several categories of car owners that must be insured under different conditions.  So, for example, owners of vehicles that have registered their car outside the Russian Federation buy an insurance policy for a period of five to fifteen days.  You can also purchase insurance for a longer period - up to twenty days.  This requirement applies only to those drivers who follow transit and are sent to the place of permanent registration, or to undergo a mandatory technical inspection of the vehicle.  Those who have registered vehicles in Russia have a minimum <span>MTPL insurance</span> period of one year.  If in the recent past it was possible to insure your <span>motor civil liability for</span> at least six months, then in 2015 this can no longer be done. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="minimum insurance period" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/843199.jpg" width="600"></div>

First of all, this is the car itself.  Next, the price of the policy of the region where the car is registered is considered.  After that, the car owner must indicate in the contract the period in which he plans to use the vehicle.  However, it should be remembered that when specifying a period of, for example, ten months, the price will be calculated as one year.  Therefore, regardless of the minimum term for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, the cost of a third-party liability insurance policy cannot be paid in installments; this is not provided for by the insurer.  That is why, in order to save money, drivers come up with various tricks, if only to reduce the cost of the policy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="minimum insurance period for OSAGO Rosgosstrakh" class="if" height="245" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/843200.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  How to insure a vehicle </h2><p>  All that needs to be done in order to purchase a contract for vehicles for the minimum insurance period for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance is to contact a company that provides such services.  Today, there is a large selection of organizations ready to serve their customers at the highest level and at affordable rates.  The main thing is that they will not shy away from purchasing compulsory policies so that there are no problems in the future, especially in the event of a traffic accident.  If after the accident the fact that the guilty party does not have a compulsory insurance policy is revealed, then, in addition to recovering the damage to the victim himself, he will also pay a heavy fine for the lack of this document. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the minimum insurance period for liability insurance" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/843201.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  For example, if in winter a person does not use his car, then, of course, he does not need to overpay for several months. </p><p>  There are motorists who drive only three months a year.  Thus, the driving experience is growing, the coefficient of accident-free driving is falling, and the age of the owner of the car also becomes older than twenty-two years.  The calculation coefficient for three months will be lower than for the whole year, so be sure to indicate the period of use of the vehicle. </p><p>  Having collected all these data, the insurance manager will be able to make a small discount to such drivers for a minimum MTPL insurance period.  Some companies, trying to earn as much as possible, also include life insurance in the policy.  Therefore, before signing the contract, it is necessary to check with the agent what is included in the services.  If there is no need for additional services, then it is better to refuse them and not overpay, but then you will need to wait a little more than a month for registration for the minimum term of compulsory motor liability insurance.  Rosgosstrakh, for example, having an excellent reputation, sells policies without any additional premiums.  Therefore, when the insurance expires, you can turn to a reliable organization and calmly drive your car for another year. </p>
