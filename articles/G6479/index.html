Of course, the well-known criterion of price-quality plays an important role (and we will talk about it below).  The cost of the tour for 8 days and 7 nights for one vacationer with accommodation in a double room is at least 406 ‚Ç¨.  This is half board (HB, i.e. breakfast and dinner), all inclusive, the price of a full board is 500 ‚Ç¨.  Which of them to choose?  According to the reviews of spa guests, it is more profitable to take a <span>full board.</span>  Half board will cost more in the end.  In addition to the absence of lunch, HB does not include drinks for dinner.  It is necessary for guests vacationing on half board in Oceanis 3 * to buy separately cash tea, coffee, cola for 2 ‚Ç¨, mineral water, alcohol.

    <p>  However, there are other factors in choosing a tour to Crete.  With them we and we will begin our story.  Of course, any tourist, having decided to go to open a new world, is trying to maximize the natural potential of the chosen corner of the Earth.  So we ask ourselves: ‚ÄúWhen and where is it better to relax in Cyprus?‚Äù </p><h2>  Holiday Season </h2><p>  Some vacationers, having decided on a trip in the summer and choosing a boarding house on the south coast of the island for their vacation, are perplexed: ‚ÄúHow is it - in the Mediterranean, not only can there be summer heat at 35-40 <sup>0</sup> C, but, most surprisingly, the climate can be dry ? "  The fact is that, despite its relatively small size (island after all), Crete has two climatic zones - the southern one, defined by winds blowing from the Sahara and the northern, classically Mediterranean, fenced off by mountains.  In the south of the island, due to dry and hot winds, air temperatures of 35-40 <sup>0</sup> C are not uncommon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Note that the Hotel Oceanis 3 * is located just on the northern coast of the island, which has a classic Mediterranean climate. </p><p>  On the other hand, deciding not only to relax, but also to travel (and the excursions here are very interesting), it is useful to get acquainted with the temperature regime optimal for a resident of moderate latitudes (see table 1). </p><p>  <em>Table 1. Weather in Crete</em> </p>

    <p>  If we also take into account the price factor, it turns out that it is best to fly to the island in September-October, in the velvet season.  The main influx of tourists, like prices, is falling by this time, the sea is warm, although sunbathing should be at the height of the day, and not in the morning and evening.  Hotel Oceanis 3 * will be able to provide you with a relaxing stay and quality guest house at reasonable prices.  Not far from the hotel there is the city of Heraklion, most interesting for excursions, the world famous Anissaras beach, the beaches of Falasarna and Frangokastello (where the ancient castle flaunts).  The remains of the Minoan civilization await tourists near the town of Rethymnon, the unforgettably clear Lake Kournas - at the foot of the White Mountains.  However, we will move in our story from external factors to the Oceanis 3 * hotel itself (Crete). </p><h2>  Location and hotel name </h2><p>  The hotel complex was built directly in the village of Anissaras, two kilometers from the resort town of Hersonissos.  However, in advertising brochures it is more often correlated with the more famous city of Heraklion, located 25 kilometers from the hotel.  It is characteristic that in the tourism business the same hotel has three names, and this can cause confusion.  Let‚Äôs explain the situation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Its territory has long been capitalized and equipped with chic hotel beaches and hotels, therefore it is perceived by the Cypriots themselves as the standard of a successful provincial resort business.  Therefore, in fact, the hotel is correctly called Oceanis 3 * (Crete, Anissaras).

    <p>  On the other hand, the city of Hersonissos, specializing in youth resort infrastructure, provides many visitors to a quiet provincial three-star hotel with their leisure opportunities.  Young people, choosing a vacation destination for themselves, often focus on Hersonissos, where nightlife boils up to 6-7 a.m.  Night clubs are actively working here, among which Status Club, Camelot, Tiger, Bio Bio are popular (the latter is for older visitors).  Perhaps that is why the hotel is called Oceanis Hersonissos 3 *.  Reviews indicate that the hotel itself provides a solid and affordable guesthouse to its guests.  And they actively travel, including renting a car. </p><p>  The third name of the hotel is associated with the city of Heraklion, which is one of the brands of Crete.  It is for the health resort ‚Äúliterate‚Äù, that is, theoretically prepared for their tour to Crete.  They are attracted by a trip to this recognized capital of Crete, which at the same time is an ancient city and a comfortable resort.  For them, he is Oceanis 3 * (Heraklion).  Meanwhile, travel sites and guides use any of the three aforementioned names. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Directly about the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel consists of two buildings, built in 1983 and renovated in 2009. This hotel complex consists of a main building with an elevator and two additional buildings.  The buildings - four-story snow-white buildings - are architecturally given the Art Nouveau style thanks to the semicircular arches above the loggias, the modernist arrangement of balconies.  It is surrounded by greenery: stylish neat lawns, two types of palm trees and olive trees give the guests an atmosphere of peace and contribute to exercise.  On the territory of the Oceanis 3 * hotel (Greece) there are two outdoor pools: a children's and an adult.  Adult - large enough, suitable for swimming, and for playing polo.  In the daytime, there is a bar next to it, where, in addition to drinks, you can have a meal with Greek dishes. </p><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  The hotel has 129 rooms.  The design of the hotel complex involves three types of rooms.  Standard is designed for two to three vacationers.  It offers garden views.  Family suites provide relaxation for four to five vacationers.  They have a larger area than standart, and are located more favorably: from their windows you can observe the sea landscape.  The third type of room Oceanis 3 * (Greece) is single, however, two people settle there. </p><p>  Various suites of the hotel are landscaped as standard.  They have a bathroom, a balcony, household appliances necessary for a good rest: a TV, a telephone, a hairdryer, a refrigerator, air conditioning (the last two are for an additional fee. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>

    <p>  An even more convenient option is to get to know the beauties of the island with a car rental service.  If you take a car in the rental office of Hersonissos, then a middle-class car will cost 100 ‚Ç¨ for three days.  The same service from the hotel will cost much more. </p><p>  Using a car and armed with sightseeing materials and maps, you will save real money.  The fact is that excursions around the island are traditionally overpriced.  Excursion bureaus only deliver tourists to the facility.  And then each guide will have to pay further - this is how Greece earns on the tourist industry.  Hotel Oceanis 3 * also offers tours, but they are significantly more expensive.  If you buy them in Hersonissos according to the average Greek tariffs, then the average excursion will cost 50 ‚Ç¨ per adult and 25 ‚Ç¨ - per child.  Calculate for yourself how much you can save on a rented car. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Guests of Crete have the opportunity to choose for themselves numerous excursions.  The central one is a visit to the remains of the Knossos Palace, built during the Minoan civilization in ancient times.  It existed one and a half thousand years: from 2600 BC.  e.  1100 BC  e.  Thus, the ruins of this castle are three thousand years old!  Its territory stores places associated with Princess Ariadne, <span>King Minos</span> and the hero Theseus. </p>

This amazing city has interesting architecture, it was founded on the territory of Greece, then it was conquered by Arabs, Byzantines, Venetians, Turks.  And finally, in 1913 he was again returned to Greece.  The architecture of all these countries left its mark on it.

    <p>  Visiting the Lassi Plateau is also interesting for tourists; its picturesque landscapes with <span>windmills are</span> remembered <span>.</span>  Here, in the midlands, is one of the most beautiful caves in the world - the cave of Zeus, its <span>stalactites and stalagmites are</span> impressive.  According to legend, in a small pond located in a cave, God was bathed after birth.  The stalactites hanging over this reservoir are called the mantles of Zeus. </p><p>  Guests of the island should definitely see Palm Paradise, located at the town of Wai.  The amazing nature of this corner is protected by a special European eco-program.  The local palm grove and the white sand of the beaches are amazing! </p><p>  An unforgettable boat trip to the ancient Venetian fortress of Spinalonga.  This structure held the defense for another 50 years after the conquest of the rest of Crete by the Turks.  On a small ship, tourists go to him along the bay of the Aegean Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãMirabello.  On the way, tourists visit the legendary Lake Voulismeni, where, according to legend, the goddesses Artemis and Athena bathed, the classic folk fishing village of Eloundou. </p><p>  Children will be interested in visiting the Water City water park, which is located between Heraklion and Hersonissos.  In addition to all kinds of water slides, divided into three categories - for adults, for adolescents and for young children, fascinating attractions are also equipped here.  Among them, the River for Lazybones, the pool with artificial waves, the Black Pipe, and Kamikaze are especially popular.  Adults will enjoy the spa and hydromassage. </p><p>  There is a wonderful route for lovers of outdoor activities.  The largest gorge in Europe Samaria stretches for 17 kilometers.  A 6-hour tour does not scare away hiking enthusiasts.  By the way, this is the second most visited object of the island.  From ancient times, people erected ritual structures in the gorge.  The Greeks built an altar to Apollon here, the Byzantines - small churches, the early Christians arranged their burials. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Those who like to combine shopping and boarding holidays go to Crete in the holiday season, starting in July.  At this time, the markdown of summer collections begins.  Discounts (ŒïŒ∫œÄœÑœâœÉŒµŒπœÇ) in July start at 20%, and in the velvet season in September, lucky customers find discounts up to 70%.  However, there are few such enthusiasts at the Oceanis 3 * hotel (Anissaras), its visitors prefer sightseeing tours.  Moreover, the prices in Crete are no lower than in Moscow. </p><h2>  What do the motivated guests of Crete buy for themselves? </h2>

The most popular fur salons are ‚ÄúVoss‚Äù, ‚ÄúAlexandro Bosso‚Äù.  Prices in the latter are lower.  Moreover, this product, as we have already mentioned, even in comparison with Moscow is far from being so cheap.  For example, the price <span>of a goat‚Äôs fur coat</span> starts at 500 ‚Ç¨, from a mink - from 2800 ‚Ç¨.  Really relevant coat of fashionable design costs 4,5 thousand ‚Ç¨.  Fur coats are sewn in the factories of northern Greece.

    <p>  It is more profitable to buy weaving products of local crafts in mountain villages.  For example, an original embroidered linen napkin can be bought there for 10 ‚Ç¨, while its price in the city is 15 ‚Ç¨. </p><p>  Those who wish to buy Crete handmade jewelry - in the city of Chania, in the stores "Katerina Garofalaki" and "Creta Gold."  These shops are also recommended by visitors to the Oceanis 3 * hotel (Crete).  Their reviews do not indicate low prices, but the amazing quality of the products.  Some ladies write that they found in the above jewelry stores those jewelry that they had long been looking for and wanted to buy. </p><h2>  What tourists buy for souvenirs </h2><p>  An extremely short shopping guide for a newcomer to Heraklion can be written in three sentences.  Brand boutiques are sold in boutiques on Delalu Street.  Souvenir lovers prefer merchants from 1866 Street.  On the same street is the central market of Heraklion. </p><p>  To buy yourself a relatively inexpensive, but memorable souvenir, you can opt for vases and figurines made by local artisans depicting the heroes of an ancient Greek epic.  A good option is handicrafts made of fabrics: tablecloths, napkins, curtains. </p><p>  Most often, as a souvenir, holidaymakers buy such foods as olive oil, pickled olives of the calamate variety, olives, Halumi cheese, Cypriot lucanic sausages with coriander, rakia grape vodka, ouzo anise vodka, <span>Metaxa cognac.</span> </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Crete brought together a wonderful beach holiday and exciting excursions.  This is the oldest European resort with centuries-old infrastructure.  Therefore, tours to the island are always popular.  The benevolence and hospitality of the locals are amazing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oceanis 3 anissaras" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/495974.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  To come on a tour to Crete and spend the whole rest without leaving the hotel territory?  Such a formulation of the question can only cause bewilderment.  Therefore, three-star hotels, like the Oceanis 3 * hotel, providing high-quality basic services, are in demand.  Tourists save by choosing for their tour is not a five-star service.  But, being at the hotel, they spend money on car rental and excursions. </p><p> Unlike countries whose only wealth is a paradise climate, this largest Greek island is one of the centers of European civilization.  A decent standard of living for the Cretans is the reason for the low crime rate.  Therefore, tourists have almost nothing to fear outside the walls of their hotel.  They freely use rental cars, traveling around the island.  And, to the honor of the islanders, they greet guests with a smile, always ready to help and answer questions. </p>
