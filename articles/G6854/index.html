The Second World War caused terrible destruction to the country, most of the cities lay in ruins.  The buildings restored after the war are almost all built in the style of Stalinism. </p><p>  Modern <noindex>  <span>chisinau hotels</span> </noindex>  and other cities of the country offer decent service and living conditions. </p><p>  The country is beautiful and picturesque.  Moldova's vineyards are considered one of the best on the European continent. </p><h2>  Kishinev </h2><p>  The capital of the country is Chisinau, or the “White City”.  It is called so because white limestone was used to build houses of past times.  In Chisinau, freely spread over 7 hills, a lot of greenery.  There are many war memorials in the capital, and M. Eminescu and Pushkin, who lived in the city during the exile, should be allocated from the monuments.  All city parks have their own layout, they are beautiful and picturesque. </p><p>  A lake located in a city of artificial origin.  Walking along its shores, you can go to the Open Green Theater and visit the Exhibition of Achievements.  In the area of ​​the old city, three ancient churches have survived - the Annunciation, Ryshkanovskaya, and also Mazarakievskaya. </p><h2>  Vineyards </h2><p>  The climate of the country, warm and dry, contributes to the development of viticulture and fruit growing on an industrial scale.  Moldova is both vineyards and winemakers.  After driving 15 km north of the capital, you will find yourself in Cricov, where all the “wine tours” begin.  It is in this city that the world's largest wine cellar is located.  This is a real city underground, and the labyrinths of its streets stretch more than sixty kilometers.  Each street is given a name of a certain type of wine, so choose what you like best - ul.  Cabernet or Isabella Boulevard. </p><p>  Having driven fifteen kilometers east from Cricova, you will find yourself in the city of Koszna.  In addition to wines, both white and red, they also produce port and traditional vodka.  Sparkling white wines are produced in the Straseni vineyard, which lies northwest of the capital at a distance of 30 kilometers.  Of course, tasting wine in Moldova is not exactly what tasting wine in ancient castles of France.  But the wines produced in this country are also worthy of your attention, and their bouquet and aroma are distinguished by a peculiar taste. </p><p>  After visiting the vineyard, go to the monastery built in the 14th century, which managed to survive in the Soviet era.  It is only 7 km southwest of Straseni.  The monastery consists of three churches built in different eras. </p><p>  If you intend to travel to any foreign country, book <noindex>  <span>hotel oxford rimini</span> </noindex>  , City Center Apartments (Chisinau) or Exe Iris Congress (Prague) can be accessed via the Internet.  This will save you from unnecessary trouble. </p></div></article>
