  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Middle Kingdom: History, Characteristics, and Interesting Facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The millennia-old history of Egypt is usually divided into certain periods, such as the Prehistoric period, Pre-Dynastic Egypt, the Early Kingdom, the Ancient Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, the New Kingdom, and the Later Kingdom. </p><p>  Each of these chronological segments has its own specific features.  The period of the Ancient Kingdom ended with the collapse of the country into semi-independent regions.  But this does not mean that the story ended.  A new round of development of Egyptian society, known as the era of the Middle Kingdom (2040-1783 BC), was coming.  About what she remembered, what features she had, can be found in this article. </p><h2>  Chaos and devastation </h2><p>  The fragmentation of the once mighty Ancient Egypt affected all spheres of life.  The irrigation system was the first to suffer.  Egypt has always been dependent on the whims of the Nile.  When the canals became clogged, there was a famine that drove people to despair.  Monstrous information about cannibalism has reached our days.  This is not accidental: after all, along with the destruction of the distribution of water, the well-proven state grain storage program, designed for crop failure, was also destroyed. </p><p>  The possibilities of the nobles of that period became more than modest.  This is clearly seen from the preserved tombs.  Although they are erected locally, the tombs of the local semi-independent nomarchs cannot boast of luxury.  The period between the eras of the Ancient and Middle kingdoms is perhaps one of the most mysterious in the history of Egypt.  One can only guess about all the violence that happened then: the riots, their suppression, "squabble" between the neighbors in an attempt to take control of the territory they liked. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.metmuseum.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="middle kingdom" class="if uuid-2516106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2516106.jpg"></div><h2>  Collecting splinters </h2><p>  Two centers of power claimed the role of the unifier of scattered lands: the cities of Thebes and Heracleopol.  As a result of a fierce struggle, the Theban nomarch Mentuhotep II emerged victorious.  The power of the pharaoh was overthrown and Heracleopol obeyed. </p><p>  There was a lot of work and the first thing that the country's leadership drew attention to was the restoration of the canals that feed the fields with water.  The population increased, so it was decided to develop swampy areas of the state.  All necessary work was done to improve communications within Egypt.  All roads in the desert along which caravans passed were equipped with wells. </p><p>  The situation in the era of the Middle Kingdom was stabilized: economic and military power increased, so a policy of conquering and developing new territories was carried out.  The most striking example is the expansion of Nubia and penetration into the Eastern Mediterranean.  Huge success was achieved by trade, which opened up new partners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ancient.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="middle kingdom of egypt" class="if uuid-2516060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2516060.jpg"></div><h2>  Agriculture </h2><p>  It was of a primitive natural character.  In the era of the Middle Kingdom, the improvement of implements takes place (the appearance of plows with a steep inversion, slanted grains on a stand, etc.).  In addition, cattle breeds are being improved, and lands that have recently been swamped are being commissioned.  However, the methods of agricultural work themselves were quite archaic.  Here is how it looked. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As a rule, after the fall of the flood, the soil was one continuous liquid mud.  Without further ado, the sower simply threw the grain under the feet of domestic animals (rams or pigs) released on such a field in order to trample the sowing, and at the same time to compact the soil.  This operation replaced the action of the harrow.  To improve the result, the control action was the work of a team of bulls pulling a wooden plow.  But she did not loosen the earth, but covered the sown grain with earth. </p><p>  If the earth quickly dried up, overgrown with weeds, then such large clods of land were loosened with a hoe, then the plowman harnessed a couple of bulls and pushed small clods of plow into shallow furrows.  Only after this was the grain sower allowed to work, which was also trampled into the soil with the help of livestock.  The final stage is work with a hoe: leveling the ground and covering the sowing. </p><p>  Harvesting was ritual in nature.  Even musicians were attracted to her.  While the reapers, armed with wooden sickles, with silicon teeth inserted in them, were doing their job, the flutist and singer inspired them to labor exploits.  Judging by the preserved relief of Tia‚Äôs tomb, the singer, with an eye on the accompaniment, was ready to perform any hit of the time (mostly these were hymns dedicated to God Osiris).  That was the art of the Middle Kingdom, at the service of its people, ready to support it at the most crucial, important moments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ancient.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="middle kingdom of ancient egypt" class="if uuid-2516043" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2516043.jpg"></div><h2>  Slavery and the "small" people </h2><p>  Developing an aggressive policy, Egypt is gaining many hands in which it was urgently needed.  Trade, agriculture, successful military campaigns - all these conditions contributed to the advancement of the middle layers of the population in society.  Documents of the Middle Kingdom they are called "small" people.  The image of a person who himself has achieved success, honor in society becomes the most attractive.  If you draw parallels - the "American dream."  The same roots and motivation: to succeed, so that later other people work for you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Therefore, there are very often posthumous inscriptions dating from this period, where along with various property ‚Äúheads‚Äù are also listed.  This term meant slaves.  The average well-to-do cattle breeder, dignitary, merchant could have several dozen of such "heads."  They were bequeathed, handed out as a reward.  In general, the position of slaves was powerless.  The situation of ordinary people was only slightly better. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new middle kingdom" class="if uuid-2516499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2516499.jpg"></div><h2>  Social Relations in the Middle Kingdom of Egypt </h2><p>  Nomarchs - representatives of the highest local nobility - in order to strengthen their power, had to enlist the support of the priesthood.  Although there was a unification of Egypt under the one supreme power of the pharaoh, the real situation of the local "princes" has not changed much.  They were all also strong in the field.  But the situation of the peasantry really worsened.  In the days of the Old Kingdom, ‚Äúroyal‚Äù people ‚Äî the category of people (free farmers) engaged in harvesting on the nomarch‚Äôs households ‚Äî are now increasingly serving labor duties with other large farmers. </p><p>  In general, Egypt has a high organization of labor resources.  The documents often mention the "detachments" of masons, the "detachments" of sailors.  Craftsmen are united by occupation, but few of them could boast of high incomes.  In general, there is a huge gap between different segments of the population.  This played a key role in further weakening the country, and its subjugation by the peoples, bearing the common name "Hyksos", at a higher technical level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ancientexplorers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient and middle kingdom" class="if uuid-2516023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2516023.jpg"></div><h2>  Under the heel of the invaders </h2><p>  It is generally accepted that the Hyksos are an association of peoples who came from the territory of modern Syria.  The Khurits and Hittites are still ranked among them.  This 110-year period of control by the invaders of a significant territory of Egypt is called the "Second Transition", it is in chronology between the Middle and New Kingdom. </p><p>  The Hyksos, possessing chariots, sophisticated compound bows, excellent armor and excellent combat tactics, used the enmity of individual Egyptian nomarchs.  In order to expel the invaders, it was necessary to adopt their weapons, create a material base, rally allies around themselves.  The main disasters from the actions of the invaders experienced areas of the Nile Delta.  Thebes at this time was preparing for a fight. </p><h2>  Liberation of egypt </h2><p>  A legend has come that mentions the name of the Theban king Szekenenra.  Having received the broad support of the masses, with enormous resources, he came out in an open struggle.  Military luck was not on his side.  The mummy of this commander surviving to this day has significant damage.  Apparently, he fell in battle, but his work was continued by his son, known in history as Kames. </p><p>  But even he failed to destroy the capital of the hated invaders.  Too independent were the Nubian rulers who stabbed in the back to the advancing Theban forces. </p><p>  Only his brother - the founder of the new 18th dynasty, with which the period of the New Kingdom of Yahmes originates, finally drove out the Hyksos. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crystalinks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="art of the middle kingdom" class="if uuid-2516519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2516519.jpg"></div><h2>  Spiritual heritage </h2><p>  The middle kingdom of Ancient Egypt can rightfully be considered the classic heyday of science and culture.  The Middle Egyptian language is being drawn up, hieratic writing is further developed.  Osiris, the God of the Underworld, was identified with each deceased, although in the era of the Ancient Kingdom, only the pharaohs enjoyed this privilege. </p><p>  The surviving portrait sculptures less idealize the <span>rulers of Egypt.</span>  Unfortunately, there are not many architectural monuments preserved.  This is the memorial temple of Mentuhotep, the chapel of Senurset.  The basic style of construction is revised in favor of the new needs of society.  He became less pompous. </p><p>  Medicine is developing.  Works such as the papyrus of Ebers and Edwin Smith, reflect the knowledge of the Egyptians about the anatomy of man, his circulatory system.  There is one noteworthy detail: in the works of this period, magic terminology is inferior to practical. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="middle kingdom" class="if uuid-2516071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2516071.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The heyday of the Middle Kingdom came just during the reign of the 12th dynasty.  Despite successes in the economic and military spheres, the main task - the complete unification of Egypt - was never solved.  This played its sinister role in further disasters.  The fight against the invaders was the unifying platform that rallied Egyptian society.  The era of the New Kingdom has begun, but that's another story. </p>
