    <p>  When buying a refrigerator, it is extremely important not to rush, as an error will lead to a waste of a considerable amount of money.  In addition, it will be useful to study consumer reviews.  The Ariston refrigerator is often featured in them, but because today we will discuss all the advantages of this kind of technology. </p><h2>  history of the company </h2><p>  In 1975, Vittorio Merloni, an Italian, created the company Merloni Elettrodomestici.  Ariston equipment, characterized by excellent quality and relatively low price, quickly became a leader in the Italian market.  Gradually, it began to spread throughout Europe, and then - to be delivered to our country.  It should be noted that the Indesit brand also belongs to this company, so that all the information that is available in the article can rightfully be applied to this technology. </p><p>  Buyers immediately noticed the new manufacturer, and soon the first reviews appeared.  The Ariston refrigerator, they claimed, belonged to the middle segment of household appliances: at a relatively low cost, it performed all its functions perfectly, but it also had some drawbacks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Soon there were even production in our country.  The Ariston refrigerator is good for this - spare parts for it are not taken across half the world, but are delivered from several domestic plants. </p><h2>  What do customers like? </h2>

Secondly, modern design, perfect maintenance of the set temperature are other positive qualities of the equipment from this manufacturer.  Given the fact that the traditions of the company's production date back more than 40 years, one should not be surprised at the high quality of the products.

    <p>  Almost all users claim that a reliable refrigerator continues to work fine even after 7-8 years of operation, when competitors' products often already manifest various "age problems".  What does statistics say about this?  If we take the <span>rating of refrigerators</span> in terms of quality, then Ariston products will always be among the first 5-7 brands. </p><h2>  Ariston HBD 1201.3 MFH </h2><p>  In order not to be unfounded, we give a characteristic of a rather average model - Ariston HBD 1201.3 MFH.  Despite the price, which indicates belonging to the middle category, the equipment of the refrigerator is such that in many respects it is not inferior to the devices of the premium segment.  In any case, it is about this model that there are especially enthusiastic reviews.  The Ariston refrigerator is equipped with an excellent Danfoss compressor.  It is he who provides the main consumer joy - almost silent operation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The huge volume of the freezer makes this refrigerator an excellent choice for a large family or those people who rarely go for groceries.  From the reviews it becomes clear that the two-chamber refrigerator ‚ÄúAriston‚Äù for 206 liters fully meets the <span>needs of a family</span> of three to four people in food storage for a week.  Especially valuable is this spaciousness in the summer. </p><p>  Almost all buyers are delighted with the Full No Frost function, since it allows you to completely forget about such an uncomfortable defrost.  By the way, this option should be considered in more detail. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotpoint ariston" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/456405.jpg" width="570"></div></h2><h2>  What is the information in the official instructions? </h2><ol><li>  Cold air in the chambers is distributed extremely evenly.  This contributes not only to better food safety, but also to minimal energy consumption, since the compressor will turn on much less frequently. </li><li>  Even if you load a large batch of products in the refrigerator, the temperature will become optimal much faster than if you used the equipment without this function. </li></ol><p>  Here are the dry statistics: the temperature in the lower shelves is kept within +2 degrees Celsius, while at the top it can be +8 degrees.  In freezers, the situation is even sadder.  If your refrigerator has the Full No Frost function on board, the temperature difference reaches no more than 1-2 degrees!  The Hotpoint Ariston refrigerator is very good for this.  The instruction to it says that this constancy of the temperature regime in many respects contributes to the durability of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The reviews perfectly confirm this feature: users say that even after loading 5-6 kilograms of fresh meat into the freezer, the refrigerator goes back to normal operation after a couple of hours, while their old refrigeration units could sometimes work after that day, constantly driving compressor. </p><p>  However, not everything is so good.  There are negative reviews about the technology.  The Ariston refrigerator, as it turned out, can not only please. </p><h2>  Cons Options Full No Frost </h2><ol><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ariston refrigerator malfunction" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/456404.jpg" width="400"></div>  Since technology involves constant air circulation, products can dry out faster.  This is especially true just for vegetables and fruits. </li><li>  The freezer for refrigerators of this type is less than about 20% (compared with conventional models), since all the necessary equipment takes up a lot of usable space. </li><li>  During operation, an increased <span>noise level</span> may be observed <span>,</span> since the sound of the compressor is superimposed on the noise of the running fan. </li><li>  Because of this, in some cases, energy consumption can increase significantly. </li><li>  Of course, this kind of equipment will cost significantly more than ordinary products. </li></ol><p>  A quick temperature recovery after opening the door is also not an indicator, since in many respects this characteristic depends on the perfection of the heat-insulating layer, which is becoming cheaper and more functional every year.  In addition, many experts agree that conventional refrigeration chambers can maintain a lower temperature longer when the power is turned off, since they do not have channels for supplying air inside. </p><h2>  Is it really? </h2><p>  If you read the entire list of negative points, then there may be doubt about the need to purchase a refrigerator of the described brand equipped with Full No Frost.  Do not worry, because real customer reviews largely debunk established dogma. </p><h2>  Prevention Instructions </h2><p>  Firstly, drying of products, as experienced housewives say, does not even depend on the movement of air, but on proper packaging.  It has long been noticed that at low temperatures and low humidity, the evaporation process is slightly less intense than in the heat.  And therefore, in ordinary refrigerators, the lettuce leaf almost instantly turns into hay. </p><p>  If you wrap leafy vegetables in a damp cloth or parchment paper, then in ordinary freezers they can be kept fresh for three to four days, while the Ariston refrigerator with a two-chamber ‚Äúknow-frost‚Äù salad can easily be stored for a week.  So the advantage of new technologies in this case is obvious. </p><p>  Secondly, the instructions for the device itself contain clear recommendations that all perishable products of this kind are best stored in special perforated bags that do not prevent fruits and vegetables from ‚Äúbreathing‚Äù.  In combination with the features of the refrigerator itself, such a simple trick will allow you to keep them completely fresh for much longer. </p><h2>  A little bit about the noise ... </h2><p>  As for the greater <span>noise level,</span> consumers actually testify that many Ariston models are indeed more ‚Äúloud‚Äù.  However, this applies only to products with a classic layout.  If you buy an <span>inverter refrigerator,</span> then you are unlikely to hear it even at night.  However, almost all models presented in stores rarely have noise below 42 dB, so you won‚Äôt lose in any case. </p><p>  High cost is from the category of beliefs of the 90s.  In the modern world, technologies tend to be rapidly cheaper, and therefore, normal refrigerators are today a little more expensive than their ‚Äúarchaic‚Äù predecessors, and saving a thousand and a half rubles is unlikely to make the ‚Äúweather‚Äù of your family budget.  That is why all Ariston refrigerators, the prices of which (most often) are within 20 thousand rubles, are bought very often. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reliable refrigerator" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/456403.jpg" width="256"></div></h2><h2>  Other useful options </h2><p>  The Super Freeze option also receives commendable reviews, as it allows you to freeze ten (!) Kilograms of meat to a stone at once in one day.  And further.  Since in our area electricity outages do not surprise anyone at all, thermal insulation coating has received special reviews.  It allows you to maintain a low temperature in the refrigerator for 13 (!) Hours after a <span>power outage.</span> </p><p>  The controls also make a good impression: on a large display, all the necessary information is displayed, and the pictograms with which it is displayed are intuitive.  This model is very beautiful, and not least because of this, it is regularly purchased. </p><h2>  Other useful features </h2><p>  One of the most important advantages that have recently been found in almost all refrigerators of this model is the Fresh Box option.  A special container with a convenient pull-out section is designed to store products that need special conditions.  So, reviews indicate that in this box fruits and lettuce are perfectly preserved, which otherwise wither after a day.  Thus, the Ariston refrigerator (the instruction contains the same information) is perfect for those people who prefer to eat high-quality and healthy food. </p><h2>  Brief instructions for using Holiday and Side-by-Side </h2><p>  If you often go on business trips, then Ariston refrigerators are specially created for you!  The Holiday option is ideal for storing food in the long run.  The fact is that the refrigerator compartment in this case is switched to the minimum energy consumption mode, while the freezer functions as usual. </p><p>  Moreover, reviews of vacationers say that people left the door of the refrigerator compartment open (so that there was no mold and smell)!  At the same time, the supply of meat and other frozen semi-finished products was excellently preserved in the freezer. </p>

This is done to ensure an uninterrupted supply of ice cubes.  However, reviews of people say that it would be better to connect not directly, but through some specialized filter.  Very often, users send for repair the Ariston refrigerator, the malfunctions of which arise precisely because of the lack thereof.

    <p>  The fact is that in many of our cities the quality of water leaves much to be desired, but there are no own filters in the refrigerator. </p><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  Like many Western manufacturers, Hotpoint Ariston attaches great importance to ergonomics.  So, the location and shape of all the compartments are such that you do not have to curl in order to get vegetables or fruits, dairy products or eggs.  All are located so as to be as accessible as possible. </p><p>  In reviews, this moment is also well displayed.  Customers notice the logical layout of the compartments for the most commonly used products.  Sometimes you don‚Äôt even think about how and where to put the purchases brought from the store. </p><p>  A huge plus to the creators of the refrigerator is the ability to outweigh the doors to the place you need.  Because of this, when rearranging in the kitchen, you do not have to think about how to properly put the refrigerator.  Wherever you install it, you can always outweigh the doors, so that problems with access to the internal space will not arise in any case. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the shelves in the compartments seem ‚Äúairy‚Äù, each of them easily withstands 40 kg of products, which is simply an excellent result.  Customers who often engage in home canning respect this company‚Äôs refrigerators very much.  Indeed, on each shelf, you can safely put a bowl of berries, vegetables or fruits, without worrying at all for its safety! </p><h2>  To power engineers - a battle! </h2><p>  It is no secret that the electron flows in the open spaces of our energy networks often behave in the most unpredictable way.  As a result, almost everyone can recall a story when, due to the mischief of power engineers, household appliances ‚Äúflew‚Äù.  If you use Ariston refrigerators, you can forget about such troubles. </p>

Residents of villages are especially flattering about this feature of Ariston refrigerators, since voltage fluctuations in this area are the norm, and not an exception.  In the event of a jump on the line, the repair of Ariston refrigerators will involve the replacement of a penny fuse, rather than the purchase of half the filling. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="quality rating of refrigerators" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/456947.jpg" width="447"></div>

    <h2>  Common faults </h2><p>  Alas, but in this case, there were some negative points.  Well, there is nothing ideal in the world, so the Hotpoint Ariston refrigerators in this regard are not out of the general plan. </p><p>  Many consumers have complaints about build quality.  It is not clear what exactly this drawback is connected with, but the quality of the paintwork on some refrigerators is so deplorable that it can be easily scratched with a fingernail. </p><p>  Experts, however, give this ‚Äúphenomenon‚Äù a fairly simple explanation.  The fact is that in recent years, almost all manufacturers of household appliances are forced to comply with stringent environmental standards.  Special enamels, which are usually painted with equipment, do not fall into this framework, and therefore enterprises have to use their environmentally friendly varieties.  Almost every second Ariston refrigerator is distinguished by this, the malfunctions of which are rarely serious. </p><p>  The technology of their production is still not too perfect, so the quality of the paint is quite far from acceptable.  It will not work to fix anything, so find out about these points before you buy. </p><p>  In addition, often consumers are terribly unhappy with the build quality.  This is especially often manifested when trying to use the possibility of rearranging the doors described above: almost all the masters unanimously say that the wires reach the desired connectors in only one position!  Either you will build them up on your own (deprivation of the guarantee automatically), or you will bring the refrigerator to the service center.  The problem is well-known, so such a repair of Ariston refrigerators must be done for free. </p>
