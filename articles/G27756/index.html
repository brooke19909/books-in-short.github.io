The Jungle Waterpark Hotel (Hurghada) is very attractive in many ways.  But is he so good, how do tour operators advertise him? </p><p>  Most tourists leave positive reviews about the hotel complex.  As often happens, the opinion of vacationers is different.  Someone thinks the hotel is great, but someone is missing something.  According to reviews, the "Jungle Water Park" has its own minor flaws.  But they are so insignificant that they are not able to spoil the overall impression. </p><p>  All tourists are invariably admired by the vast hotel area, surrounded by greenery and in water bodies.  There are many bushes, trees, flower beds and other plantings.  Numerous recreation and relaxation areas are equipped throughout, so there is a place for walks and photographs.  The hotel does not feel constricted and cramped. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mylittleadventure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best water park of the resort" class="if uuid-3253306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3253306.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel complex is organized in such a way that on its territory there is everything that vacationers may need.  But on the other hand, some tourists say that it is far removed from Hurghada.  If this moment is important for you, you should pay attention to other institutions.  Near the hotel there is a bus stop with transport to the city.  By the way, the hotel itself organizes a daily paid shuttle service to Hurghada. </p><p>  Tours in the "Jungle Water Park" are well-deserved.  The hotel is preferred by those tourists who want to enjoy all the delights of a water park and organized relaxation.  Resting in a hotel, there is no need to reflect on leisure, everything has been thought out for you for a long time. </p><h2>  Reviews about the number of rooms </h2><p>  The housing stock in the hotel is represented by rooms located in two-story buildings and bungalows.  The advantage of organizing space is that virtually all cottages are located near pools or rivers.  Leaving the room, you can immediately find yourself in the water.  It seems that all bungalows are equipped with their own courtyards. </p><p>  The hotel's room fund is represented by beautiful and comfortable rooms with modern TVs and good appliances.  Some tourists report mosquitoes in the evenings.  Therefore, before the trip, you should take care of repellents.  In the rooms, maids not only clean, but also change linen and towels.  Bottled drinking water is provided for guests.  The hotel has internet access, but you must pay for its use.  Tourists are satisfied with the comfort of the apartments.  Of course, sometimes breakdowns occur in the rooms and there are minor flaws, but they are very insignificant. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Tours in the "Jungle Water Park" in Hurghada are very popular.  There are several points that attract guests here.  Of course, the most interesting is the water park holidaymakers.  The resort has only three to four hotels with its own water park.  And "Jungle Waterpark" is the largest of them.  In addition, the complex offers its guests a varied diet.  The hotel has five restaurants, in fact three of them are served throughout the day as a buffet.  All establishments are located on one street.  Walking along it, you can choose where to go this time.  Several times a week, theme nights are organized for guests.  At this time, for tourists on the street prepare dishes of a certain orientation.  For example, on Thursday, vacationers can taste numerous seafood and fish. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cafes and restaurants" class="if uuid-3253304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3253304.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that there are a lot of cafes, bars and fast foods in the hotel.  Therefore, the choice of food and drink is quite large. </p><p>  It is nice that all alcohol, juices and water are included in the concept of nutrition.  Tourists note that restaurants always have a lot of food, and the choice of desserts and fruits is simply huge.  Resting at the hotel, there is no need to rush for lunch and breakfast, since all dishes are always available. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  According to tourists, "Jungle Water Park" fully corresponds to the stars on its sign.  The hotel could well qualify for a five-star status if it were on the coast.  The road from the hotel to the beach takes only a couple of minutes.  But at the same time, a good bus service is established with the coast.  Transport runs approximately every fifteen minutes. </p><p>  The beach is sandy and well equipped.  You can enter the sea not only from the beach, but also from the pontoon.  The local underwater world is quite interesting, so tourists recommend snorkelling or diving.  For guests of the hotel in the complex are equipped numerous relaxation areas with sun loungers and awnings.  Their use is included in the price of the tour. </p><p>  According to tourists, the water park is the best place for fun.  On its territory there are many slides for children and adults.  The depth of the pool for babies does not exceed 50 cm, but at the same time, lifeguards are on duty near it.  Workers are around adult rides.  The hotel controls the safety of its guests. </p><p>  Summing up, I want to note that tourists recommend the hotel from the best side.  If you want to enjoy a beach holiday with the whole family and have fun, you simply can not find a better place.  The hotel complex has a lot of advantages, so it is so popular among vacationers.  At the same time, the cost of living in it is quite moderate.  The hotel can be safely recommended for families with children of different ages.  Numerous animators will not let even the youngest guests get bored.  For kids, the hotel has a club and a playground.  Adult guests are also entertained by activities, which in the evenings organize exciting show programs, sports competitions and discos.  Local guides offer excursion lovers a variety of trips to local attractions. </p>
