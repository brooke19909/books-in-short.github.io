    <h2>  Hotel "Slavyanskaya" (Minsk) - service rating </h2><p>  Based on the guest reviews, the facilities and services of this hotel can be assigned the following rating: </p><ul><li>  The hotel infrastructure was awarded 4.8 points.  It has a very convenient access to the parking area.  Also highly appreciated is the work of the security service.  As for the improvement of the adjacent territories, there are some complaints.  Also not very convenient is the schedule of the bar and restaurant (they close too early). </li><li>  Service at the hotel was rated at solid 4. The main disadvantage is that there is practically no entertainment.  In addition, receptionists work quite slowly.  Nevertheless, all the staff is very polite, smiling and friendly. </li><li>  For comfort in the rooms, a total rating of 4.5 was set.  Particularly impressive is the bright design, as well as high-quality furniture and modern appliances.  As for noise isolation, here you can put a bold minus due to the strong audibility between the rooms. </li><li>  As for living with children, the hotel did not take care of this issue at all, and therefore there is a well-deserved deuce on this point.  There is no animation, no game room or playground, no special children's menu. </li><li>  As for the location, it deserves a rating of 3. There are a lot of shops and cafes in the district, but as far as entertainment facilities and objects of interest are concerned, they are far enough to get to. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists choose for themselves such an accommodation option as the Slavyanskaya Hotel (Minsk).  Guest reviews indicate that this institution has a lot of positive characteristics: </p><ul><li>  perfect cleanliness in the rooms (everything is cleaned efficiently even in hard-to-reach places); </li><li>  the hotel is quite conveniently located, it is very easy to find, even if this is your first time in the city; </li><li>  the staff is very polite, friendly and helpful; </li><li>  beautiful, pleasant interior, made in a modern minimalist style; </li><li>  beautiful view from the windows on the upper floors; </li><li>  convenient layout of the room; </li><li>  on each floor there is a cooler with drinking water (both hot and cold). </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The Slavyanskaya Hotel (Minsk) has not only advantages, but also significant shortcomings.  Guest reviews are characterized by the following negative comments: </p><ul><li>  sometimes there is confusion at the reception, and therefore you may be accommodated in the room where someone already lives (or vice versa - someone will be placed in your room); </li><li>  a fairly modest buffet menu, as for a hotel of such a high level;  complex nutrition is quite modest and monotonous; </li><li>  very strong audibility between numbers; </li><li>  lack of a minibar; </li><li>  fairly high prices in a restaurant; </li><li>  lack of an electric kettle in the room; </li><li>  most channels broadcast economic news (almost no entertainment); </li><li>  a safe is available only at the reception. <br><br></li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  If you arrived in Minsk for tourism or business, then feel free to choose the Slavyanskaya Hotel for your accommodation.  It offers comfortable conditions for accommodation, as well as a high level of service.  A feature of the hotel can be considered perfect cleanliness in the rooms.  But if we talk about the shortcomings, it is worth noting not very satisfying breakfasts (both buffet and complex), as well as excessively high prices for accommodation. </p><p>  Speaking about the location of the hotel, it should be noted that it seems very successful to nature lovers.  If you want to get quick access to infrastructure, tourism and business facilities, then this option is most likely not suitable for you. </p>
