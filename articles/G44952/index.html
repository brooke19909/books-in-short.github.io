  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Alluring real estate in Spain, the pros and cons.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An increasing number of people are trying to realize their dream and acquire real estate in Spain.  But a dream is a dream, and that it would come true, and then the person did not regret it, it is worthwhile to understand in advance whether this country is right for you. </p><p>  For starters, you should learn all about Spain.  This is one of the warmest countries on our planet and the most mountainous in Europe.  It occupies a leading position in the largest number of sunny days in a year.  Its neighbors are Portugal, Great Britain, Morocco, France.  The country is washed by the Mediterranean Sea from the south, and the Atlantic Ocean from the north.  Even with this short description, one can imagine how attractive this country is.  If you still decide and choose Spain to buy real estate, then it is worth considering several cities that are in greatest demand. </p><p>  The most prestigious and colorful in all of Spain can be called Costa Brava, which is located in Catalonia.  The sea coast here, to the envy of other places, is the cleanest.  Blue water attracts exciting looks, and the bays and beaches delight with their design decision.  In addition, there is also a clean town with many houses, houses and villas.  Almost everyone who wants to settle in Spain, get <noindex>  <span>real estate on Kcosta Brava</span> </noindex>  .  There is not even a question about another place, because there are towns such as Playa de Aro, Sagaro, Sant Feliu de Guixols and others, in which real estate is in great demand. </p><p>  One of the popular places in terms of living and comfort in Spain is Barcelona.  She ranks in the top five places in this country.  Life here will be stormy and fun, as it will be saturated with a mass of cultural and sports events held in this paradise.  Thanks to many prestigious universities and medical facilities, restaurants and entertainment centers, residents feel like they are in seventh heaven.  You can buy property near the sea coast and enjoy the sea views or prefer a sleeping area in the upper part of Barcelona.  Prices in the city itself will be slightly higher than in the suburbs, but it's worth it. </p><p>  The suburb of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthe town of Costa Maresme, is suitable for people who want to lead a more measured way of life.  Here it is possible to settle a few kilometers from the sea in special villages.  Living conditions in these houses are considered more comfortable than on the coast, due to less humid air.  In addition, by purchasing real estate in this place, the client automatically becomes the owner of a large land plot on which there may be a swimming pool and green spaces.  Such villages are well guarded and have developed infrastructure.  In addition, it is quiet and calm, since tourists are not massively allowed here. </p><p>  Property on the Costa Garraf, the closest suburb of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãis in great demand, despite the relatively high prices.  Here the rich and famous love to live and relax.  The landscape of the coastal zone is quite flat, which allows residents to have greater access to the beaches and carry out construction work more functionally.  In the interior of the town begins a mountainous area, where there are a lot of villas and mansions.  This area is considered more prestigious, since the air here is slightly drier than the sea, and the panorama from the windows is simply mesmerizing. </p></div></article>
