Cohabitation of children and parents almost always leads to undesirable conflict situations.  That is why, most often, a forced exchange of an apartment is required.  In the case when a daughter or a son with his family settles in the parents' apartment, such problems are simply inevitable.  Such conflicts can be read in many media.  In this regard, most families prefer to leave.  Sometimes forced exchange of an apartment is necessary.  Sometimes it is possible to exchange an apartment in court. </p><p>  Very often they sell a three-room or four-room apartment and on </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="forced exchange of an apartment" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11103/21513.jpg" width="600"></div>  the received money is acquired by two ‚Äúones‚Äù.  According to experts in this field, such proposals are not so few.  Basically, they are primarily looking for a home buyer, then specialists try to choose the most suitable apartments for exchange.  Only after this is the transaction of sale of the required objects.  It is no secret to anyone that the owner of four-room apartments, which are located in the center of the metropolis, can get the biggest benefit from such a deal.

Demand for premium facilities has decreased and in order to sell such an apartment, the owners have to make many concessions.  It is worth noting that buyers of such real estate mainly represent the largest companies.  That is why they can bargain very well.  Such a change of housing for the owners is not very profitable, because you have to make a significant discount.  But at present, real estate prices are being dictated by sellers themselves. </p><p>  For all other categories of citizens who want to leave, this situation is also not so rosy.  Mostly trying to exchange apartments, </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="exchange of apartments in court" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11103/21509.jpg" width="600"></div>  located in mid-rise homes in <span>residential areas.</span>  At the same time, residents who want to leave are simply no extra money.  Many residents of large cities generally refuse to exchange their housing.  And this can be explained!  All parties involved in such a deal should be fully satisfied with the options that they are offered.  But, as long-standing practice has shown, this is not always possible.  However, there is an exception to any rule.  This is true for the exchange of housing.  The degree of profitability of such a transaction is mainly determined by the following parameters:

In this case, each family will contribute a relatively small amount, which will be required to pay for individual apartments.  It is this kind of apartment exchange that is most acceptable for many families. </p>
