    <h2>  Krasnodar today </h2><p>  Today it is a large, rapidly developing city in the south of Russia.  According to some reports, here is the largest construction of residential buildings and social facilities in Russia. </p><p>  Krasnodar is administratively divided into four large districts - Western, Karasunsky, Central, Prikubansky.  In addition, there are 5 rural districts and 29 settlements within its borders. </p><p>  Krasnodar has an amazing ability - gradually, hypnotically captivate its guests.  To feel this, just walk along Krasnaya Street, the main street in the city.  Believe me, there is something to see here - numerous monuments and fountains, trees neatly, lovingly decorated with lanterns, cleanliness in the streets.  Almost all flowerbeds of the city (and there are a huge number of them) roses bloom throughout the year.  From the first minutes of your stay in the city, you understand that he is very loved by its inhabitants.  They are anxiously caring for ancient monuments, extremely proud of the present of their hometown. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Forbes List </h2><p>  Krasnodar annually wins first places among the cities of Russia, the most favorable for living.  In 2012, the city was recognized as the best “Russian newspaper”.  And the Forbes and RBC magazines, well-known in business circles, quite often spoke of Krasnodar as a city attractive for business and the best for living.  In 2013, he was recognized as a leader in the ratio of quality of life and its cost. </p><p>  If in 2013 the authorities of the <span>Krasnodar Territory</span> in connection with the Olympics focused on Sochi, then in 2014 the same funds and efforts will be sent to Krasnodar.  Naturally, big changes await the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prikubansky district Krasnodar" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/482119.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  In-city districts </h2><p>  The western district is located in the west of the city.  It is the smallest in occupied area - only 4% of the territory.  In the south it borders with Adygea. </p><p>  The next district is located in the east of the city of Krasnodar.  The Karasun district, or rather the district, borders on the Prikubansky and Central districts, the Republic of Adygea and the Dinsky district.  This is a much larger territory compared to those that the city of Krasnodar has.  Karasunsky <span>district (district)</span> has Pashkovsky airport on its territory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Near the Karasunsky located Prikubansky district (Krasnodar).  It is located in the northwestern part of the city.  This is the largest district, covers an area of ​​474 square meters.  km  The Prikubansky District (Krasnodar) borders on the Central, Karasun and Western districts. </p><p>  In the south of the city is the Central (intracity district) of Krasnodar.  Here is the Cheryomushki district, the railway station, the Kuban stadium. </p><h2>  Krasnodar: city districts </h2><p>  There are thirteen of them in the city.  They all differ from each other.  Different districts of Krasnodar receive different reviews from residents.  Today we will try to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each of them. </p><h2>  Anniversary microdistrict </h2><p>  Perhaps this area can be called the most popular in the city.  In 1980, he began to be built up in multi-storey buildings.  Now it is a densely populated area.  Despite this, intensive construction is still ongoing along the coast of the Kuban.  The main transport routes of the district are the street named after the 70th anniversary of the October Revolution and Chekistov Avenue.  From it it is easy to get to anywhere in the city by tram, bus, taxi, and non-stop.  The area is well developed and, one might say, autonomous.  More than 80 thousand people live here. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of local residents, the Jubilee district of Krasnodar is quite comfortable for living.  There is a lot of greenery here - Platanovy Boulevard was appreciated by young mothers with children, and older people like to walk here.  The residents of the district also say the same about Rozhdestvenskaya Embankment, where you can breathe in the fresh Kuban air.  An important advantage of this area is the ability to quickly get anywhere in the city.  Of course, residents are satisfied with the availability of all the necessary facilities for living - shops, cafes, laundries, hospitals and clinics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="anniversary district of Krasnodar" class="if" height="459" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/482125.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Its only drawback, according to the townspeople, is the overload of transport interchanges, due to which traffic jams, alas, are inevitable. </p><h2>  Festivalny District </h2><p>  More often this area of ​​the city is called “Two Airplanes” by residents.  This is due to the monument erected in honor of the pilots.  These two aircraft, standing on a high pedestal, adorn the Festival District of Krasnodar. </p><p>  The construction of this site began in the 60s.  Now there is a new round of housing construction.  New lands are being developed that previously belonged to Solnechny state farm.  This area is more than inhabited.  Here you can see at every step "Khrushchev" and "Brezhnevka" both five- and nine-story.  Many kindergartens and schools that were built in Soviet times in the required quantity.  Moving towards the former Solnechny state farm, you will certainly get to the Solnechny residential complex built several years ago. </p><p>  According to residents, the houses are modern spacious apartments.  Going a little further, you will get to the street of Yana Poluyan - a Kuban politician and revolutionary, and to Atarbekov street.  They focus on shops, cafes, medical facilities, beauty salons, etc. In the Festival district there is the Krasnodar balneotherapy center - a small resort where Krasnodar children improve and strengthen their health, and it’s completely free, and adults pay a nominal fee.  These are the usual procedures for such establishments - mineral baths, showers, mud wraps, etc. </p><p>  Having studied the reviews of the residents of this area, it can be argued that this is one of the best and most desirable sections of the city.  Many Krasnodar residents consider it ideal for families with children - there is so much greenery and fresh air that it would be enough for a whole city.  In addition, there is an excellent traffic intersection, which allows you to move around the city without any problems. </p><h2>  Microdistrict "Komsomolsky" </h2><p>  If this is your first visit to this southern city, you will need a map of Krasnodar.  It is better to get acquainted with the areas, knowing for sure how to get there. </p><p>  If someone believes that this area is somehow connected with the Soviet past, then he is deeply mistaken.  Only the name reminds of bygone times, and even, perhaps, kindergartens in almost every yard.  It should be noted that this is a rather large city - Krasnodar.  Komsomolsky district is removed from the historical center.  And many consider it a significant drawback. </p><p>  True, CMR is completely autonomous, but the problem of remoteness should not be discounted.  Approaching the Komsomolsky district, you can see huge wholesale warehouses, bases, retail space.  On the territory of the district itself there are markets, shops, consumer service centers.  He is actively building up.  New quarters appear.  Its residents believe that the layout is well thought out here - the houses are built in the form of a square, inside of which there are kindergartens, sports grounds, schools.  This is a huge walking area.  Here, magnificent, clean air, and squirrels live on the branches of trees.  The only minus is its distance from the center. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnodar districts reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/482122.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  central District </h2><p>  Many citizens consider it the most interesting and at the same time ambiguous.  What is the reason?  The fact is that this is an ancient city - Krasnodar.  The Central District, like no other, combines magnificent new homes, clean and tidy squares, original fountains with dilapidated houses.  It's just that reconstruction has not yet reached some streets, which has been going on in the city for several years. </p><p>  Almost all the most interesting things in the city are concentrated in this area.  For example, Red Street, which at the weekend becomes a pedestrian.  Or <span>Theater Square,</span> where the most important city events are held.  Here are museums and theaters, a large number of entertainment venues and a wonderful park named after  30th anniversary of the Victory, in which you can walk, ride children on the rides and just have a great time. </p><h2>  Microdistrict Hydrobuilders </h2><p>  Along with completely new sites, there are residential areas that have long celebrated their 40th anniversary in the city of Krasnodar. </p><p>  The Gidrostroy district (as locals call it more often) refers to the latter.  It was built in the early 70s and was named after the builders of the reservoir in Krasnodar.  The Hydro Builders area attracts many with its huge number of trees, shrubs and flowers.  This is a real paradise.  According to local residents, living here is a pleasure. </p><p>  Naturally, not only natural beauties attract people here.  The district has a well-developed infrastructure, several schools, a clinic, a sports school and so on.  Krasnodar leaves no one indifferent.  The districts of the city are so different that it seems that you have visited several cities.  But this is just an illusion.  This is one, diverse and multifaceted city of Krasnodar. </p>

    <h2>  Cheryomushki District </h2><p>  Some areas of Krasnodar have something in common.  This is primarily true of old buildings.  This neighborhood is somewhat reminiscent of Festivalnaya - very green, with an abundance of five-story buildings.  True, in Cheryomushki more crowded, more transport, and therefore more noise.  The townspeople are famous <span>for the Vishnyaki clothing market.</span>  This is a huge territory where people from all over the city come to shop, and even from nearby villages.  This area is rarely awarded with praise - it is very noisy here, and the apartments are not the most comfortable. </p><h2>  The area of ​​Moskovskaya street </h2><p>  The newest areas of Krasnodar deserve special attention.  As a rule, they consist of new buildings and the private sector.  The area of ​​Moskovskaya Street is located between Rostov Highway and Rossiyskaya Street, at the exit of the city.  It was built in a swamp, so during even light rain it is quite difficult to move there.  The houses are built too close together.  This is the work of private developers.  Residents complain that there are often problems with electricity and sewage.  Often they have to use their own generators.  And all this happens in apartment buildings!  The area is densely populated.  And this is understandable - here are the lowest housing prices in the city.  Although, to be honest, what is this housing ... </p><h2>  East Kruglikovskaya </h2><p>  Some areas of Krasnodar have not yet been marked on the map, although today these are large housing complexes, so we believe that they should also be given attention. </p><p>  This area is composed of several streets.  It is famous for the fact that a huge number of high-rise buildings have already been built here, which continue to grow like mushrooms after rain.  Previously, there was a wasteland at this place, so here you will not be able to find dilapidated houses or the private sector.  The area consists of brand new skyscrapers.  The apartments here are being built good - spacious and bright, but more often people are buying them, although locals like this young area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnodar city districts" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/482121.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To its shortcomings, new settlers include a poorly developed infrastructure.  The construction of houses is far ahead of the construction of schools and kindergartens.  There are serious problems with parking, and the roads there leave much to be desired. </p><h2>  ZIP area </h2><p>  More recently, many areas of Krasnodar were built near large industrial enterprises for their employees.  The Plant of Measuring Instruments (now defunct) was no exception.  In this area there are the usual five-story buildings and more modern nine-story buildings, there is a school, two colleges and three kindergartens.  Chistyakova Grove has a beautiful park.  Well developed infrastructure. </p><p>  Residents of the neighborhood speak warmly about this place.  They are attracted by the proximity to the city center, the good ecological situation in the area - there are no large industrial enterprises and busy roads.  Young parents are pleased with well-equipped playgrounds and the opportunity to take a walk with the baby in the park without leaving the area.  Active construction of monolithic-brick houses of improved layout is underway here, so everyone who wants to improve their living conditions, prefer to stay in their area. </p><h2>  RIP Area </h2><p>  The people called this district of the city "Shanghai."  This analogy is not accidental - houses are built close to each other.  On the streets, to put it mildly, not very clean.  The history of this area began only a few years ago.  By a strange coincidence, the most “economical” developers met here.  They were attracted by a piece of land between the streets of Russian and Moscow, located near the city center.  The plot was built up so tightly that residents of neighboring houses can talk to each other, looking out the window.  We did not discuss the construction of kindergartens and schools in this area - they cannot be sold, and therefore what is the point of investing money in their construction ... </p><p>  Brick houses can be considered an advantage of this area - they are warm and not noisy.  In addition, the low price of housing in this area is of considerable importance.  More reviews could not be found. </p><h2>  Pashkovsky district </h2><p>  It is designed for lovers of the private sector.  Here you can inexpensively build your own house, and quite close to the city center.  There are few high-rise buildings, most of the territory is occupied by private cottages, so Pashkovka is often called a village. </p><p>  Locals love their area, because many people prefer to live in their own home, but many complaints are made about the underdeveloped infrastructure and condition of roads.  In addition, residents are not satisfied with the state of street lighting. </p><h2>  KKB District </h2><p>  In the north-east of Krasnodar is the Regional Clinical Hospital No. 1 named after  S.V. Ochakovsky.  The complex consists of eight separate specialized centers.  It is surrounded by streets 40 years of Victory, Russian, May 1, Cherkasskaya.  This is the area of ​​the Regional Clinical Hospital (KKB).  The area began to be built up in the 70s, but began to actively develop in recent years.  Today, several large housing complexes are being built here, and plans include the construction of several more. </p><h2>  District "German Village" </h2><p>  There are no analogues of this complex in the Krasnodar Territory.  The area was created in a mixed German and Russian styles.  Its infrastructure is so autonomous that residents do not need to leave the area to take their children to kindergarten or visit a beauty salon.  Everything is located within walking distance.  Basically, the area is built up with cottages, but there are also multi-storey buildings.  The area is elite, real estate is expensive, but residents are happy with it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnodar map with regions" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/482339.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  "The Red Square" </h2><p>  This area is often referred to as Enka.  In the 90s, builders from Turkey built a <span>housing complex</span> for military personnel here.  As you might have guessed, the name of the construction company is Enka.  As the residents of the district say, the houses here are simply magnificent, the apartments are well-planned and, by the way, are expensive.  The area looks very modern - the houses are new, well-equipped playgrounds and sports grounds in the courtyards, nice kindergartens.  This very well-groomed, quiet and comfortable area is proud of the city of Krasnodar.  The Red Square area is called that because it has the large shopping center of the same name. </p><p>  Some residents believe that it is somewhat far from the center, while others are happy to live away from the central noisy streets.  To this, it should be added that city transport works smoothly here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnodar Red Square" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/482127.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  "Aurora" </h2><p>  Another new elite area.  Built up with houses of different floors.  Apartments in them are VIP-class.  On the territory of the district schools, kindergartens, gymnasiums, clinics were built.  The Institute of Economics and Modern Technologies is also located here. </p><p>  Naturally, such an infrastructure is quite satisfied with the residents of the region, so the reviews about it are only positive. </p><p>  Today we met another old Russian city, with a rich history, favorable climate and very friendly residents.  We offer you to call the best districts of Krasnodar yourself.  Our article and reviews of the indigenous inhabitants of the city will help you with this. </p>
