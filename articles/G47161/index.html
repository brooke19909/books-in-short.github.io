  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Which electric shaver is good - you decide</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An interesting moment: we live in an age of high technology, we strive to simplify our life as much as possible and surround ourselves with ‚Äúsmart‚Äù things that help us easily cope with every pressing need - from brushing our teeth to general cleaning in the house, and at the same time remain extremely conservative to such a familiar, everyday, sometimes burdensome, but necessary hygienic procedure, such as shaving.  See what our bathrooms are equipped with: electric hairdryer, electric comb, electric epilator, electric toothbrush and ... a regular machine.  Well, albeit not ordinary - with several blades, with a micro-comb, with a lubricating strip, but in essence it is still the same old, if not to say, archaic ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù razor. </p><p>  Even if you don‚Äôt get hurt with the machine as much as you did with its ancestress with an open blade, it still requires special handling and caution skills.  And the constant change of blades, the purchase of foams, gels, creams, balms that always end at the most inopportune moment!  It is not surprising that many men are increasingly thinking: whether to switch to an electric shaver?  There are so many of them now - beautiful, elegant, stylish, sophisticated.  And after all, often they refrain from buying only because they do not know which electric shaver is good and which is not very good.  Let's get it right. </p><p>  <strong>What are they like?</strong> </p><p>  With all the seeming diversity, the main razor systems are actually only two: mesh and rotary.  The first cuts the bristles with vibrating blades, approximately the same as in the machine, only steel grids separate them from the skin of the face - hence the name.  In the second, small round rotating knives enclosed in razor heads cope with the same task.  Which electric shaver is good for a particular person - mesh or rotary - is up to him to determine, guided by the recommendations of specialists and knowledge of the features of his face.  If the <span>skin is sensitive,</span> then experts generally advise using a mesh system, only the rotary one is considered to shave more cleanly and accurately. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>What improves shaving quality?</strong> </p><p>  Suppose you have determined which mesh shaver is good for you - mesh.  So, to refuse accuracy ‚Äúfor the sake of‚Äù sensitive skin?  Not at all, manufacturers of razors and in this matter do not sleep in a hat.  Shaving quality designed to improve additional heads.  The principle here is the same as in machines with several blades: more heads - a cleaner shave.  ‚ÄúAnd the price is higher,‚Äù your wallet will skeptically add.  Alas, you always have to pay extra for quality. </p><p>  Moving (floating) heads, following the contours of the face, make shaving even more comfortable.  But in one of the models of mesh electric shavers, an arcuate shape of the head was used, which provides a better fit to the face and, consequently, a cleaner shave.  So in the question of which electric razor is good, the ‚Äútrick‚Äù prevails, as, however, in almost everything else. </p><p>  <strong>Dry or wet shave?</strong> </p><p>  Didn't you know?  The use of electric shavers does not at all preclude the use of foams and gels, which make shaving more enjoyable.  Just in order to be able to do this, you need to choose an electric razor that has a wet shave function.  Such a razor, among other things, is also the easiest to maintain, as it can simply be put under the tap and rinsed.  In some models, the manufacturer even provided special tanks with dispensers, where gel or lotion is poured.  It is clear that all these improvements increase the price even more, like the availability of a battery that allows you to use a razor on the road, and equipment with a liquid crystal display, which shows the <span>battery charge</span> level <span>.</span> </p><p>  <strong>What are the best shavers?</strong> </p><p>  The main manufacturers of electric shavers, whose products can be advised with confidence, are Braun, Panasonic and Philips, while the first two specialize in mesh razors, and the third - on rotary razors.  Each company has developed many models that satisfy certain needs, so it‚Äôs simply impossible to say unequivocally which electric shaver is better.  All of them are good in their own way - for some, functionality, for someone design, for someone at a price.  It is only necessary to carefully approach the choice, and then the question "What is an electric shaver good?"  you will say with confidence: "Mine!". </p>
