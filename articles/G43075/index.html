    <p>  A photograph of yourself is considered a self portrait.  Due to the unattractiveness of the word, it was replaced with a selfie, which translates as "self."  The first mention of such a picture appeared only in 2010 and quickly took root around the world. </p><p>  A photograph taken on an outstretched arm or in a mirror is considered a selfie.  This method made a real boom, and in the wake of popularity, a lot of attributes were created for lovers of self-portraits.  An interesting invention was a special stick, allowing more people to get into the frame.  Selfie lovers also received an Instagram resource designed to post self-portraits. </p><h2>  Device selection </h2><p>  Most people prefer using a phone for a selfie.  The mobile phone is always at hand and is able to take good pictures.  Although not every smartphone can cope with the task. </p><p>  The emphasis in the device should go to the cameras, and both.  The quality of the selfie depends on the matrix of the device and its resolution.  Also, the phone must have autofocus, the presence of such a function is desirable for the front-end.  Finding a great selfie phone is not easy.  The buyer will have to carefully study many models of different companies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Main camera </h2><p>  <span>When choosing a phone</span> for a selfie, you should pay attention not only to the front camera.  The rear camera is also important when shooting self-portraits.  You can use a mirror surface for a selfie, which means that the front camera will not help here.  A picture taken with the main camera will be much better.  With a photo in the mirror, even a budget device will show good results. </p><p>  The main camera is useful when shooting on an outstretched arm.  Of course, this method is not the best, but if the usual ‚Äúeye‚Äù is in place of the front camera, this is a great solution.  Having good autofocus in the phone, the user can achieve good results. </p><h2>  Balance </h2><p>  The best selfie phones are balanced phones.  A vivid example was the Desire Eye Red device created for self-portraits from the famous HTC brand.  The phone received 13-megapixel sensors on both cameras.  Additional features also failed.  The back and front cameras have autofocus, in addition, there is a flash near each ‚Äúeye‚Äù. </p><p>  If the front camera is slightly inferior to the rear counterpart by the number of megapixels, there should be no problems.  Naturally, the ‚Äúeyes‚Äù of 0.3, 1.3, and even 2 megapixels are unsuitable for a good self-portrait.  The best selfie phones start at 5 megapixel <span>front camera</span> and 8 megapixel rear. </p><h2>  Samsung Smartphones </h2>

First of all, Samsung devices should be noted.  The company has always stood out with excellent cameras, and most fans of self-portraits prefer this particular company. </p><p>  The manufacturer has released many devices suitable for selfies.  Samsung Galaxy S6 is one of the most striking examples.  The company equipped the main camera with a 16 megapixel sensor, and the front camera with 5 megapixels.  Features are great for selfies. </p><p>  Almost all Galaxy devices are suitable for self-portraits.  The company has installed a five-megapixel front camera in most of its phones.  Of course, there are exceptions in the form of the J1 model, in which only 2 megapixels.  However, selfie fans will have plenty to choose from. </p><h2>  Phones "Lenovo" </h2>

    <p>  The popular Chinese manufacturer also paid attention to the camera features.  The presence of excellent matrices allows fans of Lenovo products to take selfies.  The company's phone is almost not inferior to the Korean competitor.  The manufacturer pleases with a rather large assortment of smartphones with excellent cameras. </p><p>  Representatives of the S-series, namely the 60 and 90 models, are some of the best photo devices. These devices, similar to the last iPhone, received an 8- and 5-megapixel front camera.  The rear camera is also full of advantages.  For both devices, the main matrix has a resolution of 13 megapixels. </p><p>  It is difficult to ignore the Vibi X3, the owner of the main camera with 21 megapixels.  The front-facing matrix of this miracle has a resolution of 8 megapixels, which is also very nice for photo lovers.  Slightly behind his advanced brother Vibi Shot.  The manufacturer equipped the main camera of the smartphone with 16 megapixels, and an additional 8 megapixels. </p><p>  In the cheaper segment there are also models suitable for selfie.  The representative of the budget class A, or rather the 7000 model, has five megapixels of the front camera and a main camera of 8 megapixels.  Also, those wishing to take self-portraits will appreciate the P70.  The approximate cost of these models ranges around 12 thousand rubles.  However, they are definitely worth their money. </p><h2>  Sony Smartphones </h2>

    <p>  Not far behind the competition and the Japanese manufacturer.  Sony equip their devices with some of the best cameras.  Only Samsung can compete with the company.  Cameras on Sony devices are designed for shooting self-portraits. </p><p>  Among the company's products you can find real pearls.  For example, Xperia M5 acquired a matrix of 21.5 megapixels.  In addition, the model received a front-facing camera of as much as 13 megapixels, perfectly suitable for selfies.  A more balanced and cheaper option would be the Xperia C5, which has 13 megapixels of both the main and the rear camera. </p><p>  When exploring Sony‚Äôs assortment, it‚Äôs hard to decide which selfie phone to choose.  Attention is drawn to the expensive Z5 models, the average ones in the price of Z3 and, of course, the M4 Aqua that many have grown to love.  Each of the phones received a powerful and functional camera.  The heavy burden of choosing a device designed for selfies will fall on the shoulders of the buyer and will certainly not be the easiest. </p><h2>  HTC Phones </h2>

    <p>  A less extensive, but rather interesting range of selfie devices is offered by a Taiwanese manufacturer.  Although HTC does not focus on cameras, it will be able to attract photo enthusiasts with some models. </p><p>  The buyer should pay attention to smartphones with the prefix One, namely the M9 and M8S.  The eighth model of the series has got 13 and 5 megapixel cameras.  The specifications, unfortunately, are inferior to Sony products, but they will cope with self-portraits with a bang.  The device One M9 looks a little more attractive.  The flagship got at its disposal 20 and 4 megapixels.  Frontalka a little failed, but still looks decent. </p><p>  Among cheaper devices, it is difficult to determine which phone is better for taking a selfie.  "Budget employees" and part of the middle class are not able to surprise with their parameters.  The same Desire 516 received only 5 and 2 megapixels.  Similar cameras are on most HTC models.  Such a matrix will be enough for a low-quality photo.  For vivid and memorable selfies, better features are needed. </p><h2>  Interesting finds </h2>

    <p>  Not only famous brands will cope with self-portraits.  The companies that surrendered their positions, or Chinese manufacturers, may also surprise.  Paying attention to the search, the buyer can stumble upon a curious F5 device from Doogee.  The phone will surprise not only with the affordable price, but also with the presence of cameras with 13 and 5 megapixels. </p><p>  Among the LG line also there are devices suitable for selfies.  Model Ray X190 will delight the buyer with excellent features.  From the manufacturer, the phone received as much as 13 megapixels of the main and 8 megapixels of an additional camera. </p><p>  You should not ignore the famous "Chinese".  Paying attention to Huawei, the buyer will surely stumble upon the Ascend P7 model.  The phone has 13 and 8 megapixels, which is very good. </p>
