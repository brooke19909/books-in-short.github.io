    <h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Ivan Surikov was born in the village of Novosyolovo (Yaroslavl province) in 1841.  The boy‚Äôs father lived in Moscow.  There he went to work, while still young.  First, I had to be an assistant, and then serve as a clerk in the market.  As a result, Ivan's father opened his own <span>vegetable shop.</span>  Zakhar Surikov only occasionally came to the village to visit relatives. </p><h2>  Moving to Moscow </h2><p>  Until nine years old, a sick, weak and quiet Ivan lived in the village.  Her calm, peaceful, simple way and the beauty of the surroundings made a lasting impression on the future poet.  Over the years, readers will be able to observe village motifs in <span>Surikov‚Äôs work</span> .  But this later ... In 1849, Ivan and his mother moved to Moscow with his father.  The metropolis with its suffocating air, lack of space, dirt and noise negatively affected the boy.  He became even more introverted.  In the tenth year of life, parents gave Ivan to study with the Finogenov sisters from a merchant family.  They taught the future poet the church and civic alphabet, writing, reading, religion, etc. As soon as they learned to read and write, little Surikov eagerly ‚Äúabsorbed‚Äù the books.  Moreover, he read everything that came to hand.  These were novels, and travels, and fairy tales, and the lives of saints, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Acquaintance with Poetry </h2><p>  Soon, the biography of Ivan Zakharovich Surikov was replenished with a landmark event - the boy first read poetry.  These were Dmitriev‚Äôs fables, Tsygankov‚Äôs songs and a series of Merzlyakov‚Äôs novels.  After reading these works, the boy felt a subtle attraction to poetry.  Since Ivan studied ‚Äúin the old fashion‚Äù, he did not read poetry, but sang them.  Surikov used this ‚Äúnatural‚Äù method in the future to check the size of his creations.  And he left him only when he became acquainted with the theory of versification.  Official Xenophon Dobrotvorsky, who lived in the neighborhood, made the boy even more readable.  He regularly gave him books from his library. </p><h2>  First work and first verse </h2><p>  As soon as Ivan Zakharovich Surikov, whose brief biography is known to all lovers of Russian poetry, reached adolescence, his father put the young man at the counter.  He was not at all interested in the boy's hobbies.  But Ivan did not give up reading and continued to engage in it furtively.  Soon the young man's attraction to poetry was expressed in a concrete work.  The boy wrote the first verse, which he was inspired by the fire in their house.  Dobrotvorsky praised Surikov and advised him to continue.  Inspired by the words of his mentor, Ivan composed several plays in the form of September. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivan Zakharovich Surikov short biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1058190.jpg" width="374"></div>

The boy was barely 16 years old.  On the advice of friends, he attributed his creations to two Russian poets.  One of them took a warm part and gave useful advice.  From the second came such an unfavorable response that Ivan fell into despondency.  Nevertheless, the young poet did not abandon versification, but only began to work harder.  Surikov improved sonority, smoothness and form of his works.  And this yielded results: in the verses, artistry and simplicity of images appeared. </p><h2>  Ruin father </h2><p>  Soon, the boy‚Äôs father decided to expand his business.  Biography of Ivan Zakharovich Surikov says that his life from this moment has made a new round.  Despite the new workload (reporting and work behind the counter), the young poet was able to make time for his favorite pastime.  Wanting to get rich quick, Ivan's father began to play at the races.  This has led to serious losses.  Zakhar washed down, only aggravating the situation.  As a result, both of his shops went bankrupt.  The boy‚Äôs father had to leave for the village, and the young poet himself got a job as an assistant to his brother Zakhar. </p>

    <h2>  Uncle's job </h2><p>  <span>The biography of Surikov</span> Ivan Zakharovich describes this period of his life as quite difficult.  The capricious and picky uncle loaded the young poet with work even more.  Ivan had to not only serve customers, but also deliver goods to customers, as well as sweep the shop.  Almost no free time for favorite reading and versification.  Uncle's life was becoming unbearable.  As a result, Surikov sold all available property and rented a small room on Tverskaya.  He also, with his mother, started buying and selling old scrap.  The case went especially briskly when Ivan, in addition to iron, began to trade in coal and charcoal. </p><h2>  Independence </h2><p>  Having become independent, the poet was able to return to his favorite pastime.  Since the beginning of the 60s, the biography of Ivan Zakharovich Surikov was replenished with a number of important events.  One of them was an acquaintance with the poet Plescheev.  The latter saw talent in the young man and motivated him to further self-education and creativity.  Some of the most successful poems Pleshcheyev sent to the editor of the magazine "Entertainment" Miller.  The first of them was published in 1863.  Inspired by success, Ivan became even stricter in creating his works.  Plescheev helped him to perfect the verse and form.  But soon in the life of the young poet a crisis came. </p>

    <h2>  Difficult stage </h2><p>  Surikov Ivan Zakharovich (a short biography intended for children, also describes this period in detail) lost his mother, and his father returned from the village.  He settled with his son and led a drunken lifestyle.  Then Zakhar married a schismatic - a grumpy woman with a heavy character.  Ivan could not tolerate her and left the house.  For a young poet, a life began, full of wanderings, hardships and constant search for work.  Surikov tried several professions: a student in a printing house, a copyist, a henchman ... </p><h2>  New Publications </h2><p>  When the stepmother left, having robbed Zakhar to the skin, Ivan again settled with his father and engaged in trade.  He did not forget about the pen.  "Entertainment", "Illustrated newspaper", "Sunday leisure" - these are the publications in which Surikov Ivan Zakharovich was published (a biography for children will be very interesting if you read at least a few excerpts from poems published in these magazines).  The poet's talent and fame grew <span>exponentially.</span>  In 1871, the first collection of his works was published, including 54 plays. </p>

    <h2>  A circle of self-taught poets </h2><p>  On this, a brief biography of Surikov Ivan Zakharovich comes to an end.  It remains to reveal a couple more important points.  Ivan was always impressed by the same self-taught as he himself.  Therefore, Surikov decided to organize an appropriate circle, which included Radienov, Grigoryev, Razzorenov, Derunov, Kondratyev, Tarusin and others. Together they released the Dawn almanac in 1872.  And in 1875, the 2nd edition of the poetry poetry collection was released.  Any biography of Ivan Zakharovich Surikov tells us this.  For children, by the way, he wrote wonderful poems.  The mid-70s saw the peak of the poetic career of the hero of our story. </p><h2>  Last years </h2><p>  This was the entire biography of Ivan Zakharovich Surikov.  In the last years of his life, the poet found himself in difficult conditions.  There was never enough money.  This undermined his strength and health.  Surikov began to get seriously ill in 1879.  The poet developed consumption.  The 3rd edition of his works brought some money, and Ivan Zakharovich went to them to be treated in the Samara steppes.  For the same purpose, he lived for some time in the Crimea.  But the treatment did not help, consumption progressed.  In April 1880, the poet died and was buried in Moscow at Pyatnitsky cemetery. </p>
