  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is an electronic alcohol meter used for?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The manufacture of alcoholic beverages, the main characteristic of which is their strength, began from time immemorial.  In essence, alcohol is a semi-finished product, however its properties are directly reflected in the final result - be it brandy, liquor or homemade vodka.  The number of degrees or, in other words, the strength can be measured using a special device called an electronic alcohol meter. </p><h2>  Device device <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Electronic alcoholometer" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/353731.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><p>  An electronic alcoholometer is a type of hydrometer designed to measure the density of a liquid.  To a greater extent, it is used to determine the performance of alcohol-water solutions, and the accuracy of the data obtained will depend on the amount of impurities.  It should be noted that alcoholometers are not used to study the strength of wines. </p><p>  The device‚Äôs device is rather primitive: it consists of a glass tube, which is filled with mercury at the bottom and has a measuring scale at the top.  A modern electronic alcohol meter, the price of which makes it available to everyone, makes life easier for its ‚Äúuser", because it makes it possible to immediately see the percentage of alcohol content, rather than calculate the ratio of mass to volume. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to use a hydrometer? <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Electronic alcohol meter price" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/353734.jpg?1394869376610" width="300"></div></h2><p>  To achieve maximum measurement accuracy, certain procedure requirements must be followed.  The temperature of the test fluid should be clearly 20 ¬∞ C.  It should be remembered that as a result of adding water to alcohol, the temperature rises, so you need to wait for it to return to its original value.  In addition to alcohol and water, there should not be any other impurities in the liquid. </p><p>  So, in a narrow glass container containing the test solution, we immerse the electronic mercury alcohol meter and wait until the numerical value is stabilized.  It should be noted that this device is very convenient to use and as accurate as possible in its readings, therefore it is widely used by both professionals and amateurs of the production of alcoholic beverages. </p><h2>  Laboratory alcoholometer <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Laboratory alcoholometer" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/353736.jpg?1394869713607" width="584"></div></h2><p>  Such hydrometers are designed to measure density in two-component solutions that are manufactured for export and household needs.  The device is often used in home brewing and winemaking, since it determines the strength of the finished product with maximum accuracy.  A laboratory alcohol meter can be of several types, each of which has its own range on the measuring scale, which allows the study of liquids of various strengths. </p><p>  It should be noted that such devices are made from environmentally friendly materials and do not contain mercury.  The product is quite compact and lightweight, so it does not take up much space during storage.  A laboratory alcohol meter is simple enough to use: to determine the density of a solution, the device is immersed in a liquid so that it can float freely without touching the container.  In addition, this measuring device is certified and has been in great demand among the population for many years. </p><p>  An electronic alcoholometer is a necessary and useful thing in the household, as well as a great gift for any winemaker. </p>
