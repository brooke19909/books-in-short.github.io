There is a simple explanation for this - ideal conditions for rest and recreation included in the hotel‚Äôs accommodation system.  With an abundance of entertainment and a choice of leisure options, Turkey remains the most economical resort holiday option.  Usually, Antalya or Aegean coasts are chosen for the trip. </p><h2>  Holidays on the Aegean coast </h2><p>  More tourists choose the <span>Antalya coast</span> for leisure <span>.</span>  Here is the most developed infrastructure of the leisure industry: a large selection of resorts and excursion programs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="garden of sun hotel spa wellness 5 beaches vacation with children" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/802760.jpg" width="524"></div>  Aegean coast is chosen less frequently.  However, at the peak of the season, in July and August, it would be advisable to consider a vacation in this particular resort.  Its options for beaches and the hotel base are not inferior in quality, but the tourist flow is less and the heat is not as sultry as at the same time in the resorts of Antalya.  This is even more important when the trip is organized with children and the gentle sun of Aegean is more suitable for them.  There is no big difference in the cost and quality of holidays at these resorts in Turkey.
