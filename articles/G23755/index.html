It is enough to take an ordinary paper or linen napkin and fold it in a special way to add a little comfort to the kitchen.  There is a very easy way to make roses from <span>napkins with your own hands, a</span> step-by-step guide to which will be given below. </p><h2>  Simple flower made of napkins </h2><p>  Bouquets created from ordinary office corrugated or papyrus paper are often used to create decorative compositions and installations.  There are many options for making roses from napkins with your own hands (photos of some products are given in the review). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theidearoom.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="topiary with roses from napkins" class="if uuid-2456382" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2456382.jpg"></div><p>  The easiest way is to fold the paper several times, place a glass on top and circle the bottom with a pencil.  If you cut the same circles, fix them in the center with a stapler and fluff the layers, you can get flowers resembling pink buds.  They are often used to make numbers from cardboard for children's parties, to create topiaries and decorative balls. </p><h2>  Tea rose for tea </h2><p>  Let's try to make a tea rose from napkins with a candy inside.  For work, we need the following materials: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  one large two-layer napkin; </li><li>  one single-layer napkin; </li><li>  candy; </li><li>  pencil; </li><li>  wooden skewer for the stalk; </li><li>  glue gun; </li><li>  thin cotton yarn; </li><li>  green corrugated paper; </li><li>  green wire; </li><li>  green floristic ribbon; </li><li>  nippers; </li><li>  ordinary scissors and with cloves; </li><li>  two blanks for leaves of different sizes. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.westwing.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="napkin rose" class="if uuid-2456221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2456221.jpg"></div><p>  If desired, only a floral ribbon can be used to decorate the trunk, and not candy can be placed inside the bud, but a foil or newspaper folded into a ball. </p><h2>  Roses from napkins: a step-by-step guide </h2><p>  Create a flower to decorate the interior or an unusual gift.  Its size will depend on the length of the stick and the volume of the core. </p><ol><li>  At the first stage of making roses from a napkin, we cut the corrugated paper into several strips with our own hands. </li><li>  Cut them to the width of the leaf patterns. </li><li>  In roses, leaves are collected on a twig of five pieces.  One of them, large, is located on top. </li><li>  The other four, smaller, are fixed opposite. </li></ol><p>  For one flower, two branches will suffice, that is, you need to prepare 2 large leaves and 8 small ones.  You can do more if you wish. </p><h2>  How to make foliage for a rose </h2><ol><li>  We cut a strip of paper into rectangles, attach blanks to them and cut foliage along them. </li><li>  Then we make the edges corrugated with scissors with teeth. </li><li>  We measure 10 cm from the wire and cut it off - this will be the central branch.  For the side leaves, fold the segment in half and divide it into two parts. </li><li>  We straighten the tips and apply glue on one side. </li><li>  Fold each leaf in half, attach a wire to the center and press. </li><li>  When all the parts have dried, we collect them in one branch: first we take a wire with large sheets and fasten a couple of small ones on the sides.  With a floral tape, we begin to wrap the branch, going down. </li><li>  Then we add two more and also wrap them with tape, fixing its edge with glue. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailymail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napkin Origami Rose" class="if uuid-2456333" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2456333.jpg"></div><p>  In order for the twig of roses from napkins to look more natural, you can give the foliage a curved shape, pulling it a bit by the edges. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Making sepals from corrugated paper </h2><p>  Now we need to make sepals. </p><ol><li>  To do this, take a piece of green paper 6 cm wide and about 8 cm high. </li><li>  Fold it in half, and then bend it to determine the middle. </li><li>  We open the workpiece, take the scissors and begin to cut the cloves. </li><li>  The stalk of roses from napkins will also be decorated with corrugated paper.  We cut a rectangle from it 2 cm wide and slightly longer than the wooden skewer you prepared. </li></ol><h2>  Blanks for rose petals </h2><p>  Now let's start creating the bud.  To do this, take a large two-layer napkin and cut it into strips. </p><ol><li>  We bend it in half and cut off the fold line - the upper part of the resulting rectangle. </li><li>  Now you need to fold the canvas so that one part is shorter, and the other is longer by about a centimeter. </li><li>  We cut along the fold line and unfold the resulting strips.  There should be four identical parts. </li><li>  We put one of them aside, and from the rest we will create a bud.  To do this, take a pencil, place it in the middle of one of the strips on the very edge and begin to twist the part into a tube, but not to the end, but about 1/3 of the length. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="supermakeit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper rose in a cup" class="if uuid-2456301" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2456301.jpg"></div><h2>  Cut the petals </h2><p>  Next, cut the petals. </p><ol><li>  We bend the quarter of the strip and round the napkin on the upper part from two sides. </li><li>  Then bend again to 1/4 and cut the corners. </li><li>  We repeat all the actions until we get to the end.  The deeper the incisions, the more open the resulting rose from the napkin. </li><li>  On the next layer, make one more petal. </li><li>  On the third, we again increase the number of petals by one. </li><li>  Once again, twist the tips of the napkins with a pencil or skewer. </li></ol><h2>  Middle for a rose </h2><p>  Before making a rose from a napkin, you need to make its core.  You can use any candy, but the larger it is, the larger the flower will turn out. </p><ol><li>  We wrap the treat with a small napkin, forming a bud, and then place the wooden skewer at the bottom. </li><li>  We put a glue gun to warm up. </li><li>  At this time, we take the yarn and fix the leg with it, tightly wrapping the bottom of the future flower.  Additionally we fix the parts with glue. </li><li>  Cut the thread and take the strip cut from a large napkin, without petals. </li><li>  We wrap it in the middle, periodically turning the edge a little to get a shape resembling a rose bud. </li><li>  We fix the edge with glue and take the workpiece with the largest number of petals. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="supermakeit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fold a napkin" class="if uuid-2456331" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2456331.jpg"></div><p>  Before making a rose from a <span>napkin with our own hands, we</span> collect the lower edge of the paper with an accordion and gently squeeze it.  You can immediately process all the workpieces in this way. </p><h2>  Flower assembly </h2><ol><li>  We begin to form a rose: we take a napkin and begin to wrap it in the middle so that the bent petals look outward. </li><li>  Having finished, we fix the flower with a thread in the lower part and additionally process it with glue. </li><li>  Repeat all the steps with the rest of the workpieces. </li><li>  When finished, we straighten the petals and glue the sepals, stretching the corrugated paper around the rose. </li><li>  Now we take the floral ribbon and begin to wrap it around the skewer. </li><li>  Then we fix the first branch with leaves and, going down a bit, cut off the floral ribbon and fix the tip with glue. </li><li>  Now we take a piece of corrugated paper, which we prepared for the stem, and wrap it with a skewer, previously lubricating it with glue. </li><li>  On the fold line we place the second branch with leaves and glue the edges. </li><li>  We cut off the excess - and the rose from the napkins is ready. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.seriouseats.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rose from napkin scheme" class="if uuid-2456736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2456736.jpg"></div><h2>  Rose origami from napkins </h2><p>  The origami technique is known to everyone, it allows you to create three-dimensional figures from paper of various densities.  It can also be used to make roses from a regular napkin. </p><ol><li>  Expand the napkin and fold each of the four corners in the center, make sure that your folds lay the center of the square. </li><li>  Take the corners again and fold them in the center, then repeat these steps a third time. </li><li>  Turn over a napkin and bend corners to the central part. </li><li>  Pull the ends of the corners from the bottom, holding them with your palm. </li><li>  Draw corners to create petals. </li></ol><p>  Repeat the steps to make many roses from napkins - as many as you need. </p>
