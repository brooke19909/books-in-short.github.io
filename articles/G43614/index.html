In 2005, the Finns came to the conclusion that their products are seriously behind their competitors, and this primarily concerned design.  Competitors produced more elegant <span>thin phones,</span> which forced the management of Nokia to make appropriate adjustments.  At the same time, the <span>Nokia 6500</span> Classic was not only a new milestone in terms of appearance, but also got an optimized technical stuffing.  To date, this model is considered one of the best in the history of the manufacturer. </p>

    <h2>  Model Specifications </h2><p>  The success of the model is caused not so much by a breakthrough in one of the directions, but by a combination of diverse advantages.  This can be judged by the characteristics of the device: </p><ul><li>  The phone platform is Series 40. </li><li>  Dimensions - 109.8 mm in length, 45 mm in width and 9.5 mm in thickness. </li><li>  Type of construction - Nokia 6500 Classic case is made in the classic ‚Äútube‚Äù shape. </li><li>  Mass - 94 g. </li><li>  Battery - 830 mAh Li-ion. </li><li>  Display - TFT with support for 16 million colors. </li><li>  Sound - 64-tone polyphony. </li><li>  Connectors - MicroUSB for connecting to a PC, USB for a charger and USB 2 support. </li></ul><h2>  Design and materials </h2><p>  The design is a classic solution for handsets.  However, the elongation of the body and layout still give a hint of originality.  Do not forget that the Nokia 6500 was designed as a designer.  But the version with the Classic prefix differs in materials.  If metal was practically not used in models from competitors of that time, the Finnish device is equipped with <span>anodized aluminum.</span>  There are two options: the Nokia 6500 Classic Bronze, as well as the black version.  In both cases, the unique polishing of the metal surface emphasizes the external gloss of the phones.  However, the developers had space for further movement towards improving the case.  So, in some models stainless steel was already actively used, which meanwhile looked more solid.  One way or another, the design turned out worthy not only in terms of design, but also in ease of use. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  No major changes have occurred in this part.  The device received the camera module that was already used in the 6300 series. This is a two-megapixel CMOS device, which, however, by 2005 standards can be considered a good achievement.  Another thing is that this technological solution is not implemented in the best way.  The manufacturer Nokia 6500 Classic has relied on camera options, but at the expense of quality.  As a result, the process of photographing requires a certain skill from the user to get a more or less clear and not blurry picture.  By the way, the camera resolution is 1600 x 1200, which also does not characterize the photographic capabilities of the device in the best way.  And now for the pleasant.  The module is equipped with an 8x zoom, the shutter sound can be turned off, and 5 different effects are offered as design tools.  In general, for a phone from the middle price segment, such a camera design cannot be called a failure, but taking into account the brand and positioning the model as a business class device, this is rather a minus. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  For the display, a QVGA type module was used, which has a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels.  The size is average, and by and large it can be called optimal for models of this class.  The screen differs in pretty good color rendition with rich colors.  True, fans of reconfiguring phones for themselves will be disappointed by the fact that the creators of the Nokia 6500 Classic did not provide tools for adjusting the brightness of the display.  But there are positive aspects to this.  Firstly, the existing settings can really be called optimal and comfortable, and secondly, uniform illumination contributes to a more economical energy consumption.  In any case, if necessary, the backlight can be completely turned off, but then it will be possible to distinguish anything on the screen only at an angle and in good light.  The screen is also provided with a mirror layer, thanks to which, even in bright sunshine, you can easily distinguish text.  But here, many will be disappointed by the small screen resolution - it is enough to view messages, but it will not work to evaluate the same image quality. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  MicroUSB and Bluetooth </h2><p>  The presence of a MicroUSB connector provides the ability to connect the device both for transmitting information and for connecting to a headset or charger.  In addition, Nokia 6500 Classic supports the standard USB Mass Storage mode, due to which the speed of information transfer increases to 600 Kb / s. </p><p>  Although some competitors models with the same MicroUSB connector provided higher performance.  In particular, this can be said about the Motorola's RAZR2 V8.  One way or another, the integration of MicroUSB into the phones of the 2000s is worthy of praise.  It is worth noting that this connector allows you to charge the Nokia 6500 Classic.  The battery is powered regardless of the mode in which USB is operating.  Bluetooth technology in version 2 with EDR has also been successfully implemented.  The user is offered a wide selection of profiles and stable operation of the connection. </p>

    <h2>  Games and programs </h2><p>  Unfortunately, gamers and lovers of useful applications in this device, unfortunately, will not find it.  First of all, this is a list of games familiar to Nokia fans, including Snake III, Rally 3D, Sudoku, and others. The programs for Nokia 6500 Classic, which are represented by converters and sensors, are not spoiled.  However, if desired, you can download any application in Java format.  Fortunately, there is every opportunity for this.  The user can use wireless or download via cable.  A CD with a program manager for this model is supplied with the device.  Using this software, you can easily manage files by transferring them to a computer or, conversely, uploading them to the phone‚Äôs memory.  By the way, about the memory - there are no special card slots for building it up, but the built-in volume of 1 GB looks impressive.  Moreover, the large amounts of data in this phone are simply useless.  It can only be multimedia materials and audio files. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Almost all the advantages of the phones of the Finnish manufacturer converged in the model, for which users of different categories rated it.  Of course, this is a strict style, a robust case, stable operation and the absence of obvious defects.  It was the design of many that attracted the first time it entered the market, and the build quality and durability did not give reason to be disappointed in the purchase.  After nearly a decade, many praise the impeccable condition of the Nokia 6500 Classic.  Its price is 4000‚Äì5000 rubles, which seems excessive for a model with such functionality, but acceptable, given the quality of technical and stylistic implementation. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 6500 classic reviews" class="if" height="171" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1021466.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Also, owners note the ergonomics of the device.  And not only external, but also internal - in relation to the interface.  The phone case is compact, thin and comfortable.  In turn, menu management and its organization itself have always been the strengths of Nokia models, and in the 6500 Classic series these qualities have reached their peak.  In a sense, this phone has become the standard of convenience, comfort and reliability.  At the same time, the build quality and durability did not go to the detriment of other characteristics of the device.  Both the authors' design idea coupled with an aluminum panel, and ergonomics, according to the owners, deserve the highest praise. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  As the advantages of the model are unambiguous, its disadvantages are obvious.  Despite the many consonant opinions, there are complaints about the offensive lack of a radio, a weak battery and the generally poor performance of the Nokia 6500 Classic.  Reviews, of course, do not bypass the device‚Äôs camera.  Pictures can be used purely for utilitarian purposes, although photographing legible text is also problematic.  Unfortunately, this drawback makes the device an exclusively fashion model without serious claims to performance and functional excesses.  There are also negative opinions about comfort in operation.  It should be noted the top connection of the cable for headphones and small keyboard buttons.  However, there are also opposite impressions about these characteristics of the model, so everything is individual here. </p><p>  If you compare the device with direct competitors from Motorola and Samsung, then there is insufficient battery.  Users criticize the developers for the fact that the phone is not able to be in an intensive working condition for a long time.  At the time of the mid-2000s, this problem was not so acute, since even the average according to the requirements of 6500 Classic did not use such volumes of energy as in the case of modern smartphones. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Although today the time of tube cases is gradually losing relevance, there are many connoisseurs of this particular segment.  At the same time, new representatives of this segment are far from always able to provide the same level of reliability that Nokia 6500 Classic phones with metal elements of the body and a well-thought-out technical base once set.  Of course, in terms of functionality, this model used to lose to competitors, but today it does not even reach the entry-level devices.  Nevertheless, the fact that the phones have served for years, providing good quality communications, allows you to forget about many of the shortcomings.  Plus, in the device sound is well implemented.  Good audibility and uninterrupted communication allow the model to perfectly cope with its immediate tasks. </p>
