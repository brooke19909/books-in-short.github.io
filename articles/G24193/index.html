But this does not mean that it will be boring here.  You have the opportunity to play tennis, go diving, as well as visit the steam sauna and take advantage of a huge range of services.  After an active day, be sure to eat in the restaurant, which serves the best of Mediterranean cuisine. <br><br>  Harry's Hotel 3 * cares about the comfort of its guests, and therefore provides beautifully decorated rooms for living.  There is a complete set of necessary furniture and household appliances.  But the central place is occupied by the balcony, especially when it comes to the upper floors.  It offers incredibly beautiful views of the sea and the surrounding nature. <br><br>  Not far from the Harry's Hotel (Cyprus) is a public sandy beach.  But if you do not want to leave the hotel, an outdoor pool is at your service.  It is very well maintained and clean, and around it there are a large number of sunbeds.  If the weather turns out to be cold, then the hotel staff will include water heating. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the resort located </h2><p>  Resort Harry's Hotel 3 * (Protaras) is located in a quiet area on the outskirts of the city.  This place is characterized by beautiful beaches and nature.  Since Pratoras is a rather small town, literally in 5 minutes you can reach its center, where there are many shops, cafes and entertainment centers.  You will also have the opportunity to visit the famous resort of Ayia Napa, which is only 10 kilometers away from this village.  As for <span>the Larnaca</span> International <span>Airport,</span> you will have to overcome almost 90 km to it. </p><h2>  Guest apartments </h2><p>  All rooms at Harry's Hotel 3 * Resort (Cyprus, Protaras) are in the standard category.  They represent a spacious room, which is divided into zones of the bedroom and living room.  Accommodation can be made both on large and one and a half beds.  The apartment also has two armchairs and a soft sofa, which serves as an extra bed.  All rooms have access to a small private balcony.  You can choose the option of accommodation with sea or city views, which in some way affect the cost of living. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Perhaps the only drawback is the Harry's Hotel room interior.  Reviews, photos - all this indicates that the rooms are decorated very simply and nondescript.  In addition, all furniture, plumbing and household appliances are quite old, and some require not only repair, but also a complete replacement. </p>

    <h2>  Positive hotel reviews </h2><p>  The sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpositive emotions leaves tourists at the resort Harry's Hotel.  Reviews about this institution especially note the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  the road to the sea leads through the territory of the neighboring hotel, which is very beautiful and always accessible for walking; </li><li>  a great place for those who love peace and tranquility; </li><li>  Friendly and polite staff who are always ready to help; </li><li>  very beautiful views from the windows of the rooms, which are facing the sea; </li><li>  Accommodation prices are very affordable. </li></ul><h2>  Negative hotel reviews </h2><p>  Travelers found some flaws at Harry's Hotel (Cyprus).  Reviews include the following negative comments: </p><ul><li>  the air conditioners are old and practically do not cool the air, and therefore it is impossible to hide from the heat in the room or in the hall; </li><li>  the hotel is very old and has long required major repairs and furniture replacement; </li><li>  the food is very scarce and the dishes are tasteless; </li><li>  despite the fact that the restaurant is not so happy with the assortment and quality, you won‚Äôt be allowed to take food that you didn‚Äôt eat with you (it even reaches the point of absurdity with a search of the bags because you were suspected of what you decided pick up your toast); </li><li>  sometimes the reception staff specially give the guests disgusting rooms, then to demand an impressive surcharge for relocation; </li><li>  Of course, in many hotels you can find a paid safe, but a paid fridge is something new; </li><li>  the beach is very small, and it is always crowded there, as people gather from all the surrounding hotels. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  In order to characterize this resort hotel, one word will be enough - budget.  The low cost is due not only to the remote location, but also to the general dilapidation of the hotel.  The room decor is quite old, and the equipment works with varying degrees of success.  Needless to say, you should not even dream about quality food in the dining room.  The sea is located, although not far, but the beach is very small and quite dirty.  The only consolation here is the pool, which is kept clean. </p><p>  We can say that this hotel will be a good economical option for tourists who do not like to sit still.  If you just need an inexpensive place to sleep (also with a beautiful view from the window), then here you are.  In the afternoon, head to the center of Protaras.  Here you will find inexpensive restaurants with very tasty food, shops and a lot of entertainment.  You can also find a more spacious and well-groomed beach.  Be sure to go on an excursion to neighboring settlements.  The ideal option is to rent a car to familiarize yourself with all the tourist attractions.  Thus, settling in this hotel, you can save a lot of money to ensure interesting leisure. </p>
