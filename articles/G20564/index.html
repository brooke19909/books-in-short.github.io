  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the income tax rate?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Taxes are a sore point, both for the state and for <span>private individuals who are</span> engaged in business.  Every second strives to evade them, believing that the state has no <span>right to establish</span> such requisitions and that it has nothing to pay for.  You can convince a malicious tax adversary only by showing him how the income tax rate is calculated and where these funds go. </p><p>  The fact is that the state of the federal budget depends on how well people pay taxes.  And already from the federal budget funds are allocated for the salaries of police, medical workers, traffic controllers, guards, military, fire service, janitors ... Just imagine if the federal budget is small and does not pay money for labor to all these people?  The city will turn into chaos: it will be dirty on the streets because the janitors will not go to work, crime will flourish, people will die, because they will not be provided with timely medical care ... It would be scary to live in such a place.  It is also necessary to take into account the fact that it is from the federal budget that salaries are paid to all government officials, leaders, as well as the head of state.  That is, the income tax rate is your small contribution to the calm and peaceful coexistence of people in your city and country. </p><p>  <span>The tax service</span> for each company takes an individual approach.  Here, when calculating the corporate income tax rate, many factors are taken into account.  And this is right, because all firms and enterprises are different from each other.  For example, <span>the income tax rate</span> for enterprises engaged in educational or medical activities is in most cases 0%.  Most manufacturing enterprises pay 20% of their profits to the state.  Foreign enterprises that organized their activities on the territory of our country give 30% of their profits to the federal budget, which, by the way, is a lot. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All these nuances are reported to each private person when he is just about to register his business.  The income tax rate is calculated directly at it.  Therefore, there is only one way out: if you do not want to pay, turn off the business. </p><p>  By the way, a profit tax rate of only 13.5% is proposed for a special economic zone.  If the income is in the form of dividends, the tax is also equal to 0%.  <span>Debt obligations</span> are taxed at 15% of profits.  By the way, you can consider <span>special tax regimes,</span> perhaps some is suitable for you, then the income tax rate will be zero.  Gambling establishments have such a special tax treatment.  As a rule, they do not pay income tax. </p><p>  There are difficulties in filling out documents when determining what rate of income tax will be assigned to your company.  We will analyze the basic terms that usually raise a number of questions.  The first of these is the Object of taxation.  In the tax service and financial law, this term refers to the profit of the organization.  By the way, profit also needs to be calculated.  This is usually the difference between the costs and revenues of the enterprise.  In order to calculate the object of taxation correctly, you must provide the service with documents confirming the facts of revenue and committing any kind of embezzlement.  By the way, only those costs of the enterprise that can be called justified are considered as expenses.  Everything else does not count. </p><p>  Taxation has its own time periods, which are called quarters.  It is important to know the meaning of the term <span>"tax base".</span>  This is nothing more than the monetary equivalent of the profit on which the tax rate will be charged.  That, in fact, is all that people who want to start their own business, honestly pay taxes and sleep peacefully should know.  The income tax rate is not a deception of the state, but a necessary necessity. </p>
