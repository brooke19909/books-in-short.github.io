No apples, no cherries, or other horticultural crops could be seen on the local market.  Meanwhile, as reported in the article, attempts have been made to breed them in the region for a long time.  Mr. Nikiforov‚Äôs nursery endowed with state-owned land is cited as examples, as well as the achievements of the fruit-grower Mr. Olonichenko, whose scale of activity, according to the newspaper‚Äôs correspondent, is very insignificant. </p><p>  In December 1910, the Krasnoyarsk City Duma raised the question of the need to allocate a plot of urban land to equip the experimental field.  What is an experimental field in Krasnoyarsk?  Information about this is provided in the article. </p>

    <h2>  The meaning of the term </h2><p>  This term refers to objects that are part of a network of research institutes or agricultural experimental stations.  In field experiments, the effectiveness of various technologies of cultivating crops, mineral and organic fertilizers, methods of combating soil erosion, plant protection products, etc. is studied. In addition, the Experimental Field is a geographical name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Which objects are so named? </h2><p>  Several settlements with this name are known.  In Kazakhsan, this is the name of the village in the Glubokovsky district (East Kazakhstan region).

Apples were brought here from other provinces.  It is known that in 1909 a large number of fruits were imported from Samara and Syzran.  As a result, wholesale purchase prices decreased, but booths still sold for 10-12 kopecks.  kilo.

    <p>  In the winter of 2010, the city council laid the foundation for the development of an experimental field in Krasnoyarsk.  In the future, an experimental station was supposed to grow on its basis, in which the work of other experimental institutions would be combined.  In sec.  Kazachinsky, near the city of Minusinsk, in the Minusinsk district, near the beet-sugar factory, Tagarsky island, experimental fields were already functioning at that time.  The Duma returned to this issue in 1912.  A decision was made on the provision of leased urban land for the construction of an experimental field in Krasnoyarsk. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What was the site? </h2><p>  The allocated site, in fact, was an inter-facet located between pasture peasant and Cossack lands in the village of Solontsovsky, in Zaledeevsky volost, and an adjacent narrow strip to the river.  Cache.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe plot was 513.77 acres.  The soil was clay dry land, considered unsuitable for crops, haying, and pastures.  The station staff was to consist of 2 agronomists, several workers and employees.  In 1912, D. D. Nashchokin was appointed the head of the experimental field. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  It is known that in the beginning, housing was built for staff, an office, a chemical laboratory, a stable, a <span>weather station, a</span> vegetation house, storage rooms and a library.  In addition, a fence was built around the site with a length of 2 thousand fathoms.  The head of the field was allocated an apartment of 6, the assistant - of 4, the observer of the weather station - of 2 rooms and a kitchen.  The premises were furnished at the expense of the city budget. </p><p>  On the experimental field, tests were conducted of potatoes, various varieties of cereals: oats, wheat, oats, spring rye, herbs.  An exchange of experience was established with US farmers. </p>

    <p>  In 1914, D. D. Nashchokin collected a collection of samples of bread seeds from different counties of the Yenisei province.  The scientist's goal was to study the quality of grain of bread, the selection of the most profitable varieties for growing in the region.  Scientific work was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I.  D. D. Nashchokin worked on the experimental field for eight years.  In April 1921, he was replaced by VV Sabashnikov, who was tragically killed in the dungeons of the OGPU. </p><h2>  Current days </h2><p>  The Soviet government reorganized the experimental field into a fruit and berry station.  Great professionals worked here.  In the late 30s, S. M. Shcherbachenko was appointed director of the station.  In 1941, all the men, employees of the station, went to the front.  After returning, S. M. Shcherbachenko served as the director of a nursery in Achinsk.  Until 1968, at the Krasnoyarsk station, N. S. Simonov worked as director. </p><p>  Today, after more than 100 years, the <span>Krasnoyarsk Territory</span> takes one of the leading positions in Siberia in the development of gardening.  Thanks to the activities of the employees of the experimental station, Krasnoyarsk residents have a huge variety of varieties of fruit trees: plums, apple trees, currants, etc. </p><h2>  Experimental Field (Balashikha) </h2><p>  It is known that residents of the metropolitan microdistrict them.  Gagarin (Experimental Field), endowed with the status of a closed settlement, for many years remained in relative prosperity and comfort.  In the 30s, a station was opened here to test new airfield coatings and aircraft landing systems. </p>

    <p>  In the future, the benefits of civilization in the microdistrict were not provided by the city-forming organization - the 26th Central Research Institute, which still has a classified signature.  The station and the 26th Central Research Institute made a significant contribution to the development of domestic aviation.  On the territory of the closed facilities of the Experimental Field, projects were developed for military airfields, methods of erecting protective structures, and new technologies were constantly searched for. </p><p>  Residents of the village recall that 30-50 years ago it was calm, quiet, organized, the military town was always very well-groomed and decent.  In a clear forest with large clearings and edges, the children played football.  Old-timers mention a lake near the Experimental Field, which turned into a skating rink in winter.  Today, according to the population, life in the microdistrict has not worsened.  And yet this place is called healthy, belonging to the geobioactive zone. </p>

    <h2>  Kotelniki </h2><p>  The experimental field in Kotelniki is the former village of the Lyubertsy experimental field (Lyubertsy district).  Information about its history is not provided for free access.  Today, the district consists of several residential buildings, abandoned technical buildings and a metro station.  On the territory there is also a medical center, a grocery store, a tennis club.  It is known that in the near future the microdistrict will be demolished - a city hospital will be built in its place. </p><h2>  Ulyanovsk </h2><p>  The history of the Experimental Field in Ulyanovsk dates back to the distant 1859, when, through the efforts of Count V.P. Orlov-Davydov, an agricultural society was created to assist landowners. </p><p>  In February 1971, the village was included in the city of Ulyanovsk.  In addition to the regional office of beekeeping and the wax processing plant, which have been operating for several decades, they have opened a procurement office, a motor transport enterprise, a plant protection station, a fire department, as well as a number of construction organizations. </p>
