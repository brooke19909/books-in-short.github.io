But not everyone understands the type of card, especially in its payment system.  Ignorance of the possibilities of credit and debit cards is often the reason for the wrong choice of a banking product.  One of the most popular types of credit cards in Russia are cards like "Maestro".  But the payment system of Maestro cards remains a mystery to many users. </p><h2>  What types of payment systems exist in the banking sector of Russia? </h2><p>  The Russian market is actively using non-cash payment options, and more than 100 million citizens have become cardholders.  Such an abundance of banking products obliges banks to cooperate with the most popular companies that issue credit cards. </p><p>  Currently, 95% of Russian banks can issue bank cards of the following payment systems: </p><ul><li>  "WORLD". </li><li>  Master Card. </li><li>  Visa </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.bezahlen.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payment system maestro sberbank" class="if uuid-2955699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2955699.jpg"></div><p>  MIR is the first and so far the only payment system in Russia.  Visa and Master Card are foreign companies.  Visa is an American payment system, and Master Card belongs to a multinational company. </p><h2>  Features of the choice of payment system </h2><p>  The choice of a payment system is the prerogative of the cardholder.  The client himself is determined which product of the company he would like to have. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Those who choose cards of an inexpensive price category often ask themselves: ‚ÄúWhat is the payment system of the Maestro card?‚Äù  This is important, since the payment system affects not only the number of bonuses and privileges from partners, but also the points of credit card acceptance. </p><p>  Those who often travel to European countries are recommended by bank employees to open Master Card payment system cards.  This payment system is accepted in almost all retail outlets in Europe, and the conversion by Master Card is made in euros. </p><div class="photo" data-original="penzanews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="maestro payment system" class="if uuid-2955662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2955662.jpg"></div><p>  Visa-based cards are more common in the countries of the American continent, so when traveling to these regions, it is recommended to give preference to credit cards of this payment system.  Convert Visa cards in US dollars. </p><h2>  Map "Maestro": features of the banking product </h2><p>  When choosing a type of bank card, first of all, many customers start from the price category of a product.  And one of the most affordable plastic cards are Maestro credit cards. </p><p>  Payment system of the card "Maestro" - <span>Master Card.</span>  The product itself is one of the directions of issuing credit cards and debit cards.  From the classic Master Card credit cards, "Maestro" has a low cost and limited functionality. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This applies in particular to the cash withdrawal limit.  On cards of the classic format, the limit for cash withdrawals per day is an average of 150-200 thousand rubles.  On "Maestro" cards of the Master Card payment system, the limit is much lower - up to 50 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Appearance and device of the card "Maestro" </h2><p>  The design of credit cards and debit cards like "Maestro" is not remarkable.  Such cards are issued either in one color or in a classic color scheme.  The main focus of the creators of the series is not on the uniqueness of the design and attractiveness of the product, but on its price category. </p><p>  Master cards of Master Card payment system are Economy class products.  They are available to all customers who are eligible for a credit card.  The cost of servicing Maestro in Russian banks ranges from 0 to 300 rubles. </p><p>  The card device is identical to the cards of the classic format.  On the front side are indicated the full name of the client (with the exception of instant issuance cards), validity period of the plastic, name of the issuing bank, credit card number.  On the right side is a chip that serves to protect client data. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sberbank.ba" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="maestro card what payment system" class="if uuid-2955656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2955656.jpg"></div><p>  Until 2016, more than 70% of Maestro cards of the Master Card payment system did not have a chip.  But after 2 years, everything changed, and now even cards of the "old" type are automatically re-issued with additional protection. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The CVV2 code is indicated on the back of the card.  This is a 3-digit cipher that is required for secure online shopping.  It is located next to the ribbon for the signature of the card holder. </p><p>  The bank‚Äôs contacts (Support Service) are also registered behind, they are necessary for the client to communicate with specialists. </p><h2>  Differences between the Maestro Card and the Classic Master Card Products </h2><p>  Choosing between a Standard line of cards and an Economy product, few people know how credit cards differ from each other. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sberbank.si" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="card maestro whose payment system" class="if uuid-2955644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2955644.jpg"></div><p>  But the payment card "Maestro" was not developed by chance.  And its main differences from the Master Card Standart are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Low cost of annual maintenance.  This is its main advantage.  In some banks you can get a Maestro card absolutely free. </li><li>  Low cash withdrawal limit.  This feature was noticed by customers who were quick to choose a debit card.  The desire to save money is not always profitable: if the limit for withdrawing per day is exhausted, you will have to pay a commission to the bank for the remaining funds. </li><li>  Standard design.  Unlike classic cards, the design of which the client can develop independently (for an additional fee), Maestro cards are issued only in the form of a bank. </li><li>  The quality of the plastic.  Master Card Standart serve the customer longer, despite the same validity period - from 3 to 5 years.  After 1-2 years of active use (at least 1 time per day), Maestro cards lose their appearance. </li><li>  Quality protection.  The chip on the front side of the Maestro is less secure than the standard Master Card.  Many users note a gradual deterioration in the work of a credit card, which leads to the need to issue a reissue of a card ahead of schedule. </li></ul><h2>  Master Card or Visa?  Which card is better to choose </h2><p>  Choosing between Visa or "Maestro" (which payment system is better), you should only rely on your own expectations in using the product.  Both companies offer a package of services for cardholders of their payment system.  But not all options are available to owners of inexpensive credit cards. </p><p>  The main feature for a Russian citizen will be the difference in the conversion of currencies when traveling abroad.  Euros or dollars - that‚Äôs what the client who plans to travel to other countries will have to choose between.  And what type of conversion the account holder will have depends on the choice of the payment system. </p><p>  If traveling abroad is not the main reason for choosing a credit card, then you can study the bonuses offered by partners. </p><p>  Visa cards have this: </p><ul><li>  10% discount at the RIVIERA water park in Kazan. </li><li>  Up to 6% discount on Mercedes-Benz cars from an authorized dealer. </li><li>  Up to 25% on the products of natural cosmetics from the UK The Body Shop. </li><li>  Premium services at Sheremetyevo at a special price. </li><li>  Decoration as a gift when buying in SUNLIGHT stores. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="saravanan-works.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="maestro payment system" class="if uuid-2955685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2955685.jpg"></div><p>  For Maestro cards there are offers: </p><ul><li>  10% discount on a ticket to CINEMA PARK and Formula Kino, as well as 50% at the PIONER cinema. </li><li>  Free 1 month ivi online cinema subscription. </li><li>  15% on <span>Starbucks</span> products <span>.</span> </li><li>  <span>Certificate for 3,000 rubles when buying online at the Technopark (subject to special conditions).</span> </li><li>  <span>10% on reservations at the Nevsky Forum Hotel.</span> </li></ul><h2>  Pros and Cons of the Maestro Card </h2><p>  Having decided to opt for the Maestro card, whose payment system is Master Card, bank customers often doubt whether it is worth opening an inexpensive card like Maestro.  This product has its advantages and disadvantages, namely: </p><ol><li>  Not the best protection - an option for those who will not keep all the savings in the credit card account.  Maestro customers need to be prepared for the fact that over time they will have to reissue the card due to the poor quality of the plastic. </li><li>  Inexpensive price is a great way to save on choosing a card product.  Not everyone can afford to open Master Card for 3,000 rubles a year and more.  And "Maestro" in some banks (for example, Sberbank) opens for free. </li><li>  Standard feature set.  "Maestro" accept almost all outlets, it can be paid on the Internet and abroad. </li><li>  Classic design.  The inability to order a card with a personal design upsets some users, but only 1.5% of credit card holders around the world use this opportunity. </li></ol><h2>  Product Overview "Maestro" (using the Sberbank Social card as an example) </h2><p>  The "Maestro" card of the Sberbank of the Master Card payment system is one of the most popular products in Russia.  Every 3rd pensioner receives deductions to her account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.investireoggi.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payment system maestro sberbank" class="if uuid-2955625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2955625.jpg"></div><p>  It has a bright spring print design.  Available for retirement income, including benefits.  Design and maintenance are free. </p><p>  On a quarterly basis, the bank multiplies the account balance by 3.5% per annum (only pension and other contributions are taken into account).  Clients can withdraw cash throughout Russia without a commission (at Sberbank ATMs). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="card maestro payment system" class="if uuid-2955621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2955621.jpg"></div><p>  Sberbank's Maestro card, whose payment system is Master Card, is available for registration by citizens of 18 years and older who are eligible to receive pensions. </p><p>  The daily <span>limit on cash withdrawals</span> at ATMs is 50 thousand rubles.
