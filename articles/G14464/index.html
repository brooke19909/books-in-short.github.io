Reviews about this institution note the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  in the rooms located on the first and second floors there are many ants; </li><li>  too small pool, which does not fit everyone; </li><li>  numbers are opened with a regular key, not a magnetic card; </li><li>  the door to the bathroom creaks heavily; </li><li>  the floor in the room is tiled, which is cold to walk barefoot; </li><li>  the pool has too few sun loungers, and therefore it is almost impossible to find a free place (they are occupied in the morning); </li><li>  most of the apartments have old refrigerators, which practically do not fulfill their functions; </li><li>  during dinner, drinks are not included in the price (even for drinking water you have to pay extra); </li><li>  contrary to hotel rules, small children are required to pay extra; </li><li>  the hotel has too few workers, and therefore they physically do not have time to cope with their duties; </li><li>  the breakfast menu is repeated every day; </li><li>  the staff does not speak Russian (therefore, you need to know the basic phrases for communicating in English); </li><li>  there is not enough space in the restaurant to accommodate all vacationers, and therefore, during breakfast, you often have to stand in line; </li><li>  the territory is quite quiet and calm, which contributes to a complete family vacation; </li><li>  instead of double beds, the rooms have separate beds, which are constantly moving apart due to the castors on legs; </li><li>  cosmetic accessories are available only upon check-in, but during the stay they are not replenished; </li><li>  there are no clothes dryers in the bathroom or on the balcony; </li><li>  too small territory, on which there is practically no place for walking. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The main claims to this institution are related to the fact that it does not correspond to the modern four-star institution.  Everything here is quite outdated (both furniture and appliances).  Nevertheless, here you will be provided with quality service and good nutrition.  It is also impossible not to say about the convenient location, which makes this place ideal for active tourists. </p>
