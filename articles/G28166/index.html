The name of the village from Turkish translates as "the finest sand."  Incekum is considered one of the most popular places on the Antalya coast.  Local beaches stretch along the Mediterranean Sea for eight kilometers.  Incekum won the title of a great place for families with children.  The resort is located in an incredibly picturesque place.  From all sides it is surrounded by a pine forest, so the rest here is recommended for people suffering from pulmonary diseases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club dizalya hotel 4 turkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2064445.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In recent years, resort infrastructure has been steadily expanding.  Many hotels have been built on the coast, and new restaurants, bars, cafes and other establishments are opening next to them.  It is worth noting that Incekum was one of the first in the region to start accepting tourists.  However, his hotel complexes are not outdated yet and are in good condition. </p><p>  The embankment of the village is a favorite place for walking not only tourists, but also local residents.  In the village, vacationers can stroll around the local shops and jewelry stores.  Incekum, the holiday season begins in April and many tourists come here until the very end of October.  By the way, many local hotels do not stop working even in winter.  At such times, hotels offer holidays at incredibly low prices for accommodation, attracting the attention of the British and Germans. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The coast of Incekum has an arched shape.  The bay is divided by rocks into small cozy backwaters.  Golden sand beaches are the main pride of the village.  Due to its gentle entrance and clear water, the resort is considered one of the best in Antalya.  Since Incekum is a very small village, there are no special attractions in it.  But everyone can go to the picturesque Alanya or ancient Side to diversify the rest. </p><h2>  Reviews Club Dizalya Hotel 4 * (Turkey) </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, it is worth considering the reviews of those holidaymakers who have already visited it.  Should I consider Club Dizalya Hotel 4 * (Alanya, Konakli) as a possible place for a good vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club dizalya hotel 4 alanya" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2064455.jpg"></div>

    <p>  According to tourists, the main pride of the hotel can be called its territory.  Although not very big, it is incredibly well-groomed and green.  There are a lot of palm trees, flowers and other plants.  It can be seen that the staff exerts a lot of effort to keep the complex clean.  The hotel consists of the main building and one three-story building, in addition, small bungalows are scattered throughout the territory, in each of which 2-3 families can live.  Pleasantly complement the interior with numerous flower beds with evergreens.  There are cats and dogs on the territory, they even equipped special houses for them.  Children really like to mess with animals. </p><p>  The hotel area is very beautiful, in the shade of trees hammocks are hung in which to relax.  According to tourists, Club Dizalya Hotel 4 * (Konakli) is the most picturesque and equipped complex in the immediate vicinity. </p><p>  Special attention should be paid to the hotel rooms.  Despite the fact that the hotel complex has been hosting guests for a long time, all its apartments are in good condition.  No old broken furniture or any malfunctions.  According to tourists, the rooms are very clean and tidy.  The maids do their job well.  Towels are changed daily.  Tipping can be left at will, they do not affect the quality of cleaning.  In general, the hotel staff is friendly and pleasant.  Many understand Russian, so at least somehow you can explain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club dizalya hotel 4 alanya konakli" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2064459.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If you are planning a trip to the hotel, then you should pay attention to which building you want to accommodate, or perhaps you prefer a bungalow.  In principle, there is no difference between rooms in different buildings or cottages.  Therefore, tourists do not give special recommendations on this subject. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  As for the food in Club Dizalya Hotel 4 *, reviews about it, as often happens, are a bit contradictory.  First of all, it concerns the variety of dishes.  Some tourists believe that the choice is not too large.  Although other vacationers say the exact opposite.  In general, no one is left hungry.  There is also a diet menu.  Of course, there are always many Turkish dishes on the buffet, which not everyone likes because of their spiciness.  Grilled meat and grilled fish are offered daily.  There is always a large selection of salads and fresh vegetables.  The local chef makes great delicious pastries and great desserts.  From fruits there are melons, watermelons, grapes, oranges and apples.  On Tuesdays, a Turkish evening is organized with excellent national dishes and an excellent entertainment program. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club dizalya hotel 4 konakly" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2064461.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The hotel restaurant has several areas.  It is very nice to dine outside on the outdoor terrace.  The staff of the institution works very quickly and harmoniously.  There are no queues in the restaurant, and you can always find free tables.  The waiters are very welcoming and smiling at the visitors.  In terms of service, the establishment is worthy of all praise. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, Club Dizalya Hotel 4 * (Turkey, Alanya) has an incredibly beautiful and well-groomed territory.  The hotel has two swimming pools.  One of them is small and equipped with two slides.  They are included twice a day.  The second reservoir is large.  Shady relaxation areas with sun loungers and hammocks are equipped on site. </p><p>  The hotel has a good kids club with animators.  Kids are very pleased with his visit.  The hotel has a team of animators.  Activiti conduct daytime activities in the form of water aerobics and sports.  The animation is not intrusive, but you can always take part in entertainment if you wish.  But in the evenings, a mini-disco is organized for the kids, after which there are show programs for guests - performances by artists, magicians and much more.  In principle, the animation can not be called very active, but for a family holiday it is quite enough.  Of course, if we are talking about young people who crave going to night clubs, then our hotel is unlikely to do.  Although every day trips are organized to Alanya to a disco. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club dizalya hotel 4 turkey alanya konakli" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2064471.jpg"></div>

    <p>  I want to say a few words about the staff of the institution.  Most of the employees understand Russian well.  But the reception workers are an unpleasant exception, because they perceive in surprise not only Russian, but also English.  One gets the impression that they are the ones who speak the worst languages, although it should be the other way around.  The rest of the work of the staff leaves a good impression. </p><p>  Arrival and check-in are quick enough.  If you arrived earlier than scheduled, then you will be offered lunch or a walk.  In general, the service and maintenance at Club Dizalya Hotel 4 * (Turkey, Alanya, Konakli) are up to standard, as evidenced by numerous positive reviews.  It is worth noting that the hotel complex makes the most pleasant experience. </p><p>  Tourists recommend visiting the hotel's spa.  Services in it are paid, but the guests are very satisfied. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club dizalya hotel 4 turkey reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2064485.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is worth emphasizing that most of the guests of the complex are Germans.  The rest are Russian-speaking representatives.  However, the ratio of foreigners and our compatriots may vary depending on arrival. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  The complex is located on the beach and has its own beach.  The coast is equipped with fixed awnings and sun loungers.  Guests of the establishment can use them for free.  But getting beach towels is a deposit of $ 5.  Issued by their staff at the spa.  Each replacement of towels with clean ones costs a dollar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club dizalya hotel 4 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2064484.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The hotel's beach has fine sand cover.  A gentle entry into the sea is covered with slabs, so a very convenient pier has been built, from which it is convenient to jump or descend into the water.  Pontoon is rather convenient for adults.  But the children, of course, will have to go from the shore.  The sea in this region is famous for its cleanliness.  And it really is such what the reviews of tourists say.  Algae sometimes appears, but this natural phenomenon happens infrequently.  As for storms, the local bay is not very prone to them, especially in the summer.  The resort is surrounded by forests, so the wind here is quite rare. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Club "Desalia" is a pretty good hotel on the Antalya coast.  The complex is a four-star institution that focuses on family vacations.  The hotel is very praised by tourists.  In their opinion, according to some indicators, the hotel is consistent with five stars.  Although there are also some small flaws, which some vacationers pay attention to.  One of them is not the most successful entry into the sea, which is offset by the presence of a pier.  And yet, the hotel is very popular among tourists and does not stop working even in the winter, offering accommodation at incredibly low prices. </p>
