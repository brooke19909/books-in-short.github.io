The deployment of Adolf Hitler‚Äôs hateful policy, the existence of concentration camps, the Holocaust, the most significant and terrifying war in the history of mankind ‚Äî all of this forced a sharp turn in modern civilization, rethinking existing values ‚Äã‚Äãand ideas about future development. </p><p>  It is interesting that it was fascism in Germany that caused such a significant echo in the consciousness of the world community.  Radical in its </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fascism in germany" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/294015.jpg" width="245"></div>  actions and the conservative political wing that existed in the first half of the 20th century in the vast majority of European countries, took on such an ugly form in Germany - a country that for centuries has been, if not the main, then one of the main cultural centers of European culture.  The country that gave the world Humboldt, Gutenberg, Schiller, Nietzsche and many other stars of the first magnitude.  The reasons for such attention lie far from the fact that the Third Reich was the most powerful rival of the Allied states.  In the end, their rivals were also fascist Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria.  This was another important reason.  You can long list the features of fascism in Germany in the field of economics, <span>government.</span>  List its differences from, for example, the Italian model.  However, the most important factor highlighted by fascism in Germany was the absolutism in state policy of concentrated and fanatical ideas of racism, nationalism and anti-Semitism.

Until the 1970s, the Salazar regime in Portugal also existed.  But fascism in Germany has demonstrated that it is impossible to get along with it.  <span>The Third Reich</span> was either to realize its fundamental idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcapturing vast living spaces, or to be destroyed.  Having caused so much reflection from the whole world civilization, National Socialism has caused even deeper processes in Germany itself.

    <p>  The first post-war decades became a difficult stage for the country culturally and psychologically.  The history of fascism in Germany has become an important topic.  Something similar to what the history of the CPSU was for the Soviet Union.  But if in our country the history of the party has become more of a state religion, then the main topic of German historiography was the question of why this happened.  Indeed, the National Socialists came to power not only in the wake of the economic crisis of the <span>Weimar Republic.</span>  Their ideas really resonated to a certain extent in the hearts of the Germans.  And Adolf Hitler's ideas about the world around him were formed not just like that, but in many ways under <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="features of fascism in Germany" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/294017.jpg" width="580"></div>  the influence of the mood of society: the same anti-Semitism, nationalism, romanticism of Prussians, popular theories about anti-German conspiracies, in which, of course, the main role was played by Jews and so on.

    <p>  The anti-Semitic and militaristic political forces were commonplace both for Austria-Hungary until 1918, and for Weimar Germany.  And even more common was the desire of almost all politically active social forces to destroy the brainchild of Philip Scheidemann and <span>Friedrich Ebert.</span>  Hundreds of volumes have been written about why it all happened, why it led to such terrifying results.  The origins of German fascism wherever they were searched: in the ideology laid down by the ‚Äúiron‚Äù Prussia of Bismarck, in the excessive humiliation of the Germans by <span>the Treaty of Versailles,</span> medieval Christianity, in the reformation of Martin Luther, finally, in the very mentality and nature of the Germans with their thirst for discipline, marches and a strong leader. </p>
