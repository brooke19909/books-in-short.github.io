Despite the fact that modern banknotes have many security elements and special tags, counterfeiters are improving the technology for making fake banknotes.  For this reason, false bills fall into circulation, which are increasingly difficult to recognize without special knowledge.  The main features of the authenticity of banknotes of the Bank of Russia and foreign currencies, methods of recognizing real banknotes, precautions and consequences for the distribution of counterfeit currency will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Fake banknote distribution statistics in Russia </h2><p>  According to the analytical reports of the Central Bank of Russia, about 71,000 fake banknotes totaling about 250-300 million rubles are seized annually in the country.  Considering that the Russian economy has about 4 billion banknotes in the amount of 9.5 trillion rubles in money circulation, the chance of encountering a ‚Äúfake‚Äù is rather small - about 1 in 100,000. The statistics for identifying counterfeit banknotes also look positive: in 2016, in the banking system The Russian Federation seized 61,046 counterfeit notes, in 2017 - 45,313 banknotes, and in the first three quarters of 2018, this figure amounted to 28,300 notes.  A similar trend is observed among the most common foreign currencies.  In 2016, 4,334 counterfeit dollar bills and 140 fake euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation, in 2017 - 2,343 US dollar denominations and 194 euro banknotes, in the first three quarters of 2018 - 1,859 dollar bills and 132 euro bills. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What ruble banknotes are most often faked? </h2><p>  Over the years, denominations of 1000 and 5000 rubles have been the most favorite target of counterfeiters.  So, over the past two years, 63,132 counterfeit five-thousandth notes were revealed, which is about 59% of the total number of counterfeit banknotes seized.  Signs of the authenticity of banknotes with a face value of 1,000 rubles are counterfeited a little less often - 39 539 notes for the same period, which is about 37% as a percentage of all counterfeit rubles. </p><h2>  The most counterfeit foreign currency bills </h2><p>  Among foreign currencies, in the popularity rating among scammers, a banknote of 100 US dollars is in the lead.  Then follow Euro banknotes in denominations of 20, 100 and 50. The Chinese currency does not go unnoticed - most often counterfeiters counterfeit yuan in denominations of 20 and 50. Much less often they imitate the British pound, the Swedish krona, the Kazakhstan tenge and the Japanese yen. </p><h2>  Methods for Recognizing Counterfeit Paper Money </h2><p>  There are several methods to evaluate the signs of authenticity of a banknote of Bank of Russia rubles and other currencies: </p><ul><li>  Study on the clearance. </li><li>  Research from different angles. </li><li>  Touch test. </li><li>  Recognition with a magnifying loupe. </li><li>  Using a special currency detector: with infrared, ultraviolet, magnetic or optical sensor. </li></ul><h2>  What are the characteristics of a real banknote? </h2><p>  The original bill has the following properties: </p><ul><li>  Special material.  An authentic banknote is made using special technology with the inclusion of flax and cotton.  As a result, the bill has good wear-resistant qualities, has a rigid surface and emits a specific crunch when felt. </li><li>  Water marks.  They appear when looking at a banknote against a light source.  These parts are located on the coupon fields and painted in light and dark colors.  It is difficult for counterfeiters to achieve a similar effect - counterfeit banknotes are most often equipped with plain filigree, which is easy to identify. </li><li>  Security thread.  It is a tape embedded in a banknote structure.  There are two types: solid and diving.  The visible part of this element usually contains graphic details - drawings or inscriptions. </li><li>  Elements that change color at different angles.  Genuine banknotes are equipped with graphics that vary depending on the angle of view.  The use of color-changing paint is one of the main signs of a real banknote because of the complexity and high cost of the technology. </li><li>  The presence of embossed inscriptions and labels for people with low vision.  Such details are located in different parts of the bill and have the property of roughness to the touch. </li><li>  Elements that glow when exposed to infrared or ultraviolet radiation.  These include randomly located protective fibers, luminescent images, holographic filaments, infrared tags, etc. They are detected using a currency detector. </li><li>  Laser microperforation.  One of the reliable security features, which is a series of even micro-holes that form a picture or inscription.  Such an element does not have rough edges and does not cause tactile sensations. </li></ul><h2>  The key differences between genuine bills of 200 and 2000 rubles from fake </h2><ul><li>  Protective <span>metallized thread</span> having exits to the surface of the front side of the bill.  When studying against the light, this element looks like a dark bar with a series of repeated designations depicted on it: for a two-ruble note, this is the digital value of the face value, for a bill of 2000 rubles, multiple signs with the abbreviation of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation are signs of authenticity.  With a change in the angle of view, the position of the light rectangular shapes relative to each other changes, and a 3D image of the ruble symbol also appears. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="200 rubles" class="if uuid-3059933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114778/3059933.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Watermark.  It is a combined drawing of the central part of the banknote (a banknote of 200 rubles - a monument to the scuttled ships, 2000 rubles - a bridge in the background of the sun) and a banknote denomination.  The element is made using light and dark tones and a smooth transition between them. </li><li>  A gray field of solid colors on the left side of the front of the bill, containing the word "Russia".  When changing the viewing angle in this area, an image of the face value of the banknote appears, painted in various colors. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.banknoteworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="2000 rubles" class="if uuid-3059928" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114778/3059928.jpg"></div><ul><li>  KIPP effect.  The image of the ruble symbol in the lower face of the banknote changes color from dark to light when changing the angle of view. </li><li>  The increased relief.  The following elements of the front side of the bill are felt to the touch: strokes along the edges of the paper, the face value text below, the inscription ‚ÄúBank of Russia Ticket‚Äù and the face value designations in the upper part. </li></ul><h2>  The main signs of authenticity of banknotes in denominations of 500, 1000, 5000 rubles </h2><ul><li>  Water marks.  On the right coupon field of the bill, multi-ton watermarks are applied, visible in the light.  The detail includes a monument to a historical character, depicted in the center of the front of the bill, and the denomination of the banknote in the form of numbers. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.bidorbuy.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="500 rubles" class="if uuid-3059892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114778/3059892.jpg"></div><ul><li>  On the left side of the front side of the banknote are hidden moire stripes, which are visualized only when the banknote is tilted.  On a banknote of 500 rubles in this area, an image of the nominal size appears, each figure of which changes color depending on the angle of inclination.  Signs of the authenticity of the 1000 rubles bill are yellow and blue stripes, five-thousandth banknotes are red and green. </li><li>  Near the border of the coupon field on the front side there is a micro-perforated inscription in the form of a denomination denomination. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="numismaticacameroni.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="1000 rubles" class="if uuid-3059896" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114778/3059896.jpg"></div><ul><li>  The banknote has a number of elements with embossed properties that are located on the front: the inscription "Bank of Russia ticket", the emblem of the Bank of Russia, strokes on the sides of the banknote and special tags for visually impaired people. </li><li>  The banknote contains a diving metallized thread.  When viewed against a light source, the thread looks like a solid dark strip with a repeating face value image.  These designations can be observed on the front side when changing the inclination of the bill.  Depending on the angle of inclination on the banknote of 5,000 rubles, instead of the image of the numbers, the effect of rainbow shine appears, on the other banknotes the numbers are shifted relative to each other. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="picclick.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="5000 rubles" class="if uuid-3059918" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114778/3059918.jpg"></div><h2>  US dollar: the main security features of the bill </h2><p>  Consider the most common and counterfeit US banknote with a face value of $ 100. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  The quality of the material.  Dollar bills are made from a mixture of flax and cotton, so they are dense and slightly rough to the touch.  Such bills are very strong and durable, and the paint on them lies deep and embossed. </li><li>  Three-dimensional protective tape.  When the banknote is tilted, the inscription on the blue woven ribbon, consisting of the number "100" and the image of the Liberty bell, changes its location, moving from top to bottom and vice versa. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="100 dollars" class="if uuid-3058895" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114778/3058895.jpg"></div><ul><li>  The image of the bell in the ink tank changes color depending on the slope of the bill from copper to green.  The digital designation of the denomination in the lower right corner has the same effect. </li><li>  The Franklin garment depicted on the banknote is tactile. </li><li>  The watermark on the right side of the banknote is visualized on a gap from two sides and has a golden color. </li></ul><h2>  Distinctive features of Euro banknote </h2><p>  The most popular among counterfeiters are euro banknotes of denominations of 20 and 50. Less often is a 100 euro bill, forged signs of authenticity which are often paid attention to because of the high value.  Banknotes of 200 and 500 euros are imitated in small quantities, as they are most checked with cash payment or exchange. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pexels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="100 euro" class="if uuid-3058909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114778/3058909.jpg"></div><p>  Regardless of the face value, there are a number of common signs of the authenticity of euro currency notes: </p><ul><li>  The material of the banknote consists exclusively of cotton fibers, which give the paper hard properties.  It is perceived to be slightly rough to the touch, unlike a fake.  With a wave of a bill, a characteristic sonorous rustle is issued. </li><li>  At the top of the front side of the banknote is a line with the abbreviation of the European Central Bank in 5 languages.  This part is perceived by touch. </li><li>  Each banknote has its own unique serial number, consisting of one Latin letter and eleven digits.  The peculiarity of this inscription is as follows: if you replace the letter with its serial number in the English alphabet, add each digit from the serial number to this number in turn, then the sum of the two digits of the resulting two-digit number should be 8. </li><li>  When studying a bill against a light source, the value of its face value is displayed in a white field. </li><li>  All holograms depicted on the euro bill are iridescent.  Fake holograms are often found among counterfeit banknotes without any visual effect. </li><li>  When examining a bill for transparency, fragmentary details located in the left corner of the front side are combined into a number indicating the face value of the banknote. </li></ul><h2>  How not to run into fake bills? </h2><p>  Most often, counterfeit money is sold in small shops, in the market, when making purchase and sale transactions between private individuals.  Therefore, you need to know how to distinguish a fake bill from a real one and always be on the lookout.  If there are a lot of banknotes, it is better to go to a bank or exchange office and use the service of counting and checking banknotes.  Such a procedure will require time and money, but it will save you from the irrevocable withdrawal of fake money and a criminal investigation. </p><h2>  What happens if caught with a fake? </h2><p>  The production, marketing and distribution of counterfeit bills belongs to the category of especially serious crimes.  If it is proved that there was a deliberate intention to sell counterfeit banknotes, then in accordance with Article 186 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, such a criminal act is punishable by imprisonment from 8 to 15 years.  If you give the police a detailed testimony regarding the time and circumstances of receiving fake money, you can fall under the category of ‚Äúbona fide marketer‚Äù and avoid criminal liability. </p><h2>  What should I do if I get a fake bill in my hands? </h2><p>  If you have any doubts about the authenticity of banknotes, you should not try to sell them in another place.  If they are caught trying to pay with fake money, then a criminal case will be opened against the detainee and a special investigation will be launched.  It is best to contact the bank for an expert determination of the authenticity of banknotes or write a statement to the police.  Banknotes will be withdrawn for examination and will issue a certificate of the withdrawal of the banknote.  If the money turns out to be genuine, then upon completion of the examination, they will be returned to the rightful owner or credited to his account.  In the opposite case, the victim is denied the return of the detained banknotes, and the police will request detailed information about the circumstances of the receipt of criminal banknotes and will raise the issue of initiating a criminal investigation. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  There are a number of signs of authenticity of banknotes by which you can recognize a real banknote from a fake.  Experts from the Central Bank of Russia recommend checking at least five of them.  This includes distinguishing a watermark, viewing a protective tape, checking the touch of relief elements and special marks for visually impaired people, identifying emblems and signs that vary depending on the angle of inclination of the bill.  More accurate results when establishing protective properties can be obtained using a magnifying magnifier - it will allow you to see and distinguish areas with microtext, which is difficult to fake for scammers.  The detector for checking banknotes is used in banks and exchange offices to monitor the presence of hidden elements - luminescent images, protective fibers and infrared tags. </p>
