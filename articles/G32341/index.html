  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Smartphone Samsung N7000: specifications, review, description and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Smartphone manufacturers are trying to improve their gadgets from year to year and at least surprise the consumer: the thickness of the models is waning, the battery lasts longer, and the screen gets better and bigger.  Weighing the characteristics of the Samsung N7000, we can say that it keeps up to date and supports almost all new trends.  And if the previous generation - ‚ÄúGalaxy S2‚Äù passed somehow unnoticed, then the new model managed to make a lot of noise. </p><p>  So, we present to your attention a review on the Samsung N7000 - a smartphone with a large screen.  Consider the main characteristics of the gadget, its advantages and disadvantages, as well as the desirability of a purchase with user reviews. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  The device comes in a classic white cardboard box.  On the front part flaunts the image of the gadget itself in two angles along with a stylus.  On the back you can see the most remarkable characteristics of the Samsung N7000, and at the ends of the usual labels and barcodes of distributors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.notebookcheck.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="grade samsung galaxy" class="if uuid-2476326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2476326.jpg"></div><p>  The interior is well-designed and the accessories do not ‚Äúswear‚Äù with each other, but each one neatly lies in its place.  In general, the packaging shows that the manufacturer did not save on it and designed everything for people and on conscience.  It‚Äôs a pity even to throw out the box, everything is so good there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Completeness: </p><ul><li>  Samsung N7000 smartphone itself; </li><li>  a cable for charging and synchronization with a PC; </li><li>  mains charger; </li><li>  lithium ion rechargeable battery; </li><li>  headphones; </li><li>  stylus; </li><li>  documentation with a warranty card. </li></ul><p>  The package bundle can be called standard, and there is nothing superfluous here, and you can use the gadget out of the box.  You will have to buy a case for the Samsung N7000 separately, so it‚Äôs better to take care of it right away without leaving the store where the device was purchased. </p><p>  All accessories look solid, and there are no complaints about their quality: the cord is thick and flexible, charging is monolithic and without gaps with backlashes, the stylus is nice and comfortable, and the headset is very high quality.  Immediately it is worth noting that before the first use, the manufacturer strongly recommends that the phone is fully charged, in order to avoid ‚Äúsubsidence‚Äù of the battery. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  To call a gadget small language does not turn.  Here we have a typical representative of "tablet phones" with dimensions - 1478310 mm, with a weight of 180 grams.  ‚ÄúSamsung Galaxy Note‚Äù looks great, and if you put on a cover on it, then very big. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.arukereso.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="design samsung galaxy" class="if uuid-2476320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2476320.jpg"></div><p>  Even in an adult male palm, the device looks rather big, not to mention fragile female handles: it would be unrealistic to hold a few extra millimeters to the body and hold it with one hand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  That is, in the pocket of jeans or trousers there is no place for him, unless, of course, you prefer shapeless hoodies or overalls.  The ideal place for Samsung Galaxy Note is the pockets of a jacket or jacket. </p><p>  Judging by consumer reviews, the size of the gadget is not the best way affects its ergonomics, and using it as a regular phone is quite difficult.  Even simple conversations can strain, because it is very inconvenient to hold it near the ear.  In addition, the speakers are not located in the best way and have to adapt to them. </p><p>  Judging by the same reviews, the owners prefer a headset as an alternative to normal use, and it is mainly for everybody.  So the design features and characteristics of the Samsung N7000 must be carefully weighed before giving the money to the cashier of the store. </p><h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  Users have no complaints about the build quality.  The gadget turned out solid and monolithic.  The case of the device, although made of plastic, is of very high quality, so there are no backlashes, gaps and creaks. </p><p>  The <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Note GT N7000 was tested with dignity, but it‚Äôs not worth it to sit on it.  The panels here are not big, and the body collects fingerprints to a minimum.  In addition, getting rid of the latter is not difficult. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  The main controls have a standard and familiar layout.  In the upper part you can see the front camera peephole, proximity and lighting sensors, as well as the speaker grill.  At the bottom there is a mechanical function key, and the ‚ÄúReturn‚Äù and ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù buttons are touch-sensitive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.phones.extremecircuits.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy interfaces" class="if uuid-2476324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2476324.jpg"></div><p>  On the left side is the volume rocker, and on the right is the power key.  Using the mechanical button, as it was in other series, the camera on the Samsung N7000 does not turn on, so you will have to call up the menu to activate it. </p><p>  On the upper edge there is only a 3.5 mm minijack, and the micro-USB interface has been moved to the lower end.  The latter is used to synchronize with a personal computer and to charge the phone.  The rear part is reserved for the peephole of the main camera, flash and speaker. </p><p>  Studying user reviews, we can say that some owners complain about the volume rocker too pulled up.  Yes, when playing games or watching video or photo content in horizontal mode, there are no problems, but when you are talking on the phone or working with it in a vertical plane, you have to stretch. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The Samsung N7000's visualization features have been slightly improved over previous generations.  The phone screen is made using Super AMOLED technology, and the matrix calmly reveals a resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels.  It is not possible to consider individual points on the screen, especially since PenTile technology is used here, which nullifies all pixelation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="phonerpt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy screen" class="if uuid-2476322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2476322.jpg"></div><p>  The matrix copes with visualization indoors, but on the street under direct sunlight the screen fades and the information is barely readable.  The display in this case has to be covered by hand or look for shade.  The stock of brightness and contrast is quite acceptable and in normal mode all data is clearly visible. </p><p>  As for viewing angles, the Samsung Galaxy Note GT N7000 they are also at a very decent level.  You can safely watch the video or look through the photos in the company of one or even two like-minded people.  With a strong change in the viewing angle, the entire color saturation disappears, and it is not possible to distinguish anything. </p><p>  The 5.3-inch diagonal allows you to comfortably view the content, work in the browser, and play toys, so this part can be called a clear advantage of the phone.  All fonts are perfectly distinguishable with solid text, as is the case with gadgets on small screens, there are no problems. </p><h2>  Display Features </h2><p>  The touchscreen is capacitive and capable of working with ten simultaneous touches.  One of the notable features of the screen is the Wacom built-in digitizer.  The latter allows you to fully use the stylus (S-Pen) for drawing or writing. </p><p>  The screen itself is protected by durable glass from venerable "Gorilla" and is almost completely resistant to minor mechanical damage, such as scratches.  So the stylus will not do any harm to the surface, and the neighboring keys in the pocket of the display will not be scratched. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that this is a smartphone with a GPS module, and high-quality and quite adequate, which adds to its versatility.  Judging by the reviews of the model, quite a lot of owners use the device as a navigator in a car, since there are plenty of various maps and similar specific software for gadgets on the Android platform. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The proprietary set of chipsets is responsible for the performance - the dual-core Exynos 4210 processor, which proved to be excellent in the last generation of gadgets and was slightly overclocked to 1.4 GHz.  One gigabyte of RAM is enough for trouble-free operation of the interface, and desktops, icons and regular applications work like clockwork. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.droidviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy platform" class="if uuid-2476325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2476325.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by user reviews, problems can occur when launching serious gaming applications.  For modern and "heavy" toys, 1 GB of RAM is already not enough, so in the good half of the case, graphic presets will have to be reset to the average, or even the minimum level. </p><p>  16 GB of internal memory is enough to store photos and music files.  For video content, you will have to work with an external memory card.  The latter are supported in micro-SD format up to 32 GB.  So there should not be any serious problems with the storage of information. </p><p>  Users sometimes complain about the abundance of advertising in the operating system.  She gets there either through the hands of distributors, or thanks to the efforts of mobile operators, who sometimes expose the model as a branded device.  Removing it in the usual way is problematic, but in this case the iron version always saves - Samsung N7000 firmware. </p><p>  The stock version can always be found on the official website of the Samsung company in the "Software" section.  Well, or, as an option, look for a similar stock for Samsung N7000 on w3bsit3-dns.com or other popular forums.  There they can tell you some solution if there were failures during the firmware.  In difficult cases, you can always rely on service centers and give 500-700 rubles for work. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The front camera is suitable for communication on video messengers, and for making avatars, but the main 8-megapixel camera is capable of taking very good photos and a decent video sequence.  In addition to the classic shooting modes, the camera interface has a ton of other settings that fans will be happy to take pictures ‚Äúon their knees‚Äù. </p><p>  At the output, although good pictures are obtained (3264x2448 px), but only with proper lighting.  Therefore, at night, the efficiency of the camera drops significantly, and even an intelligent flash does not save.  As for the video, the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãcapable of overpowering the Full HD resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels at a speed of 30 frames per second.  But during shooting in motion, the picture looks jerky, so in severe cases it is better to switch to a more optimal option with HD resolution (720 r) and 60 FPS.  In this case, dynamic scenes are obtained, albeit not with such clarity, but without any twitching. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  The wireless bluetooth protocol of the third version works stably and without failures.  A similar situation with the Wi-Fi module: seamless data transfer at speeds up to 24 Mb / s at a distance of up to three meters between devices.  The GPS module also pleased with its quick response and good performance.  In addition, in the settings you can find all kinds of profiles and presets for almost all occasions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.edimax.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bluetooth and wi-fi" class="if uuid-2476323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2476323.jpg"></div><p>  There are no questions to the headset either: the sound is high-quality, one-touch connection, and the cord is quite enough even for working on a computer.  Synchronization with a PC is very fast and the user has several modes - a player, a drive or a ‚Äúcase‚Äù.  The smartphone can be used as a modem, and the signal quality does not suffer from this. </p><p>  Windows 8 and 10 windows pick up the connection without drivers, and on the Seven and XP you will first have to look at the Samsung official website and download the necessary files or full-fledged proprietary software for working with the smartphone in the Software section. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The battery of the Samsung N7000 is 2500 mAh lithium-ion type, which is a little more compared to the previous generation.  The manufacturer claims 10.5 hours of continuous talk on a full charge and 960 hours of standby time.  In reality, the data on offline conversations is slightly less, but generally correct, and there is no need to check the "sleep" mode. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lelong.com.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy battery" class="if uuid-2476321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2476321.jpg"></div><p>  At full load, and this is the Network, high-resolution wireless protocols and video with toys, the device lasted all day, which is more than acceptable for such a small battery capacity.  ‚ÄúAndroid Brothers‚Äù has always been gluttonous, but here we have not such a productive set of chipsets with a good matrix, where the brightness and contrast are almost perfectly balanced and do not put the battery down.  It takes at least three hours to fully charge the battery.  The manufacturer does not provide and does not recommend the use of instant recharging: it is better to leave it calmly at night and not force the battery. </p><p>  With a mixed mode of use, the gadget can last two, or even three days.  If you do not sit on the Internet for hours and do not play "heavy" toys, then the battery life of the gadget can be considered more than acceptable.  So users generally respond positively to the autonomy of the device.  Here it is neither worse nor better than that of direct competitors. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  At that time, when the phone was released, Samsung had no serious competitors, and it managed to fill the almost empty niche of ‚Äútablet phones‚Äù.  Even now, not every gadget in this segment can compete with a model from a reputable manufacturer. </p><p>  In a good half of Chinese models, there is simply no balance.  If the filling is powerful, then either there is no screen, or after a few hours the phone starts asking for an outlet.  Or, on the contrary, the battery will be provided with a capacious one, the screen is good, and the set of chipsets will be mediocre, and as a result, we only have more or less normal operation of the interface, without the ability to run at least some serious applications. </p><p>  In the case of our respondent, we have perfectly balanced characteristics.  Yes, today they do not grab stars from heaven, but the topic is no less, they look quite worthy and cope not only with ordinary tasks and with multimedia, but also with serious toys (at medium or low graphics settings).  And the amount of internal memory even without a third-party drive is enough for most everyday needs. </p><p>  The smartphone will surely appeal to those who need both a tablet and a phone.  In this case, it will be much more practical to take an explanatory model from Samsung than to go broke into a couple of mediocre gadgets.  As such, there is no difference when viewing video content between the tablet and this unit.  But if you work closely with textual information, then it is better, of course, to look towards devices with a larger diagonal. </p><p>  Also, the obvious advantages include the presence of a stylus, and most importantly - its full hardware and software support.  In specialized forums you can see real masterpieces that are obtained using this model: landscapes, still lifes, self-portraits and the now popular manga. </p><p>  So this model is for the most part not for toys, but specifically for work, creativity and relaxation for your favorite films and series.  And of course, like a telephone, the device was completely successful.  Yes, it is a bit ugly in terms of ergonomics, but you can close your eyes to this if you look at its other advantages. </p>
