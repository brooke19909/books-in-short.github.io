Now another attraction has appeared here, which you can not only admire, but simply live in it.  We are talking about the pompous LCD "Prince Alexander Nevsky", adorning the city since 2012.  It is a house with a dome and a spire, to the tip of which it is exactly 126 meters from the ground.  Today, the complex takes the second place among the <span>high-rise buildings of St. Petersburg</span> , losing to the Leader Tower business center, but among the residential facilities it is a confident leader.  What else, in addition to height, is the complex "Prince Alexander Nevsky"?  How does his happy apartment owner live in it?  Is it possible to buy real estate here and at what price?  Answers to all questions in our article. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  A wonderful corner in the Nevsky district of the glorious city of St. Petersburg right on the banks of the legendary Neva was chosen by the developer for the construction of the residential complex “Prince Alexander Nevsky”.  The address of the object is easy to remember: Obukhov Defense Avenue, building No. 138.  Rybatsky Avenue is located nearby, and literally 770 meters passes the important transport artery of the city of KAD.  The great advantage of the LCD is that it takes 7-8 minutes by car to the cable-stayed cable-stayed bridge across the Neva.  It is clearly visible from the windows of the complex.  The closest neighbors of the residential complex are the historical, but, unfortunately, now not very popular Murzinka district and several high-rise apartment buildings with 9 to 16 floors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Prince Alexander Nevsky" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1672608.jpg" width="489"></div>

On the avenue, literally 50 meters from the building of the complex, there is a bus stop (19 routes).  About 120 meters there is a <span>stop of trams</span> Nos. 24 and 27. Within a radius of 2 km from the complex there are Obukhovo and Rybatskoye metro stations, and the stations of the same name are nearby.  e. As you can see, public transport that runs near the complex is more than enough. </p><p>  For car owners, the location of the LCD is also convenient.  On Obukhov Defense Avenue, they can rush for a minute to the Ring Road or Shlisselburgsky Avenue, and also quickly at any time of the day proceed to the other side of the Neva by the bridge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Apartment LCD Prince Alexander Nevsky" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1672611.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  From the point of view of a clean environment, the LCD “Prince Alexander Nevsky” has a double position.  According to environmentalists, St. Petersburg occupies the “honorable” third place in Russia among all polluted cities.  Therefore, in any of its areas, the environmental situation is not favorable, and mainly automobile emissions pollute the air. </p><p>  The housing complex under consideration also suffers from this problem because it is located between two avenues.  From the building 25 meters to Rybatsky, and to one of the central and heavily loaded in the city of Obukhov defense avenue, only 15 meters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another minus can be called a gas station, located from the LCD in 22 meters, which cars constantly stop by.  The industrial zone, which is just a stone's throw from the complex, is also not optimistic.  It is located right behind the tram tracks. </p><p>  But on the other hand, the LCD was built just 100 meters from the banks of the Neva.  In this area there is even a local promenade where fishing enthusiasts gather.  Near the river there is a small grove smoothly passing into the Spartak park.  These natural sites slightly improve the environmental situation around the complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Prince Alexander Nevsky reviews" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1672603.jpg" width="504"></div>

    <h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  All the disadvantages of the residential complex “Prince Alexander Nevsky” are more than overlapping with the infrastructure built here.  <span>The adjacent territory of the</span> complex is small, but the developer managed to place a spacious fenced playground on it.  Also, a two-level underground parking was built on the territory, accommodating 214 cars and multi-seater ground parking.  All other infrastructure is located inside the building on the ground floor.  There is a fitness center, a swimming pool with an area of ​​3,000 m2, a free culture center for children, a bakery, a liquor store, a pharmacy, 2 cafes, and even a house church, which Alexander Nevsky Lavra took care of.  In total, 16 860 square meters were allocated for non-residential premises in the complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Infrastructure around </h2><p>  Residential complex “Prince Alexander Nevsky” was built in a long developed and settled area.  The nearest grocery store is located 50 meters from the complex, the nearest kindergarten is 150 meters, the next 200 meters.  Within a radius of just 400 meters from the LCD you can find <span>a beauty salon,</span> a police station, a web design studio, construction companies engaged in repair work in apartments and industrial mountaineering, bank branches, a children's clothing store, an atelier, and a dental clinic.  Lenta and McDonald's, a large supermarket, were built a little further, and at two stops from the complex there is another kindergarten, school, clinic, four large supermarkets.  If we consider the direction towards the Ring Road, 550 meters from the residential complex are located the Obukhovets sports complex, a wedding salon, a clinic and a bus departure point to Finland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Prince Alexander Nevsky address" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1672609.jpg" width="477"></div>

    <h2>  Complex design </h2><p>  LCD "Prince Alexander Nevsky" in St. Petersburg was the first residential skyscraper to ascend over buildings and become the dominant in the panorama of the city.  The complex is one three-section building with 37 floors (35 above ground and two underground).  The complex was built using a monolithic frame technology.  The external walls are made of brick with the laying of a heat-saving layer.  Balconies are glazed using tinted glass, which gives the complex a particularly spectacular appearance.  The entrance areas in all the entrances are made spacious, their walls are decorated with portraits of Alexander Nevsky and mirrors.  The building has 17 elevators of the Finnish brand KONE, which is considered quite reliable.  Security of residents is provided by CCTV cameras located around the perimeter of the territory and concierges working at each entrance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Prince Alexander Nevsky St. Petersburg" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1672600.jpg" width="479"></div>

    <h2>  LCD "Prince Alexander Nevsky": planning </h2><p>  The following categories of apartments are built in the complex: </p><p>  - studios with a total area (S) of 24 m <sup>2</sup> to 30 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - one-room (S = from 34 m <sup>2</sup> to 41 m <sup>2)</sup> ; </p><p>  - two-room (S = from 50 m <sup>2</sup> to 80 m <sup>2)</sup> ; </p><p>  - three rooms (S = from 77 m <sup>2</sup> to 104 m <sup>2)</sup> ; </p><p>  - two-level penthouses (S = from 250 m <sup>2</sup> ). </p><p>  All apartments have panoramic windows, from which on the upper floors you can admire the panorama of your city, and on the middle floors - the panorama of the Neva. </p><p>  Layouts of apartments created by designers taking into account the needs of a modern person.  In addition to the studios, each apartment of the residential complex “Prince Alexander Nevsky” has a separate bath and toilet.  The area of ​​kitchens here is from 12 squares, halls - from 5 squares, the ceiling height (without the installation of suspended or suspended structures) 2.7 m, loggias and balconies have a non-standard shape. </p><h2>  Sales </h2><p>  At the beginning of the construction of the complex, housing was sold at a price of 75,000 per 1 m <sup>2</sup> .  Now apartments in the residential complex “Prince Alexander Nevsky” are still in demand, but they can only be purchased as secondary housing.  There are many offers on the market.  Prices are set by the owners.  On average, they start at 3,100,000 per studio.  Initially, the apartments were surrendered, that is, the screed was completed, the walls were plastered, the electrical cables and communications were wired.  Now, some of the apartments for sale still have the same condition, but most of them have already been renovated.  You can buy housing in this residential complex by paying the full amount at once or by applying for a mortgage at Sberbank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Prince Alexander Nevsky planning" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1672605.jpg" width="483"></div>

    <h2>  Developer Reliability </h2><p>  Reliable and popular in St. Petersburg, the company RosStroyInvest was the developer of the residential complex Prince Alexander Nevsky.  Reviews about her are very good.  It entered the Russian market of construction services in 2001 and during this time it successfully commissioned over 30 objects.  Since 2016, the company has been developing the construction market in Spain, having begun to build cottages in Catalonia.  At present, RosStroyInvest is an association comprising 10 legal entities: a design bureau, construction organizations, suppliers of materials and equipment, maintenance services operating at commissioned facilities. </p><p>  The authorities of St. Petersburg, namely the RosStroyInvest company, were the first to give permission for the construction of a skyscraper, which is the Prince Alexander Nevsky LCD.  This task is quite difficult, because the soils in the city have a complex structure.  For the design of the foundation pit, a stable foundation and frame of the building, geologists, surveyors, hydraulics, engineers involved in technologies for increasing the strength of structures were invited to the project.  After the construction was completed, activities were carried out with the involvement of the fire service in order to provide all the nuances and ensure high security to the residents of the complex.  Only after that the facility was commissioned. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Prince Alexander Nevsky in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1672607.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <h2>  Residents reviews </h2><p>  Many Petersburgers and guests of the city, passing the complex, admire its architectural forms and stylish, modern, even somewhat pompous design.  And what do the residents themselves think of their beautiful house, which has become a landmark of St. Petersburg?  Reviews about the LCD "Prince Alexander Nevsky" are mixed.  Some apartment owners idolize their LCD, while others, on the contrary, consider it quite problematic.  Noted advantages: </p><p>  - An impressive view, causing pride in your city; </p><p>  - The proximity of traffic intersections and stops; </p><p>  - rich infrastructure in and around the complex; </p><p>  - gorgeous views from the windows; </p><p>  - A good management company managing the complex, quickly solves the problems that arise, monitors the order. </p><p>  Noted disadvantages: </p><p>  - a very small parking area; </p><p>  - around the complex there are always too many cars (their own and those arriving at the gas station); </p><p>  - the apartments have poor sound insulation, drafts even with the windows closed; </p><p>  - the place for the complex was chosen without taking into account the turbulence of air flows, which is why there is always a very strong wind in the courtyard (there are gusts that literally knock you down). </p>
