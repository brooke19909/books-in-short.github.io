In addition, Kerch is full of attractions and colorful places, and is also unique in that it has access to two seas at once - the Black and Azov Sea.  According to locals, visiting Crimea and not coming to Kerch is about the same as coming to Paris and not climbing the Eiffel Tower.  Where to stay, having arrived in this city, we will tell below. </p><h2>  Features of rest in Kerch </h2><p>  Despite the fact that rest in Kerch has great tourist potential, it is one of the most non-tourist cities in Crimea.  They rarely come here for a long time.  Basically, Kerch is a transit point on the way to Kazantip, or a one-day resort where people go to see the sights.  Therefore, the local hotel fund leaves much to be desired - several mini-hotels and mostly private pensions.  There are several resorts. </p>
