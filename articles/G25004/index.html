Sudden scientific discoveries confirm events that our ancestors considered only poetic myths.  The same story happened with the description of 10 Egyptian executions.  As it often happens, scientists suddenly gave completely scientific interpretations to mythical events.  So what real events can explain the 10 Egyptian executions? </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The description of the ten Egyptian executions is contained in the canonical biblical text - in the book of Exodus.  This chapter of the Bible describes the ancient Jews being held captive by the Egyptians.  According to ancient chronicles, the leader of the Jews Moses called on the pharaoh to release the ancient people, to free the Jews of their centuries-old captivity.  Pharaoh refused to do this, and innumerable disasters fell on the state.  They went down in history as 10 executions of the Egyptian. </p><h2>  List </h2><p>  All the misfortunes of the Egyptian people can be collected into a single list of epidemics and strange natural disasters: </p><ul><li>  a flood of blood; </li><li>  the invasion of frogs; </li><li>  execution by blood-sucking insects; </li><li>  the songs of the fly; </li><li>  zooemia among domestic animals; </li><li>  epidemic of skin diseases; </li><li>  natural disasters; </li><li>  <span>locust invasion of</span> Egyptian fields; </li><li>  absolute darkness descending on an Egyptian country; </li><li>  mass deaths of the Egyptian first-born. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="explanation of 10 executions of the Egyptian" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1225060.jpg" width="300"></div></li></ul><p>  What can explain the 10 executions of Egypt?  The scientific explanation of these phenomena should be based on all currently known scientific facts.  Let's try to deal with ancient texts, taking into account modern observations and scientific discoveries. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Blood and frogs </h2><p>  The first of 10 Egyptian executions is blood punishment.  According to biblical tradition, all the <span>rivers of Egypt</span> turned bloody.  As scientists have proved, this natural phenomenon can occur in our days.  For example, in 2003, in China, the Yangtze River turned red for several kilometers.  The reasons for this can be different - from volcanic activity, uplifting a lot of dust and coloring the water with it, to the influence of comets that fly by </p>

    <p>  The invasion of various amphibians could provoke the approach of a comet or meteorite.  As scientists have found out, all amphibians are very sensitive to changes in the earth‚Äôs magnetic pole - there is a kind of compass in the frogs' body that helps these animals navigate in space.  The sharp displacement of the magnetic pole provoked by the comet disoriented the animals, forcing them to suddenly change their usual way of life. </p><h2>  Insect infestation </h2><p>  The third, fourth and eighth of 10 Egyptian executions indirectly confirm the change in the period of rotation of the Earth.  Abnormally long daylight hours led to a surge in the spread of blood-sucking insects.  Possible radiation has changed populations of known insects, and these creatures have become larger and more dangerous.  Another reason for the appearance in Egypt of such an invasion may be the disappearance of the previous adversity - frogs.  In the absence of natural enemies, songs by flies, mosquitoes, midges, locusts and other insects can reproduce indefinitely. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The death of pets.  Epidemic of ulcers and abscesses </h2><p>  <span>Climate change</span> can significantly reduce the resistance of living organisms to various infections.  Given the level of medicine in those days, it is not surprising that high temperatures provoked the development of infectious diseases - both humans and animals are equally dependent on changes in climatic conditions.  A sharp warming caused the development of skin pathologies and pestilence in livestock. </p>

    <h2>  Natural disasters.  Absolute darkness </h2><p>  As we have already found out, the explanation of the 10 Egyptian executions lies in the study of the motion of the Earth and in climate change.  Thunder, lightning, and hail can be attributed to climate change, and fire on the ground can stagnate due to the <span>shift of tectonic</span> plates.  Mass darkness can be explained by volcanic activity.  As you know, during volcanic eruptions and large earthquakes, a huge amount of dust and ash rises into the air.  There can be so many of these tiny particles that a curtain of them can prevent the passage of sunlight.  Most likely, this is precisely the picture observed in Egypt. </p><h2>  The deaths of the Egyptian firstborn </h2><p>  Real events (10 executions of Egyptian) are explained using scientific hypotheses.  But how to explain the death of the Egyptian first-born?  Why did the mysterious pestilence not affect the children of Jews and other slaves?  There may be several reasons.  The most plausible hypothesis is all the same infections.  Do not forget that rats and mice at all times have been the spread of disease.  But the wealthy first-born were especially vulnerable.  As a rule, it was the first sons who became the main heirs, and their bedchairs always had sweets, delicious food and drink.  This state of affairs was liked not only by the first-born, but also by the rats and mice that ate the leftover food.  They penetrated the homes of wealthy Egyptian heirs, leaving behind a trail of disease and childhood deaths. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="real events 10 executions of Egyptian" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1225057.jpg" width="590"></div>  But rats ran to Jews infrequently - the ancient people of Israel were in Egypt in the position of slaves, so they didn‚Äôt have much food.  The food in the houses did not linger, but was eaten right away.  Therefore, the poor were partially protected from infections.  But for the rich Egyptians, the chances of survival were significantly reduced.

    <p>  Perhaps such an explanation of the 10 executions of Egypt would be erroneous.  But it has the right to exist along with other hypotheses.  Which of this is true, and what is not, will be proved by scientists such as geologists, historians, epidemiologists, and physicians. </p>
