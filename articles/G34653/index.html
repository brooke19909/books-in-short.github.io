Its residents, who did not contact white people, did not allow journalists to come to them for a long time, and after several reports, interest in them increased incredibly.  There were many who wanted to visit the tribe and tell the world about the nomads living according to their own laws. </p><h2>  Pastoralist tribe </h2><p>  The Himba tribe, whose population does not exceed 50 thousand people, has been living in disparate settlements since the 16th century and has a semi-sedentary, semi-nomadic existence in a desert where there is no water.  Now it is engaged in cattle breeding: residents breed cows of a special breed, unpretentious and ready to do without water for a long time.  Pets - this is the main wealth and inheritance, which is not considered as food. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Himba tribe" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1526746.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A people not familiar with the benefits of civilization </h2><p>  Selling animals, they help out a little money, and frequent guests buy souvenirs and crafts.  The <span>African tribe</span> Himba spends his earnings on the purchase of sugar, cornmeal, and treats for children.  Residents do not need clothes; they make <span>loincloths</span> from animal skins and fasten them on the body with a belt.  All they need is slippers to walk through the desert scorching feet.  None of them use the technique, almost do not know the written language, the dishes of the tribe are replaced by vessels hollowed out in a pumpkin, but they absolutely do not suffer from the lack of attributes of civilization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Himba tribe, whose photo was often printed in various publications, observes ancient customs, worships the souls of the dead and the god Mukur, raises cattle and does not shed someone else's blood.  They lead a peaceful existence in a lifeless desert, in conditions of severe shortage of water. </p><h2>  Attention to appearance </h2><p>  For members of the tribe, appearance plays an important role in traditional culture.  It indicates the position in society and certain phases of life.  For example, married women wear on their heads a kind of crown, which is made from goat hides, and married men - a turban. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="himba african tribe" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1526744.jpg" width="332"></div>

    <p>  Girls braid long hair in braids over their foreheads, with age they make hairstyles that consist of a huge number of braids, and boys pull their hair into a ponytail tied in a bun. </p><h2>  Women recognized as the most beautiful </h2><p>  Representatives of the Himba do not miss a single trifle and carefully monitor their appearance, caring for skin and hair.  They compensate for the lack of clothing with numerous jewelry made from copper, shells and pearls.  This is an important part of centuries-old traditions, and women of the Himba tribe are recognized as the most beautiful.  Their subtle facial features and almond-shaped eyes are admired by travelers who claim that every girl could work as a model on the catwalk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Himba tribe photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1526811.jpg" width="500"></div>

Jewelry that the fair sex is worn on the neck, legs, arms, serves not only for beauty - in this way local girls protect themselves from snakebites. </p><h2>  Magic mix for face and body </h2><p>  Each drop of water is worth its weight in gold, and what can be obtained is drunk, so the tribal members do not wash, and a special mixture of red-orange color helps them survive, to which the himba owes a special shade of skin.  Women rub stones of volcanic rock into powder and mix it with butter, ash, and vegetable elixirs whipped from cow's milk.  Each morning begins with the fact that the natives apply ocher paint, which maintains the necessary level of hygiene and protects against insect bites and scorching sunlight, on the whole body and face. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Himba women" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1526795.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The incredibly soft skin of women looks great and smells of aromatic resin, which is often added to the mixture, which serves as the basis for complex hairstyles that distinguish the Himba tribe. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Each resident has a second, "European" name.  Children receive it when they study in mobile schools.  Each child knows how to count and knows a few phrases in English, but after the first classes of education, few continue. </p><p>  The Himba tribe in Namibia builds cone-shaped huts from young trees and palm leaves, which are interwoven with leather straps, and later covers them with manure and silt.  Inside such a dwelling there are no amenities except a mattress on the floor. </p><p>  The tribe lives in a clan led by an elder - grandfather in charge of housing, religious aspects, compliance with laws and traditions, economic issues, property management.  His powers are confirmed by a special bracelet on the erenge hand.  The headman marries, holds various ceremonies and rituals at the sacred fire, attracting the spirits of the ancestors to solve pressing issues. </p><p>  Marriages are concluded in such a way that wealth is distributed equally.  After the wedding, the wife moves to her husband and accepts the rules of the new clan. </p><p>  Women get up very early, at dawn, milk cows, which men take to the pastures.  As soon as the land is scarce, the Himba tribe is removed from its place and moved to another place.  Husbands roam with herds, leaving their wives and children in the village. </p><p>  Of modern things, the tribe has taken root in plastic bottles in which jewelry is stored. </p><p>  It is best to go to the village with a guide who will tell you in detail about the life of the tribe and will be able to arrange a visit to the leader with the leader. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Himba tribe in Namibia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1526743.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  The amazing Himba tribe is hospitable and smiling people who are not looking for benefits from frequent travelers.  An original people, existing in isolation from the outside world, is indifferent to the benefits of civilization, and each case of preservation of traditional ways is of great interest to scientists and tourists. </p>
