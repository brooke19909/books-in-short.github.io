  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get a tax deduction when buying a property</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each state is trying to help its citizens.  In our country, there are several types of such support, among which a tax deduction occupies a worthy place.  In fact, this is a partial <span>income tax return</span> (PIT) in the amount spent on treatment, education, housing, etc. </p><p>  Despite the attractiveness of this method of returning money, many citizens still do not know how to get a tax deduction.  Therefore, annually significant funds allocated for such needs remain unclaimed. </p><p>  What are the limits for obtaining a deduction </p><p>  We will try to answer some of the questions related to the acquisition of housing.  Here, the deduction procedure is one of the most difficult. </p><p>  In order to learn how to get a <span>tax deduction,</span> first we turn to the Tax Code.  This important document establishes a certain framework in which you must fit in order to receive the long-awaited money. </p><p>  Here are the main limitations: </p><p>  1. It can only be obtained once.  No matter how many apartments and houses are subsequently acquired, the state will not provide such an opportunity anymore. </p><p>  2. A citizen must pay personal income tax, and the tax rate should be equal to 13%.  In addition, only those funds that are paid to the budget from the moment the property appears are returned. </p><p>  3. Only the owner can receive the deduction upon presentation of the relevant certificate.  It is allowed to issue money in terms of shares, if the housing has several legal owners. </p><p>  Some features of the procedure in the case of the acquisition of housing under construction.  Compensated expenses can even include expenses for the acquisition of property rights, and, of course, for the purchase of construction or finishing materials. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The question of how to get a tax deduction when buying an apartment very often confronts young families applying for a mortgage.  Typically, such loans are subsidized by principal.  The deduction also applies only to interest on a mortgage loan.  But this greatly alleviates the financial burden. </p><p>  How to get a tax deduction - who to contact </p><p>  For preliminary consultation, you should contact the tax office, which oversees the applicant's place of residence.  Its specialists will explain how to get a tax deduction, as well as what documents you need to draw up.  This can be done in person. </p><p>  But there is another convenient way - interactive.  Now inspections are aimed at servicing taxpayers, so you can safely ask questions by e-mail.  The main thing is to formulate them correctly.  The answer is sure to come. </p><p>  True, it will be a theory.  All the same, the paperwork must be drawn up for the applicant and edited repeatedly by him too.  Moreover, one very important circumstance should be taken into account: all documents confirming expenses must be genuine and correctly drawn up.  The inspection will carefully check everything, and if it finds a discrepancy, there may be trouble. </p><p>  Of course, such communication requires a significant investment of time and the ability to correctly compose a request.  If there are no such opportunities, then you can use the services of professionals who know in detail how to get a tax deduction.  An <span>agreement</span> is <span>concluded</span> with them <span>for the provision of services</span> (required) and documents are given.  It remains to wait for the result. </p><p>  And finally, you should be well prepared for receiving funds.  Before you get a tax deduction for an apartment, you should ask how the money will be issued.  Cash is completely excluded, which means that a passbook or <span>debit card</span> remains <span>.</span>  For some reason, banks prefer the first option; for citizens, the second.  True, with a certain persistence, a compromise can be found. </p>
