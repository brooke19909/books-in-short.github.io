It is clear that all this requires quite serious financial investments, which not everyone has.  Where, for example, to get money for higher education?  And this is far from all the expense items for young men and women.  Clothing, food, entertainment - they all pay special attention to this.  The first thing that comes to mind is to borrow from relatives or acquaintances. </p>

All that remains is to lend money to the bank.  However, this is not as easy as it seems.  First of all, you need to find out which bank has been lending since 18 years.  As practice shows, not all of the above financial institutions positively resolve the issue when they learn that the borrower is an ordinary student.  Nevertheless, the situation for university students is gradually changing for the better, since at this age many of them get jobs and have stable wages.

    <p>  Considering the question of which bank has been giving credit since 18 years old, it should be noted that the conditions for providing it for young people will not be somewhat different from the standard ones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cons of lending </h2><p>  Of course, when money is needed urgently, people agree to any requirements for their return.  Is it worth it?  Or maybe it's better to wait a bit and find something more suitable?  Let's get it right. </p><p>  So, the young man found out for himself which bank has been lending since 18 years.  Rejoicing at this, he turns to the financial structure, whose employees explain that he cannot count on a large amount of money (maximum 50 thousand rubles), while the interest rate on the loan is not so small.  Rummage?  Yes, unfortunately, this is so, and the young man cannot change anything here: he either agrees to such an offer or not.  But agreeing, remember: you have to pay the bills. </p><h2>  Who offers the most favorable conditions </h2>

    <p>  Experts recommend, first of all, to get acquainted with the offers of Sberbank, VTB-24, Raiffazen Bank, Tinkoff and Privatbank.  It should be noted that the first two financial institutions do not have a clearly developed loan program - they give out money according to individual conditions.  If we talk about Privatbank, then this structure can provide a loan in the amount of 150 thousand rubles for 4 years, subject to 35% per annum. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  With particular care should be considered the proposal of the Tinkoff Bank, which offers only 12.5% ‚Äã‚Äãper annum.  True, behind such a low interest rate, a whole arsenal of commissions may be hidden, which will significantly raise it. </p><h2>  Documents </h2><p>  So, what documents will be required for a financial institution to approve a loan (cash) from the age of 18? </p><p>  It should be noted that in view of the enormous competition in the market, each financial structure does its best to add to its list of customers. </p>

However, it must be noted that the above is true for cases when the loan size is not too large (up to 30 thousand rubles).  If you intend to apply for a loan with a larger amount from the bank, it may require you to provide a statement of income or find guarantors. </p><h2>  Loan offers </h2><p>  Let us analyze the most <span>common</span> loan issuance <span>proposals</span> .

    <p>  The above financial structure conducts a rather strict selection of borrowers, and the chances of borrowing money for students are relatively small.  Young people who apply to Sberbank for a loan must necessarily find guarantors, and these should be relatives.  You will also need a certificate of income not only of the borrower, but also of the guarantors.  The amount of borrowed funds may be up to 3 million rubles.  They will have to be returned in 5 years.  The minimum interest rate is 16.5% per annum, the maximum - 24.5% per annum. </p><h2>  GE Money Bank </h2><p>  This bank grants individuals from 18 years old a loan of up to half a million rubles.
