If you are a parent who bought a new device for your child, you probably want to set up parental controls and content filtering on the device to prevent the display of inappropriate content.  You can create limited profiles on tablets, use third-party applications to exercise such control, or even allow filtering and passwords for purchases on the Play Store. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thetruthspy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="parental control on the phone" class="if uuid-2585762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2585762.jpg"></div><h2>  Create and use restricted profiles </h2><p>  If you purchased a gadget running Android, you can configure the profile limit.  How to establish parental control in this way?  To do this, open the "Settings" menu of your device.  Find the gear icon on the home screen, notification bar, or application list and tap it.  This will open all the settings menu of your device. </p><p>  Scroll down and click on "Users".  A menu will open in which you can add new users to the device.  Create a restricted user profile.  Click Add User or Profile, and from the options, select Limited.  Set a password for the account.  This will be required if you do not already have such protection.  To do this, select your preferred security option (PIN, password or pattern), then enter your choice. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As soon as you finish setting up parental control on Android, a new screen will appear in which all installed applications on the device will be listed.  Each of them will have an on and off button located next to them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.av-test.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="parental control on android" class="if uuid-2585765" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2585765.jpg"></div><p>  Click the three-line icon next to the ‚ÄúNew profile‚Äù option at the top of the screen.  In the dialog that appears, enter its name (this may be the name of your child).  When you finish the input process, click OK. </p><p>  Now you can select the applications that the user of the profile will have access to.  For example, if you want your child to be able to enter only their games, select exclusively gaming services.  To select the applications you need, tap the switch button next to the program name and put it in the ‚ÄúON‚Äù position.  Leave the services to which you do not want to allow the child in the ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù option. </p><h2>  How to fix the result? </h2><p>  How to put parental control permanently?  Exit the Settings menu and lock the screen.  Reactivate it by pressing the Home button on the device.  Now you will see <span>a lock screen</span> on which user names will be displayed (below).  Select a user name with a limited profile, then open the screen using the PIN code, password or key that you set. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When accessing the list of applications, you will see that only those services that you have selected for this account will be displayed.  These are the only programs your child can run. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to establish parental control" class="if uuid-2585766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2585766.jpg"></div><h2>  Using a special application </h2><p>  You can also download and install the parental control app from the Play Store.

It will be used to add an unlimited number of applications, make changes to the settings and exit the parental control mode on the Android phone.

Find the menu button (three dots or three lines), tap it, and select Create PIN.  Enter the PIN you want to use, then click OK.  For added security, some parental control apps will ask you to select a security question and give an answer.
