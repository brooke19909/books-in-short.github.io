    <h2>  Negative reviews from a stay at the Imera Hotel </h2><p>  Unfortunately, <span>the Imera Hotel (Vityazevo)</span> receives not only positive <span>reviews</span> about its stay from some tourists.  But there are much fewer than good ones. </p><ul><li>  There was such a precedent that when checking into a room, vacationers outside the window did not see at all what they expected.  Discontent was expressed to the administration until the willingness to leave the hotel.  True, in fairness it must be said that the guests were offered to return 20% of the amount paid for inconvenience. </li><li>  There were cases that tourists, arriving in a pre-booked room, found it not yet cleaned, and had to wait. </li><li>  Somehow in the village the light was knocked out and for a long time I had to wait until it was repaired. </li><li>  Some vacationers complained that they didn‚Äôt work well, or someone from the air conditioner and TV remote control didn‚Äôt work at all. </li><li>  Sometimes complaints were received about poor-quality housekeeping. </li><li>  As for the rest at the Imera hotel out of season, you have to travel to larger cities for entertainment.  Nothing works in Vityazevo itself at this time. </li><li>  The big difference between holiday prices in spring and summer.  In principle, this is normal practice, but some tourists resting in the spring regret that they can not come here in the summer. </li><li>  And there were also complaints that in some rooms they cleaned only on demand, otherwise there was no cleaning. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Many tourists have been coming to the <span>Imera guest house for</span> many years <span>.</span>  <span>Holidays in Vityazevo (Anapa) are</span> remembered for a long time by the clear sea, a lot of entertainment and excursions, thought out services to the smallest detail.
