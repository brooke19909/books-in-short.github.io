But you can try your luck if you want to get a maid, dishwasher, nurse or hotel supervisor and join the friendly team of the Arthurs Hotel. </p><h2>  Arthurs (hotel): guest reviews </h2><p>  Most of the hotel reviews are positive, but there are still downsides.  Let's start with the pros: </p><ul><li>  Great service - the staff is friendly and helpful, but unobtrusive. </li><li>  A varied and delicious food, it is impossible to stay hungry. </li><li>  Very beautiful design, nice interior, new furniture - in a word, there is everything you need for a comfortable life on vacation. </li><li>  The rooms are clean and bright, cleaning is done every day. </li><li>  An excellent spa center that allows you to truly relax, while the prices for the procedures are quite adequate. </li><li>  Excellent location - close to the city, and at the same time creates a sense of privacy. </li><li>  The opportunity to fish, rent bicycles, sledges, tubing depending on the season also pleases visitors. </li><li>  Good animation and entertainment for adults. </li><li>  Small but cozy and picturesque area. </li><li>  Outdoor paths and lawns are suitable for running and other sports. </li></ul><p>  Well, the minuses of this hotel: </p><ul><li>  A very small amount of children's entertainment and animation. </li><li>  Food may not be to everyone's taste. </li><li>  There may be interruptions in the hot water supply. </li><li>  Too high prices in the hotel restaurants. </li><li>  The feeling of emptiness in the rooms like a studio - not enough furniture. </li></ul><h2>  Hotel Arthurs: address.  How to get there </h2><p>  Where is this place located?  Hotel "Arthurs" (Moscow region) is located twenty kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road, in the Mytishchi district, in the village of Larevo, ownership 3, building 1. </p><p>  To get to it by car, you should turn from the Moscow Ring Road towards Dmitrovskoye Shosse and then go twenty-two kilometers to the sign "Larevo Village".  After driving straight for 300 m, turn right - and after one kilometer you are at your destination. </p><p>  If you plan to travel by public transport, you should catch an electric train at <span>Savelovsky station</span> in the directions of Dubna, Iksha, Savelovo, Dmitrov and get off at Katuar station.  From the station you can call a taxi to the hotel. </p><p>  So, if you want to go to relax in a secluded place with family or friends for a few days, or think where to celebrate a wedding or a birthday, or maybe your company has a memorable date that you want to celebrate with colleagues, or just go to Moscow business, and at the same time I want to have a good rest too, feel free to choose the Arthurs spa hotel.  It is ideal for each type of trip, and pleasant memories of the time spent will remain for a long time. </p>
