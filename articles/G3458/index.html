    <p>  Politics is an activity related to the process of organizing and mobilizing resources to achieve collective goals.  The concept itself has been used since ancient times.  So, the treatise of Aristotle was called "Politics".  The word itself came from the ancient Greek "polis" - city-state, community.  Thus, the essence of politics, according to Aristotle, had a close relationship with the life of society and the state. </p><p>  A slightly different definition was given by J. Blondel.  The essence of politics, according to the French political scientist, was mainly an activity by which decisions are reached, which are subsequently implemented in the conditions of society and for its good. </p><p>  Over the course of a long period, representations of the above activities were purely normative.  In accordance with this, the essence of politics consisted in a ‚Äústruggle for a fair order‚Äù, representing a method of achieving good for the whole society. </p><p>  In science, the interpretation of the definition depends on the theoretical position of the student. </p><p>  Politics in the structurally functional sense is an indispensable component of the organization of each team.  Moreover, the activity is directly related to <span>goal-setting (setting goals / goals),</span> coercion and maintaining integrity in the community in front of the danger of global threats. </p><p>  D. Easton (American political scientist) defined the essence of politics as a volitional value distribution.  In other words, certain <span>social phenomena are</span> necessarily endowed with meaning.  Subsequent refinement of the specifics was associated with the establishment of the order of access to resources of social importance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Adherents of the conflict approach defined politics as a conflict of class interaction (according to Marx) and interaction between interested groups (according to the concepts of Truman, Bentley and other figures). </p><p>  A number of experts believe that this social activity is aimed at the mandatory settlement of conflicts occurring in society.  In this case, the instrument of regulation are values.  According to this concept, there is a shift in emphasis from directly conflict interaction towards ensuring its peaceful settlement.  According to the American political scientist Held, the embodiment of politics takes place in the struggle and cooperation of groups on the production, use, and distribution of resources. </p><p>  According to proponents of rational choice theory, an analysis should be carried out in categories of social exchange.  In this case, the basic category for the study becomes a private goal and individual interest.  Activities considered as a system of <span>social interaction of</span> individuals striving for the collective achievement of goals are formed under the condition that it is impossible to achieve them individually. </p><p>  The essence of pricing policy </p><p>  Cost is a critical economic indicator.  The company is forced to reckon with the price and (if possible) influence it.  Cost (in a competitive market) is formed mainly under the influence of factors that objectively develop independently of the enterprise. </p><p>  The essence of tax policy </p><p>  This activity is a collection of activities in the field of fees and payments.  The starting point in the implementation of tax policy are the provisions in tax law.  The manifestations of this set of measures are benefits, rates, facilities. </p><p>  Tax policy is considered an obligatory part <span>of financial policy.</span>  The goals and content of this activity are determined by the socio-economic structure in society, as well as by groups with state power. </p>
