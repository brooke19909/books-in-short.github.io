For older travelers, the love of the picturesque views and beaches of Sunny Beach, Nessebar and Kranevo still has pre-perestroika roots.  Youth reliably occupied the cheerful Golden Sands.  But most of all, Bulgarian resorts are chosen by small tourists, and, of course, by their parents. </p><p>  They are attracted by a pleasant subtropical climate, even fine-grained sandy beaches, picturesque views, spicy local cuisine, ripe juicy fruits and infrastructure designed for children.  And the cherry on the cake of the advantages of Bulgarian resorts are quite affordable prices, the absence of language barriers and unique excursion programs. </p><p>  Hotels in Bulgaria for families with children are also very welcome.  Many of them adopted a brilliant manner of service in Greek and Turkish hotels, introduced all kinds of children's clubs, and gathered animation teams.  We also designed the food for tourists on the All Inclusive system, which is well suited for guests with children. </p><p>  In summer, there is no time difference between Moscow and Bulgaria, in winter it is minus 1 hour.  Upon arrival, tourists are often ready to go to the beach or to the pool and do not lose half a day to sleep and adapt to the new time. </p><h2>  Advantages of Primorsko </h2><p>  Tourists who are looking for comfortable hotels in Bulgaria for families with children can immediately be advised to narrow down their searches and find a hotel within Primorsko.  This is an absolutely completed resort with well-established service, pleasant sights and a decent hotel base. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Primorsko, with its natural wealth, picturesque cliffs, pristine forests and rare plants, is considered a protected area.  But in the center of the nature reserve there is a wonderful highly developed resort, which is visited by 75 thousand tourists every season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Bulgaria" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1856440.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Primorsko is the ‚Äúgolden mean‚Äù for those who are tired of the hustle and bustle of noisy resorts but don‚Äôt want to be bored with their entire vacation, cruising between the beach and the hotel.  In this nice region, there is an atmosphere of leisureliness, comfort, measured, as on the Greek islands.  But the presence of water parks, beach entertainment centers, attractions does not allow tourists to plunge into a state of holiday inertia. </p><h2>  How to get to Primorsko </h2><p>  In the summertime, from Moscow to Bulgaria, in addition to regular flights from Aeroflot and <span>Bulgaria Air,</span> charter flights also fly.  Charters from travel companies accept the eastern <span>airports of Varna</span> and Burgas.  Primorsko is located in the south, 50 km from Burgas Airport. </p><p>  This resort is suitable for tourists who cannot tolerate long transfers.  From the airport to the town can be reached in 30 minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels in Bulgaria for families with children" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1856439.jpg" width="600"></div>
