And all because such creations look unrealistically spectacular and unusual, without requiring large expenses.  With a little imagination, with your own hand you can do beautiful and practical things that will serve you for a long time. </p><h2>  Ideas for knitting from bags </h2><p>  You can knit a huge number of things necessary for the home: carpets for the floor, napkins, bags, slippers, baskets for small items or children's toys and many other items equally important in everyday life.  More creative and inventive needlewomen create unique and very fashionable creations from this unusual raw material, for example, jewelry and fashionable evening handbags. </p><p>  For yourself, at the beginning of work, tie a sample to see what the texture of the product will be.  Inexperienced needlewomen it is better to take garbage bags up to 50 liters.  They are softer and easier to create from.  But do not use very thin plastic bags for knitting bags - the products will not be able to keep their shape. </p><h2>  "Spin" polyethylene thread </h2><p>  Conventional garbage bags and T-shirts from the supermarket are suitable for creativity.  All of them are different in color, density, stiffness.  To create a thinner canvas, with a softer texture, thin bags for bulk products are taken.  Bags of large volume and stiffness are better suited for thick objects - this is necessary so that the products retain their shape better.  The methods of knitting from plastic bags do not differ at all from the usual ones - with the help of knitting needles or a hook. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to build something, you need to divide the packages into strips.  You will need a sharp knife to cut paper or scissors.  If the bag is thin, then we cut the strips wide and vice versa.  Suppose the package contains a volume of 30 liters.  We cut such bags into ribbons of 2.2 - 2.5 cm. Thin shirts are best divided into strips of 3.5 - 4 cm. Also, do not forget to consider for what product we are preparing ‚Äúyarn‚Äù, what loads the finished thing will experience.  The rule for choosing its thickness is the same as when knitting with ordinary threads: the thinner the polyethylene tape - the softer and more elegant the finished result.  Therefore, we knit baskets and rugs from "threads" about 5 cm, and for decorative products we take a width of 2 - 2.5 cm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.spitthatoutthebook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Floor mats" class="if uuid-2575503" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2575503.jpg"></div><p>  The packages were cut, now we connect them along the chain into one long "thread".  There are 2 options for connecting the bands.  At the first, we all immediately connect with each other, in the second case we put the strips in a box and just start knitting, attaching each next as the previous one is knitted.  With the second method, the work of knitting from plastic bags is faster. </p><h2>  Basket with lid for storing small items </h2><p>  To tie a small basket for small items, we need to stock up with five garbage bags with a volume of 80 l, a thin wire or a hard tourniquet and a crochet hook.  The basket will turn out shallow - about six cm, it all depends on the length of the wire. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Create Recycle Bin" class="if uuid-2575525" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2575525.jpg"></div><p>  We start our knitting from plastic bags, a workshop on creating a basket will be presented later. </p><p>  We knit a round bottom pillar.  without nak., picking up a wire and tying it.  We create a circle, as usual when crocheting, adding columns in the right places according to the pattern.  Next, go to the walls of our basket - just continue to knit without additions.  We knit in height 6 - 8 cm, continuing to pick up the wire. </p><p>  The lid is made in the same way, only when knitting a circle we increase the number of rows by 2 so that you can freely close the basket. </p><p>  We tie the edges, the lid can be decorated with flowers, beads - depending on what purpose you plan to use your product. </p><p>  This method is suitable for baskets of any size and purpose, you just need to change the color, density of the bags and the final size. </p><h2>  Clutch made of polyethylene - a fashion accessory </h2><p>  Skilled craftswomen can create a huge amount of things needed in the household, fashion accessories, as well as products for decorating the interior with almost no cost.  Such things are very durable, not afraid of sunlight, they can be washed without fear that they will lose their shape.  With the help of a hook, imagination and knitting patterns, you can knit a wonderful clutch - this is a small women's handbag without a strap. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hinghamsquareneedlepoint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Designer Clutches" class="if uuid-2575530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2575530.jpg"></div><p>  We cut the prepared packages, put them in a box.  We take a suitable size hook (if it is too thin, it will be very difficult to knit the loop, if it is thick, then too large holes will be obtained).  To determine the optimal thickness of the hook, we knit a sample.  We collect a chain of air.  loops 20 cm long. According to the scheme, we distribute the pattern report and knit 30 cm. As a result, you should get a rectangle with sides 20 and 30 cm. We continue to knit the valve, making reductions in one loop at the beginning of each row (front and back).  When the resulting triangle comes to naught, we make a buttonhole for the button.  We knit the "step of the dog" in a way.  We sew on the sides so that an envelope with sides of 15 and 20 cm is obtained. We sew with beads, rhinestones or decorate with flowers.  Sew a beautiful button - and that's it, a fashionable unique handbag is ready! </p><h2>  Bright beach bag </h2><p>  A crocheted bag can also be useful for hiking on the beach.  It can be made very interesting, convenient.  The most important thing in her performance is accuracy.  Let's try knitting a white-green beach bag.  We buy packages green and white, there should be 2 times more white ones.  We connect the cut strips in the following sequence: 1 green stripe, 2 white strips, etc. </p><p>  First, we will need to knit 2 identical oval details for the bottom.  We cut out a dense lining, put it between the bottoms and connect them together with half columns. </p><p>  We continue to knit with single crochet in a straight line 26 - 30 cm. Due to the serial connection of green and white stripes, we will get a very interesting marble pattern.  On the sides we make pinches in the form of oncoming folds - not very deep - and we knit another 2 - 3 cm. Divide into two parts, add rows individually another 4 cm and sew the lock.  We will knit the handles, attach them to the bag.  Decorate to your taste than you like!  We made an easy-to-care and very practical bag. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.turntopretty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bright beach bag" class="if uuid-2575516" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2575516.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitted slippers for guests </h2><p>  Slippers linked from packages come in handy everywhere.  They can go to the bath, they are useful in the pool and at home.  Packages it is advisable to buy a more fun color.  Choose the style of slippers and go!  First, we make a pattern on the foot.  We knit an oval sole on this pattern very tightly, a pillar.  single crochet or half-columns, and then we knit the top of the slippers, focusing on your preferences (clogs, slippers, flip flops, etc.).  To decorate or not is also up to you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bath slippers" class="if uuid-2575522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2575522.jpg"></div><p>  In conclusion, we sew the slippers to the sole and wait for the guests! </p><h2>  Polyethylene flowers for decoration </h2><p>  For decoration created from packages of things, you can take flowers connected from the same material. </p><p>  To make a poppy flower, we need red and black bags.  First, the "Irish berry" for the box.  We wrap 10-17 turns on the finger with black thread, tie them with fifteen posts.  single crochet.  We knit a row of pillars.  single crochet.  In the next row - 20 pillars.  single crochet.  We form 20 arches from five air.  loops.  Continue with a red thread and knit 20 pillar.  with a crochet on the "Irish berry".  In the following rows - 2 columns.  with a crochet in each loop, a total of 40 in the second row, and 3 posts.  with a double crochet in each - in the third.  Again we take the black thread and in reverse we tie the edge of the flower. </p><p>  The scheme for knitting from plastic bags of chamomile. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bolshoyvopros.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chamomile - scheme" class="if uuid-2575815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2575815.jpg"></div><p>  Flowers made in this way will decorate your finished products.  You can also bind any others using patterns for ordinary threads. </p><h2>  Crocheting rugs from plastic bags </h2><p>  Carpet "Lamb" in the nursery is a great idea.  It will add coziness and warmth.  For the rug, we need beige and dark brown bags, cardboard, strong threads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/171207223304456669/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Soft sheep" class="if uuid-2575543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2575543.jpg"></div><p>  We cut out a cardboard ring with a diameter of 3 cm inside and 7 cm outside. We make pompoms (43 pieces) from beige bags, dressing them with threads.  From a brown polyethylene yarn we knit a filet square of the size of the body of our sheep.  We attach the prepared pompons (42 pcs.) To the grid.  The closer they are to each other, the thicker and denser the mat will turn out.  Also from the brown "yarn" we knit the tail, head and legs.  Attach the last pompom to the tail. </p><p>  Knitting rugs from plastic bags can be turned into an exciting activity.  Invite your child to participate in the assembly of such a fun accessory, and he will be very pleased! </p><p>  Let's look at knitting an oval rug from plastic bags.  Such a rug is good for the bathroom in that it does not slip on the floor, does not absorb water, dries quickly and is perfectly washed.  We will create it according to the scheme shown in the photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oval napkin, scheme" class="if uuid-2575573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2575573.jpg"></div><p>  The wonderful things made of polyethylene made by hand are very original, unusual and, certainly, unique!
