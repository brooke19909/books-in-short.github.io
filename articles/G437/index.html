    <p>  On the basis of Android, inexpensive models of smartphones are increasingly appearing.  Among them is the MTS 970, the characteristics, the price and purpose of which suit many mobile users.  First of all, the Android platform is convenient, which is understandable to most users.  MTS 970 also has the following system characteristics: 4 GB - total memory and 512 - operational.  This data will allow you to easily work with various Internet applications.  However, it is worth noting that you should purchase a memory card for this phone (it supports microSD format up to 32 GB), since free memory for installing applications the first time you turn on you will only have 1.4 GB available.  The fact is that the operator by default adds you several applications that provide additional account management capabilities and various services from the operator.  The speed of applications is ensured by a single-core 1 GHz processor, which is enough for <span>surfing the Internet</span> with the help of special applications, as well as using all the necessary functions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Camera options </h2>

However, she does not have a flash, which does not distinguish her from such devices.

In the camera menu, you have the option of choosing a shooting mode, setting exposure parameters and white balance.  In addition, delayed descent and various focuses are possible.  The camera interface is not too overloaded, but at the same time there are the most necessary functions with which you can make high-quality photos.  There is also a function for creating videos.  Writing speed <span>25 frames</span> per second.  The video quality is very good, such a video can be posted on the network.  There is also a <span>front camera</span> for communicating on Skype and making video calls.  It is rather weak, only 0.3 megapixels, but this power is enough for the interlocutor to see you.

Convenience lies in the fact that the folders of the memory card and the device itself will be displayed on the computer.  This is a very convenient option for working with all files.

It is worthwhile to consider in more detail the system refinement from the operator.  At the first acquaintance with the system, you will notice an abundance of branded MTS applications:

The phone works with all applications, showing high performance.  There are no complaints from users about freezes and other system glitches. </p><h2>  Input method </h2><p>  The smartphone has a SwiftKey keyboard by default, which is highly learnable.  At the same time, he studies your style and frequency of using words, so that later it is possible to quickly type sentences.  It is used not only in social networks and SMS, but also in the mail service.  Also, this keyboard is very convenient to use and has many options that are convenient for the user.  The only drawback is the letters that are too small for typing, but this is not a drawback of the keyboard itself, but the need for developers to make it compact due to the small <span>screen size.</span> </p><h2>  Energy saving system optimization </h2><p>  The MTS 970 smartphone, the technical characteristics of which are very diverse, differs from others in energy control.  To do this, it has a special application in which several battery usage modes are preinstalled.  Flexible application customization is also available for personalization. </p><p>  For example, three modes are available for selection: </p><ul><li>  Normal. </li><li>  Energy saving. </li><li>  Optimal. </li></ul><p>  Using the application, you can find out the estimated remaining time of using the device.  Statistics are also available that reflects the time elapsed since the last connection to the power source.  By the way, even without using this application, the battery holds for a long time.  With the active use of the phone (listening to music, surfing the Internet, chatting on social networks, watching videos), the battery may last for the whole working day.  Reduce the number of hours of operation on the battery only the game. </p><h2>  MTS 970: specifications, reviews and comparison with similar smartphones </h2>

Compared with more expensive models, a number of shortcomings can be identified.  For example, many complain about the quality of the speaker.  The interlocutor is audible, and there are no annoying rustles and interference on the line, but the quality is worse in comparison with more expensive phone models.

    <p>  There are also claims to the display, in comparison with similar models they are acceptable.  But if you compare with the devices of the class above, you can see that the font is displayed slightly differently than with models with a higher screen resolution. </p><p>  The display also has a number of complaints.  It has already been mentioned that he has a fairly small viewing angle, as well as displaying objects in sunny weather.  In general, it can be noted that in comparison with IPS display systems, the quality is somewhat worse.  At the same time, typing and touchscreen by users were rated quite high. </p><p>  Of the advantages, users have identified a convenient virtual work plane, which can be completely changed for themselves.  It is worth noting that in total there are 3 desktops in the phone, by default two of them are absolutely empty.  You can fully equip these planes for yourself and your needs. </p><p>  If we consider the MTS 970 phone, the characteristics of which are quite acceptable for its price segment, from the point of view of the consumer, then it is very attractive for purchase.  For a small price, it presents a large number of options, and all the shortcomings are not significant.  It is well suited for customers of the MTS operator.  Indeed, for not the highest price, you can have access to the Web and a sufficient number of convenient services on hand.  There is also a modification of the MTS 970 h, the characteristics of which are not inferior to the considered model.  As for the cost, this phone can cost you up to 2,000 rubles, depending on the conditions of purchase. </p>
