This methodology, named after the researcher who created it, is called the ‚ÄúOverton Window‚Äù.  The theory quite fully and reasonably describes the ways of socio-informational management of people and the whole society that have been used by the Euro-Atlantic center of world power in the last century.  The main goal of such actions is to dehumanize, corrupt, depersonalize and humanize all social layers of the population. </p><h2>  The essence of the theory </h2><p>  Overton Windows - what is this method?  This is a political theory that describes the boundaries of ideas that can be accepted by society.  The existing framework of opportunities is a kind of window. </p>

    <p>  This theory points to the political viability of an idea.  It turns out that she is not capable of winning the minds of people at the request of any statesman.  Any idea will be approved by society only if it gets into the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù.  At the same time, it will appear in the list of those concepts that at a given moment of time will be accepted by the people.  Subsequently, politicians will be able to adhere to such ideas without fear of accusations of extremism or radicalism.  The shift of this ‚Äúwindow‚Äù occurs in the event of a change in public opinion and the adoption by the population of one or another politician. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  The American sociologist Joseph Overton studied the window of opportunity for introducing immorally intolerable phenomena and presented it to public opinion in 1990.

    <p>  ‚ÄúOverton's Windows‚Äù - what kind of impact on the opinion of society?  This is not brainwashing at all, but a more sophisticated technology.  It is made effective by systematic consistent application, as well as the victim's veil of the fact of exposure. </p><p>  For example, mankind has already adopted a subculture of gays, as well as their right to adopt children, marry and promote their sexual orientation.  At the same time, there is talk that all this is a natural course of things.  However, this is not at all what Joseph Overton convincingly proved to us in 1990. The author revealed a whole technology that contributes to the destruction of social institutions, as a result of which the immoral ideas are legalized.  And in order to achieve the desired result, you need to do only five steps, passing 5 ‚ÄúWindows Overton‚Äù.  At the same time, society will first begin to condemn any idea unacceptable to it, transferring it to the rank of relevant ones, and then reconcile itself to a new legislative act, which will fix the right to the existence of something unthinkable until recently. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Consider the ‚ÄúWindows of Overton‚Äù on the example of cannibalism.  Today, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlegalizing the rights of citizens to eat each other is completely unimaginable.  The promotion of this phenomenon at the moment is simply impossible.  Society will certainly protest this terrible action.  However, if Overton's Windows begins to be used, what will it give to those who wish to promote this idea?  According to the theory of the American sociologist, the solution to such a problem is currently at the zero stage, which is called "Unthinkable."  An idea can be realized only after going through all stages of the windows of opportunity.  The method works flawlessly. </p><p>  Nikita Mikhalkov popularly talks about this theory, which entangles people's minds with lies in his creative program Besogon.  Overton's Windows, in his opinion, often turn out to be the screen of our television through which anything can infiltrate the <span>human mind</span> . </p><h2>  Technology </h2><p>  The American sociologist describes actions that allow society to legalize absolutely any idea.  The Overton Windows technology has not been proposed by the author.  He simply described the existing methods, the application of which leads to the desired result.  In other words, Overton presents an already working technology, which in its efficiency can exceed the thermonuclear discharge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  First stage </h2><p>  The initial stage of a theory such as Overton's Windows - what is this step, what is its purpose?  To obtain the desired result in the first stage, you should: </p><p>  - eliminate the taboo on the discussion of a particular phenomenon; </p><p>  - make the idea known to a wide circle of members of society; </p><p>  - lead to routine discussion of this phenomenon; </p><p>  - raise the idea to the status of an important universal theme. </p><p>  To achieve this goal, a particular phenomenon is introduced into the information sphere as a radical defiant.  This position of the idea will attract public attention to it. </p>

    <p>  Further, a spontaneous discussion of the topic will gradually become organized.  The "Unthinkable" will gradually move into the "Radical" area.  Unbeknownst to society, this or that phenomenon located in the prohibition zone will be promoted by information sources using a specific example.  In this case, a good goal will be set at first glance - to find out whether this is such a terrible phenomenon and why you can‚Äôt do it?  What follows is the conclusion that some people do just that, and yet they are happy. </p><p>  Cannibalism may well ‚Äúspin up‚Äù the theory of the ‚ÄúOverton Window‚Äù.  In order to transfer it from an inconceivable phenomenon to a radical one, you can assemble an ethnological symposium that addresses such a topic as ‚ÄúExotic rites of Polynesian tribes‚Äù.  Here, scientists will talk objectively about such a thing as cannibalism, which will be the initial movement of a theory called "Windows of Overton."  This step, on which a review of the existing public opinion is outlined, will make it possible to change the implacable attitude into a positive one.  The goal of the first stage has been achieved.  The topic was put into circulation and the taboo on its discussion was destroyed. </p><p>  This theory in our country has its own striking examples.  They tried to shift the ‚ÄúOverton Window‚Äù by asking <span>the media</span> about the likelihood of surrendering Leningrad in order to avoid the death of a large number of people, as well as by comparing the Russian Olympic champion with an SS officer.  These are typical cases of the first stage of this theory, when the topic is removed from the prohibition zone.  If the society agrees to take such a step, then it will pass the remaining stages automatically.  Fortunately, the Russians did not begin to discuss the topics he proposed, considering them clearly blasphemous. </p><h2>  Second phase </h2><p>  How does the Overton Window unfold further?  The theory considers the next stage of action as a transition from the ‚ÄúRadical‚Äù to the ‚ÄúAcceptable‚Äù.  Among the main goals of this stage is the substitution of previously forbidden concepts, in which the terms previously rejected by society are translated into emotionally neutral euphemisms.  At the same time, the sinful phenomenon changes its original meaning.  He is assigned a name that gives a positive semantic coloring.  In this case, information is given about any historical person or events affecting in one way or another a previously unacceptable phenomenon.  Such actions are not justified, but nevertheless, parts of society are suggested that everyone has sins. </p><p>  About how the process of legalizing cannibalism would further develop, one can also give examples.  The Overton Window will continue its movement with continued citation of scientists.  This leads to the idea that those who do not want to discuss this topic are not drawn to knowledge.  It can be recognized as a hypocrite or a hypocrite.  In parallel, cannibalism should be given some elegant name.  This moment is very important for the legalization of an inconceivable idea.  As a result, cannibalism no longer exists.  There is, for example, anthropophagy.  If this definition is soon to be considered offensive, it will quickly be replaced by another. </p><p>  The purpose of inventing new terms is to avoid the essence of the problem and its designation.  Moreover, the form breaks away from the word and its content, which deprives ideological opponents of weighty arguments. </p>

    <p>  Simultaneously with the game of names, a reference precedent is being created.  A mythological, historical, relevant, or simply made-up case is being pulled into the light, which must be legitimized.  It will be found as an indispensable "proof" that, in principle, anthropophagy can be legitimized.  For example, you can recall the legend of a mother who, saving her children from thirst, gave them their own blood to drink.  And the ancient gods!  They generally ate everyone.  The Romans considered such a phenomenon normal and natural!  With such arguments, the authors of the bacchanalia aim to make cannibalism a criminal offense.  Even if it was only once and at a certain historical moment. </p><h2>  Third stage </h2><p>  The psychology of ‚ÄúOverton's Windows‚Äù at this stage is aimed at: </p><p>  - approval of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe natural and natural nature of the phenomenon under discussion; </p><p>  - elimination of the attitude to the topic under discussion as absolutely unacceptable. </p><p>  At this stage, there is a transition from ‚ÄúAcceptable‚Äù to ‚ÄúReasonable‚Äù.  The problem, being previously integral, is divided into many types.  Some of them are terrible, and the second are quite acceptable and cute.  At the same time, society is presented with many different points of view on each type of problem, which are expressed by its quite respectable members. </p><p>  At this stage, the ‚ÄúOverton Window‚Äù movement in relation to cannibalism can be imagined simultaneously with the following statements in the media: </p><p>  - anthropophiles provoked; </p><p>  - the desire to be a cannibal is inherent in man by nature; </p><p>  - The forbidden fruit is especially sweet, etc. </p><p>  At the same time, an <span>artificial</span> battlefield is being created in the public mind.  Normal people who are not indifferent to the problem raised immediately get the status of radical haters.  At the same time, journalists and scientists are proving to the whole society that mankind throughout the history of its existence has been feeding on each other from time to time, and that this is a completely normal phenomenon. </p><h2>  Fourth stage </h2><p>  The goal of this step of the ‚ÄúOverton's Window‚Äù movement is to transfer the problem from the ‚ÄúIntelligent‚Äù stage to the ‚ÄúPopular‚Äù area.  At this stage: </p><p>  - Information is circulated on the mass character of the phenomenon under discussion; </p><p>  - the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe real presence of this problem is being introduced into <span>public consciousness</span> ; </p><p>  - Concrete examples are given with famous people who do not cause exclusion from the population. </p>

    <p>  Thus, the fourth stage is distinguished by the creation of the popularity of the phenomenon under consideration.  In this case, statistics are launched.  The media cite figures about the growing popularity of the idea, while talking about those people who are involved in this phenomenon, and at the same time are attractive not only in their behavior, but also in appearance. </p><p>  But how cannibalism be popularized?  Anthropophagy will be massively introduced into talk shows and news.  People will begin to eat in movies of wide distribution, in video clips and songs performed by singers.  In this case, one of the methods of popularization, which is called "Look around."  Information will appear in the media about the affiliation of the <span>famous composer</span> or director to the anthropophages, as well as data on the presence of millions of compatriot cannibals in mental hospitals. </p><p>  At this stage, the topic under development will enter the TOP and begin to self-actualize in politics, semi-business, etc. In order to justify the supporters of the legalization of this terrifying idea, criminals will be humanized.  They will be assigned a positive image by finding the necessary character traits.  About such people they can say that they are <span>creative individuals,</span> that they have an increased IQ, etc. </p><h2>  Fifth stage </h2><p>  At this step, the problem is being transferred from the Popular stage to the Political sphere.  The following objectives are pursued: </p><p>  - translation of the phenomenon into the political channel; </p><p>  - the proclamation of the denial of this idea as a violation of human rights; </p><p>  - the introduction into the minds of people of a negative attitude towards the denial of the phenomenon in question. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúOverton Window‚Äù movement at this stage becomes possible as a result of numerous social surveys, as a result of which the phenomenon will be interpreted as socio-political.  Moreover, the previously unacceptable idea begins to be included in the agenda for discussion of issues requiring a political or legal settlement.  At the same time, the essence of the problem will be presented to society as the need to protect the ‚Äúminority‚Äù, which is under threat. </p>

    <p>  At the last stage of the Overton Window movement, a legislative framework is being prepared.  Society at this moment is already defeated.  Only the most advanced part of it will resist a little the elevation to the rank of law of more recently unthinkable things.  However, society as a whole is already broken and in accordance with its defeat. </p><h2>  Technology implications </h2><p>  As a result of going through all five stages of the theory called ‚ÄúOverton Windows‚Äù, humanity loses its inner harmony.  Instead, people have only internal torment and controversy.  The one who implements this technology does not set as his goal to make everyone happy.  The movement of the "window" is made to obtain the desired vector in the development of society.  At the same time, people begin to lose touch with their culture and roots.  They become vulnerable and callous.  An example of this is the high level of suicide that occurs in <span>developed countries.</span>  That is why we can say that all of the above is a real destruction technology.  The ‚ÄúOverton Window‚Äù robs people of their humanity, leading them to death. </p><h2>  Confrontation </h2><p>  If you refuse, you can resist the influence of false ideas everywhere and always ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.  Only preserving our own individuality, we will not allow to give control of ourselves into the wrong hands.  The customs, customs and culture of the ancestors, which it must carefully preserve and protect, will allow society not to fall under mass manipulations.  These eternal values ‚Äã‚Äãwill allow to preserve individuality for each person.  At the same time, it is not at all necessary to follow long-gone traditions.  It is enough to respect and store them.  And it is worth remembering that the technology described by Overton is most easily applied in a tolerant society, where there are no ideals, there is no clear distinction between evil and good. </p>
