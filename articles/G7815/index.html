He received his name in honor of his uncle, the brother of the great Svyatoslav. </p><h2>  Origin </h2><p>  The father of the protagonist of the poem "The Word of Igor's Campaign", Prince Svyatoslav, was married twice.  His first wife was the daughter of the Polovtsian Khan Aepa, who received the name Anna at baptism.  The second time, Svyatoslav Olgovich went down the aisle in 1136.  This marriage caused a scandal.  Archbishop Nifont of Novgorod refused to hold the <span>wedding ceremony,</span> citing the fact that the first husband of the bride - the daughter of the posadnik Petrila, died recently.  Therefore, another priest crowned Prince Svyatoslav.  The future prince of Chernigov was born in this marriage, although some historians and publicists believe that it was Igor Svyatoslavich who was born Polovanka Anna. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Igor Svyatoslavich" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/990408.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  short biography </h2><p>  The prince‚Äôs father, a faithful ally and friend of <span>Yuri Dolgoruky,</span> Svyatoslav Olgovich was the same person whom the governor called to Moscow to discuss joint affairs.  Igor's grandfather was Oleg Svyatoslavich - the founder of the dynasty of Olgovich.  During the baptism, the boy was named George, however, as often happens, his Christian name was practically not used.  And in history, Igor Svyatoslavich became known under his pagan Russian name. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Already a seven-year-old child, the boy began to take part in campaigns with his father, defending the rights of his cousin uncle Izyaslav Davydovich, who claimed the throne of Kiev.  And at seventeen he had already gone on a grand campaign organized by Andrei Bogolyubsky, which ended in March 1169 with a three-day sack of the city of Kiev.  Since the time of his tumultuous youth, Igor Svyatoslavich, whose biography is the biography of a warrior who began his military career very early, realized that power gives the right not to justify his actions. </p><p>  The future hero of ‚ÄúThe Tale of Igor's Campaign‚Äù had more than one victorious campaign against the Polovtsy.  In 1171, he first felt fame, defeating Khan Kobyak in a battle on the Vorskla River.  This triumph showed that twenty-year-old Igor Svyatoslavich is a talented military leader.  The young man also had diplomatic abilities.  He presented the trophies to Roman Rostislavich, who ruled in Kiev. </p><p>  In 1180, being twenty-nine years old, the young military commander inherited the Principality of Novgorod-Seversky from his older brother.  This gave him the opportunity to start making his own plans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prince Igor Svyatoslavich" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/986219.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Authority </h2><p>  Some historians are sure that Prince Igor Svyatoslavich was an insignificant, secondary figure, but many disagree with this statement, reasonably arguing that even the geographical position of his principality, bordering the vast steppe, always predetermined the importance of his actions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When the princes of Southern Russia embarked on a joint campaign against the Polovtsy, it was Igor who was appointed senior over the troops by order of the great Svyatoslav Vsevolodovich.  As a result, another glorious victory was obtained over the steppe nomads near the Khorol River.  Inspired by this luck, Prince Igor launched another campaign that same year.  This expedition once again presented him with the laurels of the winner over the Polovtsy. </p><h2>  Major failure </h2><p>  It was against the backdrop of such success that Prince Igor decided to make another campaign to the steppe.  It was about him that a poem was written.  Then Igor was thirty-four years old, he was at the age of mature courage and was able to make informed decisions. </p><p>  Together with Prince Novgorod-Seversky, his son Vladimir, brother Vsevolod and nephew Svyatoslav Olegovich participated in the battle with the Polovtsy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The wife of Igor Svyatoslavich" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/987481.jpg" width="397"></div>

    <p>  The goal of this campaign, according to many historians, was not to save the Russian land from the constant raids of cruel steppes.  Prince Igor went with the wrong forces and the wrong route.  His main goal, most likely, was trophies - herds, weapons, jewelry and, of course, the capture of slaves.  A year earlier, in the Polovtsian lands <span>Svyatoslav Vsevolodovich</span> received a fairly rich booty.  Envy and greed pushed Igor into a military adventure.  He was not even stopped by the fact that the Polovtsian khan Konchak had huge self-arrows, pulled simultaneously by five dozen warriors, as well as ‚Äúlive fire‚Äù, as gunpowder was called in those days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Igor Svyatoslavich biography" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/986215.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Defeat </h2><p>  On the banks <span>of the Kayaly River,</span> Russian troops encountered the main forces of the steppes.  Almost all Polovtsian tribes from southeast Europe participated in the clash.  Their numerical superiority was so great that Russian troops very soon became surrounded.  Chroniclers report that Prince Igor behaved with dignity: even after receiving a serious wound, he continued to fight.  At dawn, after a day of continuous fighting, the troops, reaching the lake, began to bend around it. <br>  Igor, changing the direction of the departure of his regiment, went to the aid of his brother Vsevolod.  However, his soldiers, unable to stand it, began to flee, trying to get out of the encirclement.  Igor tried to return them, but in vain.  Prince Novgorod-Seversky was captured.  Many of his troops died.  Chroniclers talk about three days of fighting with the Polovtsy, after which Igor‚Äôs banners fell.  The prince escaped from captivity, leaving his son Vladimir, who later married the daughter of Khan Konchak. </p><h2>  Family and Children </h2><p>  The wife of Igor Svyatoslavich - the daughter of the Galician ruler <span>Yaroslav Vladimirovich,</span> bore him six children - five heirs and a daughter.  Her name is not mentioned in the annals, but historians call her Yaroslavna.  In some sources, she is referred to as Igor‚Äôs second wife, but most experts consider this version to be erroneous. </p><p>  The eldest son of Igor and Yaroslavna, Prince Putivlsky, Novgorod-Seversky and Galitsky Vladimir, born in 1171, married the daughter of Khan Konchak who captured him and his father. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Igor Svyatoslavich short biography" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/986220.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 1191, Prince Igor, together with his brother Vsevolod, undertook another campaign against the Polovtsy, this time successful, after which, having received reinforcements from Yaroslav Chernigovsky and Svyatoslav of Kiev, he went all the way to Oskol.  However, the steppes managed to timely prepare for this battle.  Igor had no choice but to withdraw the troops back to Russia.  In 1198, after the death of the ruler <span>Yaroslav Vsevolodovich, the</span> son of Svyatoslav took the Chernigov throne. </p><p>  The exact year of the death of Prince Igor Svyatoslavich is unknown, although in some chronicles December 1202 is indicated, although many consider the version that he died in the first half of 1201 to be more real. He, like his uncle, was buried in the Transfiguration Cathedral, located in the city Chernihiv. </p>
