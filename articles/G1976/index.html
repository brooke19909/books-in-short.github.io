Why buy ready-made, when in just a few hours you can associate unique ones that are not found in any store?  Yes, and shopping takes enough precious time.  How to knit beautiful booties for girls with knitting needles?  With a description, this is much more convenient, especially for beginners. </p><h2>  With love from mom </h2><p>  Before the appearance of the peanut, many mothers do not just prepare a wardrobe for him or her, but try to do each thing with their own hands.  When the baby is already born, it is so nice to put on beautiful tiny legs beautiful and warm booties.  For newborn girls and boys, they will be both protection from minor injuries and cold, and a convenient element of clothing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sweetcouch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Booties for girls" class="if uuid-3215340" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3215340.jpg"></div><p>  Modern booties add originality to any children's outfit - mom will be very happy.  By the way, not all kids who begin to learn to walk will be comfortable in hard boots, and booties are just right for this. </p><h2>  To your princess or as a gift? </h2><p>  How to knit beautiful booties for a girl with knitting needles?  With a description and a photo, it‚Äôs easier to do this - you can find some useful advice.  For beginners, it‚Äôs better to choose a lighter model, and those who knit for more than one year can add lace and decorative details. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before you start work, you need to find out the foot length of the baby or baby - measure from the tip of the big toe to the extreme point of the heel.  If booties are knitted as a gift, it is easier to use average sizes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blissfullydomestic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Comfortable baby booties" class="if uuid-3215310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3215310.jpg"></div><p>  In newborn children, the foot length is 9 centimeters, from three months to six months - 11.5 centimeters, from six months to one year - 12.5 cm, from one year and a half years - 14 cm, and from one and a half to two years - 15.5 cm. </p><p>  How to knit beautiful booties for girls with knitting needles?  With a description, this is much more convenient. </p><p>  Knitting should begin with the sole.  On the knitting needles dial the number of loops that is necessary (you need to calculate in advance).  Perform work with a garter or facial viscous.  For a newborn baby, 10 loops along with the hem will be enough.  Additions should be made through one row - along each edge and in the middle of the canvas.  It is more convenient if the knitter marks the middle loop and makes four additions.  Next, ten rows are knitted with an even cloth. </p><h2>  From down to a new set </h2><p>  The next step is to reduce the loops.  So the sole will be properly framed.  Continue until there are as many stitches on the knitting needles as there were ten at the beginning.  The last row does not need to be closed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the booties are knitted for the first time, it is better to record each action so that the second turns out exactly the same. </p><p>  Beautiful booties for girls with knitting needles with a description are best knitted as follows. </p><p>  On the side and back sides of the sole, you need to dial new loops and knit them in a circle.  For the convenience of work on the ends of the needles you can put on pieces of elastic bands.  The lining of the toe begins after twelve rows.  To get an even beautiful edge, you need to knit a row evenly, to the last loop.  Knit the last with the first, located on the side. </p><p>  Now the canvas needs to be turned over, and the back should also be tied - evenly, neatly, and at the same time, knit the last loop from the side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blissfullydomestic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful baby booties" class="if uuid-3215314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3215314.jpg"></div><p>  The toe will increase slightly, and the side, on the contrary, will decrease.  You can make the top when the number of loops on the knitting needles is the same.  In the front row, the craftswoman can make holes for the strings.  How to do it?  In the right place, it is enough to knit two loops together, and then gradually add as many loops and knit evenly. </p><p>  The last row needs to end with purl so that the edge does not wrap.  You can decorate to your taste - with knitted flowers, bows or ordinary beads. </p><h2>  28 loop shoes </h2><p>  Beautiful booties for girls with knitting needles with a description of the procedure for performing actions can be connected without difficulty. </p><p>  A thread will need only 50 grams. </p><p>  On straight knitting needles of the main color, dial 28 loops.  Make 52 rows with a garter stitch (the size of the booties will depend on how many rows are knitted).  Now, on the right, in one step close eight loops so that 20 loops remain. </p><p>  Continue to knit in a different color: perform 4 rows with the front stitch, the same number on the wrong side.  Rapport must be repeated 7 times.  Finish the work with facial loops, and all knitting ends with closing in one step. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sweetcouch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Booties for girls" class="if uuid-3215341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3215341.jpg"></div><p>  It's time to put the parts together.  First you need to sew the main part of the booties, along the rest to lay a basting seam and pull everything to the center. </p><p>  The upper part of the booties is formed in exactly the same way.  The edges that protrude should be turned away. </p><p>  You can decorate at will.  Agree that knitting beautiful booties for a girl with knitting needles for a beginner with a description is not as difficult as it seems. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  After describing the options for making comfortable shoes for the smallest young ladies, even a novice craftswoman will be able to knit them on her own.  You just need to set a goal, choose a model and purchase the necessary yarn.  All is ready.  You can start knitting beautiful booties for girls with knitting needles.  With a description, this will, of course, be more convenient, especially if mom makes such a gift to her baby for the first time. </p>
