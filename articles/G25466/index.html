But only if you approach this process correctly, that is, pre-calculate options, choose the best program and bank.  An active marketing policy at Post Bank offers favorable conditions for individuals in Russia.  The declared refinancing rate here is from 14.9% per annum, with the possibility of recovering part of the interest paid.  But is this proposal so beneficial, as seen at first sight?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><p>  Refinancing is a financial service that allows you to transfer credit obligations from one bank to another with the most favorable conditions. </p><p>  On August 1 of this year, Post Bank reduced interest rates on loan refinancing programs taken at other banks.  Funds began to be provided to borrowers at rates ranging from 14.9 to 19.9% ‚Äã‚Äãper year.  Clients have the opportunity to improve the conditions of their loans in other banks, as well as receive additional cash if necessary.  At Post Bank, you can re-lend various types of targeted and consumer loans. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mail bank refinancing of loans of other banks" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56264/2180603.jpg"></div>

This allows you to reduce the size of the payment and thus reduce your credit load. </p><p>  Thanks to the refinancing, it is possible to reduce the payment in the following ways: </p><ul><li>  Rate reduction.  Over time, in the presence of great competition in banks, interest decreases more and more.  This allows you to currently find the most favorable rates, compared with those at which the loan was issued before. </li><li>  Extension of the term.  Payment can be reduced by issuing another loan for a longer period. </li></ul><p>  In accordance with the new agreement, money is transferred from the current lender's account to a new account. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loan refinancing mail bank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56264/2180602.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How many loans can be combined? </h2><p>  As part of the loan refinancing at the Post Bank, you can combine up to four loans issued by other banks, and the conditions will be more favorable.  The maximum loan amount is equal to one million rubles.  In addition, special conditions are provided to pension banking customers.  They have the opportunity to get a loan at 14.9, 16.9 and 19.9% ‚Äã‚Äãper year, while the loan amount increases from one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Benefits of this refinancing program </h2><p>  Is refinancing at Post Bank profitable?  It happens that a loan issued earlier becomes unbearable for the borrower, and he is forced to revise his agreement with the bank.  If the lender does not agree to meet him and offer comfortable and favorable conditions for the restructuring of the loan, then the only way out is refinancing in another bank. </p><p>  There are many advantages to <span>refinancing loans of other banks</span> at Post Bank.  Such a service gives borrowers the following opportunities: </p><ul><li>  reduce the annual lending rate; </li><li>  Change the monthly payment for the better, that is, reduce; </li></ul>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  As soon as an application for refinancing loans at the Post Bank of other banks by an individual is sent, it remains only to wait for what decision the organization will make on it.  Most often, online applications are considered quite quickly - within one business day, after which a bank employee contacts the client and reports the result.  If the answer is yes, the client needs to appear at the appointed time at the bank branch with all the necessary documentation and conclude a new contract, after which Pochta Bank becomes the lender of the individual, and his task is to pay off the old debts of the consumer.  And the client‚Äôs task is following the schedule to make payments under the refinancing agreement. </p>
