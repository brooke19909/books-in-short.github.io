  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A relaxing holiday in Switzerland</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Switzerland is perhaps the most developed country in Europe.  Many tourists who have been here call it miniature Europe.  It consists of 20 cantons and 6 half-cantons.  Switzerland is famous for its amazingly clean air, large transparent lakes, its mountains and the dimensionality of life.  Most often, holidays in Switzerland are chosen by people of mature age, already held in life.  There are several treatment centers in the country where patients from all over the world dream of getting into.  Here you can find both megacities with modern skyscrapers, and small villages that have not changed much over the past 200 - 300 years.  The capital is Bern, where almost the entire economic life of the country takes place.  Lovers of <span>skiing</span> seek to spend their holidays in Switzerland <span>,</span> as the country is surrounded by mountain ranges. </p><p>  All holidays in Switzerland can be divided into several areas: wellness, panoramic, skiing and individual tours.  On the territory of the country there are a large number of <span>thermal springs,</span> as well as active scientific work on the fight against aging and maintaining the vitality of the body.  All this served as the basis for the creation of one of the most effective hospitals in the world, where the latest developments in the field of medicine and cosmetology are applied.  It is quite difficult to find last-minute tours to Switzerland to these establishments, because they are recorded several months in advance.  For example, the <span>thermal resort of</span> Bad Ragaz is little known to foreigners, but the Swiss and their neighbors actively visit it.  It is located near Zurich, at an altitude of 1000 m above sea level.  The resort has several hotels, a park, several souvenir shops and a couple of restaurants.  In a couple of days, tourists get used to this amazingly beautiful corner of nature.  The pearl of the resort is the Helena Bad thermal complex.  It impresses with the luxury of its decoration and the way the procedures themselves are conducted.  Specialists of this thermal complex are very responsible for their work and scrupulously perform it.  They radiate goodwill and professionalism. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For people who prefer ski holidays in Switzerland, the Portes du Soleil Valley will be interesting.  It is surrounded by the Alps.  There are several ski resorts, several descent options for beginners and professionals.  You can stay in the Chalet.  Every year, tens of thousands of skiers from all over the world try to buy last-minute tours to Switzerland in order to get an opportunity to go down from one of the greatest mountains in the world.  Due to the landscape features of this country, ski tourism is booming here.  Numerous resorts offer their visitors to stay in small hotels or in separate houses - chalets.  The complex has several small restaurants where you can enjoy a delicious dinner after a day skiing. </p><p>  Some tourists travel to Switzerland to spend a few days on the lake.  This <span>type of relaxation</span> will be most interesting to those who are tired of the bustle of the city and are looking for peace and tranquility.  A week spent on <span>Lake Geneva</span> among small old houses, neatly mowed meadows, will help restore mental and physical strength.  Tourists resting here go fishing, dine at local restaurants serving homemade food, walk through the woods, engage in contemplation.  Many will consider such a vacation boring, but only people who lived a stormy life and have already achieved something in it, understand its essence, taste.  Switzerland is not a country for mass visits.  Here you will not see deliberate luxury and crowds of tourists.  Rather, it opens only to selected travelers who are willing to understand it. </p>
