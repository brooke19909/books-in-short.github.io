You need to live in them, find out their history, take a sightseeing tour.  And then they slowly open to the newcomer.  But there are completely different cities: young and immediate, with a special energy.  They seem to charge with positive, warm with warmth.  And one of these cities is Petah Tikva.  In this article, we will take a virtual tour of this very first Jewish settlement in Israel in New History.  What to see in Petah Tikva, where it is and what is famous for - all this will be the theme of our short essay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Petah Tikva" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1962765.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  Petah Tikva was founded by Jewish immigrants from Belarus back in 1878.  Thus, this settlement is more than half a century older than the state of Israel.  The history of this city is quite interesting.  Belarusian Jews, led by rabbis David Huttmann, Zerah Barnett, Yoel-Moshe Salomon and others, arrived in Ottoman Palestine to establish an agricultural settlement in the Achor Valley, near Jericho.  The pioneers bought the land and called their village ‚ÄúThe Gate of Hope,‚Äù taking this name from Hosea's prophecy (2:15).  But the Turkish sultan canceled the purchase of land.  Then the first settlers moved to the mouth of the Yarkon River and bought a plot there near the Arab village of Mulabbis.  They began to cultivate the land, but since this area was swampy, malaria epidemics often broke out there.  Then the pioneers moved twenty kilometers south and founded the town of Yehud.  But they lived there temporarily.  With the help and financial support of Baron Edmond Rothschild, the settlers drained the swamp and moved to their chosen land in 1883.  After that, Jews of the First and Second Aliyah (waves of emigration) joined them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Petak Tikhva city" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1962756.jpg" width="535"></div>

For a long time he was called Em A-Moshavot, which means "Mother of the settlements."  After all, it was almost the first Jewish village in Ottoman Palestine.  And the pioneers who founded it went through many trials.  It was not only malaria, but also the extremely meager crops that the first farmers who had no experience in growing crops in the local climate collected.  But it was not for nothing that the pioneers kept in their hearts the true name of their settlement - the Gate of Hope.  The belief that they will succeed, led them forward.  Gradually, farmers gained the necessary agricultural experience, the swamps were drained, and the era described in Hosea's prophecy began.  But the prosperity of the inhabitants of Em HaMoshavot attracted gangs of Arab origin.  And the townspeople learned to repel the attacks of the robbers.  In Petah Tikva, by the way, the very first self-defense detachment was organized.  The transformation of the settlement into a city took place gradually.  First, Rothschild transferred control to the Colonization Society of Jews (1900).  And the status of the city of Gates of Hope received in 1939. </p>

    <h2>  Modern Petah Tikva </h2><p>  Photos of this beautiful city convince everyone that in front of it is a developed urban center.  And every year it makes changes to the modern look of the village, which has grown rapidly since the last decade of the XIX century.  So, in 1890 there were 465 inhabitants, at the beginning of the 20th century - already 819. The population increased mainly due to the influx of new repatriates.  Aliya‚Äôs wave was especially large in the 90s of the last century, when, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, tens of thousands of people came here to settle.  <span>This radically</span> changed the character of the city.  If earlier his industry was focused on the processing of agricultural raw materials, then textile, chemical and metallurgical enterprises appeared.  The construction boom of the turn of the millennium changed Petah Tikva.  The city today boasts beautiful modern skyscrapers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Knowing the history of this settlement, one should not look for antique or medieval antiquities there.  But still the city also boasts attractions.  Firstly, it is Jabotinsky street.  It is listed in the Guinness Book, as it stretches through four cities: Petah Tikva, Bnei Brak, Ramat Gann and Tel Aviv.  The second attraction is a huge cable-stayed bridge, which in 2006 was built by the famous Spanish architect <span>Santiago Calatrava.</span>  Thirty-one strings support this modern Y-shaped design. It seems to float in midair.  The Calatrava Bridge immediately became the ‚Äúcalling card‚Äù of the city.  There is also a small zoo in Petah Tikva.  It contains a rather interesting collection of birds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is Petah Tikva" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1962766.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is Petah Tikva </h2><p>  The city is located ten kilometers from Tel Aviv.  Despite the fact that Petah Tikva has its own mayor, it is considered the northeastern outskirts of Tel Aviv.  But the proximity to the capital simplifies the path to the Gate of Hope.  You just need to follow the huge and long Jabotinsky street.  The roadway is excellent and the city can be reached in minutes.  Buses follow strict Jabotinsky street.  All this, plus the relatively cheap housing in Petah Tikva make it the place of residence of the Tel Aviv workforce. </p>
