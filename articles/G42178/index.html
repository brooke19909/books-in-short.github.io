And he began his story with a small aul with a strange by ear name Hadyji. </p><h2>  In outline </h2><p>  Despite this, as old-timers say, the city has always been vibrant and fun, vibrant and flourishing. </p><p>  The big Adyghe aul of Khatukaev’s Khydyzhy (Khadyzhi) in 1864 was renamed the village of Khadyzhenskaya.  Kuban Cossacks lived here, who came from the ruined steppe villages and villages, migrants from the Don, Urals and Ukraine.  At the very beginning of the last century, mineral healing springs and oil deposits were discovered near the village.  Mining and processing of "black gold" began to develop especially rapidly.  This has led to an active population growth.  And by the beginning of 1950, by decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the RSFSR, the village was given the status of an urban settlement. </p>

A forest in the foothills is tall beech trees.  There is no undergrowth, but only dry leaves and branches, half-rotten trees littered with winds.  The beech forest (huge trunks and branches woven at the top) is silence that makes its way to dread, dampness and twilight. </p><p>  The southern slopes of the mountains are centuries-old pears, apple trees, chestnuts and wild grapes.

Instead of the expected oil from a well with a depth of more than 500 m, a source of mineral water clogged.  From this period, Khadyzhensk became known as a balneological hospital.  Water turned out to have a uniquely large percentage of iodine - more than 0.400 g / l and bromine - 0.087 g / l.  Alkaline sodium chloride water with a natural addition of iodine and bromine is used for drinking treatment. </p>
