The scientist was the first to explain the <span>structural</span> features of <span>substances.</span>  He studied in detail the nature of the interactions of atoms. </p><h2>  Theory Background </h2><p>  Alexander Butlerov became the founder of the new theory just when many questions had accumulated in science that scientists could not find answers to.  For example, explanations required valency and isomerism.  In addition, chemists continued to argue about how to write chemical formulas correctly.  Butlerov clarified this issue.  He proved that formulas should reflect the structure of matter. </p><p>  In addition, there were several concepts that were contrary to the views expressed by Butlerov.  It was a theory of radicals.  Its founder was Jens Berzelius.  He argued that in molecules there are special elements - radicals that pass from one substance to another.  There was also type theory.  Its supporters believed that all complex substances are derivatives of simple inorganic substances - water, hydrogen, ammonia, etc. All these concepts contradicted each other.  Science needed a theory that put everything in its place. </p>

    <h2>  New ideas Butlerova </h2><p>  Alexander Mikhailovich Butlerov (1828‚Äì1886) was one of the prominent chemists of his time.  He was much engaged in theoretical issues of his science.  In 1858, the scientist spoke at one of the meetings of the Paris Chemical Society.  Then, for the first time, the main points of Butlerov's theory sounded from his lips. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The researcher used new terms in his report, which later became entrenched in international science.  For example, it was he who became the author of the concept of the structure of compounds.  The scientist believed that the structure of different substances allows us to attribute them to one group (in particular, it is methane, chloroform, methyl alcohol, etc.). </p><h2>  Synthesis Study </h2><p>  In 1861, in a published report "On the chemical structure of matter", the main provisions of the theory of the chemical structure of A. M. Butlerov were formulated.  The scientist described in detail the methods of synthesis and use of various reactions.  One of the most important points of a chemist was his statement that one formula corresponds to each chemical substance.  Its importance lies in the fact that it characterizes all the properties and shows the connection of atoms inside the molecules. </p><p>  Butlerov‚Äôs theory also provided that controlled substances could produce new substances.  In subsequent years, the famous chemist and his students conducted many experiments to prove this assumption.  They were able to synthesize new substances such as <span>pentane isomers,</span> isobutylene and some alcohols.  For their era, these discoveries had enormous significance, which can only be compared with the importance of determining other elements by the Mendeleev (for example, ecabor). </p>

    <h2>  Systematization of chemistry </h2><p>  In the XIX century, the main provisions of Butlerov‚Äôs theory completely changed the scientists‚Äôs view of the <span>structure of chemical</span> elements.  In particular, the researcher was the first to suggest that molecules are not a chaotic cluster of atoms.  On the contrary, they have an ordered structure.  Atoms are connected to each other in a certain sequence, on which the nature of the whole substance also depends. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Butlerov, developing his theory, relied on mathematical principles and laws.  Using this science, he was able to explain most of the processes and relationships in chemicals.  For contemporaries, it was a real revolution.  The fact was that even if scientists knew some facts about the nature of certain substances, they could not build their knowledge into a clear, systematic picture.  The main provisions of the theory of Butlerov's structure solved this problem.  Now chemistry was not a disparate piggy bank of facts, but a harmonious system, where everything was subject to strict mathematical logic. </p>

    <h2>  Variety of substances </h2><p>  Butlerov‚Äôs famous theory pays much attention to isomerism ‚Äî the phenomenon of the existence of isomers ‚Äî equal in molecular weight and atomic composition of substances, which at the same time differ in atomic arrangement and structure.  This feature explains the variety of properties of substances in nature. </p><p>  Butlerov proved his theory by the example of butane.  According to the scientist‚Äôs idea, two kinds of this substance should have existed in nature.  However, at that time, science knew only one butane.  Butlerov conducted many experiments and still received a new substance, similar in composition, but excellent in properties.  It was called isobutane. </p>

    <h2>  The influence of atoms on each other </h2><p>  Butlerov discovered another important pattern.  With the formation of chemical bonds, the process of transition of electrons from one atom to another begins.  At the same time, their density changes.  Electronic pairs appear that affect the property of the newly formed substance.  The scientist studied this phenomenon using the example of hydrogen chloride, where chlorine changes the electron density of hydrogen bonds. </p><p>  Butlerov and the main provisions of the theory of structure were able to explain the nature of the transformation of substances.  In the future, the principle discovered by the <span>Russian chemist</span> was studied in detail by his followers and students.  Awareness of the mechanism of change of substances allowed scientists to understand how to synthesize new elements.  A special surge of these discoveries began at the end of the XIX century.  Then European and American scientists in the new laboratories using the methods proposed by Butlerov, were able to produce new substances. </p>

    <h2>  Chemical bonds </h2><p>  Butlerov believed that the structure of substances can be studied by chemical methods.  This position was confirmed thanks to many successful experiments of the scientist.  The researcher was also a supporter of the idea that formulas can be correct only if they begin to reflect the order of chemical bonds of different atoms.  Butlerov has been analyzing this assumption for many years. </p><p>  He distinguished three types of connections - simple, double and triple.  The scientist was right, but the further development of science showed that there are other chemical bonds.  In particular, now experts can characterize them also with the help of physical parameters. </p>

    <h2>  The development of the Butlerov theory </h2><p>  The new theory of the structure of chemical compounds by A. M. Butlerov was materialistic in nature.  The scientist was the first to boldly declare that researchers can study the properties of atoms, from which all elements are built.  Moreover, Butlerov himself regarded his theory as temporary.  He believed that his successors should develop it, since she did not fully explain some facts of chemical science. </p><p>  The scientist was right.  Butlerov‚Äôs theory further developed in two directions.  The first was that science was able to determine not only the order of the compound, but also the spatial arrangement of atoms in the molecule.  So stereochemistry arose.  This discipline began to study in detail the <span>spatial structure of molecules.</span>  Butlerov himself spoke of this new direction, although during his lifetime he did not manage to study this theoretical question. </p><p>  The second direction in the development of the theory of the scientist was the emergence of a doctrine on the electronic structure of atoms.  This is not only chemical, but also physical discipline.  The essence of the mutual influence of atoms was investigated in more detail and the reasons for the manifestation of various properties were explained.  It was the main points of Butlerov‚Äôs theory that allowed scientists to achieve such successes. </p>
