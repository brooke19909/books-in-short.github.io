So much blood is mixed here that you can meet a black man with a blond head of hair or a blue-eyed mulatto at every step.

    <p>  The <span>population of Brazil is</span> gradually growing.  But the <span>population density is</span> relatively low, about 17 people per 1 m¬≤.  However, the country is in the top five in terms of population, giving precedence to China, India, the United States and Indonesia.  Thus, low density is explained by the area occupied by the state.  The fact is that the <span>area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBrazil</span> is 5 times larger than the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe same India. </p><h2>  Some statistics </h2><p>  According to 2008 data, almost 192 million people live in Brazil.  In 2011, several other data were announced.  Then the figure exceeded 203 million. But these data were obtained from the CIA, and not as a result of the census.  The population of Brazil for 2014 is more than 202 million people.  As you can see, in comparison with the 2011 data, the indicators decreased slightly.  In 2016, the figure continued to grow.  According to preliminary estimates, it has already exceeded 206 million people.  It can be argued that in this hospitable country lives almost half of the entire population of the South American continent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  If in the 17th century the population of Brazil increased due to relocation from Europe and Africa, now this process is happening due to the high birth rate. </p><h2>  Age structure </h2><p>  The last few years, the country's age structure is surprisingly stable.  For comparison, we present data for 2010, 2012 and 2014. </p><p>  So, in 2010, the population of Brazil consisted of: </p><ul><li>  26.2% of children under the age of 14; </li><li>  67% of people aged 15 to 64 years; </li><li>  6.7% of the population is over 65 years old. </li></ul><p>  The average age of the population was 29.3 years </p><p>  In 2012, the age structure was as follows: </p><ul><li>  24.2% of the population were children under the age of 14; </li><li>  68.5% of people from 15 to 64 years old; </li><li>  7.3% of adults over 65. </li></ul><p>  The average age is 29.6 years. </p>

    <p>  Next, we will consider what Brazil‚Äôs society structure had in 2 years (2014 population).  The presented numbers look like this: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  23.8 children under 14 years old; </li><li>  68.5% of the population were people aged 15 to 64 years; </li><li>  7.4% of Brazilian society was over 65 years old. </li></ul><p>  For 2014, the average age is 30.8 years.  That is, the <span>average age</span> for the reviewed years does not differ much.  In general, young people predominate in the country. </p><h2>  Life span </h2><p>  And here Brazil has nothing to brag about.  The society is mostly young, not only due to the high birth rate, but also because of its low life expectancy.  On average, Brazilians live about 68 years.  As a rule, women live longer than men.  The difference for this country is 8 years. </p>

    <h2>  Ethnic composition of the country </h2><p>  As you already understood, the population of Brazil is quite large, and its ethnic composition is very diverse.  On the territory of the country there are representatives of more than one hundred peoples and nationalities.  Here you can meet people of all races and nationalities that exist on Earth. </p><p>  The native population of Brazil is South American Indians.  Their numbers are very small.  It is 0.45% of the total.  Asians from Japan, China and Vietnam in the country's population are 0.5%, black Brazilians - 6.2%.  And mulattoes make up - 38%.  Among the white-skinned population, the Portuguese prevail, they make up 20%.  This is followed by Italians (14%), Germans (6.6%), descendants of immigrants from Spain (8%), Arabs (5.3%). </p><p>  A characteristic feature of Brazilian society is that, despite their diverse composition, they are not divided into small ethnic groups, but position themselves as the people of Brazil. </p><p>  Multinational Brazil, whose population is becoming more and more, is formed of three main ethnic types: </p><ul><li>  mulattos, that is, children from mixed marriages between Europeans and Africans; </li><li>  mestizos - children of Europeans and Indians; </li><li>  sambo - children of Indians and Africans. </li></ul><p>  Due to the mixing of blood, dark-skinned couples often have white-skinned children, and vice versa.  Sometimes in one family 3-4 children are born with different skin colors and different phenotypes.  For Brazil, this is completely normal, and does not cause any doubts in kinship. </p><h2>  Education and Employment </h2><p>  Many people think that people here are just doing samba dance, because this is Brazil.  The number of people who have received a decent education in this country, however, is quite high.  There are almost 89% of educated women and men.  This is by no means small, but there is still something to strive for. </p><p>  The unemployment rate among the <span>working population</span> ranges from 5.5 to 6%.  More than 95 million citizens work in the service and trade sectors.  Given the population of Brazil, this is 66%.  Industry provides jobs for only 14% of Brazilians, while 20% are employed in agriculture. </p><p>  Brazilians are sentimental, emotional and responsive.  They managed to keep <span>warmth</span> and know how to sincerely smile.  Brazilians are generally friendly towards guests of their country, but they do not allow indulgence and disrespect for themselves.  In some areas, tourists have to watch things very carefully, but such places exist even in the most prosperous countries. </p>
