With it, you can make the speakers work much more productively.  For all who are not indifferent to the high-quality sound, the selection of amplifiers should be taken very responsibly.  An equally important system that generates high-quality sound is the car amplifier for the subwoofer.  There are various types of these devices.  You can also assemble the amplifier yourself.  Let's find out how to choose a device so that it really pleases the ear. </p><h2>  Why an amplifier, because there is a radio? </h2><p>  Most car radio systems already have a built <span>-</span> in <span>multi</span> - <span>channel amplifier.</span>  And for many drivers, this system is completely suitable.  Some of them do not change the regular sound in a car for years.  But there are those who like the music in the car to sound quality and loud.  In this case, you can‚Äôt do without an amplifier.  A car subwoofer without an amplifier will not produce the desired effect.  Such equipment can improve the acoustics, regardless of the quality of the head unit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car amplifier circuit for subwoofer" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1975539.jpg" width="600"></div>  A distinguishing feature of an external amplifier is the absence of strict tuning restrictions.  Favorite music tracks will always sound good - at minimum volume levels and even at the highest.

With it, you can increase not only the power of sound, but also its quality. </p><p>  Very often, car audio is acquired after the installation of the <span>head unit.</span>  If the selected speakers, as well as the subwoofer, are of high quality, then they will need more energy at the peak of performance.  A standard radio cannot provide this.  Therefore, they purchase a separate car amplifier for the subwoofer.  This solution gives a good result. </p><h2>  Types of Acoustic Amplifiers </h2><p>  There are several types of this equipment.  So, mono amplifiers, or monoblocks, are intended only for low-frequency sounds.  Two-channel solutions can also be distinguished.  They are used in the absence of rear speakers, when there is only the front.  Three-channel amplifiers allow you to connect also a subwoofer.  Well, the most expensive solutions are four-channel.  These models allow you to amplify the sound throughout the acoustics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wiring diagram for car amplifier and subwoofer" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1975536.jpg" width="600"></div>  A subwoofer is the most sophisticated speaker for artificial amplification.  Therefore, professionals recommend choosing a monoblock as a car amplifier for a subwoofer.  These types of devices can work with a variety of resistances.  The design has a tone block for special settings and filters.  The latter help loud bass sound at full power.

Amplifiers quickly overheat when the subwoofer reaches full power. </p><h2>  Monoblock differences from the amplifier </h2><p>  Monoblock technically - the same device as multi-channel devices.  However, single-channel models have certain characteristics that are not available for analogues.  What does it mean?  Monoblock has only one channel and is designed to enhance low-frequency bass.  The load for which these devices are designed most often has a resistance of 1 ohm.  If you comply with this condition, you can get high power at the output.  In this case, the load on the on-board network will be minimal.  For resistances of 2 ohms and 4 ohms, it makes no sense to buy a candy bar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect a car subwoofer to an amplifier" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1975540.jpg" width="375"></div>  According to the classification of electric amplifiers, modern monoblocks have a class ‚ÄúD‚Äù.  They are very powerful, but the sound quality is very low.  Quality for the subwoofer is a secondary characteristic.  There are also amplifiers of another class - "AB".  These are average indicators.  There are other classes.

    <h2>  How to choose an amplifier for a subwoofer in power? </h2><p>  If, to enhance sound, all attention is paid to sound quality, then in the case of subwoofers, the main characteristic is power.  It can be of two different types.  This is the maximum possible (or PMPO) and nominal.  The inscription "PMPO mono" is seen on the case.  This parameter indicates the total power for all channels, inclusive.  You should not focus on PMPO - the numbers serve only to make devices better buy.  In practice, this figure does not matter.  Another type of power is nominal.  It is recorded in the technical passport.  Reviews say that this characteristic should be guided by the choice.  This parameter should be indicated with a SOI of less than 0.1 percent and a voltage of 14.4 volts. </p>

This is an erroneous opinion - weak devices will lead to coil failure.  It is necessary to select an amplifier whose power corresponded to the subwoofer.  But there is a small catch - the rated power is considered at a voltage of 14.4 volts.  This voltage will never be held at the output of the amplifier.  This can lead to overheating of the coil.  Reviews say that the right amplifier is the one whose power is higher than that of the subwoofer.  This is the best option.  The risk is only in mechanical damage to the coil.

    <h2>  Other characteristics </h2><p>  Reviews say that, in addition to power, it is worth paying attention to the frequency range.  The parsing should not be too big.  Serious manufacturers make values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom 15 to 350 hertz.  The amplifier class can be ‚ÄúAB‚Äù or ‚ÄúD‚Äù.  The first are analog amplifiers with good sound, but low efficiency and low power.  The second - powerful, with high performance.  But judging by the reviews, such devices have poor sound quality. </p><p>  Another criterion is the number of channels.  Monoblocks are very expensive and rare.  They can only be seen in professional audio systems.  The class of such monoblocks is ‚ÄúD‚Äù.  Two-channel models are suitable for a subwoofer, designed for resistance of 4-8 ohms.  The connection diagram of the car amplifier and subwoofer in this case is of the ‚ÄúBridge‚Äù type. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY car subwoofer amplifier" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1975538.jpg" width="600"></div>  Three-channel models are not found.  Four-channel analogs completely replaced them.

    <h2>  Do-it-yourself amplifier for a car </h2><p>  To build a system, you will need an output power amplifier, as well as a voltage converter.  You can do them yourself, but it takes a very long time.  You can simply purchase ready-made items in the store.  Then you can go directly to the manufacture of an amplifier for a car subwoofer with your own hands. </p><p>  The device needs two channels, and the amplifier is a single channel.  How is this fixed?  This is corrected by connecting the two channels of the radio using an adder.  Then the sound signal will be filtered out - frequencies that go beyond the range of 16 to 300 hertz will disappear from it.  Next, the signal goes to the filter.  The latter removes frequencies from 35 to 150 Hertz. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car subwoofer without amplifier" class="if" height="187" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1975537.jpg" width="600"></div>  When the engine is idling, according to the scheme of the car amplifier for the subwoofer, it is supposed to consume 1.5 amperes.  To prevent the battery from discharging, install a relay with a separate REM terminal and a voltage of 12 volts, as well as a current above 20 amperes.  This REM is connected to the radio output + 12 volts.  The subwoofer will turn on with the head unit.

    <h2>  Connecting an amplifier at home </h2><p>  Often it turns out that there is a subwoofer with an amplifier, and it is impossible to operate them in the car.  There is a way out - to put the equipment home.  How to connect a car subwoofer with an amplifier at home?  The amplifier has connectors for the input signal and output for connecting the speaker system and subwoofer.  They are connected by "tulips."  They are shown in the photo below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car amplifier for subwoofer" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1975535.jpg" width="600"></div>  The amplifier is powered by a computer power supply.  It is better to connect the subwoofer according to the principle of "Bridge" (just like a car).

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  So, we figured out how to connect a car subwoofer to an amplifier.  The type of connection depends on the number of amplifier channels.  Often, installation is performed according to the bridge scheme, which is indicated in the photo in the article.  In the case of a <span>two-channel amplifier, a</span> subwoofer is connected to both channels.  Installing a capacitor is optional. </p>
