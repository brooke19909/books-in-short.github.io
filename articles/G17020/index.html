The boy‚Äôs father and mother lived together very little, only a year after the birth of their son.  There was no official divorce, and the ex-wife of the singer Marianne continued to bear his last name. </p><p>  Father and son actively communicated even after the divorce, even while the ex-wife had an affair with a famous rock musician of the time under the pseudonym Ricochet.  Regular parties with alcohol, loud heavy music and drunken guests who were constantly in the apartment left an imprint on the formation of Alexander's personality.  In addition, the death of the pope was a shock for a five-year-old child.  To date, he has decided to change the surname inherited from the legendary Viktor Tsoi.  The son of a rock star became Alexander Molchanov. </p>

    <h2>  Biography of Alexander Tsoi (Molchanov): childhood and youth </h2><p>  The child began to compose poetry at the age of five.  <span>Alexander</span> did not graduate from <span>high school</span> , deciding instead to go to the capital.  There he began studying English, computer programming, in which he achieved great success.  Even at this time he was engaged in web design.  In addition, Alexander (the son of Viktor Tsoi) worked on television, where he was personally invited by the head of Channel One for six months.  After that, he returned to St. Petersburg and worked as a system administrator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Alexander‚Äôs mother was always categorically against the boy following in the footsteps of his father, and in every possible way protected him from the press and fans of Viktor Tsoi.  Even dying of cancer, in the last minutes of her life, she asked her son to avoid publicity, explaining that she does not bring anything good.  Given that Alexander is practically unknown to the general public, he followed the advice of his mother.  Many do not even know that the rock singer had a child.  At the time of his mother's death, he was 20 years old.  So there was one son of Viktor Tsoi.  His biography is sad only because his parents left him early. </p><h2>  Confident steps </h2><p>  However, despite the closed way of life, the creative vein was still observed in the boy from childhood.  At a certain stage in his life, he began to make music himself and played the guitar in the group Para bellvm.  But the son of the great rock musician did not achieve much success in this field. </p>

    <p>  Today, he owns the da: da: club, and also continues to engage in creativity: composing lyrics and music for songs.  In addition, he owns half of the rights to the creative heritage of Viktor Tsoi and the Kino group.  Five years ago, he made a deal with businessman Oleg Tinkov, as a result of which the latter received the rights to the song "We will continue to act."  Alexander Tsoi (son of <span>Viktor Tsoi),</span> whose <span>biography</span> was not the easiest, managed to receive income from his father's talent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The film "Choi -" Cinema "" </h2><p>  Almost the only public affair of Alexander was participation in the filming and editing of the film "Choi -" Cinema "", which was commissioned by Channel One.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe painting belonged to <span>Natalia Razlogova,</span> she is known in the press as the last love of Viktor Tsoi.  Without Alexander, the film would be incomplete.  Some shots were shot in his club, then he went for three weeks to Moscow. </p><p>  In addition, it was the son of the great rocker who was the art director of the picture and managed the creation of graphics.  At the same time, he participated in recording music for the film, which was based on the songs of the group.  In the last days before the release of the film, Alexander (the son of Viktor Tsoi) took an active part in editing and staging the final version of the film.  Thus, we can say that he made a tangible contribution to the picture, which was created in memory of his father. </p><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  Given the closed life style of Alexander, few can boast of knowing the details of his personal life.  It is known that since the end of 2010 he was officially married to Elena Osokina.  The couple has no children and does not talk about their relationship. </p><p>  Alexander doesn‚Äôt remember Viktor Tsoi.  The son of a famous rock singer does not know what kind of relationship connected his parents.  Perhaps that is why he is closed and trying to protect himself and his soulmate from the camera lenses. </p>

    <h2>  Strange hobbies </h2><p>  Recently, Alexander began to show masochistic inclinations: he likes to get a thrill, being suspended from the ceiling.  Such strange hobbies began to appear in him after marriage.  This gave occasion to friends and relatives of Alexander to blame Elena in such a strange "hobby" of his friend.  At the same time, they argue that before meeting his future wife, he did not show such inclinations in any way, being an absolutely adequate young man, fluent in computer and English. </p>

    <p>  Now he has almost completely changed his environment and spends all his time in the company of masochists, minimizing communication with former friends.  Nevertheless, his friends hope that this is a temporary hobby, and Alexander (the son of Viktor Tsoi) eventually abandons his unhealthy hobby and returns to normal life.  In the meantime, this guy is attracted by pain and suffering of a physical nature. </p>
