    <h2>  Parents </h2><p>  Natalya Pavlovna Paley was born in Paris in 1905.  The fact is that the girl‚Äôs parents were ‚Äúexiles‚Äù.  They were banned from entering Russia.  It all started with the fact that Natalie's father - Grand Duke Pavel Alexandrovich - was an early widower.  After some time, he fell in love with the charming, beautiful and smart Olga Pistolkors.  The girl came from the family of a not-so-rich and not wealthy Petersburg official.  She was also married.  For the Romanov family, this became a very scandalous story.  When Olga divorced, Pavel Alexandrovich secretly married her in Italy.  After this, the emperor stripped his son of all ranks.  Nevertheless, no one took his considerable fortune from the prince.  It allowed the couple to lead a carefree social life in Europe.  Their love story, as well as the charm and beauty of Olga constantly attracted public attention. </p>

    <h2>  Revolution </h2><p>  Paul received official forgiveness only ten years later.  Spouses with children came to Russia.  The prince was reinstated in the service and returned to him all ranks.  Olga Paley became the legal wife of Paul and received the princely title.  Everything seemed to be fine now, but a revolution was brewing in the country.  In 1917, the political system completely changed.  Now Princess Olga Paley and Prince Pavel were not very happy with the returned ranks and acquired titles.  Spouses lost absolutely everything.  In March, Pavel was arrested with his son Vladimir.  The Red Commissars did the same to them as they did to most members of the royal family ‚Äî they killed them.  Natalia‚Äôs father was shot in the Peter and Paul Fortress.  And the commissars threw living Vladimir into the mine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Olga Paley perfectly understood that the same fate awaits her with her daughters.  Therefore, in a hurry, she left Russia with Natalie and Irina.  Thanks to the condition that Paul prudently left in France, Olga and her daughters led a very comfortable life.  She taught Irina and Natalie manners, instilling in girls an impeccable taste. </p><h2>  In a new place </h2><p>  As it turned out, quite a few emigrants from Russia were in France.  And their living conditions were significantly worse than that of Olga Paley and her daughters.  Left the borders of their native country, once spoiled by luxury, ladies were looking for opportunities for their continued existence.  Countesses and princesses began to work as fashion models, dressmakers, embroiderers.  Russian beauty, complemented by the ability to present oneself, charm and aristocratic upbringing, brought huge revenue to local fashion houses. </p><p>  Natalya Paley and her sister Irina did not even plan to receive further education.  What was enough for them was what their mother gave them.  It was difficult for girls to adapt in a new country.  Some lurking sadness and concern was read on their faces.  Irina and Natalia were distinguished by isolation and did not seek to communicate with friends.  Of course, the reason for this was the tragic events that happened in Russia.  Memories of the loss of a beloved brother and father constantly haunted the sisters. </p>

    <p>  Olga Paley regularly talked with fashionable tailors of French houses.  The princess did this in order to renew ties in high secular society.  Many high-ranking exiles from Russia began to open fashion houses.  For example, Olga <span>'s half-sister</span> , Maria Pavlovna, founded Kitmir, specializing in embroidery.  Felix and <span>Irina Yusupov</span> opened the IRFE.  Soon Olga's half-brother, Prince Dmitry, became closely acquainted with fashion designer Coco Chanel.  The French emigrants already worked for the Frenchwoman.  Thus, the Paley family became more famous in the world of haute couture.  After some time, Irina married Fyodor Alexandrovich (brother of Yusupova). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Carier start </h2><p>  Princess Natalya Paley chose a different path.  From birth, independent, wayward, graceful and beautiful looking like a mother, the girl decided to become a model.  She began working immediately in two fashion houses - "IRFE" and "Iteb."  Soon Natalya conquered Paris and became Queen of France.  She was fascinated and admired, loved, imitated.  But all the same, the recognition was incomplete, because Paley acted in the homes of her compatriots-exiles.  After some time, Coco Chanel herself became interested in the fashion model.  On the recommendation of the famous Frenchwoman, Natalie managed to get into the prestigious fashion house of Lucien Lelong.  The latter simply could not resist the grace and exquisite beauty of the Russian princess.  In 1927, Paley and Lelong got married.  The girl became the face of his fashion house.  Relatives of Natalia were very unhappy.  They did not approve of this unequal marriage - the tailor and granddaughter of Emperor Alexander II. </p>

    <h2>  Fans </h2><p>  Lucien Lelong was completely dominated by the beauty of Paley.  He sewed the best models of clothes for her, and the model‚Äôs face did not leave the covers of popular magazines.  Natalie was dedicated to the perfume of the Lelong company - Indiskret, Mon Image, Elle ... Elle.  However, the gifted and bright Paley preferred that the same men be next to her.  Fans of the model were: Salvador Dali, Serge Lifar (dancer), Pavel Chelishchev (artist), Count de Beaumont and others.  For these men, a large part of whom was homosexual, the princess personified beauty - smart, passionless and bearing light.  Wherever Natalie was, she was surrounded by bright and interesting personalities.  And it is natural that the princess felt like a star, which everyone worshiped. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Jean Cocteau </h2><p>  In 1932, Lifar, hopelessly in love with a model, introduced her to this French director.  Between Cocteau and Paley immediately broke out a novel.  Jean was homosexual, and Natalie became the only woman in his life.  Cocteau was attracted to the fashion model by her strength of mind, perfect beauty, accuracy and sharpness of judgment, as well as the ability to understand.  The romance of lovers lasted several months and ended very tragically. </p><p>  According to the memoirs of Jean himself, Paley got pregnant from him, but was forced to have an abortion.  According to some reports, such a requirement was put forward by Marie-Lore de Noaille (patroness of Cocteau).  She was afraid that because of Natalie she would lose her power over Jean.  After this, the sensitive Cocteau parted with the princess and hated all the women.  His long-time lover Jean Marais wrote in his memoirs that the director could not stand even a casual touch.  Nevertheless, Cocteau kept the warmest memories of the fashion model.  In his film Orpheus, the merciful and beautiful Death has the features of Paley. </p>

    <h2>  Cinema </h2><p>  In 1933, director Marcel l'Erbier invited Natalia to his picture ‚ÄúHawk‚Äù.  The partner of the girl was <span>Charles Buyer.</span>  A year later, Paley starred in the movie "Prince Jean."  Both paintings were a success.  This is not to say that the model had acting talent - rather, it was about the ability to give oneself to the public.  And the role of Natalie can not be called particularly deep.  Paley played eccentric, elegant women who fell in love with men. </p><h2>  Relocation to the USA </h2><p>  The marriage with Lelong did not last long.  Paley lost interest in Lucien.  After the first successes in the cinema, the girl decided to focus on this activity.  Natalie's photogenicity and beauty, combined with Lelong's stunning outfits, immediately attracted everyone's attention.  And more importantly, Paley was spotted in Hollywood.  In 1937, the princess divorced Lucien and left for the United States.  Saddened by the fact of the breakup, Lelong invented a new <span>perfume fragrance</span> - Le N. Women of the 1930s and 1940s enthusiastically responded to them. </p>

    <h2>  Exupery </h2><p>  Soon Natalya Paley married the director and producer John Wilson.  Princess did not leave the modeling business.  She became the most successful and sought-after fashion model in the American company Lynchboycher.  Natalie also opened a salon, in which there were famous artists, musicians and actors.  Erich Remarck and <span>Marlene Dietrich</span> often visited Paley <span>.</span> </p><p>  In 1942, the heroine of this article met the famous writer Antoine de Saint-Exupery.  It is difficult to say how much this novel meant for Natalie, but for the Frenchman it was extremely important.  This is indicated by Antoine's love letters on Paley. </p><p>  By temperament, the writer was a melancholy writer and often fell into depression.  He needed regular comfort.  In the person of Natalie Antoine found not only a lover, but also a friend who knows how to support in difficult times.  But their romance was short-lived.  In 1943, Antoine returned to France.  He corresponded with the princess until his death. </p><h2>  Remark </h2><p>  Erich has a novel called Shadows in Paradise.  There he tells the love story of two main characters.  Those who know the biography of the writer can see a resemblance to his real life.  Having met Natalie, Remarque was immediately captivated by her mind and beauty.  For a long eleven years the princess kept him under her magical influence.  Her ability to charm, brilliant mind, smile, slim figure, delicate skin and bewitching gray eyes captivated the writer. </p>

    <p>  Remarque and Paley met in America.  During their eleven-year romance, there were frequent quarrels and passionate reconciliations.  At the same time, none of the writer's and fashion model‚Äôs entourage doubted that their love was genuine and sincere.  For the sake of the princess, Erich even broke up with the great Marlene Dietrich.  Remark met with the actress before meeting with the heroine of this article. </p><h2>  Return to America </h2><p>  In 1947, after several years of traveling, Erich decided to go home to Europe.  Natalya Paley was his company.  And here their romance came to an end.  Remarque remained in Switzerland, where he had his own home.  And the princess more and more often left him.  Natalie could not come to terms with a serene and quiet life.  Paley needed new friends, meetings, changes, bright and intense leisure.  Gradually, Erich's feelings faded.  And then the writer met a new love - Paulette Goddard.  Soon, the actress became his wife. </p>

    <p>  Immediately after the breakup, Paley returned to John Wilson in America.  By that time, the director was already drinking heavily and was distinguished by aggressive behavior.  Natalie just could not invite someone home.  So her life, filled with bright and turbulent events, faded over time.  The number of Princess's friends decreased every month. </p><h2>  Depression </h2><p>  In 1961, John Wilson died of cirrhosis.  Natalya Paley fell into a severe depression.  She no longer felt like a dazzling star.  The former fashion model was left completely alone.  A close circle suddenly turned away from her.  Even my sister no longer communicated with Natalie.  Why did this happen?  How?  Perhaps in a whirlwind of events, Paley simply did not notice the loss of loved ones.  All her life she was looking for bright personalities, forgetting that ordinary people only need emotional closeness.  Was she happy now?  It is likely that it was precisely these questions that the once successful and beautiful woman asked herself. </p>

    <h2>  Death </h2><p>  As a result, Natalia Paley, whose biography is presented above, realized the decline of her own career.  The star of the princess went out.  She was just an aging woman.  The next twenty years of her life, Natalia was in severe depression.  The former fashion model lived alone and did not communicate with anyone.  Paley drank a lot and was practically blinded.  In December 1981, she fell, breaking her thigh neck.  Doctors made a terrible diagnosis - immobility until the end of life.  Natalia was 76 years old, and she did not want to become a burden to anyone.  Taking a huge dose of sleeping pills, Paley voluntarily left this life. </p>
