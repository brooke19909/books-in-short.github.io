In fact, we will deal with some of the most profitable tariff plans.  Why?  Now we will deal with you in this matter.  In addition, it is worth knowing how you can connect it to your mobile.  True, the ‚ÄúAll Inclusive S‚Äù tariff has one feature - the so-called free minutes and other features.  So, you have to check the balance of these funds from time to time.  This will also be discussed today.  Let‚Äôs start with you to consider the tariff plan as soon as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="all inclusive s" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/875861.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  We call inside the home region </h2><p>  Of course, the first thing you should pay attention to is outgoing calls (or rather, their cost).  This is often what helps us to determine the tariff plan.  After all, no one wants to overpay. </p><p>  The tariff "Megaphone" "All inclusive S" is what any modern client who wants communication needs.  The thing is that you will receive 400 free minutes of conversation within the home region.  The promotion applies not only to Megafon subscribers, but also to all other mobile operators. </p><p>  In case of exceeding the limit, you will call our today's operator absolutely free of charge, and on others - 1 ruble per minute.  This is really a great deal.  But it is implemented for a reason.  The tariff "Megaphone" "All inclusive S" requires a monthly fee.  Only 290 rubles.  And for this amount you will get not only 400 minutes of free conversation.  Let's try to understand what else they can offer us such interesting and useful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  In Russia </h2><p>  Well, calling in Russia is also a rather important point when choosing a tariff plan.  Indeed, modern customers like to call up friends and relatives throughout the country and not only.  So we will have to figure out whether it is worth paying 290 rubles of a monthly fee for a tariff plan that will be used, for example, for talking in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="all inclusive rate" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/875862.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Of course, the answer is positive, because All Inclusive S is, as already mentioned, a real anti-crisis solution.  Why?  The thing is that the provided 400 free minutes apply to calls throughout the country.  That is, not only within your home region.  And it pleases. </p><p>  After the limit is exceeded, you will have to pay 3 rubles for calls to Megafon in Russia.  For other operators, as well as when making a call to a <span>landline number, you</span> will have to pay a lot more - 12.5 rubles.  However, this is not so much when compared with other offers of mobile operators.  Of course, ‚ÄúMegaphone‚Äù ‚ÄúAll Inclusive S‚Äù can be turned off at any time.  But is it worth it?  After all, the <span>monthly fee</span> implies a lot of quite interesting and important offers.  And now we will meet them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Calling around the world </h2><p>  If you have friends around the world with whom I would like to talk, then the tariff "Megaphone" "All inclusive S" is just what you need.  After all, you can talk to him for free with Russia for 400 minutes a month, and pay little money all over the world. </p><p>  So, for example, in the <span>Baltic countries</span> and the CIS, in Abkhazia and Georgia, in South Ossetia and Ukraine, you can call at 35 rubles per minute.  In Europe, calls will cost you a little more - 55 rubles.  And in all other countries - 75 each. Satellite communications require 313 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff megaphone all inclusive s" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/875863.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  In fact, the All Inclusive S (Volga region or any other region) is exactly what will help save on calls.  It seems that 75 rubles for calls to most countries is very expensive.  Only it is worth comparing Megafon with other mobile operators to understand that this is not so.  After all, they require for this type of call from 100 rubles.  Probably not worth talking about the benefits.  Only here the advantages of our tariff plan do not end there.  What else do we get by paying a fairly small monthly fee?  Let's move on and think about it. </p><h2>  Messages </h2><p>  In truth, it is now quite difficult to imagine a modern person who does not use SMS and MMS.  Probably every client writes them at least once a day.  After all, messages are a great and convenient way to quickly convey short information to another subscriber.  Especially if neither you nor the other person has the time or opportunity to talk.  A kind of great replacement for calls. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The tariff "All inclusive S" allows us to write SMS messages for free.  True, within your home region and only a limited number.  Which one?  400 posts per month.  In fact, this is quite enough for a modern client. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="all-inclusive megaphone s disable" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/875864.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  But outside the region (throughout Russia and on Megafon), one ‚Äúletter‚Äù will cost you 1.5 rubles.  In principle, this is a very normal price.  So to say, the average cost of outgoing messages from all mobile operators.  For the rest of the companies providing mobile services, we will have to pay 3 rubles for a "letter".  So, this is quite normal billing.  400 messages per month is more than enough for a modern client. </p><p>  But with MMS, things are a little simpler.  The thing is that they cost 7 rubles.  No matter where you send them.  Pretty good offer.  After all, the same Beeline asks for MMS from 10 to 15 rubles.  But here we should not end our conversation.  After all, we have not yet figured out the mobile Internet, and also have not talked about how you can connect your "All Inclusive S" tariff plan.  How to disable it, we will figure it out too. </p><h2>  Mobile Internet </h2><p>  Now everyone is using the Internet.  After all, it is he who helps us to stay in touch and deal with some business issues.  So, it is important when choosing a tariff plan to pay to this item. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúAll Inclusive S‚Äù tariff gives us 3 GB of free Internet (both 3G and 4G) for 290 rubles per month, and all this at a tremendous speed.  After you exhaust this volume, the speed will drop a little.  But then you can download all the data absolutely free.  A kind of unlimited Internet for 290 rubles per month.  We are talking, of course, about the monthly fee for the entire tariff plan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="all inclusive s how to disable" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/875865.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In fact, mobile Internet is another of the strengths of our tariff.  Indeed, now customers are looking for exactly "unlimited".  In addition, the 4G network from Megafon has excellent quality, which other mobile operators do not have.  It is enough to connect this tariff to yourself to understand how profitable it really is.  And that is exactly what we are now going to do with you. </p><h2>  Connect </h2><p>  If you decide to connect an All Inclusive S tariff plan, then you have several alternative solutions to this issue.  Let's start with the most understandable and radical method. </p><p>  The first thing that can only help us realize the idea is to buy a new SIM card in a mobile office with an already connected tariff plan.  To do this, you need a passport.  Buy, issue a number, activate it - and all problems are resolved. </p><p>  If you are a Megafon subscriber, then you can easily change the tariff on your previous phone number.  To do this, send an SMS message with any text to 0500933. The cost of the transition is 290 rubles.  More precisely, this is a monthly fee, which is immediately charged to you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="all inclusive s megaphone balance" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/875866.jpg" width="500"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  You can also use the Internet.  Go to the official page "Megaphone", and then go through authorization in your personal account.  Then select "Rates".  There, find "All Inclusive S" and click on "Connect."  In the case when you have enough money on your mobile phone, you can receive a notification about the successful transition to a new tariff plan. </p><p>  Disabled "All Inclusive S" by changing the tariff using any method convenient for you.  For example, you can come with a passport and a mobile phone to the operator‚Äôs office in your city, choose a different tariff plan and inform that you would like to connect it. </p><h2>  What do they say? </h2><p>  What do customers say about our current tariff?  The thing is that here the opinions are a bit mixed. </p><p>  The first thing you pay attention to is that in "All Inclusive S" ("Megaphone") you have to constantly check the rest of the minutes and Internet traffic.  To do this, just dial * 558 #, and then wait for the message.  This item forces customers to do this action all the time.  And they don‚Äôt really like it. </p><p>  But everything else is quite positive.  After all, mobile communications, as well as SMS and MMS messages (along with the Internet) are provided to us on the most favorable terms.  As the subscribers say, you can save a lot of money.  290 rubles is not such a big monthly fee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="all inclusive s volga" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/875867.jpg" width="600"></div>

As you can see, this plan is perfect for those who are used to constantly communicate. </p><p>  If in doubt about whether you really need this tariff, you can buy yourself a new SIM card for a month with it.
