    <h2>  Location, rooms and staff </h2><p>  Many of our compatriots respond positively to the housing fund Marmaris Park HV-1.  So, despite the fact that the hotel is not new, it is noticeable that repairs are carried out regularly.  The rooms are very cozy and comfortable.  Furniture and appliances are not new, but all in good condition.  Nothing creaks, everything works.  If something fails, then after contacting the reception all problems will be quickly eliminated.  Experienced travelers recommend choosing bungalow rooms if possible.  This will give you the opportunity to stay in cute small buildings surrounded by pine trees.  The distance to the main building, restaurant and pool will be no more than 200 meters.  However, in the bungalow you can relax in peace and quiet, and you will not be disturbed by the noise from the bar, restaurant, pool or amphitheater.  If you come to Marmaris, including to visit discos, you can safely settle in the main hotel building. </p><p>  As for the location of Marmaris Park, most tourists respond positively to it.  So, our compatriots were delighted with the small, but very picturesque territory of the hotel with many tall pines, which not only give the natural shade, so necessary during the summer heat, but also fill the air with magnificent coniferous aroma.  Also, travelers note a beautiful view of the sea and mountains, which opens from some of the rooms, as well as from the restaurant, from the terrace and from the hotel pool.  A big plus of Marmaris Park is its proximity to the nearest settlements - Icmeler and Marmaris.  The first of them can be reached in leisurely steps in 10 minutes.  You can also get to Marmaris either by taxi or minibus (the journey will take no more than 10 minutes), or walk by taking a pleasant walk along the beautiful promenade.  In these settlements at your service there is a developed tourist infrastructure and a lot of entertainment for every taste. </p><p>  For the most part, the positive reviews of travelers concern the staff of the hotel in question.  So, tourists were mostly satisfied with the quality of room cleaning, regular change of linen and towels, attentive attitude and friendliness of all employees without exception.  Despite the fact that a large percentage of Marmaris Park guests are made up of Europeans (most often Germans, Belgians and English), many workers here speak Russian. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  Unlike most other hotels in Turkey and other countries, the opinion of travelers was unanimous regarding the quality of food in Marmaris Park 5 *.  So, many tourists found the menu in this hotel more than varied, and the food is very tasty.  According to our compatriots, they were offered here dishes from both seafood and meat, a large selection of fresh fruits and salads, as well as a variety of desserts, pastries and sweets.  In addition, during the day you could always have a snack in the snack bar on the beach with pizza, french fries and flat cakes.  The choice of drinks in the hotel bars also delighted guests.  In a word, according to our compatriots, it is impossible to remain hungry at the Marmaris Park Hotel.  Moreover, many returned home from their vacation with extra pounds, as it is simply impossible to resist such a varied and mouth-watering menu. </p>

    <h2>  Guest opinion about the beach and Marmaris Park entertainment </h2><p>  I liked the tourists and the hotel‚Äôs own beach.  It is located just a few tens of meters from the main building and is a concrete platform, from which it is very convenient to descend into the water along the ladders.  Due to the lack of sand, the water here is very clean.  In addition, Marmaris Park guests have a pier and a floating platform from which to dive.  On the hotel beach you will find a lot of comfortable sun loungers and parasols.  If you suddenly want to sunbathe on the sand, you can walk along the promenade a few hundred meters to the nearest sandy beach. </p><p>  However, water activities at Marmaris Park HV-1 are by no means limited to beach vacations.  So, the hotel also has a large outdoor pool with a children's section.  Near the pool there is a large sun terrace with a magnificent view of the azure waters of the sea.  There is also a bar where you can enjoy your favorite drinks and cocktails, skillfully prepared by a professional bartender.  In the daytime, animators work in the pool, inviting guests to take part in fun games and contests.  In the evenings, the amphitheater of the hotel hosts entertainment events and shows, after which a fun disco begins.  In addition, those who wish, accompanied by hotel animators, can go to Marmaris night clubs. </p>
