  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY crafts from garbage bags: rug and Christmas tree</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What people just don't think of!  For example, the last original and quickly became a popular trend was the implementation of various crafts from garbage bags with their own hands.  The needlewomen offer to put into business what we usually throw away.  And I must admit, this venture does not seem so absurd when you look through a few finished works. </p><p>  If you are also interested in unusual trends, then you've come to the right place!  Indeed, in the article we will talk in detail about how to make a rug and a Christmas tree from unnecessary packages. </p><h2>  A few words about the material used </h2><p>  First of all, it is important to note that the instructions in the various master classes describe the features of working with the waste product.  But it‚Äôs important to consider that to create <span>crafts from garbage bags</span> with your own hands, you should take only clean bags.  But regarding the density, color and other nuances, there are no recommendations.  However, experienced craftswomen are still advised to choose the same thickness material.  Many even offer to specifically purchase in the store packaging for garbage bags. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tr.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from packages" class="if uuid-3069804" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3069804.jpg"></div><p>  For most people who do not understand the principle of work, such an action may seem wasteful, but in fact, a conceived product will cost much less than a similar purchased one.  At the same time, it will look not only beautiful, but also original.  And if you come up with a design yourself, it‚Äôs also unique. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, it is important to note that due to the growing popularity, respectively, and the demand for handicrafts from garbage bags, it is not only interesting, but also profitable to carry them out with your own hands.  If you wish, you can find many sites where you can profitably sell your work. </p><h2>  Preparation of necessary materials and tools </h2><p>  So that in the process of creativity there are no problems, it is important to properly prepare.  But what is meant by this? </p><p>  In fact, nothing supernatural.  It is only necessary to lay out on the desktop: </p><ul><li>  a ruler; </li><li>  stationery knife; </li><li>  washed, dried (if necessary) and carefully selected bags; </li><li>  hook (tools No. 6, 7, 9 are ideal); </li><li>  sewing threads; </li><li>  a suitable size needle; </li><li>  a paper cone (you can do it yourself) the size of a conceived Christmas tree. </li></ul><h2>  Bag slicing </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lenny-face.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from packages master class" class="if uuid-3069806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3069806.jpg"></div><p>  This part of the description is very important because, as a matter of fact, it sets the ‚Äúpace" for all further actions.  At the same time, it doesn‚Äôt matter at all what kind of crafts you plan to do with your own garbage packages; you won‚Äôt be able to skip this step.  Therefore, read carefully! </p><p>  So, the essence of the upcoming work lies in the following manipulations: </p><ol><li>  Select bags by density and color, put them in even stacks. </li><li>  Then take a ruler and lay across. </li><li>  Move away from the edge of the desired distance.  It can be determined independently, but it is better to adhere to the recommendations of professional craftswomen.  Traditionally, thick bags are divided into strips 1-2 cm thick, and transparent cellophane - 3-4 cm. Needlewomen recommend focusing on the density of the material.  The thicker it is, the thinner the strip. </li><li>  Measure the desired distance, take a knife and simply swipe along the ruler. </li><li>  By analogy, continue to work until the entire stop is over. </li><li>  As a result, you will get many identical "rings". </li><li>  Further actions vary.  To perform the rug, the "rings" must be connected by threading one into the other and tightening.  The resulting "thread" to wind into a ball.  But to make a Christmas tree, you should cut them into strips and, without fastening, use for creativity. </li></ol><h2>  How to make a rug? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bag mat" class="if uuid-3069805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3069805.jpg"></div><p>  Before acquainting the reader with the features of the technology, it is important to note that it assumes the presence of basic crochet skills.  Beginners knitters should not be scared.  In order to make a rug from garbage bags, you need to learn how to knit simple crochet columns. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The essence of the master class is simple steps: </p><ol><li>  Dial a chain of 5 stitches. </li><li>  Lock in the ring, connecting the last and first column. </li><li>  After knitting in a spiral - without lifting loops. </li><li>  In this case, you can manage the process yourself.  Increases will not be visible on the finished product, so they can be done arbitrarily.  The main thing is not to overdo it, otherwise the circle will turn out wavy. </li><li>  Having reached the desired size, tear off the "thread", hide the tip.  If desired, you can add fringe or leave it like that. </li></ol><p>  That's the whole master class "Do-it-yourself rug from bags for garbage." </p><h2>  How to make a Christmas tree? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.uaua.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tree of packages" class="if uuid-3069801" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3069801.jpg"></div><p>  To complete the next original and undoubtedly beautiful craft, take prepared tapes, a paper cone, a needle and threads.  And then carefully read the instructions: </p><ol><li>  Cut the ribbons into equal pieces. </li><li>  Fold a few pieces and drag in the middle - you get a pompom. </li><li>  Continue in the same vein.  It is better to stick to one size, but the number of parts depends on the size of the cone. </li><li>  Then collect the pompons on a string, like a garland. </li><li>  And then sew, winding onto a cone. </li></ol><p>  A handmade Christmas tree from garbage bags can be decorated at will.  And then put in the most prominent place. </p>
