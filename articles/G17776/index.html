For the first time this place was mentioned in the old Russian chronicles in the 15th century.  The small village was a haven for merchants and artisans.  In the 19th century, Borovichi began to extract lime, brown coal, pyrites and refractory clay, which led to the rapid development of the city.  Let‚Äôs take a closer look at Borovichi city, sights and what to see in it. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="58.3925508" data-lng="33.90682560000005" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/2/2/8/8228.png"></div><h2>  Bridge over the Mstoy River </h2><p>  An arch bridge, built more than a hundred years ago, is rightfully considered to be a visiting card of the city.  The creation of the engineer Belelubsky has the shape of a bow and majestically rises above the river Mstoy.  Openwork design gives this powerful and heavy construction a visual weightlessness and airiness.  In the 90s, by order of the president, this object was considered a historical and cultural heritage of the federal scale. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotokto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bridge over the Mstoy River" class="if uuid-2771290" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103993/2771290.jpg"></div><p>  At the end of the 19th century, the Borovichi City Council decided to build this bridge.  A lot of money was required, and the city budget could not cover all the costs.  For this reason, the authorities began to collect the necessary amount through voluntary donations.  After the money was collected, representatives of the Duma turned to the designer Belelubsky, who created three projects for the bridge across the river.  The choice fell on the construction of the arch type.  The construction of the bridge began in 1902, and after three years the work was completed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Museum of Local Lore </h2><div class="photo" data-original="gulaytour.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Borovichi Museum of Local Lore" class="if uuid-2771297" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103993/2771297.jpg"></div><p>  Thanks to exhibition displays and slide shows, tourists in this museum can get acquainted with the history of Borovichi, the sights of which attract many tourists.  After acquaintance with the merchant and craft life, everyone can take part in a traditional tea party, where you can try local pastries and a variety of confectionery products made at the city factory. </p><p>  The museum was opened at the beginning of the 20th century, and at first among the exhibits were old furniture, books, paintings, as well as wooden, leather and ceramic products - the main objects of noble life.  Today, in the collection of the museum of local lore, in addition to the products of local industry, one can find expositions from the Great Patriotic War. </p><h2>  Old station </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.kaliningradgid.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The old station in Borovichi" class="if uuid-2771303" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103993/2771303.jpg"></div><p>  Arriving in the city, the first thing that tourists encounter is the station building, which in itself is a landmark of Borovichi.  The facility was built at the end of the 19th century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The structure of a single architectural ensemble includes four buildings located parallel to the railway line: </p><ul><li>  station building; </li><li>  warehouse space; </li><li>  luggage compartment; </li><li>  water tower. </li></ul><p>  A feature of the station is that each object is made of wood.  The main room is equipped with a beautiful openwork cornice. </p><p>  Refractory brick was made in Borovichi, and for its removal Borovichi industrialists built a railway with their own money.  A line with a length of more than 30 kilometers was launched in 1878. </p><p>  The landmark of the city of Borovichi has become a platform for filming the film ‚ÄúState Counselor‚Äù. </p><p>  Despite its antiquity, the facility is still in operation and receives guests from all over the world. </p><h2>  Manor of Suvorov </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.personalguide.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor of Suvorov in Borovichi" class="if uuid-2771308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103993/2771308.jpg"></div><p>  35 kilometers from the city you can find the estate named after Suvorov - the famous commander.  It is located in the village of Konchansky-Suvorovsky - the family estate of the Suvorov family (at one time his father bought this land). </p><p>  In the 40s of the last century, a monument to this historical figure was erected in the village, which used to be called simply the ‚ÄúKonchanskoye village‚Äù, and the village was renamed, adding the word ‚ÄúSuvorovskoe‚Äù to the name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The museum building was opened two years after the installation of the monument.  The exposition was dedicated to peasant farming and the life of the landowner Suvorov. </p><p>  Today, tourists can see the commander‚Äôs winter house, an old well, a park area with a pond, a gazebo and centuries-old oaks in the museum. </p><p>  Some objects were reconstructed at one time, because the buildings were wooden and they could not be preserved in their original form.  Unfortunately, the objects inside the estate were not preserved.  However, some things that belonged to Suvorov were still preserved and can be seen in the museum.  Among the exhibits there are rare and interesting paintings. </p><h2>  Estate of the landowner Nekhlyudov </h2><div class="photo" data-original="." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The estate of the landowner Nekhlyudov Borovichi" class="if uuid-2771315" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103993/2771315.jpg"></div><p>  Little is known about this cultural object, but with its mysterious appearance it attracts many tourists.  At the end of the 19th century, the landowner Nekhlyudov built a real Gothic castle near Borovichi.  After some time, the owner of the house changed, and the ownership of the property was transferred to the local entrepreneur Wachter, who made clay bricks. </p><p>  There are legends about a ghost living inside the castle.  They say that at night you can hear the roar and tapping. </p><p>  In Soviet times, the school was located in the estate.  Nowadays, the owner of the property lives outside of Russia, and the castle has a neglected, dilapidated appearance.  The walls of the estate are covered with cracks, and the windows and doors are closed by boarded up boards. </p><p>  If you want to get an unforgettable aesthetic pleasure, then by all means visit this cultural object in the city of Borovichi.  It is located near the city itself, near the village of Khvoynoy. </p><h2>  What other places can I visit? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="welcometver.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="holy spring of Jacob Borovitsky" class="if uuid-2771319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103993/2771319.jpg"></div><p>  Borovichi has beautiful places everywhere.  For especially sophisticated tourists, we recommend visiting three attractions: </p><ol><li>  Having got outside Borovichi, in Sosnovka you can get to the holy spring of Jacob Borovitsky.  There is also a chapel and a local temple.  Residents of the city often come to this place for holy water.  A source of clean water is located at a depth of thirty meters.  In the chapel you can see the icon of the Mother of God.  Another icon is made on a linden board. </li><li>  For tourists, it will also be interesting to visit the suspension bridge in Opechenskiy Posad.  It combines two local villages and has a length of more than 60 meters.  To create the object, transverse and longitudinal boards laid on steel cables were used.  The cables are attached to the pylons (poles) installed at the beginning and end of the suspension type bridge. </li><li>  In the city you can see an unusual sculpture made of wood - a giant chair.  It is located near the local plant producing furniture.  This is a kind of monument to local production.  Many people like to be photographed next to this amazing object. </li></ol><p>  If you love history, then you should go on an archaeological campaign outside the city for research and excavations in local mounds and hillforts. </p><h2>  Where can I relax with the whole family? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.novgorod.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Arboretum in Borovichi" class="if uuid-2771323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103993/2771323.jpg"></div><p>  If you are wondering where to go in Borovichi, the answer is simple: for a family holiday you can visit the arboretum, located 35 km from Borovichi, in the Opechensky Posad.  The founder of the park is S. A. Ushanov, a resident of this village.  For half a century, without the help of the state, he created this unique creation. </p><p>  The guardian arboretum will delight the whole family with trees growing on its territory, both ordinary and exotic, such as Japanese spirea, Balkan pine or Korean forzia.  The park arouses interest not only with rare plants, but also with fantastic sculptures located throughout the site.  This is a popular attraction in Borovichi.  The place will also surprise tourists with a home-made fountain that looks like a captain‚Äôs bridge, as well as a three-meter bear talking in the voice of the founder of the park. </p><p>  The guardian arboretum attracts tourists because of its beautiful pond, the island of the newlyweds and the observation deck. </p><p>  With regard to entertainment in Borovichi, Novgorod region, for a quality summer vacation, it is recommended to visit a local water park in the city of Borovichi.  Here you will find water slides, several pools (including a children's pool) with all amenities, including a jacuzzi.  Vacationers can take a steam bath in a modern sauna inside the complex. </p><h2>  Where can I spend the night and eat? </h2><p>  The problem with an overnight stay will be solved by the local guest house.  Borovichi is a small, provincial town, so it‚Äôs hard to find information about city hotels to book a room on the Internet.  But, turning to the guest house, you can always count on a free place to relax. </p><p>  There are no problems with food in the city: you can always have a bite to eat in small restaurants, cafes or eateries.  There are no exotic dishes here, but there you can have a cheap and satisfying dinner with the whole family. </p><p>  You can come to Borovichi from Moscow or St. Petersburg by your car or by buying a train ticket. </p>
