  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to charge the phone without charging?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Everyone remembers that most recently we did not even know <span>what a cell</span> phone was and could well do without it.  But now, when technological progress is moving at tremendous speed forward to new discoveries, in the age of <span>innovative technologies,</span> not a single person, not even a small child, can do without a cell phone.  This important little thing makes our life easier - it allows us to be in touch with relatives and friends, colleagues and superiors almost around the clock, wherever you are at the moment: in another country, city or just not so far from home or office.  The advantages of such a lot of phones.  It is comfortable to feel when you are not tied to a <span>telephone wall jack</span> and you and your space are not limited by the cord going from it to the telephone - this is a huge advantage of a cell over a stationary one, which is becoming a thing of the past and becoming practically unnecessary. </p><p>  Sometimes it is not the telephone that fails us, but our own memory.  It happens that we forget the charger at home, and when the phone is disconnected from a <span>dead battery,</span> problems begin.  Either the boss and colleagues cannot reach us, or we ourselves cannot make an important urgent call.  These seemingly little things clearly spoil our mood and interfere with the usual way of life.  Many begin to puzzle how to charge the phone without charging and conduct various experiments, from which the device may just suffer, well, and if you are lucky, its battery will receive the necessary energy to work. </p><p>  There is still a way out of the situation, and we will tell you now how to charge the phone without charging. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  People on various Internet forums offer many ways to solve this problem.  Someone advises to use the old, proven method, as we used to do with ordinary depleted batteries that had to be removed from the device, even if it was a tape recorder or watch, a remote control from the TV or something else, and throw them on the floor or asphalt shake, knock them, and then insert them back.  It helped, but not for long.  This is the method that Mr. X, a regular participant in forum communication on the Internet, offers us. </p><p>  How can I charge my phone without charging?  A lot of proposals are written about this, which are quite interesting.  They suggest charging from a computer via a USB cable.  But this option is available only to those who have this cord included with the phone. </p><p>  Interesting information was shared with us by Mr. Y, who spoke about how this problem is being solved in the USA.  There, new technologies have reached the point where a person, moving along the street and talking on a cell phone, can charge the phone without charging.  Like, you ask.  But very simple. <strong> </strong>  According to new technology, the phone can now be charged by converting kinetic <span>energy</span> into <span>electrical energy</span> .  That is, when moving in space, you need to shake the phone and swing it.  So, if you meet such a strange person brandishing a cell phone on the street, do not be surprised: he just charges him. </p><p>  What other ways to charge a phone without charging can be subtracted on the Internet?  Inventive blogger Z offers to charge the phone from the sun.  But here you need to be extremely careful and careful, correctly and accurately follow the instructions. </p><p>  These are the possible answers to the question: how to charge the phone without charging.  Maybe they are far from perfect and even seem to someone implausible and strange.  But the thought does not stand still and, for sure, soon people will learn how to manage in extreme conditions without a charger for the phone.  Whether you try to charge your mobile phone with these self-charging methods or not, you decide.  Perhaps you will come up with your best option and offer it to the whole world, for which you will receive world fame.  In the meantime, we use the simple tips of resourceful and inventive people, or simply don‚Äôt forget the charger at home when we leave far and for long. </p>
