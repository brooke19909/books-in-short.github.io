    <h2>  Comments of guests and guests of Crete </h2><p>  In general, if you want to provide yourself with comfort and coziness, then you should choose Marirena 3 *.  The reviews prove it again.  Many guests claim that the trip exceeds all expectations.  Settlement is quick, cleaning is regular, always clean towels.  They note the accuracy, cleanliness, polite staff.  By the way, many tourists choose this hotel because of its advantageous location - there is a taxi and bus stop nearby, and you do not need to spend extra money on a transplant.  Some mistakenly believe that since the hotel is located next to the beach, there are always a lot of people there, but this is not so.  It‚Äôs spacious on the shore, and the sea is gentle and clean.  It is noted that staff even packs impressive orders in taverns.  Near the hotel there is an agency where you can buy excursions.  By the way, tourists say that a Russian-speaking girl works there, and this is a definite plus for those people who do not speak foreign well.  In general, tourists who have come to Greece at least once are advised to stay there.  The Greeks are very friendly and do everything to ensure that visitors to their cities fall in love with the island with all their souls.  As for the hotel, almost everyone unanimously declares that this is the best ratio of criteria such as price and quality. </p><h2>  Hotel Tour </h2><p>  And now, in fact, about the prices that Crete offers.  Hotel Marirena is famous for its fairly democratic economy.  The average cost of a tour to this hotel for one person for one week (double room) is about 11,845 rubles.  And if you buy a burning ticket, it will be even cheaper.  You can look for promotional offers before planning a trip, then it will be generally budgeted.  As you can see, the price is really affordable, given all the advantages that were described a little earlier.  Needless to say, even hotels in some Russian resorts are more expensive, but this is Greece.  Based on this, we can draw certain conclusions regarding prices in the state in general.  So, you should return to the topic of the cost of accommodation.  This is really very small when compared with other hotels.  For example, in Domes Of Elounda 5 * a double room for two will cost about 160,000 rubles.  So draw the appropriate conclusions.  Of course, hotels from different categories, but this fact still cannot be ignored. </p>

    <h2>  The cheaper principle works </h2><p>  Many tourists, not particularly versed in hotels and temporary residences, decide to stay at this place, because they are satisfied with the prices.  And they are not mistaken, since in this case the principle of ‚Äúwhat is cheap - high-quality‚Äù fully works.  A great option in order to spend the night in coziness and comfort, put yourself in order, relax.  By the way, people who are not the first time to stay in hotels, mark Marirena 3 * as a very good place - in terms of service, services, food, location, prices.  It is noted that in many other hotels of the same price category, the quality is very different, and in a bad way.  In general, this place will appeal to both businessmen who have arrived on business, families wishing to relax, and many other guests of the city.  Definitely I want to go back there again to feel all the charms of Greece again. </p>
