In the real estate market there is a huge number of various offers.  There would be, as they say, money.  This is exactly the last thing that creates problems.  Of course, nobody will refuse to buy an apartment in the center of St. Petersburg.  That's just not everyone can.  That's why people drop by in search of housing on the outskirts of the metropolis.  However, not everything is so bad actually.  Sometimes what seems at first a step of despair actually turns out to be an option that brings only joy and satisfaction.  And on the outskirts today you can find decent options, and even at a very reasonable cost.  And proof of this is the Leningrad Prospect residential complex, which is under construction in the suburbs of St. Petersburg - the village of Murino, Vsevolzhsky District.  Its developer is the developer LenSpetsStroy, which is very well known in the market as a bona fide supplier of quality economy-class housing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Leningrad perspective" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1279849.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A few words about the company </h2><p>  Everyone who is looking for a house or apartment, before buying a property, you should certainly ask about the reputation of the developer.  Today, in addition to bona fide players, there are a considerable number of not only fraudsters, but also companies that are not respected and do not fulfill their obligations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Therefore, it is recommended to deal only with a well-established developer.  Among them is the LenSpetsStroy group of companies.  The mere fact that its head is an academician and a doctor of technical sciences arouses respect and trust among customers.  The merits of the developer are marked by many prestigious awards, and numerous objects delivered on time testify to its reliability and conscientiousness.  During the construction of houses, the developer uses innovative technologies and only high-quality materials, and positive feedback from grateful customers only once again proves that you can deal with the company.  LCD "Leningrad Prospect" is far from the first property of the developer, so potential buyers are strongly recommended to consider it as an option. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Leningrad perspective" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1279850.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About the residential complex </h2><p>  The construction of the residential complex ‚ÄúLeningradskaya Prospect‚Äù is being carried out on the outskirts of St. Petersburg, in the immediate vicinity of the metro station ‚ÄúDevyatkino‚Äù.  What can not but rejoice those who decided to buy real estate here.  Construction began in early 2013, the company promises to hand over the facility by the end of 2017.  It is planned to build two houses - in 14 and 16 floors, respectively - in two stages.  Construction is carried out using frame-monolithic technology. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In total, it is planned to rent one and a half thousand apartments.  On the ground floors of the houses auxiliary and commercial premises will be located.  After completion, the developer intends to begin the construction of infrastructure facilities.  Some of them, by the way, are being built now, in parallel with the residential complex. </p><h2>  Leningrad Perspective: the progress of construction </h2><p>  The construction of the complex is in full accordance with the plan, all information is transparent and true.  All the preparatory work and work on the construction of the foundations are one hundred percent completed, as for the frame, construction activity is already underway at the level of the ninth floor.  All <span>permits have been</span> received, the construction supervision committee has not revealed any violations.  Moreover, as company representatives say, early commissioning is quite possible.  Already today, interest holders of the Leningrad Prospect can purchase housing at starting prices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vsevolozhsk district" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1279857.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ecology of the region </h2><p>  Vsevolozhsk district, on the territory of which construction is underway, does not differ in the abundance of industrial enterprises, and therefore the environmental situation here is more than acceptable.  There are no major highways as such, so residents of the Leningrad Prospect residential complex will not suffer from noise and pollution.  In addition, the ecological situation is positively affected by the abundance of green areas.  In ten minutes by car, you can reach Okhta-Park and the Northern Slope ski resort.  In addition, the Vsevolozhsk region is rich in natural reservoirs, and in the immediate vicinity of the complex flows the Izbuchechny stream. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Transport </h2><p>  As nevertheless, the specialists of LenSpetsStroy company successfully selected a place for the complex.  ‚ÄúLeningrad Prospect‚Äù is a residential complex that must be included in the list of options under consideration when selecting real estate for each potential client.  There are not many new buildings on the outskirts of St. Petersburg that can boast of proximity to the location of metro stations.  So even the presence of one Devyatkino already means that it will be possible to get to any part of the city without any problems.  In addition, almost near the house there is a bus stop from which buses and fixed-route taxis depart regularly. </p>

    <p>  In the village of Murino there is a bus station and a railway station.  As for road interchanges, the nearest ones are Piskarevsky Prospekt and Toksovskoye Shosse. </p><h2>  What property does the developer offer </h2><p>  The choice of housing formats is available, and quite impressive.  Both compact studios and traditional apartments from one to three rooms are offered.  Each type of dwelling has several layout options, so choosing one for yourself is not difficult.  I must say that the company's specialists, designing houses, tried their best.  In the Leningrad Prospect residential complex, you can buy a one-room apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã50 squares.  Studios, too, cannot be called tiny.  Their area varies from 27 to almost 33 meters.  As for the ‚Äúkopecks‚Äù and ‚Äúthree rubles‚Äù, there are rooms in 57-78 and 87-95 ‚Äúsquares,‚Äù respectively. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Leningrad price perspective" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1279921.jpg" width="265"></div>

    <p>  All apartments are distinguished by the presence of a large kitchen (in separate three-room apartments it is simply huge - almost 17 "squares"), as well as an impressive entrance hall, in which you can easily equip a dressing room. </p><p>  The ceiling height in all apartments is 2.8 meters. </p><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  And here the developer has demonstrated his professionalism.  He offers future residents a draft and three <span>finishes.</span>  The first is suitable for those who want to make repairs in the apartment with their own hands.  And also decided to save a little on the purchase of housing.  In this case, the client receives an apartment in which walls and ceilings are plastered and plastered, and there is a screed on the floors.  In addition, a metal entrance door is installed, double-glazed windows are in the windows, glazed and a loggia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Leningrad perspective St. Petersburg" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1279929.jpg" width="428"></div>

    <p>  As for the finishing options, in the basic contractor he chooses the materials and paints the ceilings, pastes the walls with walls, laminates the laminate and installs interior doors.  In general, in simple words, he is preparing an apartment so that tenants can immediately celebrate a housewarming party right after check-in.  That's just the design contractor chooses independently. </p><p>  In the second version, the same types of finishing work are preserved, but the future owner of the apartment chooses the material.  The third type of finishing work involves finishing by specialists of the company, but according to the <span>individual design of the</span> customer. </p><h2>  Internal infrastructure </h2><p>  It is assumed that each house will have a closed courtyard equipped with a checkpoint.  Therefore, the entrance and entry into the territory will be monitored by security officers.  And around the clock.  Checkpoints and entrances are equipped with CCTV cameras. </p><p>  As for the improvement of the courtyard, it is planned to place small architectural forms on its territory, as well as to carry out landscaping under the guidance of a landscape designer.  Walking paths, places for recreation, children's and sports grounds will also be equipped.  It is planned to build a kindergarten in one of the courtyards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Leningrad perspective" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1279925.jpg" width="474"></div>

    <h2>  LCD "Leningrad Prospect": prices </h2><p>  The economy class apartments offered in the complex are simply ‚Äúpulled‚Äù to comfort class.  But their cost is more than attractive.  So, a studio without decoration can be purchased for 1 million 400 thousand rubles, for a one-room one you will have to give (depending on the same finish and area) from 1,800,000 to 2,300,000 rubles, for a two-room one - from 2,400,000 to 4,000 000. As for three-room apartments, without finishing such a living space can be purchased for 3 million 600 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Reviews about the complex </h2><p>  What do people say about the Leningrad Prospect (St. Petersburg) residential complex?  About the quality of housing so far, for obvious reasons, can not go.  After all, the construction process is in full swing.  The course of which, as evidenced by the reviews of those who observe it, coincides with the schedule.  Well, everything else can be found only positive.  Both the developer and the location of the complex are praised, no one speaks badly of the ecology of the district and its transport accessibility. </p>

    <p>  But most of all people are satisfied with the cost of apartments.  After all, it is almost two times lower than in the metropolis itself.  In addition, the developer constantly holds various promotions and offers discounts on one or another type of real estate, which is also very popular with potential customers.  And since the cost of apartments in ‚ÄúPerspective‚Äù is the lowest in the region, the opportunity to purchase real estate using special offers allows you to buy housing much cheaper. </p><p>  People leaving reviews about the Leningrad Prospect residential complex emphasize that the residential complex has many advantages and is by far the most profitable and attractive option on the construction market.  And many of them say that they have either bought it or are going to buy an apartment here in the very near future. </p>
