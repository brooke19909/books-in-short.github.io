The best program for recording conversations on Android</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern smartphones with each new generation are more convincingly proving to their owners that they are not just ‚Äúdialers‚Äù, but real laptop computers.  Now even average cost models have such a high level of performance that those functions, the use of which more recently led to braking, are processed in real time, almost completely "transparent" to the user.  For example, the processor speed has become sufficient for processing images taken in HDR mode, and recording a conversation on Android does not affect the quality of communication at all, since there are enough resources for all tasks. </p>

    <h2>  The most important function </h2><p>  The main function of any smartphone is making voice calls.  Despite the fact that there are several varieties of mobile networks (GSM, CDMA), which differ in the encoding of the transmitted signal and the operating frequency, in the end, the sound stream is output.  If the necessary software is available, the user can record any communication session to a file in order to listen to it later. </p><h2>  The obvious advantage </h2><p>  Until recently, it seemed that recording a conversation on Android is an unhelpful feature that will be in demand only by a limited circle of smartphone owners.  However, everything is changing, and now almost everyone wants this opportunity to be present in his mobile assistant.  Recording a telephone conversation is essentially a document.  So, having agreed, for example, to supply a product, you can be sure to a certain extent that everything will be fulfilled, since attempts to refuse your words in this case will not work.  Or there are situations when in the dialogue any numbers, passwords or other information that is difficult to remember are communicated.  In this case, it is very convenient to record a telephone conversation on Android, and then, in a relaxed atmosphere, listen to it.  In particular, this allows you not to worry that at the time of the call there is no pen and leaflet at hand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  System "MIUI" </h2><p>  Many owners of smartphones running the Android operating system version 4.4.x - the so-called Kit-Kat, install on their gadgets an alternative solution from Chinese developers - the MiUI OS.  In it, unlike the standard one, a significantly redesigned interface is used.  Its main philosophy is convenience, which was fully realized.  It is not surprising that the number of gadgets with MIUI is growing almost daily.  Especially when you consider that there are many <span>custom firmwares.</span>  The owner of a mobile device with MiUI does not need to look for tips on how to activate conversation recording on Android, because everything is incredibly simple and obvious in this system.  Saving is possible with both incoming and outgoing calls.  The use of the provided software mechanism in these cases is completely identical. </p><p>  During the call, a standard screen is displayed (here we assume that the user has not changed the "dialer"), at the bottom of which 6 icon icons are displayed.  If you click the lower right, then the recording of the telephone conversation on the "Android" will begin.  Confirmation that the mechanism has been activated is the countdown of the red timer that has begun.  When the session is completed (saving is turned off or the call is interrupted), a window will appear at the top of the screen offering to listen and save the recording.  If no changes were made, then the files are placed in the folder Sound_recorder / call_rec on the SD memory card. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Setting up an entry in MIUI </h2><p>  The basic function of saving a conversation to a file can be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of the owner of the device.  In particular, if you want to record all calls, then go to the ‚Äúdialer‚Äù (green handset icon), call up the menu and select ‚ÄúCall recording‚Äù in the ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù section.  A list of items is displayed, controlling the state of which, you can activate automatic saving.  Additionally, it is allowed to indicate whether all sessions will be processed or if only some of them should be preferred.  Of course, the settings are not limited to this.  If you select the ‚ÄúSystem Applications‚Äù section in the general menu, then you can find the ‚ÄúVoice Recorder‚Äù item there.  It is possible to specify the quality of the stored sound stream and, as a result, the final file size. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="     " class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1082688.jpg" title="" width="300"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Popular CyanogenMod </h2><p>  Of course, not only MIUI has the ability to record a conversation on Android, so to speak, ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù.  Recently, this feature is also implemented in CyanogenMod firmware.  In order to use this software mechanism, during a voice communication session, you must click on three menu call points, as a result of which a list of actions will be displayed, among which there is a blacklist and an item responsible for starting a conversation recording.  If the Voice Recorder application is initially missing or removed, the function will not be available. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="     " class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1082689.jpg" title="" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Just Android </h2><p>  The basic version of the operating system from Google, pre-installed by manufacturers in their gadgets, does not always allow you to record a conversation on Android without using various third-party software solutions.  It all depends on whether the manufacturer of mobile devices is finalizing the firmware or not.  The record button is placed in the dialer window when making / receiving a call. </p><h2>  Automatic Call Recorder Pro </h2><p>  For obvious reasons, the best program for recording conversations on Android cannot be named.  Each of them has its own characteristics that make this or that solution more preferable for some and completely inconvenient for other users.  However, there is a program that compares favorably with the rest in that it really works, both on older versions of the operating system and on the latest ones.  This is an Automatic Call Recorder Pro, and it is even with a Russian-language interface, which makes its use understandable even to beginners. </p><p>  In order to start working with this program, after installation it is necessary to launch it using the appropriate shortcut, select a theme and indicate whether to increase the volume during calls, improving the audibility during recording.  Further, in the settings, the user is given the opportunity to indicate from which source to take the stream (line, microphones), and put a mark on the desired format (WAV, 3GP or AMR).  That's all.  At any call, the program automatically starts writing to the file, as indicated by the label on the curtain.  When the call is completed, you can open it, see how many records are made, and save or delete data.  You don‚Äôt have to think with her how to enable conversation recording on Android, because everything is done automatically. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="   " class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1082690.jpg" title="" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Digital recording </h2><p>  Also worth noting is the Digital <span>Call Recorder</span> Pro application.  Although the reviews about it are contradictory, when used correctly, everything works just fine, even on CyanogenMod 13 builds. Problems are possible only if the source from which the audio stream is removed is incorrectly selected, which the developer honestly warns about.  The last update was in December 2015.  After starting in the settings, you can choose whether to display notifications after the end of the communication session;  make a choice whether to save files or display a dialog box;  specify the required format (there is MP3 and even MP4).  The choice of sources is limited to 4 points: the telephone line (high quality), microphones and voices (your own or someone else's).  Vibro at the beginning of a call means that recording is not performed due to a malfunction, and you need to change the source or file type (the most compatible one is 3GP).  If everything is fine, then at the end of the call, a window appears asking if you want to save the file.  Everything is incredibly simple.  Since this application works in automatic mode, recording all calls, the question may arise about how to turn off the recording of conversations on Android.  This feature is also provided.  When you start the program in the first window there is a switch that allows you to deactivate the save. </p>
