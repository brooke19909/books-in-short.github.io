City tours are very exciting and eventful.  Still would!  After all, here you can visit the world's largest Amber Museum, visit the grave of the greatest philosopher, wander around the remains of one of the many city forts. </p><p>  Many book <span>excursions to Kaliningrad</span> from Moscow, St. Petersburg, Pskov, Poland and the Baltic states.  We will also go to this unusual and ancient city! </p><h2>  Kaliningrad - a city through centuries </h2><p>  Kaliningrad is a city in many ways unusual.  The spirit of Europe is felt literally at every step.  Kaliningrad, or K√∂nigsberg, as it is often called, is a rich history and many interesting sights.  That is why excursions in Kaliningrad today are so popular and in demand. </p><p>  The city has a special geographical position, because this region is an enclave between Lithuania and Poland and is not geographically connected with the rest of Russia.  On the other hand, it is this unique symbiosis of the Russian and European spirit that attracts many tourists from neighboring countries. </p>

    <p>  The history of the city began in the thirteenth century, when the Teutonic castle was laid here on the shore of the bay.  "Royal mountain" (or, in German, K√∂nigsberg) - this is how medieval knights called this area.  Around the same time, strongholds also appeared in neighboring settlements.  All these ancient cities are included today in numerous excursions in Kaliningrad and the Kaliningrad region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Over time, the castle turned into a small town where a church is being built, a university is being laid.  K√∂nigsberg soon became an important center of <span>East Prussia.</span>  As a result of World War II, the city became part of the USSR and was renamed Kaliningrad.  Unfortunately, he was badly damaged by military operations: about 80% of the historical buildings were destroyed.  Nevertheless, there is something to see the tourist today. </p><p>  Excursions in Kaliningrad are conducted, as a rule, by well-read local historians, who love their native land very much.  Therefore, they certainly will be able to tell a lot of tourists and all the guests of the Baltic city. </p><h2>  Modern Kaliningrad: attractions, excursions </h2><p>  The most popular tourist sites in the city are the Amber Museum, the Cathedral with the grave of the philosopher <span>Immanuel Kant,</span> the "Fish Village" quarter, and a number of surviving fortifications of the 19th century.  A general sightseeing tour of Kaliningrad, as a rule, involves visiting all of these attractions. </p>

    <p>  Guests of the city are usually attracted by local establishments.  So, in K√∂nigsberg there are a lot of cozy bars decorated in the British or English style, where you can try delicious tinctures and cocktails.  Excursions in Kaliningrad and the region are not only walks along the old streets and visiting forts, but also visiting the many natural beauties, which are abundant in this region.  But these places will be discussed a little later.  Now we will get acquainted with the most interesting sights in the city itself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The most popular excursions in Kaliningrad include a visit to the so-called <span>Kant Island</span> with a 14th-century cathedral, Fort King Friedrich Wilhelm I, the Fish Village, and show visitors the old city gates and the remains of the bastions.  Many are also very interested in visiting Amalienau - an area where you can feel the spirit of the old Prussian Koenigsberg. </p><h2>  State Amber Museum </h2><p>  It is difficult to imagine excursions in Kaliningrad without visiting this unique establishment.  This is <span>the largest</span> amber <span>museum in the world</span> , as well as the country's only cultural site of this kind, dedicated to only one mineral.  Yes to what! </p>

    <p>  Amber, as you know, is a resin of relict trees, which millions of years ago appeared in sea water and was transformed in this medium into a solid mineral.  The museum was opened in 1979 in the tower of the Don. </p><p>  There are 28 halls where you can see pieces of <span>amber weighing</span> up to 4 kilograms, as well as about two thousand items from it.  These are paintings, sculptures, dishes, jewelry, ship models and much more. </p><h2>  Fish Village and Kant Island </h2><p>  The fish village is an ethnographic and historical-cultural center, a favorite vacation spot for Kaliningraders themselves and city guests.  Work on its creation began in 2006.  This is a complex of buildings built in the German style, which is located on the banks of the Pregol River, between the High and Honey bridges.  The center includes several facilities.  These are hotels, cafes, restaurants, an observation tower, information and sports centers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Nearby is another attraction of the city - Kant Island with the Gothic Cathedral, built in 1380.  The sacred structure was badly damaged during the Second World War.  Now the building serves as a museum and concert hall. </p><p>  In 1804, the great German philosopher Immanuel Kant was buried in the tomb of the cathedral.  After 120 years, a small symbolic mausoleum with a stone coffin was built near the temple in honor of the thinker.  However, Kant himself is not buried in him. </p><h2>  Fortifications of Konigsberg </h2><p>  The city in its history was surrounded by fortifications three times: in the XIV, XVII and XIX centuries.  During the last defensive period, a powerful system of bastions, city gates and forts was created.  The last 15 were built.  They are located both on the right and on the left bank of the Pregol. </p><p>  What is interesting: The First World War actually passed Kaliningrad, so the forts of the city were not affected.  But during the Second World War they, oddly enough, were used for their intended purpose.  Strong walls of the forts withstood even direct hits of 305 mm shells! </p>

    <p>  The best preserved fort in the city is Fort No. 3 (the old name is Quednau).  Nowadays it is actively visited by tourists. </p><h2>  Interesting places in the Kaliningrad region </h2><p>  <span>The Kaliningrad region is</span> no less interesting and rich in sights than its regional center.  Tourists are interested in small cities of this region: Svetlogorsk, Zelenogradsk, Baltiysk and others. </p><p>  The city of Svetlogorsk is, first of all, the famous and old resort of the Baltic coast.  At one time, the writer Thomas Mann and the storyteller Hoffmann lived here.  And in the city there is a wonderful organ, which is known for its sound on the entire Baltic coast.  Svetlogorsk was surprisingly well preserved, even the dashing years of the war did not catch it. </p>

    <p>  Another interesting city in the Kaliningrad region is Baltiysk.  Here is a beautiful promenade, a fabulous view of the Pillau fortress and the fascinating Museum of the Baltic Fleet. </p><h2>  Curonian Spit: excursion from Kaliningrad </h2><p>  The Curonian Spit is a unique natural formation located just 50 kilometers north of Kaliningrad.  "The kingdom of the sea, dunes and bird voices" - this is how Wilhelm von Humboldt once described this paradise. </p><p>  The sand spit stretches for 98 kilometers.  Today it is divided between two states - Russia and Lithuania.  The width of the Curonian Spit ranges from 400 meters to 4 kilometers. </p>

    <p>  Geographers argue that there are no analogues to this natural entity throughout Europe.  On a small patch of land you can see both typical desert and tundra landscapes.  It is here that the highest and northernmost <span>dune</span> in Europe, <span>Efa, is located,</span> whose height reaches 64 meters. </p><p>  Spit excursions from Kaliningrad are organized regularly.  At the 37th kilometer of the route, all tourists stop to see with their own eyes an unusual section of a pine forest - the so-called dancing forest.  The trunks of local trees are curved and twisted in a bizarre manner.  Scientists believe that the reason for such a strange phenomenon is the caterpillars of the wintering runaway, which eat the apical buds of young pine shoots, distorting their further growth. </p><h2>  Travel from Kaliningrad to Poland </h2><p>  Poles and Germans are quite frequent guests in ancient K√∂nigsberg.  On the other hand, Kaliningraders also like to visit neighboring states as tourists.  So, excursions to Poland from Kaliningrad are in great demand among Russians.  After all, the southern state border is just a stone's throw away, and right behind it is a ton of interesting things! </p><p>  First of all, it is worth highlighting the Polish city of Gdansk with its many medieval monuments of architecture.  Olsztyn is located 60 kilometers south of the border, in the castle of which Nikolai Copernicus lived and worked.  Elblag is very beautiful with its Gothic churches and ancient Renaissance buildings. </p><h2>  Finally... </h2><p>  Kaliningrad, sights, excursions, tourism ... All these words are very well combined with each other.  It is very difficult to imagine a modern city without travelers and tourists who came from other regions of Russia, as well as from Poland, Lithuania, Germany. </p><p>  Excursions in Kaliningrad and the Kaliningrad region are becoming more popular and in demand.  The top five city attractions include the Cathedral, the Amber Museum, the Fish Village Center, Fort No. 3 King Friedrich Wilhelm I, the city zoo, Amalienau - a well-preserved Prussian district. </p><p>  Excursions to the Curonian Spit from Kaliningrad, as well as to other cities of the region - Baltiysk, Svetlogorsk, Zelenogradsk are also very popular. </p>
