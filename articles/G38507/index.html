These are trains, planes, cars, buses, but which method is the most comfortable, for example, for the route from Yekaterinburg to Tyumen or vice versa?  Let's figure it out. </p><p>  We will consider all options for achieving the goal: by air and by land.  The main criteria for us will be: price, travel time and comfort of movement.  And only by evaluating everything together, it will be possible to choose the best option for each person. </p><h2>  Airplane </h2>

    <p>  Perhaps the fastest way to bridge the distance between Yekaterinburg and Tyumen is by plane, but it is also the most expensive.  Even if you buy airline tickets in advance, they will cost you no less than 3.5 thousand per person in economy class. </p><p>  In addition, flying on a plane can be a real test for someone - after all, such a great altitude significantly affects the body, and flight can be a deplorable experience.  Considering the pros and cons of this method of transportation, we can conclude that this option is not suitable for everyone.  It is only good if you need an urgent flight, because on an airplane it takes only about an hour.  But at the same time, it is worth considering the time spent at the airport, as well as the time in order to get to the point of departure and from the point of arrival. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This way of traveling is good even when the price of the ticket does not matter, and you tolerate flights well. </p><h2>  A train </h2>

    <p>  Many will not even hesitate to immediately take a train ticket and enjoy the views of our beautiful homeland along the way.  Indeed, the train is the most convenient option for transportation, and tickets are relatively inexpensive (about 1,200 for the Yekaterinburg - Tyumen train route). </p><p>  But do not forget about the time of the train.  The duration of the trip on this transport is much longer than during the flight, and ranges from 4 to 6 hours, depending on the route and the number of stops.  Although, traveling by train is convenient because you always have a restroom, restaurant car and other services that, for example, are not provided during bus tours (which will be mentioned later in this article). </p><p>  But this option is not suitable for busy people who need to quickly get to their destination.  It will be more successful for families or various companies.  During the trip you can have a good time with your loved ones. </p><h2>  Bus </h2>

    <p>  A bus is a convenient means of transportation over short distances.  The distance from Yekaterinburg to Tyumen is about 330 km along the highway.  This route will take about 6 hours by bus - about the same as by train.  But it should be borne in mind that the bus stops only twice during the entire journey, and for people with various kinds of diseases this can cause a certain kind of discomfort. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Bus fares from Yekaterinburg to Tyumen range from 1,000 to 3,000 rubles, which in some cases is comparable even to the cost of plane tickets.  There are no particular advantages to traveling by bus over other modes of transport - it is not the fastest, not the most convenient, and is also not the cheapest for the price, so few people use it for this route. </p><h2>  Car </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yekaterinburg Tyumen scheme" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1929631.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Of course, not everyone has cars, and not everyone is ready to decide on such a long trip, but as an option it also needs to be considered.  So, if you do not have your own car, then on the Internet you can find a lot of services and communities where people are looking for travel companions on various routes.  Why are they doing this?  Everything is very simple, the driver and his fellow travelers share the amount spent on gasoline, and so the trip is several times cheaper, and besides, traveling with someone is much more interesting than one. </p><p>  Consider, for example, the same route from Yekaterinburg to Tyumen.  Driving directions show that the distance to be covered is 330 kilometers.  Accordingly, you need to spend about 1,000 rubles on gasoline, and if there are more than one person in the car, but a few more passengers, then the amount spent for each decreases by several times. </p><p>  So, a car is a good enough way to get from Yekaterinburg to Tyumen.  It is convenient, practical, the trip is cheaper than on other modes of transport, but, of course, the travel time will be longer than that of an airplane or train - the journey will take about 6-7 hours, it all depends on the driver. </p><p>  In addition, it is not necessary to follow the route on the map, and the driver himself can change the route, stopping or even choosing a different road.  You can visit new places you have not previously explored in our vast country.  But, unfortunately, asphalt pavement in Russia often leaves much to be desired, and this should be remembered. </p><h2>  What kind of transport do you choose? </h2><p>  Summing up, we want to say that in fact, there is no universal, convenient and suitable for all vehicles.  Everything needs to be considered purely individually and to calculate your travels just for yourself, based on <span>personal circumstances</span> and features.  It does not matter if it is a plane, a bus, a train or a car.  The main thing is that the trip was a pleasure and not bring any discomfort. </p>
