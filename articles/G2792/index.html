Recreation - a budget vacation option at sea</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In our time of crises and political upheavals, life is still taking its course.  Summer has already begun, and people are thinking about where to go in order to abandon everyday worries for at least a week or two.  It has become habitual for the residents of Ukraine to relax on their native <span>Black Sea coast.</span>  But now many of them are interested in the question of where to go in order to spend time with benefits for health and nerves, and even inexpensively.  One of the best options could be a vacation in Ochakovo.  Recreation facilities of this quiet town await holidaymakers.  And in this article we will help you figure out how to figure them out. </p><h2>  Ochakov as a resort </h2><p>  This city is perceived by many exclusively as a historical place.  Here Suvorov fought with the Turkish troops with the help of Ukrainian Cossacks.  And in the city itself, fables are told about the treasures hidden by the Ottomans during the retreat.  This former Turkish stronghold is located on a high cape extended into the Black Sea.  It is washed by the waters of the Dnieper and the Southern Bug - because it is here that they merge into the estuary. </p>

    <p>  You will only get here in an hour from Nikolaev - the nearest regional center.  Yes, this town is now sleepy and quiet, but the prices here are much lower than in the untwisted Koblevo, and the surrounding attractions are much higher.  What do they usually mean when referring to a vacation in Ochakovo?  <span>Recreation facilities</span> are not located in the city itself, but closer to the so-called Camp Spit.  Here a unique resort area was formed - Chernomorka, where discos, clubs, cafes and restaurants are no less good than at other famous resorts.  Especially famous are the “Tornado” and “Pilgrim”. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Ochakovo has excellent long and wide beaches with fine, sometimes reddish sand.  They are gentle, free and stretch for many kilometers.  It is interesting to walk along them - there are many picturesque cliffs, beams, bays, lakes.  Since in Ochakovo you will pay less for housing and food, you will have the opportunity to go on excursions. </p>

    <p>  History buffs can explore the ancient city of Olbia, take a trip to the Kinburn Spit and enjoy complete privacy by visiting the island of Berezan with the remains of Byzantine customs.  All this, as well as many others, attracts tourists to rest in Ochakovo.  Recreation centers are ready to offer you housing, food and excursions of your choice.  And the sea here is cleaner than in the Crimea or even Bulgaria.  For four years now, one of the best water parks in the region has been working here - Attica. </p><h2>  What to choose </h2><p>  What can attract the average vacationer to rest in Ochakovo?  Recreation centers offer him very reasonable prices.  Therefore, people who have an income even lower than average will be able to afford to come here.  Each base will provide you with a good selection of accommodation.  It can be houses, buildings from the Soviet foundation, but with repairs and modern amenities.  Most bases have acquired new wooden cottages.  Almost all of them have a fenced green area, so it’s completely safe to relax with children.  There are many playgrounds for children and nice places to spend time in the evenings. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  For example, the territory of the Akvatoriya recreation center in Ochakovo, which belongs to the Admiral Makarov National University of Shipbuilding, is surrounded by flowers planted on terraces descending to the sea.  This is one of the most comfortable places.  Although athletes often relax here, it is great for family fun.  All windows overlook the sea.  The highlight of the base is that residents can cook themselves, using the kitchens, or eat in the dining room for coupons. </p><h2>  Olbia </h2><p>  This base can serve as a good example of a private holiday investment.  It is located right on the territory of the children's sanatorium, surrounded by an exotic park in which plants from botanical gardens are planted.  It is always cool and shady.  Each room has hot water, a modern bathroom, a refrigerator.  You can park the car in a guarded parking lot.  Meals are also organized at the choice of tourists - cooking in the kitchen or a menu on order. </p>

    <p>  The recreation center "Olvia" in Ochakovo, although it was built as a private hotel, is not at all spoiled by the influx of customers and therefore provides guests with a wonderful pastime at sea for little money.  The beach is nearby, as is the marina with pleasure boats.  A descent to the sea is a real tour of the peculiar "Glade of Fairy Tales", where there are many wooden sculptures of your favorite cartoon characters. </p><h2>  "Motorist" </h2><p>  If Olbia is located closer to the center, where there is a market and major stores, then most of the bases are located towards Camp Spit.  They are good in that for a trip to the sea you do not have to go down and climb the stairs.  Many of them have their own infrastructure.  This applies, for example, the Avtomobilist recreation center in Ochakovo, which is located between the water park and the scythe. </p>

    <p>  Tourists settle there in three- and one-story stone buildings.  Many people prefer wooden cottages - the Carpathian "huts", very fashionable recently.  One-story stone buildings - the most budget.  There all amenities are inside.  Three-story ones have their own bathrooms, and wooden cottages are common to several rooms.  On the territory there are bars, cafes, a small market, attractions for children, discos.  You can eat in the dining room comprehensively or according to a custom menu. </p><h2>  "Black Sea" </h2><p>  This is one of Ochakov’s very interesting bases, which is located on the very edge of the Camp Spit.  It is designed for economical living and accommodates tourists in houses.  There are kitchens with gas stoves, refrigerators.  The territory is very green, huge.  One side of it faces the sea, and the other - to the Berezansky estuary.  The recreation center "Chernomorka" in Ochakovo has a playground for children, a parking lot.  On the territory there are water rides, slides, and closer to the estuary - a boat station.  The beach near the base is the largest and cleanest in the vicinity of Ochakovo, and from the shore you can see the <span>island of Berezan.</span>  There, like the <span>Kinburn Spit,</span> excursions are sent every day.  Other walks by the sea and estuary are also popular here. </p>
