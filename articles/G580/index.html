Want to know more about this historical person?  Welcome to this article! </p><h2>  Fedor von Bock.  Biography </h2><p>  The future general was born on December 3, 1880 in the city of Kustrin, which belonged to the German Empire (currently Poland).  The boy grew up in the family of a German officer named Moritz von Bock.  Mother Fedor Olga had not only German, but also Russian roots.  That is why Bok has a Russian name.  And Fyodor's brother served in Berlin as a naval adviser to the Russian emperor.  In general, the von Bokov clan could be divided into two main branches: the Prussian and the Baltic.  Relatives on the Baltic line were members of the aristocracy with Russian roots. </p>

Already in 1904 he received the rank of battalion adjutant, and in 1906 - the regimental.  During the years 1910-1912.  studied at the Academy of the General Staff.  After graduating from the service, Fedor with the captain rank was sent to the <span>General Staff.</span>  In 1913, von Bock received the title of chief quartermaster in the Guards Corps. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  World War I </h2><p>  In September 1914, von Bock Fedor was at the headquarters of the Guards Corps.  There he received the title of chief of operations.

    <p>  Between the world wars in the <span>Weimar Republic</span> there was a significant reduction in the military forces of Germany.  The reason for this was the so-called Treaty of Versailles.  Nevertheless, von Bock managed to maintain his position and remain in the Reichswehr.  For several years he continued to serve at headquarters in various positions.  Later, he received the rank of chief of district headquarters, and then became the head of the infantry battalion.  After some time, being in the rank of colonel, Fedor was promoted to commander of an infantry regiment.  Soon, von Bock received another promotion - he became a major general.  In addition, Fedor was appointed commander in one of the cavalry divisions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1933, power in the country was in the hands of the Nazis.  Von Bock Fedor remains neutral towards the new regime.  Already in 1935 he was appointed commander in the third army group.  Soon, von Bock decides to settle down.  In 1936, the Major General started a family, and soon a daughter was born to him.  Nevertheless, military service did not let Fedor go.  Already on March 12, 1938, he commanded the eighth army during the Anschluss.  After that, Bok received another rank - he became Colonel General. </p><h2>  The Second World War </h2>

    <p>  During the German invasion of Poland, Bock led an army called the North.  Thanks to this, on September 30, 1939, the collection of Fedor <span>'s</span> awards was replenished with the <span>Knight's Cross.</span>  A year later, Bock leads an entire Army Group B, occupying Belgium and the Netherlands.  In the same year, after the occupation of Paris by German troops, Fedor takes part in the Wehrmacht parade, which took place at the Arc de Triomphe.  July 19 Bok receives a new title - Field Marshal. </p><h2>  Invasion of the Soviet Union </h2><p>  When <span>German troops</span> entered the territory of the Soviet Union, von Bock received at his disposal a group of armies called the "Center".  The main objective of this group was the capture of Moscow.  The "Center" possessed the most powerful tank groups of Guderian and Goth. </p><p>  General Fedor von Bock was a supporter of decent treatment of the occupied population.  He was sure that otherwise the level of discipline in the army would drop significantly.  Based on Fedor's diary entries, it can be concluded that he considered the Soviet Union to be an openly weak opponent.  And the general took the Slavic peoples for uncultured, uneducated "aborigines."  In this regard, he did not have any contradictions with Himmler or Hitler.  It is also known that Fedor received an offer to commit an attempt on the Fuhrer.  However, Bock abandoned such an undertaking. </p>

    <p>  During the winter crisis (winter 1941), Fedor speaks critically about the situation at the front.  Bok's comments displeased the F√ºhrer.  Hitler was convinced that the German general and General Fedor in particular had become the cause of the failure of the Moscow offensive and Operation Barbarossa in general.  Soon, due to a failure at the front, von Bock is removed from the leadership of the "North" (if you believe the documents, then for health reasons).  However, after the death of General Reichenau, the South is given to the General. </p><p>  Disagreements again arose between Bok and Hitler.  The general criticized the fragmentation of Army South into two directions.  For harsh criticism, Fedor was again removed and sent to the F√ºhrer‚Äôs personal reserve. </p><h2>  After the displacement of the Nazi regime </h2>

    <p>  Von Bock Fedor was rather pained at his resignation.  During the years 1942-1945.  he lived in Prussia on his own estate.  The former general was critical of <span>Operation Citadel.</span>  In 1945, von Bock and his wife were driving a car along the Kiel Highway.  The car came under fire, due to which Fedor died in the hospital the next day. </p><h2>  Fedor von Bock.  Memoirs </h2><p>  During the Second World War, many military leaders kept personal diaries in which they described in detail the situation at the front.  Fedor von Bock was no exception.  "I stood at the gates of Moscow" was published in 2011 in Russia.  The book is based on Bock's military diary.  A. Kashin took up the translation. </p>
