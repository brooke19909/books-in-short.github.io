But be sure, this simple little star can become a real find in the design of the room on weekdays and holidays. </p><p>  Such an origami star has the advantage that it does not need expensive materials or special knowledge, just a few strips of paper are enough. </p><p>  As a basis, I took a paper strip 1 cm wide.  A half a centimeter wide strip will also make a nice star, but it will be too miniature.  If you take the strip wider, the star will come out rough and messy, which is why the ideal value is about 1 cm wide. </p><p>  The paper can be absolutely any; journal, notebook or any other paper will do.  For example, I chose wrapping and <span>wax paper</span> (drawing does not matter much).  Glossy color magazines also produce very beautiful stars - bright and very unusual!  The paper you have chosen can be beautiful only on one side, its wrong side will not be visible, and this is a definite plus of an asterisk. </p><p>  Now we take our paper and cut it into ribbons 1 cm wide. In the course of work, the cut strips are easier to glue into one and then cut off than to use not too long strips of paper for this.  Well, if in your house there is a paper serpentine, your work will be even easier. </p><p>  <strong>Origami sprocket base</strong> </p><p>  An origami star begins with a base in the form of a <span>regular pentagon</span> made from a pre-prepared strip of paper.  To do this, you need to fold the loop, pass the tip down through it and tie a knot from our strip. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And now the important point is that the tape should not be too loose, but not too tight so that the parts of the strip fit snugly in each corner. </p><p>  So that the tail is not noticeable from this side, we bend it back. </p><p>  Now we are starting to wind up the tape pretty tightly.  To permanently hide the just curled tail, we direct the end of the tape in its direction.  That's how we got a wonderful base of an origami star - a regular pentagon. </p><p>  <strong>Origami winding star</strong> </p><p>  The edges of the pentagon are tightly enveloped by paper so that it does not flatten.  Then we turn the tape inside out and direct it to the right and up, then we go around the side of the pentagon and start the tape left and down.  If you did everything right, the tape itself will lie in the right direction, after which we take it to the right. </p><p>  When an origami star is made up of a very long strip, each side of the pentagon needs to be circled a couple of times.  If you have a tape about 30 cm long, bend around the pentagon as many times as there is enough paper strip. </p><p>  Continue around the edges of the pentagon, wrapping the ribbon. </p><p>  <strong>Give asterisk volume</strong> </p><p>  When there remains a very short tip of the tape, it must be secured by hiding the strip under the revolution. </p><p>  Now that our <span>five-pointed</span> origami <span>star is</span> almost ready, a crucial moment lies ahead - we need to give it volume.  This is convenient to do with a fingernail, directing it across the middle of each side of the pentagon. </p><p>  With the other hand, meanwhile, we hold the workpiece beyond the edges (so that the asterisk becomes voluminous, you do not need to compress the planes of the rectangles).  Try to bend all the sides equally to the center of the sprocket.  The diameter of the finished sprocket is 1.5 cm. </p><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__vtj"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__vtj"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__2-vn-module__vtj"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__3-vn-module__vtj"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__4-vn-module__vtj"></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <strong>Using 3D Origami Sprocket</strong> </p><p>  Once you are convinced that there is nothing complicated in the manufacture of such an asterisk, you will not stop at one!  They have a truly unlimited scope! </p><p>  Origami star is suitable for decorating a Christmas tree, you can make a garland and decorate your house, stick it on gifts or holiday cards, or you can just scatter them on the table.  You can also take plastic or glass bottles of a beautiful shape and fill them with asterisks, and you will get an original and attractive gift. </p><p>  <strong>How to make an origami Christmas star?</strong> </p><p>  Origami "Christmas Star" - a great decoration for a gift box or Christmas tree.  You can decorate the walls of the room where the celebration will take place with small square silver stars.  Paper for a Christmas star can be taken in any color, but it will be most beautiful in a golden, yellow or orange tone.  Although, if you want to make it original, you can make an asterisk of the most unexpected colors - for example, striped (in a marine style) or wooded on a flower meadow. </p><p>  Execution Technology: </p><ol><li>  Fold a square sheet of paper diagonally and unfold. </li><li>  Fold and expand a sheet of paper. </li><li>  Bend the corners to the middle. </li><li>  Expand and rotate the workpiece. </li><li>  Fold a sheet of paper. </li><li>  Fold again. </li><li>  Bend diagonally first the lower right corner, then the lower left corner. </li><li>  Repeat step # 7 three times. </li></ol><p>  Such crafts can be performed with children - this is great entertainment for rainy winter evenings, allowing you to feel close to each other and imbued with the sensation of the upcoming holidays! </p>
