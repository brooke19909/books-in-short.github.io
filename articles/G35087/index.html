    <h2>  Holland on a map of Europe </h2><p>  The official name of this country is the Netherlands.  And for many, the correct answer to the question of where the Netherlands is can be quite unexpected.  The fact is that only two provinces of the Netherlands officially bear this name.  They have historically been the most developed and famous in Europe and far beyond its borders.  And there is nothing surprising in the fact that people are used to referring their name to the whole country as a whole.  But whatever the name of this country, you should look for it on the map of Europe on the coast of the North Sea.  Its inhabitants have been known for centuries both on the continent and far beyond its borders.  They have traditionally been renowned as magnificent mariners, prudent merchants, and skilled craftsmen.  This territorially small country played a more than appreciable role in the culture of Europe.  Art lovers do not need to explain where Holland is located on the world map.  The canvases of the Dutch masters are decorations of the collections of all significant museums on both sides of the ocean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is holland" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/407260.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h2>  Amsterdam </h2><p>  Very vivid memories of tourists leaves the capital of the country.  Many people know where Holland is located on the world map, because those pleasures that are considered at least reprehensible in most countries are easily accessible here.  And most often - criminally punishable.  But Holland is a free country, soft drugs are legalized here.  And a large part of the tourist audience is sent to its capital, primarily because here at an affordable price you can buy marijuana. </p>
