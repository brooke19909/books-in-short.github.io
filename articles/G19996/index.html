    <p>  Every citizen of the Russian Federation has the right to obtain a cadastral passport.  To do this, you need to have a Russian passport and a document for the site.  To implement a quick method of obtaining a passport, you can use an electronic resource.  Through the Internet, you can make a document without leaving your home. </p><p>  The validity period of the cadastral passport is not established.  The preparation of a new document is necessary in case of changing the boundaries of the site. </p><h2>  Buy land with a hammer </h2><p>  In the city of Krasnoyarsk, land plots (Emelyanovsk district and others) can be bought with a hammer.  Today at the auction put up sites that are already on cadastral registration, with drawn borders. </p><p>  The paperwork is handled by the administration of the district where the site is located.  Bidding is carried out only with all the documents prepared for the site. </p><p>  Those who wish to purchase a land plot in Krasnoyarsk can find out the date and conditions of the auction from advertisements in local newspapers, as well as on the sites of the district and city administration.  To become an auction participant, you need to write a statement to the director of the local administration.  The application must indicate the specific area where the construction of a residential building will be carried out.  A copy of the applicant‚Äôs passport is attached to the application, and it is also necessary to leave a certain amount of the deposit from the initial cost of land. </p><p>  After submitting all the documents and making the necessary amount, the district committee decides whether to include the applicant on the list of participants or not.  A refusal may be given if not all documents have been submitted or a certain amount of the deposit has not been paid on time. </p><p>  Participants must understand that it is not land that is sold at the auction itself, but the right to repurchase land in property or the right to lease it.  The amount of rent for the entire period of the contract is immediately withheld from the deposit.  If during the term of the contract the rental rate changes, the administration will recalculate the amount of land. </p><p>  Somewhere for ten years, a lease is signed.  If during this period the tenant has not built a residential building, then with the extension of the lease the amount will increase.  After building a house and registering it, land in the Krasnoyarsk Territory can be redeemed. </p>

    <p>  Before buying land with a hammer, you must be sure to familiarize yourself with the conditions of the area where the site is located.  For example, a plot of land in Solontsy (Krasnoyarsk) is also up for auction, but divorced from civilization.  Plots in this area are not connected to heat supply networks, etc. </p><h2>  Land acquisition from the owner </h2><p>  The second way to buy is to buy land in Krasnoyarsk from the owner.  He may have land both in personal ownership and in lease.  The selling price of the rental plot is much lower, but experts advise to acquire land in personal ownership. </p><p>  The state may seize areas that are both leased and in personal ownership.  But owners of personal property are entitled to payments for the plot, and the right to lease is simply terminated. </p><p>  The leased land in Krasnoyarsk, acquired from the owner, has its drawbacks.  At the time of signing the lease assignment agreement, there is no way to check what conditions are burdening the site, what restrictions are in use.  The registration chamber does not issue a certificate of all the nuances of the rental plot. </p><p>  When transferring a land plot, previously undetected problems may surface.  For example, it could be a ban on building a house.  But experienced realtors know some ways to check the land.  For this, the intermediary contacts the department of municipal property.  Therefore, when buying a leased land, it is better to contact specialists. </p>

    <h2>  Permission to use land </h2><p>  In order to acquire a land plot in Krasnoyarsk without further problems, it is necessary to find out whether this territory belongs to the lands of the settlement.  Only in this case, you can build, farm and garden on the site. </p><p>  Some citizens acquire land that is not related to the locality.  Such plots are acquired for farming.  They are good because their sizes are much larger than in settlements.  As the cities expand, the acquired land near Krasnoyarsk may soon become part of the village. </p><p>  If the main purpose of acquiring a plot is to build a residential building, then land needs to be bought on the territory of the village.  Registering in such a house is not difficult, but registering in a dwelling on a summer cottage is possible only with the permission of the local government administration.  Due to these conditions, prices for different types of land are different. </p><h2>  Land for large families </h2><p>  In 2011, D. Medvedev signed the Federal Law No. 138, which allows large families to receive land for various purposes free of charge.  This law extended not only to full-fledged families, but also to single parents, as well as to adopted children, stepdaughters, and stepsons. </p>

    <p>  Since March 1, 2015, the amendment to the Land Code has lost its force.  This opportunity has become valid only at the regional level.  Regions independently determine the size and location of the land.  The size of the territory can be from 6 to 15 acres.  The provision of land within the city is possible, but not in all cities.  For example, in Moscow and St. Petersburg there is no such possibility. </p><h2>  Land for a large family in Krasnoyarsk </h2><p>  According to Art.  14 of the Law of the Krasnoyarsk Territory "On Regulation of Land Relations in the Krasnoyarsk Territory" for large residents who permanently live in the city, free plots are provided for certain purposes.  On such land, large families can carry out gardening, gardening, animal husbandry, build cottages or build a residential building. </p><p>  For such purposes, land plots are issued on which state property is not delimited.  Local authorities of municipal areas dispose of this land.  Land plots IZHS in Krasnoyarsk free of charge, without holding auctions, can be disabled. </p><h2>  Documents for obtaining a land plot </h2><p>  Large families can get a land plot in Krasnoyarsk for free after providing a certain package of certificates and applications.  Documents that give the right to receive: </p><ul><li>  passports of parents; </li><li>  birth certificates of children; </li><li>  if the children were adopted, a certificate must be presented that confirms this fact; </li><li>  certificate from the home book or financial and personal account. </li></ul>
