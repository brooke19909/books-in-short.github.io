What is she like?  We will answer these and other questions in the article.  It is known that hussar uniforms in 1812 differed in their appearance from uniforms of other cavalry clans.  This discrepancy is due to the origin of this type of army.  Hussars appeared in the Russian army in the middle of the 18th century.  At that time, immigrants from Hungary and Serbia went to serve in it.  They brought the type of uniform that belonged to them.  The outfit and unusualness of the hussar uniform was pleasant, therefore it took root in Russia. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  You do not know what a hussar cape is?  Usually it is called a mentic.  The uniform of the hussars has slightly changed over the course of a century, but has retained its own characteristics.  It consisted of such things: chakchirs, doloman, shako, mentic, boots, hussar sash, tashka.  This also includes waltrap - one of the components of horse equipment.  By the way, each regiment had its own colors of hussar uniforms. </p><h2>  Jacket </h2><p>  What is the hussar cape, we will find out further, and now consider the doloman.  This is a single-breasted short (to the waist) jacket with a low standing collar.  On her chest she was embroidered with cord loops in fifteen rows, which the officers had a golden or silver color (in accordance with the color of the instrument metal assigned to the regiment). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Silk cords of grayish-white or yellow color relied to the soldiers.  For officers, the ends of the rope rows were decorated with gilded buttons, and for the rank and file, copper.  Around the harnesses, the chest of the officer dolman was edged with a narrow silver (gold) galloon.  General's jackets were also decorated with fringe.  Among other things, collars of general, officer and non-commissioned dolomania were lined with galloon of different widths.  The back of this product is also embroidered with cords.  However, 15 rows of cords were not always present on the jacket.  Depending on their size, they could be present from 11 to 18. </p><p>  The color of the doloman, collars and cuffs in each regiment were different. </p><h2>  Mentic </h2><p>  So, you already know that the hussar cape is called "mentik".  <span>This jacket is</span> identical to a doloman, but its collar, the bottom of the sleeves and products, the edges of the sides are trimmed with fur.  The soldiers of each regiment wore mentics of their own color, and it did not always match the color of the doloman. </p><p>  Thus, officers of the Life Guards of the <span>Hussar Regiment</span> wore black beaver fur, while soldiers and non-commissioned officers wore black inexpensive.  In the army hussar regiments, officers wore gray fur, ordinary soldiers wore white, and non-commissioned officers wore black. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In summer, mentics were worn thrown over the left shoulder, and in winter - over doloman, worn in sleeves.  To prevent this product from falling off, it was tied with a cord that passed under the arm of the right hand.  In the summer, only hussars armed with peaks did not wear a mentic.  In a military situation, before the attack, this cape was removed completely or worn on the sleeves. </p><p>  Hussar musicians (timpani, trumpeters) had on the mentics and doloman fans additional decorations in the form of the so-called "porch" on the shoulders, yellow and white braid on the sleeves. </p><h2>  Paintings </h2><p>  How was the hussar cape reproduced in the paintings?  Many canvases, including those written in the 19th century, depict hussars jumping into the attack in mentics fluttering from their shoulders.  These scenes are not true.  Outwardly, they look beautiful, but a mentic swaying in the wind can play a cruel joke with a hussar in battle.  It interferes with controlling the horse, acting with weapons, and can disturb the balance of a warrior in the saddle and throw him to the ground. </p><h2>  Chronicle </h2><p>  Hussar cape has an amazing history.  In general, a short jacket, decorated with cords on the chest, is called "Hungarian".  This thing quietly penetrated into Russia.  Before the Russian hussars put on the uniform in which Napoleon defeated in 1812, the Slavs began to recognize her, starting from the XV-XVI centuries. </p>

    <p>  Hungarian folk clothing was formed on the basis of the cooperation of the Turkish costume with the ancient Hungarian.  A couple of centuries in the lands of Hungary there were incessant military clashes between East and West.  Ottoman oppression, numerous wars ravaged and devastated the state. </p><p>  Simultaneously with the Hungarian antique clothes, there were other options - Eastern and medieval European costumes.  In the future, it was the elements of the East that were used by the Hungarians and entered elements into national clothes. </p><p>  The hussar cloak with a furry is very beautiful.  Hats with sultans, cut details, fur trim, chest fasteners, made in the form of rows of a picturesque cord with tassels and air loops - all these additions turned into an obligatory part of Hungarian folk dresses.  Already in the 15th century they became an attribute of the uniform of an officer of the light Hungarian cavalry.  They were the hussars who repelled the attacks of the Ottoman cavalry. </p><p>  Further, the characteristic features of the costume of the Hungarians began to circulate in Europe.  Most of the young Hungarian warriors sought livelihoods in other countries.  Accepting them for military service, the authorities paid attention not only to the military glory of this people, but also the colorful national attire. </p><h2>  Hungarians </h2><p>  What was the name of the short hussar cape?  If you know how the hussar uniform appeared, you will understand why jackets - mentics and dolomanes - are often called "Hungarians".  But at the same time, there was another Hungarian - civilian.  Very often it was a blue caftan, embroidered with cords on the chest.  This robe resembled the clothes of the pre-Petrine period.  Russian landowners were very fond of wearing it. </p><p>  The hussar uniform and at the same time civilian Hungarian were popular almost until the end of the XIX century.  When the 19th century ended, a female modification of a Hungarian or a hussar jacket came into fashion - a short woolen jacket trimmed with a cord or braid. </p>
