The fourth president is still famous in the United States, as he was one of the creators of the Constitution of this state.  It is believed that he was born in the town of Port Conway (Virginia).  This happened on March 16, 1751. The education of James Madison initially receives private (like many in his time).  In 1769, he easily entered <span>Princeton University.</span>

    <p>  At that time, this institution was called the College of New Jersey.  College graduation - 1771.  At the same time, he becomes a member of the Whig discussion club, which predetermines his further political career and beliefs.  With it, the history of the United States practically begins anew, since Madison has done a lot to create a fully functional and thoughtful power structure. </p><h2>  The beginning of a political career </h2><p>  For the first time, the future US president attracted the attention of revolutionaries in 1775.  He is appointed chairman of the Revolutionary Security Committee in Orange County.  At the same time, Madison is gaining widespread fame as the author of various pamphlets and speeches in which he strongly denounces the British government. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

It is he who prepares a draft resolution on rights, and also does a lot in the field of organization of state management.  By the way, James Madison is very well known in church circles, since it was this man who insisted on the complete separation of the church from government first, then the state.

    <p>  He also created the first Virginia government and was a prominent member of the first assembly.  Nevertheless, he is not elected for a second term, but in 1777 the future president is a member of the governor's council.  What is more remarkable than James Madison?  Democracy in his person acquired a politician who did a lot to form this socio-political system in the form that we know today. </p><h2>  Continental Congress </h2><p>  In just three years, he is elected permanent representative of his native state at the Continental Congress.  In the period from 1780 to 1783 he was a very active participant, having done a lot for the work of this entire organization.  It is James Madison who is considered the author of numerous amendments that gave Congress the right to collect taxes from all states, as well as the distribution of interest on the national debt for them, according to the number of inhabitants.  In addition, James fervently advocated for complete freedom of navigation on the Mississippi River. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Other political merits </h2><p>  For these services, he is elected chairman of the Chamber of Deputies of all of Virginia.  In 1786, he achieved the adoption of the law on complete freedom of religion, and also achieved the complete independence of the state from the church.  The latter did not add Madison fans, but allowed to significantly weaken the influence of Great Britain on the young state. </p>

Largely thanks to Madison's work, the US Constitution of 1787 was created and ratified, which the Americans recall every year.

    <h2>  Constitutional activity </h2><p>  Since Madison was a very calm and confident person, he was able to quickly earn the respect and trust of many deputies.  He played the role of a mediator between conservatives and supporters of the new, federal government, which could make the country stronger.  The House of Deputies in Virginia unanimously recommended James to the Confederate Parliament, and therefore, in 1787-88, he works in New York.  He writes a series of works in which he advocates the creation of a new constitution. </p><p>  Thus, the US Constitution of 1787 was created with the direct participation of this smart and assertive person who knew how to negotiate and ‚Äúbreak through‚Äù his own ideas even in an environment that categorically did not accept them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Different views on government systems </h2><p>  All these materials, signed by the pseudonym Publius, were published in the form of a book entitled Federalist, published just before the ratification of the constitution.  Today, this edition is known as James Madison, Notes from the Federalist.  It was in this work that Madison first formulated those postulates that today are considered to be the basis of modern pluralism. </p>

We can say that with this person began the history of the United States, which is now studied in American schools.  If before Madison it was, rather, not about an independent state, but about a community of revolutionaries, then his activity made other players in the international arena (including Great Britain) reckon with the young country.

    <h2>  The path to the presidency </h2><p>  In 1788, Madison was elected to the ratification committee <span>of Virginia.</span>  His supporters understood that the country urgently needed just such a person: peace and perseverance of the future president were extremely necessary in order to ratify the constitution.  At the same time, an important quality of Madison was the ability to negotiate.  He was able to convince even ardent opponents of the constitutional state that he had achieved the inclusion of ten points in the document, today known as the <span>Bill of Rights.</span> </p><p>  Along with Jefferson, he creates the first Republican party, which served as the opposition bloc.  Jefferson, who soon becomes president, has not forgotten about this role of Madison.  He appoints his associate as Secretary of State, whose post he served between 1801 and 1809.  Historians have no doubt that James and at this time had a significant impact on the development of the country, since Jefferson constantly consulted with him. </p><p>  Thus, James Madison defended the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating in the United States a form of government called the constitutional republic. </p><h2>  How did he become president? </h2><p>  He was elected President of the United States in 1808.  Before that, a kind of ‚Äúcompetition‚Äù was held within the Republican Party itself, designed to help nominate the most promising candidate.  Oddly enough, Madison never once made a pre-election speech, and supporters in the party achieved his popularization.  As in many cases, James managed to negotiate with some opponents of his nomination, making Vice President of 60-year-old George Clinton. </p>

Already in 1812, he was replaced by Elbridge Gerry, who showed himself as vice president as a competent professional.

    <h2>  The main merits of the new president </h2><p>  In 1808, the Americans had one topic for discussion - talk about the damage that the trade embargo of 1807 caused by Great Britain and its satellites inflicted on them.  Export fell sharply, many goods had to be smuggled out, which is why their value was significantly reduced.  Shipowners demanded an urgent resumption of transport, as otherwise the entire transport system would have faded for a couple of years.  James Madison (his domestic policy was balanced) did a lot to minimize damage, developing domestic trade and gradually achieving the lifting of the embargo. </p><p>  In many ways, Madison‚Äôs government program relied on the so-called ‚ÄúThrifty Government.‚Äù  In particular, he believed that in the event of a likely military conflict, the constitution should not interfere with the independent work of the states, but provided that their activities are not harmful to the central federal government.  Madison‚Äôs attitude towards the Indians, to whom he sympathized and offered to provide assistance, including monetary compensation, was also very remarkable!  For that time, it really was a breakthrough, but this idea did not receive the approval of the party majority. </p><h2>  Focus on agriculture and industrial production </h2><p>  Madison fully shared Jefferson's beliefs about the highest value of agriculture, but also recognized that further expansion and strengthening of the United States would not be possible without a strong industrial base.  It is the development of agriculture and industrial production that is characterized almost all the time of his reign. </p><h2>  What led to the war with Britain? </h2>

Thus, forming a new government, he was largely bound by his contractual obligations, and therefore very mediocre managers were largely included in this body.  The only exception was Albert Gallatin, who remained from the composition of the old government.  Even <span>Robert Smith</span> from Maryland was able to get into the State Department, who in 1811 urgently needed to be replaced by James Monroe due to complete insolvency and, possibly, dementia.

    <p>  But still, James Madison <span>(</span> whose <span>political views</span> were wide) showed himself to be a very energetic and decisive ruler.  It was he who in 1810 openly announced the expansion of West Florida, which until then belonged to the Spanish crown.  Soon after, the rebels seized Spanish territory without further ado and proclaimed the creation of a republic.  Already in 1811, the president announces that the United States has claims to East Florida.  In the end, it was possible to agree with the Spaniards ... but not with the British, who in every way interfered with this process.  Because of their obstinacy, war broke out. </p><p>  But at the same time, the president was strongly against such a development of events.  James Madison, whose quotes are still studied in American schools, said the following about this: ‚ÄúOf all the enemies of public freedom, war should be the most feared, because it contains and flourishes the embryos of everyone else.‚Äù  Nevertheless, I still had to fight. </p><h2>  Start of war </h2><p>  In mid-1812, the United States received a message from the British Foreign Minister that his country was not going to unilaterally lift the trade blockade.  In principle, Napoleon was doing the same thing, and therefore the Americans could declare war on two European powers at once.  But prudence still triumphed. </p><p>  The threat from the British was more obvious, and the young state would obviously not have drawn a war on two fronts.  At the beginning of the summer, James Madison (whose biography is briefly reviewed by us) tells Parliament that he will have to declare war on Great Britain, which ... threatens the unity and very fact of the American nation.  It was recognized that the confiscation of American courts, the abduction and murder of US citizens, as well as the incitement of Indian tribes are crimes that are subject to universal condemnation.  Despite the decision to declare war, it was not easy. </p><p>  The Congress meeting was held behind closed doors, journalists and reporters were not allowed, since the issue under discussion was too serious.  Among the members of parliament and the government there were many opponents of the war who spoke of "the lack of money, professional soldiers, military taxes."  Despite this, at the end of June 1812, President Madison officially announced the start of hostilities against Britain. </p><h2>  Failed truce </h2><p>  Oddly enough, the British soon announced the suspension of the trade blockade, after which the US government proposed a truce.  Madison himself demanded unconditionally stop hostilities at sea, release the captured sailors and stop the robbery of coastal cities.  But already at the end of 1812, Great Britain rejected all these conditions, after which the war continued. </p><p>  The central states were extremely unhappy with the ongoing hostilities.  And therefore, in the winter of that year, a commission was set up to re-elect Madison.  But this did not succeed, although not a single vote was given for the president from the central states.  In 1814, after two years of waging war, the situation of the Americans worsened even more, as Napoleon capitulated in Europe.  The British were given the opportunity to transfer the liberated divisions, after which the Capitol and the White House were completely burned, and Madison himself and the government hurriedly fled. </p>

Soon the president resigns, but he also takes an active part in building the young state.  What else is James Madison famous for?  Political science of that historical period knows him as a figure who issued a law on the free self-determination of blacks and the right to return everyone to Africa.  What is characteristic: there were only a few.
