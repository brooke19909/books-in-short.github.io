    <h2>  Geographical location and description </h2><p>  Nea Moudania is located in the southwestern part of Halkidiki, from where the Kassandra Peninsula originates.  In importance, it is second only to the provincial capital - the city of Polygyros.  This is a beautiful coastal town on the shores of the Gulf of Termei in the Aegean Sea, which has developed agriculture, industrial enterprises, valuable crafts and tourist services. </p><p>  The population is about 15 thousand people, in the summer months tourists and vacationers actively come here, to the nearest <span>airport of Thessaloniki</span> - 50 km.  The promenade offers a beautiful view of the snow-capped peaks of Mount Olympus. </p><h2>  Settlement history </h2><p>  The city was founded in 1922, when the Greeks expelled from Turkey began to resettle there after the Asia Minor catastrophe.  The Greek government sent refugees to a place of permanent residence.  They named their settlement in honor of the city of Moudania left in Turkey, but with the prefix Nea, that is, "new." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The whole territory consisted of wetlands, as a result of which many refugees experienced great difficulties in construction and health problems.  Mortality among the arrivals was high, however, as the marshes were drained and housing was built, the construction and modernization of the port, life began to improve. </p><p>  Residents of Nea Moudanya are actively engaged in agriculture, <span>fishing</span> and various crafts.  Old names have been preserved from those times, for example, the avenue leading to the port is called Almira ("salt swamp"). </p><p>  Around the town olive groves, planted fields, coniferous forests are picturesquely located - all this is available for visiting to any tourist who can rent a car or bicycle.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãcultivated land where olives, peanuts and apricots are planted is 110 thousand square meters.  m </p>
