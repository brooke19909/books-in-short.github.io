But these responses may be too subjective and very dependent on the mood.  Tourists contradict each other, and this applies to everything: rooms, food, services, staff relations.  A tour operator failed some of them, and they describe this as a hotel flaw, although the staff has absolutely nothing to do with it.  We tried to study the maximum number of reviews only of those travelers who rested in the hotel recently (in the summer and in the velvet season two thousand and sixteen).  After analyzing these responses, we compiled a digest that will allow you to make your own opinion about the hotel.  To begin with, we only say that it is network: it belongs to the network of Aqua Sol Hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aqua Sol Village 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1559223.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  First of all, it should be said that there are two representative offices of the network in Cyprus, in the Paphos region.  One of them is called Aqua Sol Holiday Village Water Park 4 * (or category A).  The second is simply called "Aqua Sol Village 4 *."  And this is a completely different hotel.  It is also called the Aqua Sol Water Park Resort.  These hotels are located completely not in the neighborhood.  Aqua Sol Village is actually located in the western suburbs of Paphos.  The second belongs to the <span>Coral Bay</span> resort <span>,</span> fifteen kilometers from the city.  The hotel described by us is located near the airport - you will have to go about half an hour.  She stands at the very seashore, on the front page, but at the foot of the hill.  That is, to get to the infrastructure of the city, you will need to go uphill.  Category A ("Village Water Park") is separated from the beach by a road.  She is famous for her water park (which is reflected in the name). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aqua Sol Holiday Village 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1559229.jpg" width="600"></div>

They consist of several dozen two-story villas painted in <span>terracotta color,</span> which creates a festive mood for relaxation in the Mediterranean.  Territories at both hotels are not very large, but also not cramped.  The whole space not occupied by buildings and pools is adapted for a beautiful park.  In the lobby of the Aqua Sol Village 4 * hotel you will be met by a receptionist.  If you do not speak English, administrator Maria, who speaks excellent Russian, is suitable.  At the reception you can buy an Internet access card.  It costs five euros for an hour and a half.  The area at the hotel is very pleasant.  Cases are so as not to obscure the view of the sea.  The hotel has a beach, but it is rocky.  As a result, the water is transparent, like a tear, but you can only swim in the aquatic pools ... Or you have to go to another beach, sandy.  But there it is very convenient to take sea baths. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aqua Sol Holiday Village (Cat.

    <h2>  Rooms and apartments </h2><p>  Beautiful two-storey villas Aqua Sol Holiday Village 4 * (Cyprus) accommodate one hundred forty-nine rooms for guests.  They are divided into only two categories.  Half of the rooms are apartments with one bedroom, and the second - "Suites".  The difference between them is not easy to isolate.  At first glance, the apartments are supposed to have a kitchenette.  But if you take the All Inclusive service program, then the room will only have a sink and a very small set of tableware.  Tourists with young children who planned to cook their own porridge required a stove, and their requests were taken into account.  In the Suites, guests will find a living room, a bedroom and a bathroom.  The rooms that are on the second floor have balconies.  The rooms in the basement are equipped with furnished terraces.  If you are comfortable with crawling bugs, you can safely book rooms on the ground floor - they are more spacious. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  And what is in the rooms </h2><p>  Hotel Aqua Sol Village 4 * was built in the last year of the past millennium.  She survived the last repair in two thousand and eleven.  With numbers, according to reviews, someone is lucky.  There are rooms with completely new furniture, and there are also "tired" ones.  The rooms are beautifully decorated, all of them have air conditioning, a refrigerator and a safe (for a fee).  In "Suites" there is a mini-fridge and an electric kettle.  The apartments are equipped with a real kitchen.  The bathrooms are spacious, the plumbing is in working order.  But from detergents give only two soaps per day.  Therefore, reviews recommend taking shampoo and shower gel with you.  As well as a hairdryer.  By the way, sockets in Cyprus are specific.  To use your electrical appliances or chargers, you need an adapter.  In a hotel it costs significantly more than in a supermarket.  You do not have to pay extra for a sea view.  The apartments also have an ironing board with iron.  Internet in rooms is paid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aqua Sol Village 4 Paphos" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1559231.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Catering for tourists </h2><p>  Guests of the Aqua Sol Holiday Village 4 * hotel are invited to choose between half-board and all-inclusive system.  Opinions about what is better are divided among tourists.  Those who want to relax exclusively in the hotel should recommend All Inclusive, as Paphos‚Äôs infrastructure still needs to be reached (and uphill).  And if you want to try real Cypriot cuisine, limit yourself to half board.  Morning and evening meals are served in the main restaurant Aphrodite.  It has an extensive veranda in the fresh air under a canopy, so you can eat there.  There are Russian tourists at the hotel, so look forward to queues and fights for fruits and meat dishes.  But overall, the nutrition is normal.  There is always a choice of appetizers, side dishes, soups.  They give seasonal vegetables and fruits.  A lot of pastries and a variety of desserts.  For dinner, cooks often treat guests with culinary delights of cuisines from other nations of the world.  Ukrainian borsch is also served here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aqua Sol Holiday Village Water Park 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1559222.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bars and eateries </h2><p>  The gastronomic power of the Aqua Sol Village 4 * hotel (Paphos) is not limited to one restaurant.  One of the pools has a snack bar, where at lunchtime you can enjoy fries, sausages, burgers and the like.  Soups are offered at dinners.  In order for you to be served free of charge for lunch on the All Inclusive system, you must show the room key.  In the evenings, there is another bar on the veranda of the restaurant.  Here you can drink a variety of drinks - both refreshing and alcoholic, and cocktails.  But only until midnight.  The bar works longer, until the last client.  But the service there is already paid, even for those who have "All Inclusive".  The pool bar is open only during the day.  All-inclusive guests enjoy free drinks and light snacks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aqua Sol Holiday Village 4 Paphos" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1559226.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Hotel Aqua Sol Village 4 * stands on the shore.  He has his own beach.  But it, according to reviews, is rocky.  You can swim in rubber slippers "coral", which are sold everywhere for eight to ten euros.  But the sea on the rocks is very clean and transparent, exactly what divers need.  If you can‚Äôt live without sandy beaches, tourists will tell you how to find a suitable coast.  You need to climb the road up the hill and go out onto the main street of the district (with many shops and restaurants).  There you should turn left and go for about a quarter of an hour to the ‚ÄúCoral Bay‚Äù banner.  Here, by the way, is located the ‚Äúnamesake‚Äù of the hotel we are describing - ‚ÄúAqua Sol Holiday Village Water Park Resort 4 *‚Äù.  What's true is true: the beach at this hotel is better.  Sand, smooth entry into the sea - ideal conditions for bathing children.  But beach ammunition is paid there.  Two sunbeds and a common umbrella will cost you seven and a half euros per day (you should keep the ticket until the evening).  This beach has a lot of entertainment: bananas, catamarans and more.  There is also a toilet, shower, as well as a shop with tourist goods and a cafe where you can dine.  You can also get to Coral Bay beach by bus 615, but you still have to stomp uphill to the main street to the stop. </p><h2>  Aquapark </h2><p>  Water activities are a feature of the Aksa Sol Hotels hotel chain.  Therefore, water parks are in two representative offices of the chain.  But the one on Coral Bay Beach has only three pools (one of them is for children), and in Aqua Sol Holiday Village (Cat. A) 4 * there are eight of them.  An artificial "lazy river" flows through the hotel, along which you can raft on inflatable rafts.  There are a variety of slides, both "extreme" and completely harmless.  Separately, there are water activities for children, very young and older.  The water park in this hotel enjoys such a good reputation that tourists from other hotels come here to enjoy the water pleasures.  True, it costs them money.  And for guests of the Aqua Sol Holiday Village 4 * (Paphos), the use of the water park is unlimited and free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aqua Sol Holiday Village 4 (Cyprus)" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1559224.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Animation </h2><p>  For many tourists, the presence of water activities in the hotel is quite enough.  But, nevertheless, in order to diversify the leisure of their guests, two teams of animators work at Aqua Sol Village.  Two girls are trying to stir up adult tourists.  During the day they conduct aerobics classes in the pool, organize team games (beach volleyball, darts, boccia), and in the evenings entertain guests with folklore shows and theme nights.  Tourists can take a live part in these programs: win a prize in the lottery, sing karaoke, etc. In the villa near the children's pool, on the ground floor, there is a mini club.  Here you can bring a child from three to ten years.  In the mini-club with other children engaged in animators.  They draw and sculpt with kids or run cartoons for them in different languages.  In the evenings, mini-discos are held.  Reviews report that on the territory of the hotel Aqua Sol Village 4 * there are also slot machines for children. </p><h2>  Other services </h2><p>  The hotel has a spa center where you can enjoy massages, a sauna and a hot tub.  This service is paid, as well as access to wireless Internet, a water sports center, billiards and bicycle rental.  But there is a rather long list of services that a guest of the Aqua Sol Holiday Village 4 * hotel can use absolutely freely.

The hotel has a mini market, an Internet cafe, a conference room, and laundry facilities.  Room service is available for a fee.  For newlyweds and people celebrating a birthday, small gifts from the hotel are relied upon. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2><p>  Hotel Aqua Sol Village 4 * (Cyprus) is located away from the epicenter of the resort (10 minutes walk uphill), but it is very close to the sea.  Entering the water is not very convenient.  But the sea is clean and warm.  Guests enjoyed their accommodation in two-story villas.  Recommendations for choosing a room: ask for in building 25 or 26. These villas are the farthest from the restaurant and there is quite quiet.  Coral Bay Beach can also be reached along the coast.  If you go up to the bus stop, you can independently travel around the entire island republic.  The city of Paphos is full of historical cultural attractions.  Tourists with children should visit the bird show and the local zoo. </p>
