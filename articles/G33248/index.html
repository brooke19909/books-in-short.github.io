The first of the Muslim military commanders who went beyond Arabia and knelt the great Byzantium. </p><h2>  short biography </h2><p>  Khalid ibn Al-Walid was born in the most famous city of Islamic religion - Mecca, in 592, and was a native of the Quraish tribe.  He was the most successful military leader in Muslim history, winning victories in 43 major battles and never having been defeated.  Entered world history as a genius of military strategies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khalid ibn al-valid" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/1806188.jpg" width="600"></div>  Historians say that it combined the cruelty of Genghis Khan, the wisdom of Tamerlane and the tactical abilities of Napoleon.  One of his favorite sayings is: ‚ÄúCowardice will not prolong my life, and courage will not decrease it.‚Äù  Tough discipline reigned in his army, the soldiers were distinguished by fearlessness and the ability to sharply change positions without prolonged sieges.

    <p>  Initially, he was an opponent of Muslims and the prophet Muhammad, fought on the side of the Quraysh and already then showed his ability to lead the soldiers, defeating Muslims in the battle of Uhud. </p><p>  Islam accepted Hijra in the year 7, and already in the year 8 he fought for the prophet, showing his remarkable strength and resourcefulness.  In the 10th year of the Hijra, with its help, the majority of the population in the Najran region converted to Islam, and in 13 won the famous victory at Yarmouk, when almost all of Syria came over to the side of the Muslims. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  He was a very disciplined and thinking warrior, but at the same time he sometimes did unexpected things: somehow, being at the front, he arbitrarily left the army and went into hajj.  For this, he was removed from the post of commander of the front.  But, taking into account his merits, from the post of military commander of the whole army, they still did not dare to punish him severely - because his mind, skill in tactical combat and assertiveness were well known.  Subsequently, Caliph Omar nevertheless dismissed him and transferred him to public service. </p><p>  Khalid ibn Al-Waleed died at 58, in 643 (in the 21st Hijri) from an illness in the city of Homs, in Syria, and was buried there. </p><h2>  Why is Sayfullah so called? </h2><p>  Sayfullah - translated from Arabic means "the sword of Allah."  Why did the wise commander get such a nickname? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the sword of allah" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/1806187.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the battle with the Byzantines, which took place in Muta, Khalid first participated on the side of the Prophet Muhammad.  The battle was very fierce, all unit commanders died in it, and the fearless Khalid took command.  He chose a special retreat tactic in order to prevent defeat and not to lose soldiers.  For his courage and resourcefulness, the prophet himself called him Sayfullah.  Since then, he was respectfully called. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Feats of arms </h2><p>  Khalid has scored dozens of major victories and no less than small fights.  He was known as swift to decisions and harsh with enemies, displaying monstrous cruelty in battle, not sparing anyone who stood in his way.  The most significant in the history of the formation of Islam are: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Companions of the Prophet Muhammad" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/1806185.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Khalid ibn Al-Waleed showed his second leg and asked the same.  And again he received a denial in response.  Then he asked to examine his hands and body, asking all the same. </p><p>  - No, dear, the largest distance between the scars is much smaller than the palm of your hand!  How could you survive after so many wounds? </p><p>  Khalid answered sadly: </p><p>  ‚ÄúI was drawn to death in thousands of battles, but why am I not destined to die in battle?‚Äù </p><p>  A wise friend answered: </p><p>  - Oh, Khalid!  You cannot die in battle - the great prophet gave you the name "Sword of Allah."  But can the sword of Allah be broken on the battlefield at the hands of the unfaithful?  This is impossible! </p><p>  After the loyal friend left, Khalid ibn Al-Waleed longedly told his slave Hammam, who reverently served him: </p><p>  ‚ÄúI'm dying like a camel in the desert.‚Äù  I die in disgrace lying in bed. </p><h2>  Khalid Mosque </h2><p>  The tomb of the genius commander is located in the city of Homs (Syria), a magnificent mosque was built above it for the glory of his exploits, but during the hostilities in 2013 it was partially destroyed.  After resolving the conflict, the <span>President of Syria</span> issued a decree on the restoration of the historical monument. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khalid ibn al-valid history" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/1806186.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In Bashkortostan, in the city of Sterlitamak, there is a mosque, also built in honor of Al-Valid in 2010. </p><h2>  Ashab al-Qiram </h2><p>  Literally, this means "the most faithful companions of the Prophet Muhammad", which were divided into three groups: </p><ul><li>  Muhajirs (immigrants to Mecca who left families and all their property for the sake of faith); </li><li>  Ansara (indigenous people of Mecca); </li><li>  Sahaba (those who converted to Islam elsewhere). </li></ul><p>  Muhajirs and Ansars occupied leading positions of military leaders, governors, and the Sahaba were transmitters of hadiths (narrations about the acts of the great prophet, about his life, thoughts).  Hadiths were the basis of ethical and legal teachings among Muslims.  The successors of this tradition still enjoy great authority and respect among believers. </p><p>  In a generalized sense, associates were those who had the honor of seeing the Prophet Muhammad live, no matter how much - five minutes or a lifetime.  The names of all these people are listed in a special dictionary listing all their deeds, exploits and great deeds.  Muslim scholars claim that there were about 12 thousand associates of the Prophet Muhammad, among whom was Khalid ibn Al-Walid. </p><p>  More than 1400 years ago, the first steps of Islam on the earth began - the spiritual support of those who are ready to endure the hardships of life on the path to Truth, and Khalid ibn Al-Walid is in the forefront in the history of Islam, revered by all Muslims of the world. </p>
