    <p>  St.  Constantin 5 * is a five-star hotel that serves its guests at the highest level, and does not take that much money for it, when compared with other hotels of this class.  However, it is worth talking about pricing later.  For starters, some information about the hotel itself. </p><p>  Its first advantage is transport accessibility.  Not only are there public transport stops nearby, but also the airport is within 20-30 kilometers.  This ideal distance is far enough so that the noise of the landing planes does not interfere with relaxation, but is quite close to the hotel. </p><p>  People do not like to spend extra hours to their temporary residence, given that they have just left the ramp and want to quickly settle down and begin to relax.  Another worth noting is the fact that St.  Constantin 5 * is located on the first coastline - literally two minutes walk from the beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The hotel offers guests rooms of various categories - each guest will find the option of apartments that suits him the most. </p><p>  In St.  Constantin 5 * only 132 rooms - the best designers worked on their design, so being inside is a pleasure.  The apartments are made taking into account Cretan style traditions - this can be seen both in the design and in the architecture of the entire hotel. </p><p>  The rooms are perfect for a romantic getaway or for a family pastime.  At least in these places youth companies stop, often elderly couples also act as guests.  So St.  Constantin hotel 5 * can be called a universal hotel.  But one very important point should be noted.  Despite the fact that there are many rooms in the hotel, it is worth to book apartments in advance - the hotel is popular, and at the height of the season it can be simply clogged. </p><h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  Guests are offered a fairly wide selection in terms of rooms.  There are standard, double - two people inside will sit comfortably.  This is the most popular type of rooms, since couples most often come to rest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next are the standard family apartments with a separate bedroom - for 2-4 people.  You can book with two separate bedrooms - these rooms usually accommodate five people.  Guests who value comfort will love the Superior Double.  But in these rooms they stop for three - booking options allow this.  And finally, superior family rooms, that is, superior apartments. </p><h2>  Room features </h2>

    <p>  Apartment St.  Constantin Village 5 * is designed for a comfortable stay - they have everything you need so that a person can get enough sleep, relax and just have a good time in a relaxed and cozy atmosphere. </p><p>  The standard rooms have air conditioning and heating (even heating is thought out, as it is sometimes cold for some guests), a refrigerator, a plasma TV with satellite and music channels, modern comfortable furniture, a terrace (or balcony).  It is also worth noting the attention of such trifles as a hairdryer, safe, telephone, kettle and even an outlet designed for a razor.  In general, everything that may be needed. </p><p>  Superior rooms are distinguished by the provision of additional services that are included in the price of the reservation.  So, if the guests staying in ordinary rooms are provided only with the ‚Äúwake-up service‚Äù and daily cleaning, then the Superior list is much larger.  Slippers, a private parking space, bath amenities and even a gift for your arrival are provided.  Guests are met at the airport and escorted back.  Even the apartments are cleaned twice a day, and in a day they provide guests with fresh fruits. </p>

    <p>  In St.  Constantin 5 * Gouves is a great hotel.  So say almost all the people who at least once stayed in his rooms.  In such an environment, you suddenly forget about routine and bustle, occupying yourself with entertainment and comfort. </p><p>  The excellent cuisine of Estia and Dionysos restaurants, delicious barbecue in Asteria, clean beaches, high-quality service, polite staff (many employees, by the way, know Russian) - all this characterizes this hotel as well as possible.  And the small price completes this pleasant picture - about 17 thousand rubles for double occupancy in an excellent bright room.  This is really a bit, because it is not surprising that in the high season it is rather difficult to book apartments in this place.  Therefore, you should address this issue in advance.  In general, if you want to spend an unforgettable vacation away from the busy city, get all kinds of pleasures, while paying a little, you should go here - to the St.  Constantin 5 *. </p>
