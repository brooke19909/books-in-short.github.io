Vacuum cleaners VITEK, SUPRA, Thomas, Karcher</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Through the filters of standard vacuum cleaners, microparticles of dust still get into the surrounding air.  And if healthy people do not feel this, then for allergy sufferers this is simply a disaster.  In addition, replacing (if it is disposable) or cleaning a (reusable) dust bag is a tedious task, and in many ways quite unpleasant.  Devices equipped with a water filter do not have this drawback.  Therefore, they confidently crowd out classic models from the consumer market.  The choice of such cleaning devices is wide and varied (both by manufacturers and by price).  In our review article, we will talk about the ratings of the <span>best vacuum cleaners</span> with an aquafilter of various price categories and their technical characteristics.  We hope that the information provided will help you decide on a specific model based on your personal preferences and financial capabilities. </p><h2>  The principle of operation of a vacuum cleaner with a water filter </h2><p>  The main fundamental difference between a vacuum cleaner with an aquafilter is that all the air drawn into the device enters the container with water, which is the main filter element.  The liquid impregnates particles of dirt and dust.  Large fractions settle to the bottom, small ones dissolve in water.  The efficiency of cleaning with the help of such devices is much higher than that of classical products equipped with ordinary bags (disposable or reusable) for collecting garbage. </p><p>  Currently, it is the products with aquafilters in the ratings of the best vacuum cleaners that are confidently occupying a leading position. </p><div class="photo" data-original="filterbuy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Principle of operation" class="if uuid-2600868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60729/2600868.jpg"></div><p>  On a note!  The use of such a highly effective device not only allows you to quickly and efficiently perform cleaning, but also additionally moisten the air in the room.  Which has a beneficial effect on health (especially on hot summer days). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  According to the principle of technological design features, all water filter elements are divided into three types: </p><ul><li>  Hookah  In such devices, air is passed through a container filled with water along a complex path. </li><li>  Injection.  In such products, the contaminated air is first mixed with water under pressure using a special injector, and then passes through the box with liquid.  That is, two-stage aquafiltration is carried out. </li><li>  Separator  A special centrifuge is installed in the water tank.  Air with particles of dirt and dust spins along with water to very high revolutions.  This allows you to "break" even air bubbles containing any microparticles, and completely clean them from the air returned to the room. </li></ul><p>  The main disadvantage of <span>separator vacuum cleaners</span> with an aquafilter is their high cost.  Therefore, they are not so in demand as adaptations of the first two types. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Vacuum cleaners with aquafilters are characterized by: </p><ul><li>  suction power - from 200 to 700 W; </li><li>  dust collector volume - from 1.2 to 5.8 liters; </li><li>  the degree of air purification (which depends on the type of water filter): for hookahs - 92-95%, for injection ones - 99-99.9%, for separator ones - up to 99.999%; </li><li>  power consumption - from 650 to 2400 W; </li><li>  noise level during operation - from 66 to 87 dB. </li></ul><p>  The convenience of everyday use and subsequent storage is also affected by indicators such as weight and overall dimensions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of products with a water filter </h2><p>  The main advantage of cleaning devices equipped with an aquafilter (in comparison with traditional analogues having dust bags) is a high degree of purification of the air returned to the room.  This is due to the ability of water to "capture" the smallest particles of dust, up to tenths of a micron. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kaercher.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aquafilter vacuum cleaners are highly efficient" class="if uuid-2600886" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60729/2600886.jpg"></div><p>  Another indisputable advantage of such vacuum cleaners is the stable suction power throughout the entire cleaning process.  Whereas in classic models, this indicator invariably drops as the dust collector fills with dust. </p><p>  An important plus is also the simplicity and ease of use.  Before cleaning, pour clean water into the container, and at the end of the process, simply drain it (along with particles of garbage and dust). </p><p>  On a note!  By adding a small amount of flavoring liquid to the dust container, you will not only clean the room, but also get rid of unpleasant odors. </p><p>  Of the shortcomings, users (especially fragile representatives of the weaker sex) note a greater weight of products (compared with classic counterparts).  This is not surprising, because the mass of the device itself increases the volume of water poured into it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Leading manufacturers </h2><p>  The most popular manufacturers, regularly occupying the top ranks of the ratings of the best vacuum cleaners with an aquafilter (which are compiled according to numerous user reviews), today are: </p><ul><li>  German Karcher and Thomas; </li><li>  Russian Vitek; </li><li>  Japanese Supra and Shivaki; </li><li>  Turkish Arnica; </li><li>  Italian Mie; </li><li>  Polish Zelmer; </li><li>  Dutch Philips. </li></ul><p>  It is not entirely correct to compare technical specifications and functionality of products that are fundamentally different in cost (for example, Shivaki SVC 1748 for 7,000 rubles and Karcher for 22,000 rubles).  Therefore, we present to your attention two or three popular models from the top lines of various price categories: </p><ul><li>  Budget - up to 10,000 rubles. </li><li>  The average price range is from 14,000 to 18,000 rubles. </li><li>  Premium class - from 22,000 rubles and above. </li></ul><h2>  Popular budget models </h2><p>  It is immediately worth noting that all modern vacuum cleaners with an aquafilter (even the starting price range) are equipped with highly effective anti-allergenic fine filters that ensure the retention of even the smallest particles. </p><p>  The three leaders are headed by the <span>Vitek</span> VT 8100 <span>vacuum cleaner,</span> costing about 8,000 rubles.  High suction power (400 W) allows you to quickly remove dust and dirt particles from any home surfaces.  The volume of the dust bag is 3.5 liters.  A distinctive feature of this model is the availability of a set of optional accessories, consisting of 5 nozzles: a standard brush for floors and carpets;  for cleaning upholstered furniture;  turbo brushes;  slotted (to remove contaminants from inaccessible places) and very narrow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tmall.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vitek Aquafilter Vacuum Cleaner" class="if uuid-2600845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60729/2600845.jpg"></div><p>  Shivaki SVC 1748 (6800-7200 rubles) confidently settled in second place.  The model is equipped with an 3.8-liter aquafilter with a suction power of 410 watts.  A set of nozzles consists of 4 brushes. </p><p>  Closes the three leaders Supra VCS 2086 (5100 rubles).  It is distinguished by both the lowest price and the rather small volume of the dust collector - only 1.5 liters.  In addition, the model has the shortest length of the power cord - 3.5 m (for competitors - 5 m).  And although the suction power is quite high (380 W), this model is most conveniently used for cleaning small rooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shop.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacuum cleaner Supra VCS 2086" class="if uuid-2600831" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60729/2600831.jpg"></div><p>  Power consumption for all three models is the same and is 1800 watts.  Of the minuses of the Supra VCS 2086 vacuum cleaner, it is necessary to note a high noise level - 83 dB (for comparison, Shivaki has only 68 dB).  All manufacturers of the above models provide a 12-month warranty on their products. </p><h2>  Rating of mid-range models </h2><p>  German vacuum cleaner Thomas Aqua Box Compact (17 000 rubles) with a unique patented water filtration system Wet-Jet tops the list of mid-range models.  Power consumption - 1600 W, dust collector capacity - 1.8 l.  Using such a device, it is possible not only to dry clean (using the so-called ‚Äúair wash‚Äù function), but also to remove liquid dirt, spilled water or other chemically non-aggressive substances from the surface.  Noise level (depending on the operating mode) Thomas Aqua Box Compact is from 70 to 81 dB.  An additional convenience in use is provided by a mechanical regulator of suction force located on the handle of the telescopic rod.  Warranty period is 2.5 years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thomas Aqua Box Compact" class="if uuid-2600823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60729/2600823.jpg"></div><p>  Confident second place was given to the Turkish vacuum cleaner Arnica Bora 7000 ARN 35 R (18 000 rubles).  Due to the design features of the aqua box (the patented DWS system), double vortex flows are created inside, which ensure efficient mixing of dirt and dust particles with water.  The maximum suction power is 420 watts (with a total power consumption of 2400 watts).  The capacity of the liquid tank is 1.2 liters.  The model is equipped with all the necessary nozzles - both for cleaning flat surfaces and for removing dust from various furniture upholstery.  Warranty period is 3 years. </p><p>  The review of vacuum cleaners with a mid-range aquafilter closes the Philips FC8950 model (14,000 rubles).  Of the advantages of the ‚ÄúDutchman‚Äù it is worth noting the impressive volume of the dust bag (5.8 l) and a convenient switch that can be actuated with the help of the foot.  The disadvantages of the product (in our opinion, quite significant) are a very modest suction power (only 220 W) and a fairly high noise level (87 dB). </p><div class="photo" data-original="allo.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips Vacuum Cleaner" class="if uuid-2601050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2601050.jpg"></div><h2>  Popular premium models </h2><p>  In this category, you should pay attention to two very popular, but quite different in price models. </p><p>  The undisputed leader in terms of price / quality ratio is the German <span>vacuum cleaner Karcher</span> DS 6 Premium Mediclean (22 000 rubles).  The developers managed to create for this model a highly efficient engine with a minimum power consumption (650 W).  Together with energy class A, this model is by far the most economical.  Moreover, all this is achieved not at the expense of suction power.  The device creates a rarefaction of air - 230 mbar, with a capacity of 72 l / s.  The absence of a power regulator only increases the reliability of the product.  If desired, the suction power can be reduced by simply opening the mechanical shutter on the handle of the telescopic rod.  Karcher DS 6 Premium Mediclean is equipped with a 2 liter water tank.  Extremely compact dimensions (53.5 x 28.9 x 34.5 cm) and light weight 7.5 kg ensure ease of use and storage.  The manufacturer provides a 24-month warranty on products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="geizhals.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Karcher DS 6 Premium" class="if uuid-2600827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60729/2600827.jpg"></div><p>  The Italian separator model Mie Ecologico was put on the second line of the ‚Äústandings‚Äù only because of its very high price (about 33,000 rubles).  The technical characteristics of this product will satisfy the most demanding lover of cleanliness.  The suction power is, just imagine, 690 watts!  And this is at a very economical power consumption (only 1000 watts).  A closed-type separator with a centrifuge speed of 28,000 rpm is installed in the product.  The degree of air purification declared by the manufacturer (99.997%) eliminates the need for an expensive fine filter (HEPA).  The capacity of the dust bag is 3.5 liters.  Warranty is 3 years.  The only drawback (albeit very conditional) is the rather large weight of the product - 12 kg. </p><h2>  2 in 1 Products </h2><p>  For those who are not ready to completely abandon traditional dust bags, you should pay attention to the 2-in-1 devices.  In such products, two operating modes are provided: </p><ul><li>  using a regular garbage bag; </li><li>  using aquafilter. </li></ul><p>  The first mode, for example, can be successfully used to remove large particles of debris from the surface, and the second - for finishing cleaning the room.  The range of such products is quite limited, so we can do without rating the best vacuum cleaners with a 2 in 1 aquafilter. </p><p>  For information!  A popular model in this category is the <span>Zelmer</span> ZVC 762 <span>vacuum cleaner</span> (12,000 rubles).  The capacity of the aquafilter is 5 l, the volume of the dust bag is 2.5 l.  Maximum power consumption - 1500 W, productivity - 30 l / s.  Despite its versatility, the product weighs only 8.4 kg.  Warranty from the Polish manufacturer - 4 years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mimovrste.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacuum cleaner Zelmer ZVC 762" class="if uuid-2600971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60729/2600971.jpg"></div><h2>  What to look for when choosing </h2><p>  When choosing a vacuum cleaner with an aquafilter for the home, you need to pay attention to several key points: </p><ul><li>  First of all, we determine for ourselves what degree of purification we want to get.  The price of the product will largely depend on this.  If there are no people suffering from allergic diseases in the family, then, for economic reasons, you can choose a simple budget model with a hookah filter (from Shivaki or Supra).  Otherwise, it is better to opt for more expensive products with a separator (they are still quite expensive, but they have the highest degree of cleaning) or an injection cleaning system (for example, purchase the very popular and well-proven Thomas Aquabox vacuum cleaner). </li><li>  Then we select the necessary suction power.  For cleaning smooth surfaces and fabric upholstery of furniture, the value of this indicator of about 300 watts will be quite enough.  Well, if the interior of the room contains carpets or floor coverings with a long pile (and besides, pet hair is scattered everywhere in the house), then it is better to choose a device with a higher suction power (400 W or more). </li><li>  Next, select the volume of the dust bag.  Naturally, the higher its value, the larger the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room that can be vacuumed without intermediate washing of the tank. </li><li>  Well, with the choice of a reliable and time-tested manufacturer, the ratings of the best vacuum cleaners with an aquafilter published above will help you. </li></ul><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Of course, in a short review article it is impossible to tell in detail about the numerous models with aquafilter, which are presented on the modern consumer market.  Regardless of whether you decide to purchase a Thomas Aquabox vacuum cleaner from an average price category or a budget (but no less reliable) Vitek, you can be sure that the quality and efficiency of cleaning will significantly exceed the use of already quite ‚Äúarchaic‚Äù analogues (with bags for collecting dust). </p>
