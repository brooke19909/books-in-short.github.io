    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The territory for development is very well chosen.  Shcherbinka, Moscow Region, has long been attracted by new buildings growing like mushrooms after rain, in which it is quite possible to purchase apartments at their current cost.  After it became part of Moscow, the intensity of construction increased several times.  And the promise of equipment in the near future metro lines created even more attractiveness of this territory. </p><p>  Just five to ten minutes by car from the Buninskaya Alleya metro station and you will find yourself in Prima-Park residential complex.  The same time to go from the railway station "Scherbinka".  The distance from the Moscow Ring Road is 7 kilometers along the Warsaw highway. </p><h2>  Attractiveness </h2><p>  The absence of industrial enterprises in the area, the vegetation surrounding the Prima Park residential complex, the proximity of the Baryshevsky Pond - all this significantly increases the attractiveness of this particular residential complex among the variety of others.  Even the location of the Prima-Park residential complex, whose address is Baryshevskaya Roscha Street, speaks for itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  <span>The residential complex has</span> taken the middle ground between proximity to the metropolis and good environmental conditions.  Transport accessibility of the complex only adds to its advantages: a personal car, an electric train, a fixed-route taxi - any type of transport will quickly bring its residents to the capital. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Proximity to the city entitles residents of the complex to use its entire infrastructure.  This is important.  Several schools and kindergartens will gladly let in new doors of the complex.  For the additional development of children there are music and sports schools.  Therefore, family citizens with children moving to Prima Park do not have to worry that their children will not receive the proper education.  Sufficiently developed Shcherbinka district. </p><p>  Prima-Park is not going to leave the residents who trusted it without their own educational and social institutions.  Therefore, the project provides for the construction of a school for 770 study places.  This is to ensure that the children did not go outside the complex and were safe. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the school, it is planned to build a kindergarten with 140 places.  To provide an adult population with all the benefits of civilization, it is planned to build a shopping and entertainment center, which will house many shops that can provide residents with everything they need, both food and industrial goods. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Owners of their own vehicles will not be left without attention, and now there are more and more of these.  The project provides for underground-surface parking for 1008 cars.  In addition, ground-based guest parking is equipped, for which the streets adjacent to the complex will expand. </p><p>  The arrangement of the courtyard of the complex will also not be left without attention.  These are children's playgrounds, and walking areas, lawns, flower beds.  Everything that will allow residents of the Prima-Park residential complex (New Moscow) to feel in a complex like in paradise and enjoy their holidays walking along the alley after a hard day. </p><h2>  Building </h2><p>  The developer erected eight monolithic-brick houses, each of which rose from the ground to seventeen to twenty-two floors.  The category of houses is ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù.  The architectural style is provided without excessive pretentiousness.  The construction company assumed the construction of high-quality brick houses near the metropolis.  Due to the simplicity of the appearance, the prices of apartments are not sky-high and quite affordable for Muscovites and guests of the capital. </p><p>  All houses are being built in order of priority.  The first floors in all buildings are non-residential and suggest renting them to tenants for shops and social services. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  Shcherbinka, Prima Park offer their residents apartments for every taste and budget: from studios of twenty-seven square meters to three-room apartments of more than seventy square meters.  Everyone, whether it is a lonely person or a happy family, will find housing in the complex to his liking. </p><p>  The layout of the apartments is very sophisticated, unique and non-standard due to the bends of multi-section buildings.  But for sale are offered standard layouts of apartments.  Especially successfully designed studios, elongated in the form of pencil cases.  In addition, they have balconies. </p>

    <p>  The price of apartments (Scherbinka, Prima-Park) includes floor screed, electrical wiring and plastering of walls.  Thus, the developer provides an opportunity for its future residents to save a lot on repairs.  It will be enough to paste the wallpaper and cover the floor with something.  And that‚Äôs all.  You can enter and live for your pleasure. </p>
