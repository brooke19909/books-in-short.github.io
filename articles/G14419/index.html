For several years she has been providing services to people, engaged in the issuance of small loans.

Applications from people are accepted via the Internet.  In the same way, decisions are communicated.  Upon approval of the application, the signing of the contract is required.

    <h2>  Key Benefits of a Microfinance Organization </h2><p>  The company has many advantages.  We list the most basic of them that people indicate in their reviews of the "Honest Word": </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Round-the-clock service work.  The process of reviewing user profiles is automated.  That is why applications can be filled out at any time of the day or night (even on holidays). </li><li>  Users are not required to provide income documents, because the company is well aware that it takes time to process various certificates.  Only one passport is needed. </li><li>  <span>A microfinance organization</span> does not pay attention to what kind of work a particular client has.  It can be both official and unofficial. </li><li>  The company provides an opportunity to save on loans.  In what ways is this done?  We will talk about this a bit later. </li></ol><h2>  User friendly </h2><p>  For the convenience of users, the Honest Word microfinance organization has simplified the application process.  Upon first contact, customers are invited to fill out a questionnaire.  It consists of several sections: </p><ul><li>  basic user information; </li><li>  Email Confirmation </li><li>  indication of passport data; </li><li>  entering clarifying information; </li><li>  indication of the method of obtaining a loan. </li></ul><p>  The first section, judging by the reviews on the Honest Word, is very important.  When filling it out, the client registers on the site, receives a personal account, which in the future becomes a convenient tool in loan management.  It can extend the period of use of funds, make payments, repay debts. </p><p>  On the website of a microfinance organization, customers independently select the conditions.  They choose the amount of the loan, the period of use of funds.  An online calculator helps you make the right decision.  When specifying a specific amount and the desired period, an automatic calculation is made.  The amount of the returned amount is the result that the client sees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Loan Terms </h2><p>  The Honest Word company offers different conditions to new and regular customers.  People who apply to this microfinance organization for the first time can apply for from 3 thousand to 10 thousand rubles.  The interest rate for this category of customers is 2.1% per day. </p><p>  For regular customers conditions are offered more favorable and attractive.  Firstly, the limit is expanding.  The amount that can be provided increases to 30 thousand rubles.  The interest rate is reduced.  The most conscientious clients of a microfinance organization have it equal to 1%. </p><p>  Very often, the company "Honest Word" holds profitable and interesting promotions.  For example, in March 2017, for several days, customers were asked to issue a loan at 0%.  Promotions are never announced in advance.  In order to learn about them in a timely manner, it is recommended that you often go to a special news section on the official website of the MFI ‚ÄúHonest Word‚Äù. </p><h2>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof service </h2><p>  Clients using the services of a microfinance organization know that loans are provided promptly.

Methods of obtaining - transfer to a bank card or account.  However, not always people manage to get money right away.  There is no company fault in the delays.  Money transfer conditions are determined by banks.  Very often delays occur due to weekends and holidays. </p>

    <h2>  Loan repayment methods </h2><p>  It is convenient to cooperate with the Honest Word company, because there are no problems with the return of loans to customers.  To transfer money after the loan has ended, you can use one of the following methods: </p><ul><li>  transfer funds to the bank account of the company (its details are provided in the personal account for each user); </li><li>  pay by credit card (it must be personal, not belong to an unauthorized person); </li><li>  make a payment through the payment terminals "Eleksnet", Qiwi or use the wallet "Eleksnet". </li></ul><p>  For users who do not have money to repay and do not want to have a debt to MFI ‚ÄúHonest Word‚Äù, the company offers to use the loan extension service.  It is available if there are no long delays under the current contract (do not exceed 15 days).  The amount of renewal depends on the chosen term.  Its users can find out in their personal account. </p><h2>  Savings on loans provided </h2><p>  Often people believe that loans and credits are useful, but expensive services, because after the expiration of the term for using money, you need to return not the amount that was taken, but much more.  Fortunately, this is not typical of all microfinance organizations.  At Honest, customers can save. </p><p>  One way is early repayment of loans.  Interest is instantly recalculated.  When choosing this method of saving, only one thing needs to be taken into account - early repayment is possible only if it is planned to pay by credit card.  With other loan payment options, early repayment is not possible. </p><p>  Another way to save money is by participating in an affiliate program.  The company, as testimonials about the "Honest Word" testify, offers each user to attract his friends to the site.  If they get a loan, then the person who invited them will be awarded bonus points.  They can be saved and used to repay interest on the loan. </p>

    <h2>  Information for those who do not want or cannot return a loan </h2><p>  Borrowing someone else's money is easy, but it‚Äôs a pity to give it back or it doesn‚Äôt work out due to the difficult financial situation.  When applying for a loan, you need to remember that the return of borrowed funds is the responsibility of the borrower.  Its failure threatens with unpleasant consequences.  In case of default, the credit history is spoiled.  In the future, it will be difficult to get a loan at any microfinance organization or take a loan from a bank.  Long delays increase the probability of failure to 100%. </p><p>  If the loan taken at the MFI ‚ÄúHonest Word‚Äù cannot be repaid for a good reason, then the borrower is advised to notify the company as soon as possible.  The microfinance organization ‚ÄúHonest Word‚Äù can go forward.  Both parties are interested in finding a compromise, because nobody wants to bring the matter to court.  You can contact the organization by calling the Honest Word MFI, which is indicated on the official website. </p><h2>  Work with debtors </h2><p>  With people who do not fulfill their obligations, the company encounters very often.  How the MFI Honesty collects debts is a question that interests many.  First, the organization itself tries to reach out to the debtor - makes calls, sends letters to e-mail, sends SMS messages.  If a person does not respond to all these actions for a long period of time, the MFI transfers the debt to one of the collector agencies with which it cooperates (Credit Express, Ruscollector, Rusdolg, etc.). </p><p>  Collection agencies deal differently with debtors.  In most cases, collectors are rude, report sending an exit brigade to seize valuable items as debt, threaten to file an application for fraud, illegal loan.  Also, collectors call the numbers of third parties that were indicated on the questionnaire, require payment of a debt from them. </p>

    <h2>  Negative service reviews </h2><p>  In negative reviews, people complain about high percentages.  Consider the example inherent in the first design of a loan.  A person wants to get 5 thousand rubles for 20 days.  You will need to return 7 thousand 100 rubles.  At the second appeal, the total amount will already decrease.  To return will be 6 thousand 700 rubles. </p><p>  Even more you need to return when applying for a loan in the amount of 10 thousand rubles.  For a new client, the total amount is equal to 14 thousand 200 rubles, and for a user applying repeatedly to the company - 13 thousand 400 rubles. </p>
