Thanks to this attraction, we can realize almost all of our ideas.  Unique jewelry, flowers, animals - all this can be created from colorful beads.  Original little things created by talented hands, extremely decorate our surroundings.  For example, a product such as a star from beads looks great. <strong> </strong></p><p>  <strong>Bead star</strong> </p><p>  There are many options for weaving stars.  They can be anything - flat or three-dimensional, with a different number of rays.  One of the most universal methods of weaving stars, offered here, is good because a star from beads can be of any size and ornament - it all depends on your imagination! </p><p>  In order for a star from beads to be born from the hands of the master, he will need directly beads (the size of the beads does not matter), fishing line or wire.  You can choose a plain material to create a one-color star, or beads can be of several colors to create a pattern. </p><p>  First weave the basis for the beam.  We collect 4 beads on the fishing line and form a ring from them by threading the fishing line into the first bead with the ends from the opposite holes.  It should be a cross.  We fix one end of the fishing line.  The second we will work, and he will come out of the upper beam of the cross. </p><p>  Next, we begin to braid the resulting cross in this way: we put two beads on the fishing line and thread it into the right beam, then again we put two beads on, we pass into the lower beam.  Moving in a circle in this way, we complete the ring.  Now the figure will already look like a square. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to the same pattern, weave the remaining rows, adding and fixing the desired number of beads.  As a result, we get squares, there should be as many as there will be rays from the asterisk.  The larger the square, the larger the size of the bead star. </p><p>  Next, we need to connect the squares so that we get a star.  For convenience, we call the sides of each square (a, b, c, d in one square and a-1, b-1, s-1, d-1 in another).  We connect such parties: a and a-1, b and d-1.  The junction angle will be the first beam.  According to this scheme, we work with the rest of the squares and as a result we get a wonderful three-dimensional star from beads, which can be used as a pendant, brooch or decor element. </p><p>  <strong><span>Christmas star</span> made of beads</strong> </p><p>  This star will be on a wire basis and can serve as a wonderful New Year's decoration of the interior or Christmas tree toy.  The star will be six-pointed. </p><p>  For work, take a wire, one central bead (the hole should be wide), 12 large beads, different, 6 of the same color and size, 6 of the other, 6 beads of conical shape and beads.  Next, cut off 12 identical pieces of wire.  We pass each piece of wire into the hole of the central bead, bend it twice and fix it by turning the wire several times.  Evenly distribute the wire beams around the beads.  Now you need to string the beads on both ends of the folded wires, the amount of beads is determined independently.  In the end you need to put on a large bead. </p><p>  Thus we string 6 rays, skipping every second.  Now let‚Äôs deal with non-strung beams.  On each we put on one of the remaining six large beads and spread the ends to the side so that the letter V is obtained. String the beads on each end of the resulting letter and, when enough beads are strung, connect the adjacent ends together.  The rays of the star turned out. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Let us return to the inner rays of the star.  String the beads on double fibers until filled and connect to the end of the beam.  As a result, it turns out that each ray of the star consists of three strung wires.  On each beam we put on a conical bead.  The decoration is ready. </p><p>  <strong>Bead <span>starfish</span></strong> </p><p>  The asterisk is quite simple in execution, but has a great view.  For work, you need to take fishing line and beads of two types: different diameters and colors.  Getting started with larger beads.  We put 5 beads on the fishing line and form a ring.  This is the first row.  The second row weave in a circle, weaving one large bead between the beads located in the first row.  The third, next row, weave in this way, only weave two beads between the beads of the second row.  Starbursts formed.  We work in the same technique with the addition of small beads.  In the fourth row above the large beads there will be large ones, and between the rays weave one small bead, with each row the number of small beads increases, in the fifth row there are already two, then three.  We continue to work until the rays of the star consist of six pairs of large beads. </p><p>  Now weave the last row.  Small beads are put on the same way (in each successive row one more than in the previous one), and the large bead is strung alone, forming the sharp tip of each ray.  The first half of the star is ready. </p><p>  The second half weave the same way, without weaving only the last row.  We sew the halves together and the starfish is ready for use as a pendant or keychain. </p><p>  Here in such a simple way you can decorate your home! </p>
