Cuba is a unique country.  It is the largest island in the Caribbean.  Someone probably already knows the name of the capital.  Havana is a vibrant and colorful place for travelers. </p><p>  The city itself has a complex history, especially in the last hundred years.  But before Havana and Cuba made headlines, the cities were completely different when the Spaniards were there.  In particular, La Habana Vieja (Old Town), including the district as a whole and the fortifications inside, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982.  There are many interesting facts from what a tourist needs to know about Havana. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.virtuoso.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="colonial architecture of Havana" class="if uuid-3056009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3056009.jpg"></div><h2>  Hemingway lived here </h2><p>  The bibliophiles probably read, or at least heard of the ‚ÄúOld Man and the Sea‚Äù by Ernest Hemingway.  This book was based on his life experience in Cuba.  The legendary author lived near the capital of the country, Havana, in a city called Kokhimar.  Tourists can visit his estate, as well as places that Hemingway often visited, such as the Floridita Bar.  All in all, Havana is a great place for book lovers - and not just because of Hemingway‚Äôs heritage.  The city has an abundance of used book markets, especially in the Plaza de Armas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Limited internet access </h2><p>  Cuba had a difficult economic past, and although tourism certainly brings a lot of money, many travelers will pay attention to the fact that there are not enough certain amenities.  One of them is the Internet. </p><p>  While the situation is improving, visitors to the capital of Havana can only connect to the Network at their hotel, or by buying a Wi-Fi card on the street.  They can be quite expensive (from 1 to 10 dollars), and the connection leaves much to be desired.  In addition, several Internet cafes are located throughout the city, such as in the Capitolio Nation‚Äôs Capitol Building;  however, as a rule, it is too crowded there, and a free computer has to wait too long. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="capitol building" class="if uuid-3056012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3056012.jpg"></div><h2>  Great healthcare </h2><p>  Cuba may not have a great internet, but it does have first-class healthcare.  In this communist country, the health care system is the pride of the government.  Students from all over Latin America come here to study as doctors, and patients come for "medical tourism." </p><p>  However, sometimes there may be a shortage of medicines, so tourists from neighboring countries who are in a difficult situation often go to their embassies.  In most cases, people in need of emergency care are sent to the Cira Garc√≠a hospital, although many hotels have their own doctors.  Travelers must also get health insurance before traveling to Cuba. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="jenonajetplane.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="street in Havana" class="if uuid-3056007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3056007.jpg"></div><h2>  Two currencies </h2><p>  Money in Cuba is a little confusing.  There are two official currencies in the country, and those who visit Havana are likely to use both: </p><ul><li>  CUP is the local non-convertible peso, the currency used among Cubans.  Of course, tourists can also use CUP.  However, they may find that places that accept only this money are much cheaper. </li><li>  CUC is a formally tourist currency, and it is widespread in Havana.  This is a convertible peso related to the dollar.  For example, 25 CUCs are very close to 25 US dollars. </li></ul><p>  It may be difficult to find places that exchange US dollars, but contrary to popular belief, this is quite real.  Travelers should have enough cash to exchange with them, since credit and debit cards from other countries, as a rule, do not work here. </p><h2>  Rum and tobacco </h2><p>  The capital of Havana is known for its rum and tobacco.  In fact, the Bacardi family used to carry out operations here before leaving the country after the Cuban Revolution.  But rum production continued, and now the largest producer is the <span>Havana Club.</span>  This rum needs to be ordered in the restaurants of the capital. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  And what goes better with a glass of rum than a good Cuban cigar?  Tobacco in Cuba has a long history, and guests of Havana can learn a lot about it by visiting the Partagas cigar factory. </p><h2>  Havana and Habaneras </h2><p>  The inhabitants of Cuba are called Cubans, and the people from Havana are called "abanero" (Habaneros).  Locals are very friendly, funny, sincere, affectionate and loyal to their friends, family and community. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.airambulancecard.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="on the street in Havana" class="if uuid-3056011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3056011.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The capital of Cuba, Havana, is located along the magnificent deep-water bay with a sheltered harbor.  This made the city a great place for economic development from the colonial times of Spain at the beginning of the 16th century.  Cuba has a number of such harbors, but Havana on the north coast was valued by the early Spanish colonialists above others.  Here, several fortifications were built in the area that opposed most of the invaders.  In colonial times, the current capital of Cuba, Havana, was the first island refuge for the Spanish fleets arriving in the New World, and it became a bridgehead, firstly, for the conquestadors to conquer America, and secondly, for the economic and political domination of Spain in this hemisphere . </p><p>  The city early became a cosmopolitan center with extensive fortifications, cobblestone squares and houses with decorative facades and iron balconies.  Today's capital, Havana, mixes these structures with many modern buildings. </p><p>  The rich culture of the city included the influence of not only Spaniards from different regions of the Iberian Peninsula, but also other European peoples.  The small indigenous population of Cuba was not a significant factor in the Havana region; in any case, it was largely destroyed during early contacts with the Spaniards.  In the colonial years there was a large influx of black slaves from Africa, who, after the end of slavery in the late XIX century, began to flock to Havana.  The current capital of Liberty Island is a mixture of white descendants of the Spaniards, black ethnic groups, and mulattos. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cubatravelnetwork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old Havana" class="if uuid-3056008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3056008.jpg"></div><p>  The capital of the Republic of Cuba, Havana, has twin cities in many countries: these are Athens in Greece, Minsk in Belarus, Veracruz in Mexico, Cuzco in Peru, St. Petersburg and Moscow in Russia and many others. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The city extends mainly to the west and south of the bay, has three main ports: Marimelena, Guasabacoa and Atares.  The slow river Almendares crosses the city from south to north, flowing into the Strait of Florida a few miles west of the bay. </p><p>  The low hills on which the city lies, gradually rise from the deep blue waters of the straits.  A noteworthy altitude level is a 200-foot (60-meter) limestone ridge that rises from the east and reaches the heights of La Cabanha and El Morro, places of colonial fortifications overlooking the bay.  Another notable elevation is the hill in the west, which houses the University of Havana and Prince's Castle (a prison for political prisoners). </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Tourists often ask about the climate in the country and the capital Havana.  For the most part, Cuba has a pleasant year-round climate, which is due to the position of the island in the trade winds with warm sea currents.  Average temperatures range from 22 ¬∞ C in January and February to 28 ¬∞ C in August.  The temperature rarely drops below 10 ¬∞ C. The most abundant precipitation is observed in October, and the most insignificant - from February to April, on average 1167 mm of precipitation falls annually.  Sometimes hurricanes fly onto the island, but they usually sweep along the south coast, and the damage in Havana is usually less than anywhere else in the country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="foodfuntravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Havana Cathedral" class="if uuid-3056010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3056010.jpg"></div><h2>  View of the city </h2><p>  Walls and forts were built to protect the old city, but by the 19th century the capital of Havana had already gone beyond its original borders.  Its territory first expanded south and west.  Expansion to the east was facilitated later by the construction of a tunnel under the entrance to the bay;  thanks to this, suburbs such as Havana del Este could subsequently develop. </p><p>  Several wide avenues and boulevards extend throughout the city.  One of the most picturesque is Malecon, which extends southwest along the coast from the port entrance to the Almendares River, through which it passes through a tunnel overlooking on the other side in Miramar called Avenida Quinta.  Approximately parallel to Malecon in the Vedado area is Linea, another long avenue that runs under the river.  Other streets include Avenida del Puerto, Paseo Marti (or Prado), Avenida Menocal (Infanta) and Avenida Italy. </p><p>  Modern Havana, in fact, can be described as three cities in one: Old Havana, Vedado and new suburban areas.  Old Havana with its narrow streets and overhanging balconies is a traditional center of commerce, industry and entertainment, as well as a residential area.  It houses many historical buildings representing architectural styles from the 16th to the 19th centuries.  Covering about three square miles and surrounding the harbor, Old Havana includes Spanish colonial structures, high baroque churches and neoclassical buildings, as well as commercial real estate and less ornate houses on the outskirts. </p><p>  In the north and west there is a newer part located in the upper part of the city - Vedado.  She became a competitor to Old Havana in the field of commercial activity and nightlife.  This part of the city, built mainly in the 20th century, has attractive houses, tall apartments and offices along wide, tree-lined boulevards and avenues.  Central Havana is the main shopping area that lies between Vedado and Old Havana. </p><p>  The third part of the city is richer residential and industrial areas, located mainly in the west.  Among them is Marianao, one of the new parts of the city, built mainly in the 1920s.  To some extent, suburban exclusivity was lost after the revolution.  Many houses were expropriated by the Castro government as schools, hospitals, and government agencies.  Several private country clubs have been transformed into public entertainment centers. </p><p>  Since colonial times, Havana has been known for its parks and squares.  Locals gather day and night under the spreading trees of these many green areas.  In colonial times and almost until the end of the 19th century, the Plaza de Armas in Old Havana was the center of urban life.  Its most famous building, completed in 1793, is the Palace of Captain-Generals.  This is a richly decorated building that housed the Spanish colonial rulers, and since 1902, three Cuban presidents.  The building now houses a museum. </p><p>  Thanks to the beautiful architecture and sights, the photos of Havana always look attractive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.encirclephotos.com" data-author=": RICHARD F. EBERT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED, "><img itemprop="image" alt="the fortress of El Morro" class="if uuid-3056013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3056013.jpg"></div><h2>  Recovery </h2><p>  In the 1980s, many parts of Old Havana, including the Plaza de Armas, became part of the planned 35-year-old multi-million dollar restoration project.  The government sought to instill in Cubans an understanding of its past, as well as to make the capital more attractive to tourists. </p><p>  One of the first restored buildings was the Cathedral of Havana, the church of the patron saint of Havana, San Cristobal (St. Christopher).  It was built in the 18th century by order of the Jesuits.  Its artfully decorated facade, located near the promenade, is considered by art historians as one of the best examples of Italian Baroque in the world.  As a result of restoration work, the cathedral looks the same as after the construction. </p><p>  The Grand Plaza de la Revolucion, west of Old Havana, was the site of Fidel Castro‚Äôs main presidential speeches, which were delivered to crowds that included an estimated up to a million citizens.  There are impressive examples of city architecture in the square.  Around the towering monument to <span>Jose Marti,</span> Cuban independence leader, there are such modern structures as the National Government Center, the headquarters of the Communist Party of Cuba and the armed forces, as well as various ministries.  There are more traditional buildings in Central Havana, including the former Capitol with white domes, which now houses the Cuban Academy of Sciences;  Museum of the Revolution, located in the old Presidential Palace;  National Museum of Art. </p><p>  Another restoration project focused on old Spanish fortifications that towered above the harbor of Havana and for some time in the XVII and XVIII centuries made the city the most fortified in Spanish America.  The most famous and impressive of them is Morro Castle (Castillo del Morro), built in 1640.  It became the center of a network of forts defending Havana, and with the fortress of La Punta (Castillo de la Punta) dominated the actual entrance to the city. </p><p>  The construction of the oldest fortification, La Fuerza (Castillo de la Fuerza), was begun in 1565 and completed in 1583.  Earlier, in Plaza de Armas in 1538, an even older fort was built - Hernando de Soto. </p>
