In the vicinity it is called Little Sochi.  Perhaps this is due to the proximity to the famous resort.  The main feature of the village is an excellent beach line, which attracts many vacationers here.  Despite the small size of this place, during a beach holiday you can take a number of fascinating walks in interesting places.  The attractions of Loo are picturesque landscapes, natural monuments and architectural structures, both ancient and modern. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions loo" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/225462.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Before moving on to exploring these attractions, I want to say a little about the village.  The name of the resort is closely connected with the highland abazins.  This is mentioned by a 17th century Turkish traveler Celebi.  The word "loo" was formed from the name of the Abazin clan Lowe, who lived here in the 16-17th centuries.  A similar name was given to the river, which flows from the mountains towards the sea.  Due to the unique history of this place, there is something to see. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loo vacation 2013 attractions" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/225460.jpg" width="510"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is recommended to start sightseeing of Loo from the Byzantine temple, the ruins of which are located near the village at an altitude of 200 meters.  The construction was made of limestone in the 8-9th century.  Today you can see small fragments of it.  The best preserved northern part.  Judging by the remains, the temple was not very large - about ten by twenty meters.  The thickness of its walls was a little more than a meter.  This indicates that once this building served as a protective structure.  Three entrances to the temple were discovered.  During the excavation, fragments of windows made of greenish glass, several fragments with carved ornaments were found. </p><p>  Continuing to explore the sights of Loo, <strong><em></em></strong>  Pay attention to the Armenian Apostolic Church of St. Hovhannes, which was consecrated in 2006.  It will be interesting to visit the temple of the Apostle Simion Kananit, whose building began to be built in 2009.  Its main feature are two gilded domes.  In addition to the architectural structures that are of interest to tourists, Loo is famous for its unique natural places, the inspection of which will be no less interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loo photo attractions" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/225461.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  The sights of Loo can be supplemented with amazing places created by nature itself.  There are <span>33 waterfalls</span> in the <span>Shah River</span> Valley in the Dzhegosh Gorge <span>.</span>  Some of them are impossible to see for ordinary tourists due to inaccessibility.  But those 17 that you can see will bring a lot of pleasure.  Locals love to spend time at the fifth waterfall, as there is a small lake suitable for swimming.  The most popular is the Paradise pleasure waterfall formed by the Loo River.  To get to this place, you need to go through the suspension bridge.  On the way, you can go to the <span>open-air museum, the</span> inspection of which will allow you to get acquainted with household items of <span>Hamshen Armenians of the</span> 19th century.  Nearby is an old <span>water mill,</span> restored at the beginning of the 20th century.  It is impossible to know the beauty of these places without visiting Loo.  Photos, the sights on which are captured, do not fully convey the splendor and the spirit that can be felt while in this place. </p><p>  While relaxing in this village, guests are invited to enjoy the wooden tea houses built in the 70s of the last century.  Their initial purpose is to receive foreign guests.  Now in these buildings are various cafes.  Near these houses you can see tea plantations.  In the houses there are exhibition halls where collections of Russian handicraft art are presented. </p><p>  You can get tired of natural beauty.  Aqualoo Waterpark is a completely different entertainment for those who spend their holidays in Loo 2013. Attractions are perfectly combined with entertainment, such as, for example, the Aquatic diving center.  You can take a fascinating ride on horseback by visiting the equestrian tourist base Paradise Enjoyment.  And for fans of extreme sports there is an opportunity to ride from the mountain in a car with increased cross-country ability. </p>
