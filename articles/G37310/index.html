    <h2>  Who is it? </h2><p>  So, who is the waxwing, why is it called and what does this bird look like?  It is worth saying that this is the closest relative to the well-known sparrow, but having a much more beautiful plumage and bright appearance.  And the bird got its name because of a special singing, similar to a whistle: "Swi-ri-ri". </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Waxwings are small birds, up to about 20 cm, and weighing about 70 g. It will be very difficult to confuse this bird with another, because it has a beautiful crest on its head and a bright, memorable color.  The body color is predominantly gray-pink, but the wings are multi-colored, "painted".  Colors such as black, yellow, orange, white can be intertwined on them.  The crest of waxwings is also gray-pink, and there will be colored stripes on the tip of the tail.  There are three species of these birds.  And females and males are almost indistinguishable externally.  However, as usual, there are some nuances: there is a view where male waxwings are completely black and females are gray. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Place of residence </h2>

    <p>  Information on where the waxwing lives is interesting.  So, his main place of residence is the tundra and taiga of Eurasia.  However, these birds can also be found in North America.  They love coniferous forests more, but flocks can also be seen in mixed ones, where there are birch and spruce.  Many may be interested in the question: is the waxwing - a migratory bird or not?  But the exact answer is difficult to give.  She is neither migratory nor settled.  But you can definitely call her nomadic.  It is during the movements that scientists study it, when birds do not fly from place to place, they lead a very secretive lifestyle, and it is almost impossible to observe them.  Having figured out the waxwings - migratory or not, it‚Äôs also worth saying that they prefer colder places to hot ones, so if they fly away, then not in warm places, but in cool areas. </p><h2>  About life </h2><p>  Having understood that the waxwing is a migratory bird or not, it is worth mentioning how the life of these birds is arranged.  So, they begin to twist their nests in early spring, but they use soft feathers rather than solid branches for litter.  It is here that the female will incubate eggs, and the male will carefully feed her offspring.  In winter, these birds feed mainly on berries, especially like mountain ash, barberry, mistletoe, raspberry, wild rose (most <span>berry bushes).</span>  As for the summer period, at this time waxwings eat the shoots of young animals, seeds, ripened berries.  It will be interesting that with their small beak on the fly these birds can capture small midges, mosquitoes and even small butterflies.  As for nutrition, waxwings eat a lot, trying to fill their stomach with any food as much as possible.  The place of their feasting is easy to find, because under the branches of trees you can always find incompletely digested berries.  However, this has its own benefit, so the birds spread the young, scattering seeds in the area where they live. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="waxwing migratory birds or not" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/416258.jpg" width="426"></div></h2><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Having figured out the waxwing - a migratory bird or not, it is also worth telling some funny facts about them.  So, the behavior of these birds in the autumn period is entertaining.  This is due to the fact that at this time the berries begin to ferment a little, and the gluttonous waxwings, after eating such fruits, feel something similar to intoxication.  However, this does not always seem cheerful, because in this state the birds often break into various obstacles that appear in their way.  Birds experience the same condition in spring when they drink fermented maple juice.  As for winter, there is another danger: waxwings can eat frozen berries and fall under the trees in a frozen state.  After some time, the bird may move away, but often this also ends with the death of the birds.  The period of mating games at waxwings is not associated with dancing, but with food.  So, the male, as a sign of favor, will carry berries to his lady, later helping to feed, but not hatch offspring. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="waxwing migratory or not" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/416259.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Enemies </h2><p>  The first enemies of these birds are martens and squirrels, which eat not only eggs, but also just hatched chicks.  Of the birds, owls, hawks, and even crows are dangerous for waxwings.  Having understood, the waxwing is a migratory bird or not, people try to feed these handsome men.  As for communication, these birds are reluctant to contact people, but with great desire they fly to various feeders, which are hung in parks and other places of rest. </p>
