Thousands of tourists from all over the world come here to experience the unique atmosphere of Italy, taste the local cuisine, as well as enjoy extraordinary views.  Padua is surrounded by beautiful nature that impresses almost every traveler. </p><p>  In this city, culture lovers will definitely be able to occupy themselves, especially the Renaissance.  As you know, the greatest masters worked on most cities in Italy, and this settlement is no exception.  For example, the Skrovegni chapel is decorated with the works of the famous Giotto.  In addition, the University of Padua is a classic example of the Renaissance style. </p><p>  Of course, active travelers will be very interesting in Padua.  Cycling routes are quite popular in this place and most tourists move in this way. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Like most cities in Italy, Padova boasts a fairly impressive number of attractions.  We decided to make the top 10 of the best of them.  Each of them is steeped in history, so if possible, you should definitely visit these places.  Of course, most of the presented attractions of Padua to explore on their own is easier than ever. </p><h2>  Palazzo della Rajone </h2><div class="photo" data-original="padovacultura.padovanet.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Padua Palazzo della Rajone" class="if uuid-2468680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2468680.jpg"></div><p>  In the medieval years, the Palazzo della Rajone served as the courtroom of the city court.  It is still one of the largest in Europe.  It may seem to many that the purpose of the hall is quite unusual for the social structure of the northern territory of the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As you know, the palace is located on the Padua market.  He divides it into the Square of Herbs, as well as the Square of Fruits. </p><p>  The construction of the building took place in the twelfth as well as thirteenth centuries.  Initially, the walls of the hall were decorated with frescoes, on which astrology was the main theme.  Unfortunately, these frescoes burned down in the fire of 1420, but were restored after several decades. </p><p>  The facade of the palazzo is surrounded by long arched galleries.  Nowadays, they have restaurants, bars, and shops. </p><p>  Inside the palace is stored a very valuable attraction for the region - the Stone of dishonor.  In medieval times, debtors repented of it. </p><h2>  Prato della Valle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Landmark of Padua" class="if uuid-2468702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2468702.jpg"></div><p>  The square is located in the southern part of the historic center of Padua.  In addition, it is worth noting that this particular territory has the largest area in Italy. </p><p>  This attraction of Padua in Italy is known for its original layout.  It includes an elliptical channel located in the central part of the square.  There is also a bridge over the canal and a double row of statues by prominent citizens of the region.  They were created between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In Roman time, the imperial theater with a capacity of more than six thousand people was located on the site of the modern square.  As is known from history, the name of the theater was Zairo.  Arena ruins were discovered in the area in the eighteenth century, and they remained here until the nineteenth century.  Later, all these residues were used to build nearby facilities. </p><p>  In 1775, the square was completely rebuilt under the guidance of the famous architect Domenico Cerato. </p><h2>  University of Padua </h2><div class="photo" data-original="robinfretwellwilson.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="University of Padova" class="if uuid-2468669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2468669.jpg"></div><p>  It is considered one of the oldest universities in Italy, as well as throughout Europe.  It was opened in this city in 1222.  It is the main educational institution of the Republic of Venice. </p><p>  The university was founded by students as well as teachers of the Bologna educational institution.  They left this place due to the fact that they had a conflict with the university authorities. </p><p>  In the Middle Ages, people from all over Europe studied at this institute.  The University of Padua became a true center of science in the Renaissance.  Many different disciplines have been studied here.  For example, astronomy, dietetics, medicine and much more. </p><p>  In modern times, the university has a lot of freedom.  All this was regulated in 1995 by the charter.  Today, the institute has about sixty thousand students and thirteen completely different faculties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is also worth noting that the university has a botanical garden, which is also a attraction of Padua.  Many students, citizens, as well as tourists like to walk along it.  It was created in 1545 and in modern times it claims to be one of the oldest in all of Europe. </p><h2>  Basilica of St. Justina </h2><p>  Another very popular place in Padua.  This Catholic church is located in the southeastern part of Prato della Valle. </p><p>  The very first church on this site was built in the sixth century on the grave of the martyr Justina of Padua.  The church was rebuilt many times, and the erection of a modern building began in the sixteenth century, and completed in the seventeenth. </p><p>  It is also worth saying that the renaissance is the dominant style in the architecture of this basilica.  As you know, many structures in Italy were built in this form.  Of course, the features of Byzantine architecture are also noticeable here. </p><p>  The interior of the premises began to be created here in the sixteenth century.  The church in modern times is one of the largest and oldest in all of Europe. </p><p>  Initially, the basilica served as the monastery church.  in 1810 this monastery was closed by the famous French commander Napoleon Bonaparte.  It was discovered only a century later.  After the war, the state library was located here. </p><h2>  Padua Cathedral </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.zainoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral" class="if uuid-2468724" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2468724.jpg"></div><p>  The cathedral is considered Catholic, consecrated in the name of the Assumption of the Virgin.  In modern times it has the status of a "small basilica".  In addition to the main building, the church has a baltistery built in the twelfth century.  It preserved frescoes of the medieval period. </p><p>  The building that we can see now is considered the third cathedral building in this place.  The very first building was built in the fourteenth century, after the edict of Milan was published (a letter from the emperor Constantine, as well as Licinius).  It came under destruction at the beginning of the twelfth century.  The next building was built in the Romanesque style.  What this building looked like can be seen on the frescoes of an Italian artist whose works are in the Baptistery.  The modern building was built in the Middle Ages under the leadership of the great Michelangelo.  Work on this structure has been conducted for more than two centuries. </p><h2>  Villa Contarini </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.collieuganei.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Villa Contarini" class="if uuid-2468712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2468712.jpg"></div><p>  This is a famous country estate located in the commune of Piazzola sul Brenta near the Brenta River. </p><p>  The central building of the villa began to be built in 1546.  The customers were the Venetian patricians - the brothers Paolo and Francesco Contarini.  The names of the architects are quite accurately documented.  It is assumed that the very first building was designed by the great Italian architect - Andrea Palladio.  The expansion of the territory during the Baroque era was watched by such famous people as Vincenzo Scamozzi, as well as Baldassere Longena. </p><p>  This place attracts many tourists due to the fact that it is surrounded by a very picturesque park.  Its area is more than forty hectares.  There are fishing facilities, lakes, alleys. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden </h2><p>  The famous botanical garden is another attractive attraction in Padua.  Reviews about this place are great.  As mentioned above, it is located near the University of Padua. </p><p>  It is known that the first project was developed by Daniel Barbaro.  From the very beginning this place was surrounded by a wall, so the garden was protected from attack by robbers. </p><p>  For such a large period of existence, the garden has been repeatedly improved.  The main buildings in it were built in the seventeenth as well as eighteenth centuries.  In addition, decorative changes took place during the same period.  For example, a small fountain was placed near the botanical garden.  Also, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, several greenhouses were updated, and a theater was also built for students and teachers from the University of Padua. </p><p>  It is also worth noting the fact that this attraction is one of the World Heritage sites and is protected by UNESCO. </p><p>  Admission for adults costs about four euros at the moment, and for a child one euro. </p><h2>  Euganean Hills Regional Park </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.salusterme.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park in the city of Padova" class="if uuid-2468711" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2468711.jpg"></div><p>  This place is considered a natural park, in the territory of which the famous resorts are located.  It extends over the rolling hills of volcanic origin.  Its area is more than nineteen thousand hectares.  You can visit it by car, bike, or walk. </p><p>  Euganean hills are also considered an islet of natural nature.  It is protected, and also has the status of a nature reserve park with very rich as well as diverse vegetation.  For example, here you can enjoy the very generous gifts of the earth at almost any time of the year.  There are cherries, strawberries, blackberries and more. </p><p>  Many wealthy citizens have their own residences or their own country villas.  It is in this place that you can have a great time. </p><p>  The Euganean hills will captivate people with their charm.  There are magnificent gardens, as well as landscape gardening. </p><h2>  Scrovegni Chapel </h2><p>  Another very popular attraction in Padua.  This chapel is dedicated to the Mother of God.  And originally its official name was the Church of St. Mary of Mercy.  The first stone was laid in 1300.  Lighted the chapel in 1303.  In subsequent years, this date became the main holiday for this place. </p><p>  In addition, behind the modest walls of this building hides the greatest achievement of mankind.  Here are the frescoes of the great Giotto di Bond.  They are considered a great asset of Western Europe.  Most of the walls are occupied by images of the Doomsday fresco.  The rest of the building is painted with stories related to the Nativity of Christ. </p><h2>  San Giorgio Chapel </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.luoghigiottoitalia.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chapel in Padua" class="if uuid-2468709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2468709.jpg"></div><p>  There are many great reviews about this Padua city attraction.  Many Russian tourists enjoy visiting this place, as it is saturated with history. </p><p>  This chapel is dedicated to the great martyr George.  The construction is considered an extension to the <span>Basilica of St.</span> Anthony.  It was built by order of the Marquis Raimondino Lupi di Soranha in the fourteenth century.  Previously, it was used as a family tomb. </p><p>  On the walls of such a popular attraction of Padua (Italy) there are more than twenty large compositions, as well as one hundred small ones.  Basically, all the frescoes are dedicated to the life of St. George, St. Lucia, as well as Catherine of Alexandria. </p><h2>  Padua attractions in one day </h2><p>  Russian tourists come to Padua not so often, or just for one day, travel.  For this reason, I would like to list the attractions of the city of Padua (Italy), which are worth seeing in the first place.  First you should take a walk to the University of Padua, you can visit the Botanical Garden, as well as the Palazzo della Rajone.  To see the sights of Padua on your own is very easy and simple, because the city is small.  We wish you good luck traveling. </p>
