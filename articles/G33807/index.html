    <p>  Peru is not the only country where geoglyphs have been found.  For example, the white horse was the most repeated, and, therefore, favorite plot of the ancient peoples inhabiting the territory of modern Great Britain.  But at least this is a recognizable animal, which was sacred to people of that time or something personified. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Andean candelabrum, on the other hand, became an example of the importance attached to it depending on the thinking or religion of the people who saw it.  So, the Spaniards, who conquered Peru, perceived it as the Holy Trinity, depicted in the form of three crosses, and to the sailors it resembled a constellation or an ancient lighthouse.  However, the same thing happens with most geoglyphs on the planet.  Not knowing the true purpose of an object or phenomenon, the human mind tries to squeeze it into the framework of its perception of the world. </p><h2>  Mysterious object location </h2><p>  For some reason, it so happened that a lot is written about objects in Peru, they are studied and even defended their dissertations.  In fact, there are many geoglyphs on the planet, far exceeding Peruvian ones both in age and in the number of images. </p><p>  But apparently, interest is always higher in what they ponder over for a long time and to no avail (for example, an unfinished chess game or an unproven theorem).  There is no exception here and the Andean candelabrum.  Where this object is located is easy to determine - on the Paracas Peninsula, a 6-hour drive from Lima.  The small crescent-shaped mountain that rises here has become the site of the work of unknown ancient "graffiti artists."  It can be seen either from the water, or from a bird's eye view.  If we analyze all the geoglyphs found on the planet, we can see that most of them have some similarities in the execution technique. </p><p>  For example, the ‚Äúlong man‚Äù in Sussex and the drawings in Peru were made, although at different times, but clearly the descendants of the same talented artists suffering from gigantomania. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  If this is so, then it seems that they were either fulfilling someone else's task - to put the necessary drawing at a certain time, or were wandering creative natures, which is unlikely. </p><p>  It is often common for people to attribute to objects and phenomena the properties that they themselves invent.  For example, some of them believe that the Andean candelabrum (Peru) points to the drawings of Nazca, although this is not entirely true. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Scientists date this object 200 BC.  e., and if everyone more or less agrees with this fact, then its purpose remains a mystery.  The giant trident, as the local population calls it, has two branches in the form of candles with spirals, while the third candle grows directly from its base. </p>

    <p>  The length of the object is about 180 m, which suggests that it took a very long time to create it and some special tools, otherwise it would not have been so well preserved to this day.  The Andean candelabrum, the description of which is proposed in this article, looks attractive, but quite trivial.  Little tridents in the world, Neptune had the same thing.  Ordinary people and scientists were always more concerned with the question of not ‚Äúhow,‚Äù but ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù </p><h2>  Appointment </h2><p>  When this question is raised, there may be hundreds of answers, we offer you the most intelligible, for example: </p><ul><li>  it is a lighthouse, since it is visible from the water, but not visible from the shore - of course, the version is so-so, because no evidence was found that lights were lit in it; </li><li>  Andean candelabrum is a navigator for a spaceship, indicating the direction to the cosmodrome in Nazca (there are simply no words, but what if it is true!); </li><li>  it is a lightning rod, since the trident is a symbol of the creator god Viracocha; </li><li>  it is a taboo sign, since there are pyramids and burials with mummies on the peninsula, which were usually buried with jewelry; </li><li>  Another version is that it is a navigator, but on it, under <span>the Nazca plateau,</span> there is still not found Inca gold or an entire acropolis full of dead people and treasures. </li></ul><p>  Maria Reiche, who has been studying the Nazca and Andean candelabra geoglyphs all her life (you can see the photo of the scientist below), was able to only determine that some of the drawings coincide with the constellations, for example, the spider's paws and its head repeat the location of Orion. </p>

    <p>  There is a version that these drawings were not left by human civilization.  Judging by the fact that humanity itself does not know what it was created for anything, it is possible that a similar conclusion is the most correct.  Maybe these images indicate the path that distant space travelers have taken, and through which constellations they had to come to us.  And the figures are clearly not people on the plateau in Nazca may well be aliens self-portraits. </p><p>  Whatever it was, perhaps humanity still has a chance to uncover the cause of the emergence of geoglyphs, which are so clearly visible from space. </p><h2>  Nazca geoglyphs </h2><p>  The Andean candelabrum and Nazca drawings differ in execution technique, which suggests that there were at least 2 ancient cultures that created them.  In the desert to date, 30 drawings and 788 lines and geometric shapes have been discovered. </p>

    <p>  The trident on the peninsula is presented in a single copy, and since a pottery workshop of the same time as the drawing was found nearby, it can be assumed that this is the creation of the hands of the inhabitants of ancient Paracas. </p><h2>  Nazca Technique </h2><p>  Shallow trenches (30 cm) with a width of 50 to 150 cm are characteristic of the Nazca geoglyphs, while in the candelabra they are deeper and wider.  Some scholars believe that the Andean candelabrum, whose history is somewhat younger than that of a figure on a plateau, is the successor to an older fellow. </p><p>  It is amazing how the ancient Incas were able to draw straight lines with a length of 500 km¬≤ in the earth's crust?  After all, even modern equipment allows you to make an even trench for no more than 10 km without deviations from the course.  Many drawings are striking in their scale, and again the question involuntarily arises: how could all the lines be connected to make a 285-meter pelican or an 188-meter lizard? </p><p>  Either these artists had a special vision of three-dimensional space, or their tools were more perfect than modern ones. </p><h2>  Paracas Peninsula Object </h2><p>  The Andean candelabrum, whose technique is simpler, is made in a different style, although it can be assumed that the performers were familiar with the drawings on the plateau in Nazca. </p>

Either there will be those who know why this was done, or people will find instructions for use.  We will wait and hope that either one or the other will happen during our lifetime, but for now, scientists are creating new versions and making films about the secrets of the Earth and the Universe. </p>
