    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  <span>Check-out time</span> at the Riviera Blue 4 * hotel - at 14:00.  Do not hope that holidaymakers arriving at 7 in the morning will be settled.  All that the hotel staff can offer is to leave things in the luggage room and spend time until checking into a room on the beach. </p><p>  Of course, when it comes to vacationing with children, I want to rely on some concessions, but this hotel is unlikely to meet you.  That is why it is necessary to immediately tune in to check in at 14:00.  In this case, you will not be upset or upset.  Moreover, some vacationers complain that even at 14:00 indicated they did not receive the room keys.  The hotel staff reacts to complaints and complaints, to put it mildly, with indifference.  Not the most pleasant start to a holiday, which can spoil the whole idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The room fund of the Riviera Blue 4 * hotel (Sunny Beach) is represented by 37 rooms located on several floors.  If you believe the description presented on most tourist portals, each room has air conditioning, satellite TV, refrigerator, minibar, private bathroom with all necessary bath accessories and a spacious terrace. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Now about how things really are in the hotel Riviera Blue 4 *.  Reviews of tourists are mostly negative, which affected its rating on the most famous and popular tourist portals.  The rooms are clearly in need of repair: some in cosmetic, others in major.  Vacationers complain about the disgusting state of furniture: shelves in the cabinets are broken, there are no hangers, in some rooms the doors simply do not open.  The condition of the plumbing is the most rosy: after taking water procedures, a huge puddle is going on the floor, in some rooms there is no door or even a curtain to prevent the spread of spray.  Mattresses and bedding are not new, sometimes tourists complain about old stubborn stains.  Bath towels are better to take with you, especially if you are squeamish. </p><p>  In the heat, the air conditioner does not cope with its responsibilities.  In some rooms, his work is accompanied by disgusting and annoying sounds, so tourists completely refuse him. </p><h2>  Room service </h2><p>  Of course, given the condition of the rooms, it‚Äôs stupid to count on not perfect service.  Do not wait for daily room cleaning and towel changes.  Tourists complain about dirt, dust and even cobwebs.  In the best case, the staff of the Riviera Blue 4 * hotel (Sunny Beach), again, if you swear and scandal, will pick up your number once for the entire stay.  The cleaning is superficial. </p><p>  If you cannot live in the midst of dirt and dust, you have to arm yourself with a broom and a mop and clean up your room. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  If you stay at the Riviera Blue 4 * hotel (Bulgaria), you can use the 24-hour reception services, as well as free secure parking.  If you decide to rent a car on vacation, the availability of a parking space will be a nice bonus. </p><p>  On the territory of the Riviera Blue 4 * hotel (Sunny Beach) there is a good souvenir shop where you can buy souvenirs for relatives and friends. </p><h2>  Entertainment on site </h2><p>  By the amount of entertainment, the Riviera Blue 4 * hotel is unlikely to be able to get around.  All guests and vacationers will be able to visit a good gym, if even on vacation they are not ready to say goodbye to physical activity.  You can relax in the sauna with a jacuzzi, a swimming pool and an excellent massage room.  Moreover, there is an excellent billiard room open to all visitors.  The pool is large enough, equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas, the use of which is free for hotel visitors.  True, vacationers prefer the sea to him. </p>

    <p>  This option often attracts vacationers with children, because all the necessary conditions are created here: a children's pool with rides and slides, as well as an excellent playground. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Riviera Blue 4 * offers buffet meals in its own restaurant.  All vacationers expect a 4 * hotel to offer a wide variety and impeccable quality of food.  But in reality, everything is not so rosy: no variety, stale products, even seasonal fruits and vegetables do not inspire confidence.  Milk is not fresh, mashed potatoes are powders diluted with hot water, meat products cause a lot of doubts.  That is why, if possible, it is better to refuse food and eat in local cafes and restaurants - there are plenty of them. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Perhaps the only thing that guests of the Riviera Blue 4 * hotel can count on is an excellent beach.  It is municipal, but, like all the <span>beaches of Bulgaria,</span> clean and well-maintained fine sand, gentle entry into the water, crystal clear sea water - something that will appeal to all lovers of beach holidays.  The sea is so clear that sometimes vacationers observe huge jellyfish. </p>

    <p>  There are all conditions for relaxing with young children.  Even 5 meters offshore, quite shallow.  The beach is equipped with rescue towers, along the coast there are many cafes and bars: you can always buy fresh fruits, soft drinks and ice cream.  As for the rescue towers and rescuers themselves: they really monitor the safety of the water, instruct vacationers, especially with young children.  Yes, many tourists who come here for the first time are sincerely surprised that rescuers forbid not only swimming for buoys, but also swimming on inflatable circles and mattresses. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Of course, as soon as you get acquainted with the reviews of real vacationers, you will understand that the Riviera Blue 4 * hotel (Bulgaria, Sunny Beach) does not exactly correspond to its declared category.  This hotel has already spoiled the holidays for many, and it is difficult to call it budget.  That is why if you, as a tourist, are counting on good living conditions, attentive staff, or are planning a vacation with young children, and therefore quite demanding on food, it is better to pay attention to another option.  Moreover, hotels and hotels in Sunny Beach are enough: there are many more worthy options.  If you got this option very inexpensively, you got a real opportunity to go to the sea, be prepared for the fact that you will return to the hotel only at night!  We wish you a pleasant stay! </p>
