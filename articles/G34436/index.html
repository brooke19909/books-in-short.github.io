Especially many tourists visited this country after watching the movie "Lord of the Rings".  This is due to the fact that it showed simply stunning landscapes of New Zealand and its attractions. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Holidays in New Zealand is quite an expensive pleasure.  And even if tourists want to save money on travel agencies and hit the road on their own, you won‚Äôt be able to save a lot, because the flight is very expensive in cost. </p><p>  Very rarely tourists from Russia come here with children, because not everyone can fly at 26 hours. </p><p>  Holidays in New Zealand is famous for its safety.  This country is one of the leading places in the world with the lowest crime rates. </p><p>  As well as residents and the government strictly monitor the environmental components in all sectors.  For example, water here can be drunk directly from the tap.  Its inhabitants do not even pass through filters. </p><p>  Smokers vacation in New Zealand will be a little test.  It is very expensive cigarettes and smoking in public places is strictly prohibited, otherwise you will have to pay a huge fine.  For these purposes, you will have to look for specialized places. </p><p>  The use of credit cards is very developed in the country, therefore, cash is used in very small quantities.  Even in a small souvenir shop there is a special terminal for payment by card. </p><h2>  Auckland </h2><p>  This city is the largest in the country.  The population in it is 1.2 million people.  Auckland is built on sleeping volcanoes.  The city has all the offices of large corporations in the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Auckland has over 1,000 varied restaurants and cafes.  Sometimes it seems that locals do not cook at home.  Many of them eat in such establishments.  This nuance also indicates the good financial opportunities of residents and the economy of New Zealand as a whole. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.britannica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation in new zealand Price" class="if uuid-2641118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43974/2641118.jpg"></div><p>  As for architecture, a clear focus is not observed.  The buildings are built in different styles.  There are a lot of huge tall skyscrapers.  Therefore, Auckland is also called the "City of Sails." </p><p>  In the village there are many attractions that should be visited by absolutely all tourists. </p><ol><li>  Kelly Tarleton's Underwater World is a unique place where tourists travel through a long tunnel underwater.  Here you can "from the inside" admire the inhabitants of the seas and oceans.  The meeting with the Antarctic pavilion recently opened in the same building.  In it you can get acquainted with this area and meet with its inhabitants. </li><li>  The bay of islands is located 260 km from the city in a northerly direction.  On the way to it you can see huge relict trees.  Once upon a time, they grew throughout the area and created whole forests.  Directly in the bay cruises to the most beautiful corners.  Delicious dinners are served on the ship. </li><li>  The sky tower is a huge television tower.  At the top, a restaurant revolves around its axis, where you can have a delicious dinner and enjoy the beauties of the city from a bird's eye view. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.newzealand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New Zealand vacation prices with flights" class="if uuid-2641124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43974/2641124.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to these places, a regular walk through the streets of Auckland will leave many positive impressions for every tourist. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Accommodation in Auckland </h2><p>  The city has more than 150 hotels of various classes.  Here you can stay in expensive hotels with whole water parks and other services.  And also it‚Äôs really possible to book a hostel with good living conditions at a relatively affordable cost by the standards of the city. </p><p>  The average cost per day in a hotel with three stars will be $ 35-40, and in a five-star hotel - at least 65. It will be more affordable to search for an apartment in advance - via the Internet.  This housing option will cost an average of 20 to 40 dollars. </p><p>  And you should be prepared for the fact that in Auckland it is not the tenants who choose the apartments, but the owners - their future customers.  Thus, if for some reason you did not inspire confidence in the tenants, then the service will be denied. </p><h2>  Wellington </h2><p>  The first thing that impresses tourists in the capital is excessive politeness to absolutely everyone.  If a tourist approaches a local resident with a question, they will not only be prompted, but also, if necessary, taken to the necessary place. </p><p>  Citizens are very careful about their health.  They travel around Wellington on bicycles.  In the morning you can meet a large number of people who make jogging. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stuff.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beach holidays in New Zealand" class="if uuid-2641126" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43974/2641126.jpg"></div><p>  There are a lot of food markets in the city.  Residents of the capital acquire almost everything in them.  In this city, more adhere to the traditions of home food. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The first place to visit is the Botanical Garden.  The tour starts with a funicular ride.  The painting, which opens from a height, is simply mesmerizing.  You can ride a ferry in the garden and take a trip to the South Island. </p><h2>  Rotorua </h2><p>  This city, despite its not very large size, is considered the tourist center of the country.  The village is located on the lake with the same name. </p><p>  Rotorua is a 3-hour drive from Auckland.  Often, tourists come there for only a few hours, but it is better to stay for 2-3 days to feel the whole atmosphere and traditions of the country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.switchbacktravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New Zealand vacation cost" class="if uuid-2641132" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43974/2641132.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth visiting the village and the thermal park.  The largest geyser operates in the southern hemisphere.  In this area there live birds that cannot fly, - kiwi.  They are also a <span>symbol of New Zealand.</span> </p><p>  Several geysers immediately take out hot water and steam.  It envelops the nearby small villages, and they look very ominously from the side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rotoruanz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New Zealand Holiday Season" class="if uuid-2641134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43974/2641134.jpg"></div><p>  The thermal park contains several lakes with hot water.  Landscapes are simply mesmerizing with their beauty.  Huge ferns grow near the water.  And from large cracks in the earth dense steam comes out.  Hotels have been built on the shores of the lakes, in which there are always many vacationers. </p><h2>  Blue and green lake </h2><p>  These ponds are called Waimangu.  They got this color due to the unusual composition of the earth, which is located under and near the water column.  And also because of the springs, whose water flows through volcanic rocks. </p><p>  The slopes also have a different color.  Sulfur colors them in yellow, and iron in red.  You just need to look at the entrance to the Karapiti steam cave.  Hot steam escapes from it with a strong roar and splashes of water fly out. </p><p>  To make the excursions more interesting and eventful, it is better to join a group with a guide.  He will be able to show places that are difficult to find on their own. </p><h2>  Ski vacation </h2><p>  The most popular place for active pastime is the resort of Fakapapa.  There are 40 tracks of varying complexity.  The resort has 20 lifts.  In Fakapapa (New Zealand), the holiday season begins in June and ends around November. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.powderhounds.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New Zealand vacation cost and photo" class="if uuid-2641138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43974/2641138.jpg"></div><p>  In the resort town there are many hotels, restaurants, cafes and souvenir shops.  There you can also enjoy magnificent landscapes. </p><p>  The country has several more ski resorts: </p><ol><li>  Turoa. </li><li>  Temple Bassin Ski Field. </li><li>  Small ski stations. </li></ol><p>  All have modern lifts and high-quality slopes, as well as well-developed infrastructure. </p><h2>  Extreme vacation in New Zealand </h2><p>  Amusement parks are very developed in the country.  It contains almost all the possible entertainment for adults.  To feel the huge adrenaline rush, you should use kayaking and rafting.  And also just need to take a jump - bungee. </p><p>  Fans of speed and dizzy sensations can try zorbing.  You can still take a small trip on a raft on a fast river.  You will be thrown over from side to side, thrown over the waves, you will have to make a lot of efforts to get out of the water dry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holidaysmith.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in New Zealand" class="if uuid-2641141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43974/2641141.jpg"></div><p>  Height lovers can fly on a small paraglider with an open cockpit.  The feeling of freedom and space from this is amplified several times.  Prices for holidays in New Zealand are quite high.  But the feelings from him will remain with the tourist throughout his life. </p><p>  The cost of rest in New Zealand will cost the extreme about $ 30-50.  And this is just for one entertainment. </p><h2>  New Zealand Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  On the Internet there are quite a lot of comments about traveling to this country.  Basically, all vacationers return from there with unforgettable experiences. </p><p>  Vacationers note that the streets are very clean.  Residents of cities are friendly and attentive to tourists.  Even in a hotel with 3 stars, the level of comfort is incomparable with the European. </p><p>  Tourists are amazed at the beauty of the beaches.  They indicate that in the hours when the storm rises, the picture is simply mesmerizing.  In season, lemons and bright orange oranges grow in the country right on the streets. </p><p>  There is no need to worry about nutrition in New Zealand.  In small cafes you can have a hearty lunch for only 8 local dollars.  Beach holidays in New Zealand are not very common.  Residents, basically, do not sunbathe because of the ozone hole, which is located directly above the country.  People are afraid of radiation.  But given the average life expectancy of 85 years, the hole is a strong exaggeration. </p><p>  The main negative reviews relate to the cost of tours.  A minimum vacation with a flight to New Zealand (price for one) will cost a tourist $ 3,000.  The price is very tangible for a person with an average income.  Many tourists raise funds for the tour for several years. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, holiday prices in New Zealand are ‚Äúbiting,‚Äù but the feeling after the trip remains just wonderful. </p>
