  <section class="page js-page"><h1>All Inclusive Greece Hotels: Holidays of Different Categories</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Holidays in Greece - endless summer, gentle sun and generous <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãwaves.</span>  This country is a small corner of paradise, excellent conditions for relaxation in which are created by the Ionian, Aegean and Mediterranean seas.  It is here that you can spend your holidays as varied and comprehensive as possible, taking a great rest in medical, skiing, beach, sightseeing, or any other that gives tourists a lot of positive emotions and the most pleasant memories in life.  The country of ancient myths and legends awaits guests all year round, offering them all the best - the generosity of Dionysus and Demeter, the secrets of the great Zeus, the entertainments of Aphrodite, Athena and Hermes, as well as the opportunity to touch the secrets of one of the oldest civilizations in the world - which is especially interesting if, as Greece Zakynthos hotels selected. </p><p>  In addition, you can choose any place to relax here - the possessions of the legendary <span>king Minos</span> and Minotaur, the birthplace and training of Cyril and Methodius, the city in which the <span>first Olympic Games</span> were held <span>.</span>  Tourists will be able to conveniently stay in hotels and hotels operating on an all-inclusive basis anywhere in the country, which will make spending time here especially comfortable.  All-inclusive hotels in Greece are located in Athens, Thessaloniki and other large cities, on resort islands, where our compatriots most often like to relax. </p><p>  When choosing which hotel to stay in, it is worth remembering that all such institutions are classified in Greece according to the international (traditional) ‚Äúfive-star‚Äù system, but in some places you can also find the old classification, which was used earlier and based on the letter system (A, B , C and De Luxe).  Category A, according to European standards, means 4-5 * quality - accommodation, services and a high level of service, reasonable prices.  All-inclusive hotels in Greece of category B are 3-4 * quality, which means even more reasonable prices and a good standard set of services.  Category C - a budget option, 2-3 *, intended mainly for families or friendly numerous companies.  Most often, such places - the so-called youth hotels of Greece - are located on the islands, in the central parts of the resort regions, that is, in the most popular holiday destinations.  And connoisseurs of exquisite relaxation, comfortable and modern, can stay in De Luxe class hotels (in European - 5 * quality), luxurious, with a unique design, the maximum possible range of services offered and high-quality service. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The last category includes, in particular, the Athens Imperial 5 * Hotel, located in Athens.  Guests here have at their disposal rooms with exquisite decor, extraordinary interiors and ‚Äúmodern‚Äù equipment with modern furniture and appliances.  The hotel building itself is located in a very picturesque place, not far from the Acropolis on Karaiskaki Square, which allows you to make interesting excursions and travel to the most beautiful places of the amazing city of Athens.  This place, like many other De Luxe all-inclusive Greece hotels, offers a variety of non-smoking apartments, spacious standard rooms with views of the courtyard, junior suites and suites.  There are all necessary amenities, including satellite TV, air conditioning and a separate shower.  The hotel has restaurants, bars, shops, swimming pools (one of them is on the roof), a gym and a fitness room.  In general, the Athens Imperial 5 * hotel is ideal for those who, for the sake of comfort, are ready to part with a fairly decent amount of money - and this is what awaits them. </p><p>  If tourists don‚Äôt want to overpay for extra conveniences, then it‚Äôs best to go to other all-inclusive hotels in Greece, in particular to the <span>island of Zakynthos,</span> which is chosen by young people who are free, looking for adventure and relaxation so diverse, as much as possible in this country of myths. </p>
