    <h2>  History </h2><p>  In September 1942, the Soviet Union requested the establishment of a government award.  The honor to develop the layout of the medal was awarded to the famous artist Moskalev.  He developed a unique design project, after which the medal "For the Defense of Leningrad" was established. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Heroes of the defense of Leningrad" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22747/552263.jpg" width="340"></div>  Also A.

    <p>  All servicemen who were awarded the medal "For the Defense of Leningrad" received a reward for their efforts while serving in the <span>internal troops.</span>  In total, more than half a million blockers were awarded during the war.  By 1995, an additional 900 thousand people received awards and the total number was 1,470,000 heroes. </p><p>  Today, all the heroes who received the medal "For the Defense of Leningrad" are presented in the museum of the blockade.  The award list consists of 6 volumes. </p><h2>  Description of the medal </h2><p>  At first, the medal was cast from a rare brass alloy.  Since this was the most significant government award, every effort was made to make it.  Although at the beginning it was decided to cast a stainless steel award (it is noteworthy that later versions of this alloy really began to appear).  In January 1943, the Leningrad Mint will receive a decision to manufacture the first batch of medals.  Within a few months, the first thousand medals were awarded to war heroes.  It was round in shape with a diameter of 32 mm.  On the front side, it was decided to portray several Red Army soldiers with machine guns who mercilessly shot at the enemy, defending <span>the Admiralty building.</span>  The inscription “For our Soviet homeland” was engraved on the reverse side of the coin.  In addition to the main model, a jubilee version was also made on which another inscription “In memory of the fiftieth anniversary of Leningrad” flaunted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medal for the defense of Leningrad photo" class="if" height="208" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22747/552265.jpg" width="242"></div>

Over time, awards began to appear without such numbers, made no longer of brass, but of stainless steel.  You can also highlight several varieties and modifications of the award. </p><h2>  Option 1 </h2><p>  The ear of the medal was a separate element that simply soldered to the base.  With this method, the award was made during the Second World War and for some time after its end.  Among such medals, serial numbers on the reverse were least likely to occur.  In fact, it is still not known where such a tradition came from.  Most likely, the awards were numbered directly in the military units, and the number itself corresponded to the division number. </p><h2>  Option 2 </h2><p>  The round eye of the medal was fully stamped.  Such awards were given after the war to those heroes who, for one reason or another, could not get the medal earlier.  Her block was made of aluminum. </p><h2>  Additional rewards </h2><p>  The heroes of the defense of Leningrad also received a special certificate in which a verse was written dedicated to the protected city.  People who had both direct and indirect relation to the blockade could receive a reward.  For example, this honor was awarded to the Metropolitan of Leningrad Alexy, as well as the secretary of the regional party committee, Konstantin Ryzhov and many others.  Medals were awarded to historical figures, government officials and ordinary soldiers.  Metropolitan Alexy had an unbearable part in raising funds for the speedy construction of a new tank division.  In the shortest possible time, the clergyman collected about 6 million rubles, and thereby helped save the thousands of lives of not only civilians, but also the military on the battlefield. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="awarded the medal for the defense of Leningrad" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22747/552269.jpg" width="543"></div>

    <p>  Traditionally, the medal "For the Defense of Leningrad" was worn on the left side of the chest.  Usually next to the award "For the rescue of drowning" placed this medal. </p><h2>  Medal "For the Defense of Leningrad" now </h2><p>  It is no secret that many collectors are ready to pay a round sum for the right to possess such a relic.  On the Internet, you can find a huge number of tenders and offers to purchase such a medal.  Despite the fact that auctions begin literally with 200 rubles, the final cost can reach hundreds of thousands.  The cost directly depends on when the award was issued, from what material it is, etc. </p><p>  Fraudsters also earn money on this.  They put up for sale the medal "For the Defense of Leningrad", a photo of which is confirmed by the fact that you have a real reward.  But in fact it turns out that this is just a cheap fake that has nothing to do with the original. </p><h2>  Reward hierarchy </h2><p>  There were three similar rewards.  The most honorable and oldest was the <span>medal "For the rescue of drowning".</span>  This was followed by the award "For the Defense of Leningrad", and then the <span>medal "For the Defense of Moscow".</span>  The presence of any of these medals allowed its holder not only to claim a high position, but also gave the right to all kinds of incentives from the state. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The blockade was one of the most high-profile and tragic periods in history.  It is difficult to imagine what trials our grandfathers and great-grandfathers had to go through.  Having defended not only Leningrad, but also their entire homeland, they gave a chance for future generations to exist.  Despite all the efforts on the part of the enemy, the heroes defended the country and forever secured the concept of perseverance for the Russian people.  Undoubtedly, the heroes who have been awarded this medal deserve our eternal gratitude, respect and reverence. </p>
