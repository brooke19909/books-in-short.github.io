Just cross the road to get on it.  But for Russian tourists this is not so easy to do.  Cars travel at tremendous speed, in Thailand there are practically no traffic rules.  Fortunately, there is a little traffic light.  But, if you went out on the road, then you should not rush about on it.  If you stand in one place, then the cars will go round you. </p><p>  The beach area is well equipped.  Garbage is taken out every day, but the sand is not sieved.  Sun beds and umbrellas are available for a fee, which varies depending on their location.  You can also purchase various beach items (mattresses, children's circles, boards).  Water in the sea is not very clean, but tourists do not care.  There are always a lot of people on the beach, quite swimming and sunbathing.  Near the pool, almost no one is resting. </p><p>  There are several indisputable advantages of the Jomtien Best Residence 3 * hotel.  Guest reviews indicate a fairly favorable location of the complex. </p><h2>  What do guests say about the location of the hotel? </h2><p>  In the ranking of Jomtien hotels, the Jomtien Best Residence 3 * complex occupies a leading position in terms of location criteria. </p><p>  To the left of the hotel is a huge fruit market.  Guests can enjoy fresh, inexpensive fruit daily.  The market is open from 7 am to 9 pm.  In addition to fruit, they also sell delicious Thai food.  This is very convenient for those who do not want to eat at the hotel or go on an excursion in the morning.  Fruits in Thailand are worth a penny, many travelers go to this country just to enjoy exotic natural vitamins.  Moreover, here they will clean and cut them for you, of course, for a small surcharge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The beach is a 5-minute walk.  But the entertainment located near the Jomtien Best Residence 3 * hotel (Thailand, Pattaya) deserves special attention. </p><h2>  How to spend leisure time? </h2>

    <p>  The hotel is located in the 7th jay.  Toward evening, life here takes on different colors.  <span>Bars, restaurants, cafes</span> quickly fill up with guests.  It is believed that it is here that they sell the most delicious beer in Jomtien.  Therefore, not only tourists gather here, but also local men.  Not far from the complex there are also European institutions with signs in Russian.  I am glad that despite the huge number of bars, on the street you will not find not only drunk, but even slightly drunk people. </p><p>  Hotel Jomtien Best Residence 3 * is surrounded not only by bars, but also by other leisure facilities.  You can visit Thai massage parlors, hairdressers, shops, dry cleaners, and moped rentals. </p><p>  According to many tourists, Jomtien itself is one continuous attraction.  On both sides of the hotel complex is a picturesque promenade, along which you can stroll on warm evenings.  This area has everything a tourist needs.  Many travelers throughout their stay in Jomtien may not even leave its borders and at the same time not feel discomfort and dissatisfaction. </p><h2>  The local market is a major attraction near the hotel </h2><p>  At 500 meters from the hotel there is a night market.  Mostly they sell food products.  In a small area there are several rows with fruits and other dishes.  Thais happily pack their large purchases in baskets for free.  There, in the market, you can taste your purchases, comfortably accommodated in a small cafe.  Thais have a special relationship with food.  Dishes that are more than 2 hours from the date of preparation are considered unsuitable for consumption.  Therefore, all food is fresh and very tasty.  Everything is prepared in front of customers.  Food in Thailand is very cheap.  Therefore, the hotel can only buy breakfast, and for dinner go to one of the many restaurants or to the market. </p><p>  Children can also find activities here.  Enterprising Thais built a small scene for small artists, and every night there are children's discos.  Nearby is an inflatable mini-town.  All entertainment for children is open until 11 pm. </p><h2>  About rooms </h2>

    <p>  The most modest in price rooms include several beds.  Some have a large bed with two separate mattresses and bedding.  It offers views of the alley.  There is a small balcony. </p><p>  On both sides of the bed are tables and sockets.  Opposite there is a huge plasma with foreign and Russian channels.  One of them shows stories about Pattaya with an overview of places of interest to visit. </p><p>  Under the TV there is a long table with shelves and a built-in refrigerator.  Near the window is air conditioning. </p><p>  For things there is a spacious wardrobe.  Valuables can be stored in a safe.  At the entrance to the room there is a large bedside table in which you can fold the suitcases. </p><p>  The bathroom is equipped with all necessary accessories.  Plumbing in perfect condition.  2 towels (large and small), a glass and a bottle of water are allocated for each guest. </p><p>  The hotel is relatively new, so everything is working properly.  Repair is fresh.  Even there are no insects, which is a rarity for Thailand. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The service staff is top notch.  The receptionists are polite and friendly.  Try to solve all problems quickly.  If you do not want to be disturbed, just put a “do not disturb” sign on the door.  The maids will come at another time. </p><p>  They clean the rooms efficiently.  Towels and rugs are changed daily, bed linen every three days.  Daily bring water for each guest.  Bath accessories are replenished as necessary. </p><p>  Every evening you can enjoy perfectly laid out beds. </p><p>  Nothing is stolen in the rooms, but it’s better to keep valuables in a safe.  Some tourists complained of theft.  I am glad that the rooms are well soundproofed.  The noise only comes in when the window is open or if someone is talking very loudly in the hallway.  It seems that there are no neighbors at all, although the hotel is always crowded with vacationers. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Not only advantages are the hotel Jomtien Best Residence 3 *.  Unfortunately, the photos of the complex presented in this article do not reflect the main drawback - the lack of their own territory.  The hotel is located between other hotels and does not even have its own porch.  Almost all of the rooms have a completely inanimate view of the wall of the neighboring house. </p><p>  The pool is located indoors on the second floor.  Swimming is completely uncomfortable.  But for those who like to spend time alone, this is what they need.  Near him, almost never one rests. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has virtually no internet.  Theoretically, it is, but in practice the signal is so weak that it is simply impossible to use the network.  But this is a small problem, as there are numerous cafes with free internet nearby. </p><p>  More flaws, according to tourists, were not found in the hotel. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2><p>  You can see the exact location of the hotel Jomtien Best Residence 3 * Pattaya on the map and understand that this position is very advantageous for the hotel complex. </p>

    <p>  The only negative is the lack of its own territory.  Otherwise, the hotel is full of undeniable advantages.  Even the cheapest rooms are comfortably furnished.  A huge plus is that the hotel was built in 2014 and for 2 years has not completely lost its novelty.  The beach is within walking distance, all kinds of entertainment are also located within walking distance. </p><p>  In the neighboring market you can buy fresh fruits every day.  There are also shops with other goods.  For souvenirs and other trifles you do not need to go far.  The hotel guide will gladly tell you the best excursion routes.  But, even if you do not attend excursions, then rest all the same will be rich and full of impressions. </p>
