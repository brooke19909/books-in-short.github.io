Of these, Kassandra is the closest to mainland Greece, named after the king of <span>ancient Macedonia,</span> Kassandros.  The cozy and very beautiful hotel Daphne Holiday Club 3 * is located here.  Its guests will certainly appreciate the beauty of the territory and the surrounding area, the sincere friendliness of the staff, the bewitching views that open from almost every corner of the hotel, the pleasant relaxing atmosphere that reigns here every day. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Daphne Holiday Club Hotel 3 * is located in Halkidiki and at the same time on two peninsulas - the large Halkidiki and the small - Kassandra, the secretly called "Poseidon's trident."  Kassandra is a narrow strip of land more than 60 km long and less than 20 km wide, crashes into <span>the Aegean Sea.</span>  On the one hand the peninsula is washed by Themaikos Gulf, on the other - the Toronic Gulf (its other name is Kassandra), on the southwestern shores of which lies the resort village of Chanioti.  About 800 meters above its center, on a hillside, the hotel in question was built. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Daphne Holiday Club 3" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1573225.jpg"></div>  There are several other hotels just a little higher, and a little aside are the private houses of the Greeks.  According to reviews by guests of the Daphne Holiday Club, this does not interfere with the rest, as no extraneous noise penetrates the hotel grounds.

The climate of northern Greece, although Mediterranean, but stable heat is established here only by the end of April.  True, this month the weather can "please" with rains.  Swimming at the end of spring is not entirely comfortable, as the sea warms up to +19 ¬∞ C even in the bays.  Even in June it is not warmer + 22 ¬∞ C.  But powerful winds (the Greeks say ‚Äúfortune‚Äù) are here, especially in summer, very rare.  The most comfortable to relax on Kassandra from July to mid-September.  Then in the sea the temperature can even be + 25 ¬∞ C, and the air warmed up to + 30 ¬∞ C or slightly higher. </p><p>  The nearest beach to Daphne Holiday Club is 700 meters away. It is public, sunbeds cost 3 euros, but you can buy a fruit salad or a drink in a nearby bar to use the sunbed and umbrella for free.  Such a service is practiced throughout Greece, not only in Kassandra. </p><p>  Covering the nearest beach - coarse sand, good entry into the water.  But the infrastructure here is not very developed, there are no changing rooms, showers. </p><p>  Meters 800 from this beach there is another, more ennobled.  Prices there are about the same. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Daphne Holiday Club 3 pics" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1573121.jpg" width="510"></div>

    <h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Mostly for lovers of a harmonious relaxing holiday surrounded by beautiful nature, Daphne Holiday Club 3 * is suitable.  Reviews of tourists note that active youth and everyone who goes to Halkidiki for noisy and recklessly fun nightlife will be bored here.  In the hotel itself, guests entertain themselves.  The staff here is unobtrusive and seemingly inconspicuous, although people perform their work perfectly.  In the nearby village of Hanioti, there is also not a lot of entertainment.  There are shops and shops with Greek and Chinese goods, taverns, bars, but there are no nightclubs with noisy parties. </p><p>  Daphne Holiday Club is also not very suitable for those who are hard to walk a lot.  Firstly, the sea and the center of the village are not nearby, secondly, you need to climb the slope to the hotel, and thirdly, there are many stairs on its territory. </p><p>  Parents with children at the hotel will enjoy the cleanliness and service, but for the little ones there is practically nothing here, not even the children's section in the pool. </p><p>  The rest in the Daphne Holiday Club is mainly foreigners (approximately 80% of the contingent), and Serbs prevail among them. </p><p>  Excursions can be purchased by anyone at the hotel or in city travel agencies.  The most popular destinations are Thessaloniki, Meteora (monasteries on the rocks), Athos (they are not allowed inside, only outside), Petralona (the cave where the remains of an ancient primitive man were found), Olympus. </p><p>  Many tourists report that it is convenient to rent a car and travel around the area on your own.  You can rent a car immediately upon arrival at the airport or later in the village.  The cost of this service, like other prices at the resort, varies depending on the season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Daphne Holiday Club 3 reviews" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1573112.jpg" width="509"></div>
