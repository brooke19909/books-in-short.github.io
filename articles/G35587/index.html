It has become so necessary that sometimes it is simply frightening to imagine the lack of the ability to phone with a loved one.  Each person, even in another city, can contact colleagues on business matters or call relatives.  Thanks to cellular communications, during the day all tasks and problems are solved quite quickly.  However, there are situations when it is not possible to make a call, and the message ‚ÄúNo signal‚Äù appears on the screen. </p><p>  What to do - the Megafon network does not catch?  Why in the age of high technology can one encounter this kind of problem?  Every mobile phone owner wants to know what causes the network to disappear, and how to avoid it? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the megaphone does not catch the network" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1895221.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <h2>  No network </h2><p>  At present, the towers of the MegaFon mobile operator have been trained practically throughout the territory of the Russian Federation and even beyond its borders.  Extremely rare are those areas where there is completely no coverage. </p><p>  If the phone does not catch the Megafon network, then there may be several reasons for this.  To say that there is no coverage in this place can only be done if all the people nearby have no signal.  Most often, such a problem can be encountered outside the city.  Sometimes in those areas located in the lowland, there may also be no network coverage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Megafon towers are built rather densely in urban conditions, therefore, as a rule, there are no problems with the signal.  However, due to the large number of buildings, certain areas with a weak coating or with its complete absence may occur.  Concrete partitions are an obstacle to the propagation of radio waves.  In this case, it is enough to step aside about 10 meters - and there will be no problems with communication. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the megaphone does not catch the network" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1895216.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  There is a signal, but I can‚Äôt call </h2><p>  You are faced with such a problem when the Megafon network does not catch it.  What to do in such a situation?  There may be several reasons, as well as their solutions.  For example, interruptions in cellular communications or problems with a mobile device.  However, often users are faced with the fact that on the phone screen the signal level, although small, is there.  But when you try to send a message or dial a subscriber number, except for short beeps, nothing happens.  In this case, you can try the following: </p><ul><li>  Check call forwarding service.  If it is active, then you need to dial the command ## 21 # and the call key. </li><li>  Communication problems can be caused by FDN mode.  If it is enabled, then there are restrictions on working with subscriber numbers.  Only those that are listed in a special list on the SIM card will be available for calls. </li><li>  If the Megafon network does not catch, or the signal is very weak, you can try restarting your mobile device.  In this case, it is desirable to remove the SIM card and reinstall it. </li><li>  The presence of a blacklist is displayed on calls.  Most often, in this application, a block is set for some services.  You can check the status and correct the settings in the settings. </li><li>  In mobile phones, the function of barring incoming and outgoing calls is provided.  I can‚Äôt dial the number - then you need to see its status. </li><li>  If the problem with the signal still remains, you should try to insert your SIM card into another device.  If there is no signal on it, then you will need to contact any Megafon mobile phone salon. </li></ul>

Why does the Megafon SIM card not catch? </h2><p>  Currently, every mobile user knows that 3G is not only a reliable, but also a powerful source of the Internet.  In the event that the network is unstable or completely disappears, then it is necessary to carry out diagnostics. </p><ul><li>  Most often, in case of denial of access, the reason is a lack of funds in the account or the spent traffic limit.  In order to check the status, you must run the following commands: * 558 # or * 105 #. </li><li>  If the MegaFon SIM does not catch the 3G network while the owner is outside his region, you need to check the package settings to see if the 3G network is allowed in roaming. </li><li>  Devices equipped with two ports for SIM cards often have some technical limitations.  For example, support for 3G or 4G can be implemented only on one of the slots. </li><li>  And of course, you can test the device itself.  To do this, it is recommended that you first switch to a 2G network and check if it is functioning.  After that, activate the function only 3G.  Often there are signal failures with active mixed mode. </li></ul><h2>  4G network issues </h2>

    <p>  Not so long ago, users had the opportunity to connect to fourth-generation networks.  This option is also implemented by the mobile operator Megafon. </p><p>  Stopped catching the phone network, but previously there were no problems?  It is necessary to understand the reasons for this failure.  The fact is that 4G is currently stable only in large cities.  At the testing stage are the territories of district centers and <span>rural areas,</span> so in these places the signal can be either weak or completely absent. </p><p>  Also, the reason that Megafon does not catch the 4G network may be the restrictions of the tariff package.  To do this, you must contact the mobile phone salon and activate the service. </p><p>  Another reason, if you can‚Äôt connect to 4G, may be the technical features of the mobile phone.  Not all devices support this technology. </p><h2>  The reason is in the phone </h2><p>  Why doesn‚Äôt the Megafon network catch on the phone?  This question is very frustrating for mobile users.  Unfortunately, there are not always problems in coverage if there is no signal.  Any device is not insured against malfunctions.  And at present, multifunctional smartphones are crammed with so many different technologies that it is simply impossible to prevent and ensure the reliability of the level of work with cellular networks. </p><p>  So, if the subscriber noticed that the Megafon SIM card does not catch the network on his phone, then you can try inserting it into another device.  If there are no problems with the signal on it, then there may be several reasons for the breakdown of the device.  Consider the main ones: </p><ul><li>  The radio contact has failed. </li><li>  The fault is in the transmitter power amplifier. </li><li>  Problems with the antenna. </li><li>  Software crash. </li><li>  Moisture has gotten inside the phone. </li></ul>

    <h2>  SIM card malfunction </h2><p>  No less common reason why Megafon does not catch the network may be a SIM card defect.  Many users are often surprised when this happens.  However, the mobile operator‚Äôs card is the same electronic device as the phone itself.  Inside it there is a microcircuit that may be damaged.  In case of failures, the phone simply does not register on the network. </p><p>  If this happened, then you should not be upset ahead of time.  You can restore access to your number at any office of your mobile operator.  It is quite simple to order a duplicate SIM card in it.  However, you must remember that this number should be issued specifically for you. </p><h2>  SIM card blocked </h2><p>  There are times when the owner does not use the service of a mobile operator for a long time, and then discovers that Megafon does not catch the network.  This problem is quite natural.  After a certain period, this number is blocked.  Almost all operators provide services for one year, after which it is necessary to replenish the account in order to extend the term.  If the SIM card is locked, it becomes inactive.  Naturally, you cannot see the network and connect to it with its help. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="SIM card does not catch a megaphone" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1895219.jpg" width="384"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, in this article we figured out why Megafon does not catch the network.  The most common causes that can lead to these consequences: </p><ul><li>  Damage to the phone itself. </li><li>  SIM card issues. </li><li>  Lack of coverage in a particular area. </li></ul><p>  Also, if Megafon does not catch the network in automatic mode, it is recommended to use manual search.  Sometimes the <span>problem is solved</span> quite simply by rebooting the gadget. </p>
