    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Once upon a time, these lakes were a single pond of glacial origin, which was called Parkola.  A pine forest grew along the shores.  During the Middle Ages, Orthodox Karelian villages were located here, the inhabitants of which were engaged in agriculture.  The middle of the 18th century was marked by the fact that the lake passed into the private hands of <span>Count Shuvalov.</span>  By this time, it was already divided into three parts and got its current name in honor of the Suzdal Sloboda.  A hundred years later, a holiday village and a <span>railway station</span> appeared in this place <span>.</span>  These objects were called Shuvalovo, and most of the streets of the village still bear the names of members of this family. </p><h2>  Description of the lakes <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="middle Suzdal lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15127/219725.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Upper Suzdal Lake is located north of Poklonnaya Gora.  Its depth reaches 11 meters.  In length, this pond is 600 meters, while in width - 450 meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The middle Suzdal lake is the smallest of the whole galaxy.  Its length and width are 400 and 250 meters, respectively. </p><p>  Big Lower Lake is the largest in the group of Suzdal lakes.  Almost 2 kilometers is the length of the lake and 600 meters is the width.  The Starozhilovka River flows into this reservoir from the north, and the Kamenka River flows to the west. </p><h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  Suzdal lakes are of great interest for lovers of fishing.  The <span>Upper Lake</span> is considered the most fishing spot of all three reservoirs <span>.</span>  Roach, perch, gudgeon, bream, crucian carp and even pike are found here.  The best time to catch is considered spring, summer and the end of winter.  On the Middle and Big Lake, you can also catch a rather big catch.  Peak activity is observed mainly in autumn and winter.  At this time, you can catch roach, scavenger, crucian carp, ruff, pike and perch on the lake. </p><h2>  What was before </h2><p>  Previously, Suzdal Lakes had good prospects for the development of recreational tourism in the area.  A clear reservoir, <span>pine forest,</span> picturesque hills - the perfect place to relax.  A small steamer even cruised around the lake.  No wonder this place was called "Shuvalovskaya Switzerland."  Alexander Bech himself admired these beauties.  And in the Soviet period, artists of the Mariinsky Theater performed here. </p><h2>  Suzdal lakes today <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Upper Suzdal Lake" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15127/219727.jpg" width="540"></div></h2><p>  Today Suzdal lakes are very popular among vacationers.  For this reason, the water in the pond quickly becomes very dirty, despite the fact that all the lakes are cleaned before the tourist season.  Due to the large accumulation of debris, in particular glass bottles, it is forbidden to periodically swim in this place.  Every spring new sand is brought to the beaches and cleaned throughout the season, but the beaches are still very dirty.  The infrastructure is scarce.  On the beach are bins, changing cabins, dry closets, small shops and a boat station, which most of the time does not work. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Suzdal lakes have simply huge potential for the development of highly profitable tourism business.  All that is required is to equip the beaches with benches, sun loungers, playgrounds.  Many tourists will not even spare money to pay for a vacation on a clean and well-equipped beach. </p>
