  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chronology of the history of Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p><strong></strong>  The chronology in translation from the Greek language is a sequence of events in time.  Each state has its own history, which can be represented in numbers and dates. </p><p>  The chronology of the history of Russia originates in the VI ‚Äì VII centuries, when the Slavs began to settle along the banks of the Dnieper.  In 862, the reign of Prince Rurik begins, who was called to reign by the Rusichs to end the internecine wars in the Slavic tribes.  The year 882 was marked by the unification of the Novgorod and Kiev principalities, and Kiev began to be considered the capital of Ancient Russia.  In 988, Prince <span>Vladimir Krasno Sunny</span> conducts the Baptism of Russia.  After the death of Vladimir, his sons begin internecine wars, and in 1019 Yaroslav the Wise ascended to the princely throne.  Further, the chronology of the history of Russia indicates that the intensive construction of cathedrals begins in Kiev, Novgorod and Chernigov.  After the death of Yaroslav the Wise in 1054, Russia was again divided between his sons.  Fragmented Russia is subjected to constant raids by the Polovtsians. </p><p>  The 12th century was the collapse of Kievan Rus, the reign of Vladimir Monomakh and Yuri Dolgoruky, the beginning of the construction of Moscow and the approval of the Novgorod Republic.  The chronology of the history of Russia of the XIII century includes a number of significant events.  In 1223 - the battle of Kalk;  1240 - the capture of the Batu forces of Kiev;  July 15, 1240 - Battle of the Neva;  beginning of the Tatar-Mongol yoke;  April 5, 1242 - The <span>Battle of the Ice.</span>  The 14th century was marked by the founding of the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius in 1340, <span>the Battle of Kulikovo</span> in 1380, the construction of a stone Kremlin in Moscow, the ruin of Moscow by Khan Tokhtamysh in 1382, and the defeat of the Golden Horde Tamerlan. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The history of Russia, whose chronology is incredibly rich, further narrates the events of the 15th century: the siege of Moscow by Edigem in 1408, the proclamation of the Russian Orthodox Church, which became independent (autocephalous) and was divided into the Kiev and Moscow metropolises.  This century was marked by the famous ‚ÄúJourney beyond the three seas‚Äù by Athanasius Nikitin, and the accession to the throne of Ivan III, and the accession to the Principality of Veliky Novgorod in Moscow.  The 16th century begins with the war with the Livonian Order.  At this time, Pskov, Smolensk and Ryazan join Muscovy.  In 1533, Ivan IV (Ivan the Terrible) ascended the throne.  Later, he begins the annexation of the Kazan and Astrakhan khanates.  In 1564, Ivan Fedorov published the first book, The Apostle;  begins oprichnina, mass executions and atrocities in 1565-1572.  The <span>Rurikovich dynasty</span> ceases to exist in 1598. After this, the chronology of the history of Russia begins a new stage in the Time of Troubles, after which a new Tsar, Mikhail Fedorovich Romanov, is chosen in 1613. </p><p>  In the 17th century, there was a <span>church schism, an</span> uprising of Ivan Bolotnikov, riots and popular unrest, the final enslavement of the peasants, the beginning of the reign of Peter I and the famous <span>Streletsky riot of 1698</span> .  In 1700, Russia switched to a new reckoning.  The history of Russia further tells about no less significant events.  St. Petersburg was founded in 1703, the Battle of Poltava took place in 1709, in 1721 - Russia became an empire.  1725 was marked by the death of Peter I, 1755 - the foundation of Moscow University.  1762-1796 - the <span>reign of Catherine II, the</span> uprising of Emelyan Pugachev - 1773-1775.  Crimea was annexed to the Russian Empire in 1783, and the Russo-Turkish war took place in 1787-1791.  These dates of the history of Russia <strong>are the</strong> most significant, they must be known to our contemporaries. </p><p>  The following events take place in the 19th century: 1812 - war with Napoleon and the Battle of Borodino;  1825 - uprising of the Decembrists;  1861 - the abolition of serfdom;  1862 - the year the great reforms of Alexander II began, 1865-1873 - the Khiva, Kokand and Bukhara khanates came under the jurisdiction of Russia, and Alaska was leased in 1867.  In 1894 - the beginning of the reign of Nicholas II.  These dates of the history of Russia allow us to trace the events that took place before the 20th century, the chronology of which we will consider in the next article. </p>
