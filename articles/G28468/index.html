Experienced users can also find useful information on the most popular alternatives. </p><h2>  How to choose the right camera: required features </h2><p>  You should not buy a camera if it is deprived of at least one of the following features that have become standard in modern models. </p><ul><li>  Image stabilizer.  Shaking hands can ruin the frame, but the best cameras are equipped with optical stabilizers for a clear shot.  The cheaper models use digital correction, but it is not so effective. </li><li>  LCD screen.  A good display should be bright and clear so that you can view the photo or endorse even in strong sunlight.  The standard is a 3 ‚Äùdiagonal screen. </li><li>  Manual setting.  In the price range above 10 thousand rubles, even basic digital cameras provide, at least partially, manual control, and high-end models give you the ability to fully control focus, aperture, shutter speed, etc. Some cameras allow you to customize user functions. </li><li>  Strong optical zoom.  Most modern digital cameras provide adequate optical zoom. </li><li>  HD video.  Many modern cameras can record high definition movies.  However, some models only provide 720p recording.  High-performance cameras can usually record 4K video. </li><li>  Timer.  All digital cameras allow you to set the time delay so that the photographer can join the group being shot. </li><li>  Wireless connection.  If you need a simple way to backup or transfer photos to your smartphone or tablet, then before choosing a camera, you need to check whether it supports Wi-Fi wireless.  Some models also allow connected devices to remotely control the camera. </li><li>  Autofocus  Most digital cameras can automatically focus on the subject. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Olympus Tough TG-5" class="if uuid-2350048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2350048.jpg"></div><h2>  What to decide? </h2><p>  Cost.  For 11 thousand rubles, you can purchase a compact, convenient camera for quick shooting with limited creative control.  If you need a higher image quality, longer zoom or the ability to change lenses, the price will increase to 14 thousand rubles.  and much higher with the best SLR cameras. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The size.  Modern cameras can fit in your jeans pocket or jacket.  Interchangeable lens compacts are usually larger.  Such devices weigh about 140 g, so they do not burden a backpack or jacket too much during outdoor adventures. </p><p>  Is protection necessary?  Good cameras, as a rule, are made not of plastic, but of durable light metal.  The best of them are sealed to protect against dust and rain.  But you can find surprisingly durable and <span>waterproof cameras</span> cheaper than 28 thousand rubles.  The quality of photographs will not be professional, but sufficient to please the photographer himself. </p><p>  How many megapixels do you really need?  Some of the best digital cameras have only a 12 megapixel image sensor.  Some offer 24 megapixels or more, which provides high definition details when printing large photos.  However, practice shows that not always everything works in this way, so you should not judge a camera by this indicator only. </p><p>  Are you planning to shoot moving objects?  If so, then before you select a digital camera, you must check <span>the shooting speed.</span>  The fastest cameras capture 16 or more frames per second.  Again, you should not judge only by the numbers: the best models are equipped with fast processors that can quickly cope with such a data stream, but many make you wait until the data is written to the memory card. </p><p>  Will special effects and modes be used?  Even cheap cameras provide at least a few of these features.  For example, you can give the photo a nostalgic shade of sepia or make it look like a miniature model. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Cyber-shot RX10 Mark III" class="if uuid-2350129" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2350129.jpg"></div><p>  Is shooting in RAW format necessary?  Most basic digital cameras record images only in JPEG files that are pre-processed in the camera (sharpening, smoothing granular noise, etc.).  Some photographers prefer to shoot in RAW format and later process photos on a PC, thus gaining full control over the editing process.  Advanced digital cameras allow you to record both RAW and JPEG files. </p><h2>  How to choose a camera by type? </h2><p>  Basic level digital cameras.  They are in the price range up to 14 thousand rubles and are suitable for beginners or those who need a pocket-sized, simple camera that does not greatly burden the family budget.  Some models of this type are truly tiny (slightly larger than a business card and less than 2 cm thick) and inexpensive.  Although not a single camera in this category matches the professional quality of the best cameras, with the right choice you can get decent shots.  Will photos be better than on a smartphone?  Probably not, but even a cheap camera has more zoom (and battery life) than any phone. </p><p>  Protected Models.  When floating or climbing rocks, boating or skiing, I don‚Äôt want to risk my smartphone, so shockproof and waterproof cameras are useful here, the characteristics of which will make it possible to take pictures without worrying about anything. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Digital cameras with super zoom.  This is another type of camera that smartphones cannot match.  The longest telephoto cameras of this type with 83x zoom allow you to study lunar craters in detail.  They are great for leisure and sporting events, as they take everything from wide angles to extreme close-ups. </p><p>  Mid-range digital cameras.  These work tools provide better photos and can handle difficult situations - dim light, close-ups, and fast movement.  They provide more control over the settings so you can be creative in your shots. </p><p>  Compact cameras with interchangeable lenses.  Also known as hybrid or mirrorless.  They allow you to change lenses like bulky SLR cameras, but much less.  Can match DSLR quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon PowerShot SX620" class="if uuid-2350026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2350026.jpg"></div><h2>  The best digital camera for beginners </h2><p>  <span>The Canon PowerShot SX620 HS</span> in a rather small body offers an impressive <span>25x</span> zoom lens.  The size of a deck of cards and a thickness of 2.8 cm, it does not fit in a tight pocket of jeans, but it can be easily carried in other places.  In their advice on choosing a camera, experts and users call this camera the best choice among entry-level digital models. </p><p>  What is a 25x magnification?  This is enough to take a close-up of a favorite football player, even if he is on the other side of the field, or to photograph a child performing on the stage from the back row of the school assembly hall.  Users like this optics, as evidenced by the levels of sales in online stores. </p><p>  But this camera is more than just a nice zoom: the 20.2-megapixel sensor is superior to its competitors in low light conditions, and the built-in image stabilization system perfectly suppresses jitter.  The battery life is excellent: according to Canon, the battery lasts for 295 shots (or 405 in eco mode, in which the screen goes blank when the camera is not in use) or for 1 hour 1080p video.  Charger and strap included. </p><p>  According to the owners, the SX620 HS is comfortable to hold thanks to a rubber grip in the front and a small recess for the finger at the back, which is not the case with cheaper models.  A 3 ‚Äùscreen (standard for this class) occupies most of the rear panel, and Wi-Fi and NFC support make it easy to transfer photos to your phone, tablet or computer. </p><h2>  The best low-cost camera </h2><p>  How to choose a high-quality camera in this category?  Expert and user reviews recommend purchasing the Canon PowerShot Elph 190 IS.  It does not have all the features of the SX620 HS, but a 10x zoom lens brings it closer to the subject than any smartphone.  A 20-megapixel camera with image stabilization, Wi-Fi and NFC allows you to shoot clear and clear video in 720p format.  The camera is slightly larger than a business card and weighs about 140 g. A 2.7 ‚Äùscreen occupies most of the rear panel.  The kit includes a strap and charger.  According to the manufacturer, the battery is designed for 190 shots (245 in eco mode) or 50 minutes.  video. </p><p>  However, before choosing an inexpensive Elph 190 IS camera, you should check whether you plan to shoot in low light conditions.  The dim scenes in the room in the photo look blurry, especially when fully scaled. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imaging-resource.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon PowerShot ELPH 190 IS" class="if uuid-2350044" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2350044.jpg"></div><h2>  Olympus Tough TG-5 </h2><p>  When deciding which camera is best to choose for extreme relaxation, it is worth paying attention to this particular model.  The camera can be immersed under water to a depth of 15 m, dropped from a height of 2 m, subjected to a pressure of 100 kg and used at temperatures up to -10 ¬∞ C.  According to experts, this is the best protected model that can only be purchased. </p><p>  The TG-5 camera has replaced another popular camera - the Olympus TG-4.  She has additional features, including 4K-video, RAW-image capture at a speed of 20 fps and a 12-megapixel sensor, which captures wonderful shots in low light conditions. </p><p>  Despite its sturdy case and sophisticated features, the TG-5 is an ordinary compact camera the size of a business card and slightly thicker than 3 cm, with a 3 ‚ÄùLCD screen.  The lens has a 4x zoom and is compatible with the Telephoto Tough Lens Pack, which extends the focal length of the built-in lens from 100 to 170 mm, and the zoom up to 7x.  There are GPS and Wi-Fi.  The kit includes a charger, a micro-USB cable and a strap.  A full battery charge allows you to take about 340 shots (or 50 minutes of video). </p><h2>  Nikon Coolpix P900 </h2><p>  The camera impresses with an 83x zoom lens.  Experts warn that the image quality is not the highest, but the owners do not complain: the 16-megapixel P900 is praised by hundreds of users, and the forums are filled with pictures taken from a distance of 1.5 km or more.  According to user reviews, the ability to shoot with a compact camera, for example, a bird that can hardly be seen, inspires many. </p><p>  However, you cannot call a pocket camera.  The P900 is no smaller than a DSLR camera with a standard lens.  But for a DSLR with the same zoom, you will need optics the size of a 4-year-old child.  Thus, the P900 is incredibly compact. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon Coolpix P900" class="if uuid-2350051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2350051.jpg"></div><p>  Blurred photos are a big drawback of long-zoom cameras, but Nikon's excellent image stabilization system allows you to take clear pictures and even video in 1080p format.  The problem is represented by photographs in low light conditions.  Although the ISO sensitivity of 1600 is acceptable, the P900 is not the camera that should be used for indoor photography.  There is no RAW mode. </p><p>  Thoughtful additions include a hinged, rotatable 3 ‚Äùscreen, an electronic viewfinder and built-in GPS, Wi-Fi and NFC.  The P900 comes with a neck strap, lens cap, micro USB cable and charger.  The battery charge allows you to take 360 ‚Äã‚Äãshots or record 1 hour 20 minutes.  video. </p><h2>  Advanced digital cameras </h2><p>  Cameras of this type represent the next step compared to compact models.  They are a bit heavier and bigger, but with lots of extra features and capabilities.  They are more expensive and designed for enthusiasts, and not for ordinary users who need a simple camera for everyday use.  But how to choose a camera of this type? </p><p>  The hearts of owners and critics won the 24-megapixel <span>Fujifilm X100F.</span>  He has everything a compact compact should have.  The compact camera captures SLR-quality images.  It features a rangefinder that critics find beautiful.  35-mm optics are not zoomed in, but this is not a problem, since you can choose a lens for the camera.  Wide 28mm and standard 50mm options are available. </p><p>  Professionals like the intuitive controls and reliable manual controls.  The built-in flash works great, and the sync contact allows you to set the external.  Pictures can be saved in RAW format, but reviewers agree that pre-processed JPEG files look good without any settings, even at ISO 3200. There is a viewfinder with a hybrid eyepiece or a 3 ‚Äùdisplay.  The video is 1080p, but the lack of image stabilization means that frames will appear blurry without a tripod. </p><p>  Wi-Fi makes sharing photos easy.  The X100F comes with a shoulder strap, lens cap, USB cable and charger.  The battery charge is enough for 390 shots with an optical viewfinder, 270 with electronic or a 1-hour video. </p><h2>  Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX10 III </h2><p>  The camera has a 25x zoom and a 20.1-megapixel sensor.  It is larger than Fujifilm and is the size of a compact SLR camera.  The quality of the photo is excellent, as well as the video: the recording is done in resolution up to 4K, and the built-in image stabilization keeps it clear at all but the longest focal lengths. </p><h2>  Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX10 </h2><p>  Before choosing an inexpensive but good camera, you should familiarize yourself with the 20-megapixel Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX10.  This is a great alternative to the above models.  The camera is small enough to fit in a jeans pocket, has a 3x zoom lens and can shoot 4K video.  She will satisfy serious photographers with excellent image quality and advanced functions (including the ability to record in RAW format), although she lacks the sophisticated JPEG processing, optical viewfinder, sync contact, and some of the manual controls that more expensive models have. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fujifilm X100F" class="if uuid-2350060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2350060.jpg"></div><h2>  Fujifilm X-T2 </h2><p>  Compact cameras with interchangeable lenses, often called hybrid or mirrorless, occupy a central place between compact and SLR.  Cameras of this type allow the use of interchangeable optics, which provides greater versatility without the inconvenience of large DSLR cases. </p><p>  Fujifilm X-T2 (about 109 thousand rubles with an 18-55 mm lens) receives almost all the awards in this category.  According to experts, this is the best mirrorless camera you can buy. </p><p>  The compact case, made in a beautiful retro style, is made of hard magnesium alloy and is carefully protected from adverse weather conditions.  Stunning 24-megapixel images, 4K video, a convenient rotary 3 ‚Äùdisplay and an electronic viewfinder are almost devoid of flaws.  According to the owners, the choice of lenses is amazing, and autofocus is fast and intelligent.  There is no built-in flash, but it is included in the kit (along with a sync contact plug, lens mount, shoulder strap and charger).  Battery capacity allows you to take 340 shots or record 40 minutes.  4K video. </p><h2>  Best DSLR Cameras </h2><p>  How to choose a camera for a novice user of mirror models?  Less expensive cameras can help you learn the basics of working with devices of this type without much burdening the budget.  But these are not truncated models.  They offer most of the features of more expensive cameras and, according to experts, allow you to take photos of the same quality. </p><p>  Reviews of DSLR cameras show that in this category there are several outstanding options, but the Nikon D3300 (32 thousand rubles and above) is beyond competition.  Experts often say that the number of megapixels should not be taken into account when comparing cameras, but the D3300's 24.2 megapixels are knocked out by analogs whose sensor resolution does not exceed 20 megapixels.  In addition, this model is smaller and lighter than more expensive competitors. </p><p>  Nikon D3300 comes with a standard 3x (18-55 mm) zoom lens, as well as in sets with 50 mm and 55-200 mm optics.  This entry-level DSLR camera is equipped with the image stabilization system needed to capture high-quality photos and a 700-picture battery.  According to user reviews, the quality of photos and videos is good, even in low light conditions without using a flash. </p><h2>  Nikon D5500 </h2><p>  The ideal <span>camera for beginners</span> combines simplicity and quality.  However, having comprehended the basics of photography, the user may wish for a faster and more advanced camera.  This is where advanced entry-level DSLR cameras appear.  They are easy for beginners to master, but they provide features that are enough for the camera to not get bored too quickly. </p><p>  <span>The Nikon D5500,</span> compared to the D3300, is a step up, both in terms of price and performance.  The camera has the same resolution of 24.2 megapixels and shoots at a speed of 5 fps, but has a longer battery life (820 frames).      -,   ,           ,   . Wi-Fi          . D5500     ,       3      . </p><p> The absence of a smoothing filter allows the sensor to capture more detail, although images are at risk of moire on elements such as striped or checkered clothing.  According to reviews, the D5500 is smaller than most DSLR cameras and easy to use, although due to its small size the controls are placed closely, especially for users with big hands.  The model is made in black and red. </p><h2>  Canon Rebel T6S </h2><p>  Like the Nikon D5500, the T6S DSLR offers a 24-megapixel resolution and a rotatable touch screen.  It supports Wi-Fi and can shoot at 5 fps.  The main drawback, compared with the D5500, is the short battery life, sufficient for only 180 frames.  The camera captures the image more slowly - in about 0.7 s versus 0.2 s.  The Canon Rebel T6S is slightly larger, which may be more convenient for users with big hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon D7200" class="if uuid-2350167" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2350167.jpg"></div><h2>  Nikon D7200 </h2><p>  Above the class are semi-professional DSLRs, which, according to experts, will satisfy the most serious photography enthusiasts.  Models of this category provide a higher frame rate and shutter speed, have a more robust design, more intelligent autofocus and other additional functions. </p><p>  Nikon D7200 (from 60 thousand rubles) is an update to the best digital camera D7100.  The best DSLR camera in this review has a resolution of 24.2 megapixels and can shoot at speeds up to 6 fps or up to 7 fps in crop mode.  It weighs a little more than other models, but it works offline for 1110 hours - 15% longer than its predecessor.  Fast start-up time, short delay between shots and wireless connectivity put the D7200 on a par with high-end professional SLR cameras, with several additional features such as 2 memory card slots.  On the other hand, the 3.2 ‚ÄùD7200 display does not move, like other Nikon models, and, surprisingly, it does not have a touch screen. </p><p>  The camera features a newer processor and a large image buffer (up to 100 frames in JPEG format).  In addition, NFC allows you to connect to smartphones and tablets just by bringing the camera closer to them. </p><h2>  Canon EOS 70D </h2><p>  This is another alternative with excellent autofocus, a resolution of 20.2 megapixels and a nominal battery life of 210 shots.  Canon EOS 70D is equipped with a LCD touch screen, has built-in GPS and Wi-Fi.  The model is characterized by high video quality and a shooting speed of 7 fps, which is faster than that of many other SLR cameras. </p><p>  According to experts, the Canon EOS 70D can be chosen both as a professional camera and as an amateur, since it allows you to video and photograph sports events, portraits, landscapes, etc. both indoors and outdoors.  The disadvantage of the model is that in low light conditions, the EOS 70D takes blurry pictures, although the flash illuminates objects at close and far distances well and provides excellent and uniform coverage.  70D shoots video better than most DSLR cameras (although 4K is not available).  Startup time and delay between shots are also better. </p><p>  The Canon EOS 80D, which replaced this model, is also a good camera, although the changes in it are more evolutionary than revolutionary.  The upgrade touched the image sensor, the resolution of which increased to 24.2 megapixels, the processor and the autofocus system. </p>
