    <h2>  Features of rest in Cuba </h2><p>  Liberty Island is becoming increasingly popular with tourists from Russia every year.  More and more of our compatriots, despite the long distance separating the countries (about 13 hours of flight) and rather expensive prices for travel packages, they choose the Caribbean coast for holidays, in particular in winter.  Russian citizens do not need visas to enter the country, which is very convenient, especially for those who do not like to plan their holidays in advance, and once, having packed a small suitcase in a hurry and booked an airplane ticket online, they headlong to the airport in half an hour before take-off. </p><p>  Our tourists are especially attracted to four-star hotels in the resort of Varadero.  In them you can find full compliance with price and quality.  The Cuba Hotel Be Live Experience Varadero is a prime example of this category of hotels.  It provides all vacationers with excellent service, wonderful interior and delicious cuisine.  Like most hotels in this category, it has a wonderful location and incredible beauty of the landscape outside the window. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Resort Varadero </h2><p>  This Cuban sea town, which is located on the Ikakos Peninsula and belongs to the province of Matanzas, is washed by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean.  The tourist infrastructure is well developed here, because the resort is located only an hour and a half drive from the capital of the country, Havana. </p><p>  On a 20-kilometer long beach there are countless snow-white hotels that have their own well-groomed territories, stretches of beaches where tourists can spend their holidays with complete comfort.  It is to these hotels that the Live Experience Varadero 4 * (Varadero) belongs.  Of course, here you will not find such a service as, for example, in the Canaries (do not forget that for many years Cuba has been a socialist country), the island has not yet been spoiled by many benefits of civilization, but all that is available is enough to make the trip It turned out to be interesting and rich. </p><p>  Especially great here are evenings to the rhythms of incendiary salsa, with a glass of rum, with the famous Havana cigar in hand.  The most interesting thing is that discos are held right on the beach, and then the rhythms of melodic music merge with the sound of waves. </p><p>  By the way, Varadero is a great place for lovers of diving, windsurfing, golf, tennis and other sports.  However, the most pleasant thing that tourists find here is a friendly attitude, hospitality and benevolence of local residents, whom about 27 thousand live in the resort.  Most of them are involved in the tourism business and work to provide guests with high-quality service. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches and Hotels </h2><p>  All sections of the 20-kilometer coast of Varadero are free.  Many of them belong to one or another hotel, but admission to them is free.  There are also completely wild beaches that appear before tourists in their original form.  Along the coast, there are unique natural attractions: sea caves, fancy sand mounds, coral reef chains, etc. </p><p>  For tourists with children who are going on vacation to the Be Live Experience Varadero 4 * hotel, the entrance to the ocean is gentle, due to this the depth does not increase sharply, but gradually.  The water in the sea is warm all year round, reaches 26 degrees. </p><p>  As you can see, the coast of Varadero is just perfect for a beach holiday, but there is one drawback - it's jellyfish.  They are very beautiful and glow in coastal waters.  This is a real bait for babies who want to touch them at all costs, and as a result a burn can occur and it is quite painful.  Therefore, jellyfish should be treated with extreme caution. </p><p>  On the beaches there are cafes, bars, various water activities, there is the possibility of horse riding.  Activities for divers are very common here.  At the first dive, tourists explore the underwater world of coastal waters, then coral reefs and underwater caves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="live experience varadero 4 varadero" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1568646.jpg" width="496"></div>

The only way to go there is by air, since there is no sea connection with other countries.  At the same time, it is impossible to fly directly to Varadero from Moscow.  Aeroflot makes direct flights to Havana, but the resort can be reached by transit flights, and to make it profitable, it is better to fly through Europe (Paris, Amsterdam, etc.).  The approximate price of an economy-class ticket in the low season is about 400 USD, and in the high - up to 1000 US dollars. </p><p>  From Havana to Varadero usually get either by bus or taxi.  But if you included a transfer in it during the design of the tour in Live Experience Varadero 4 * (Cuba), then you do not have to worry about transporting yourself to the resort: you will be met at the airport and comfortably delivered by bus or minibus (depending on the number of tourists) to the hotel.  You will reach Varadero in three and a half hours by bus and 2.5 hours by taxi. </p>
