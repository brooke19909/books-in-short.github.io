For example, this period is not as sultry as the summer months, but the temperature is still pleasant and allows you to swim in the sea.  In addition, the streets are becoming more quiet and calm.  Although there are still as many vacationers as in summer, there are no more diners around, because the beaches are not crammed with students and families with noisy children, because the school year has already begun.  Of course, the one who is going to visit this island for the first time in early autumn wonders whether it is reasonable to visit Cyprus in September and what can be expected from this time of year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus in September" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/995051.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  About the September weather </h2><p>  This month in Cyprus is considered the velvet season and is not much different from August.  Almost all thirty days a clear sky is maintained, and rain is a rare occurrence.  The wind, if any, is also insignificant.  Visiting this island in September, you simply add one more month of summer to yourself, because you will not meet a single hint that autumn has already arrived.  The only thing worth noting is that in 2015, a sandstorm suddenly covered this paradise.  In Cyprus, September had never before been accompanied by such elements.  In addition, this sandstorm was the most significant in the last hundred years.  Everyone hopes that the elements will no longer overshadow the rest and life on the island. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many people like that during this period the sea warms up so much that there is no significant difference when immersed in water.  If on the coast the air temperature is 28-32 degrees, then the water temperature is 26-28.  In Paphos, Larnaca and other resorts, the temperature may differ by a couple of degrees, but in any case it is high enough to continue to enjoy the summer.  But in the western part of the island these figures are slightly lower, and therefore people who can‚Äôt tolerate the heat are drawn there. </p><p>  With the onset of the evening it becomes a little cooler, and, walking along the shore, it is better to throw a blouse.  The temperature on rare nights can drop to 19 degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holidays in cyprus in september" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/995052.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It can be noted that Cyprus at the end of September is not so sultry.  It is still warm and soft, friendly for tourists and allows you to swim in the water.  There is still a danger of sunburn in the sun.  In addition, a little further from the coast, the temperature reaches 35 <sup>0</sup> C. Already in the last days, the approaching of rainy October begins to be felt, and tourists slowly leave the island. </p><h2>  How to have fun? </h2><p>  Of course, first of all, people travel to Cyprus in September in order to swim in the warm, welcoming and clean sea.  You can also get a real summer tan.  In the evening, when the temperature drops slightly, tourists, throwing light sweaters, go for walks in resort places. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But the local industry also offers fun.  So, in September, water parks are actively working, surfing, diving, fishing classes are offered.  You can also go on jeep or donkey safaris, ride bicycles, play golf, rent a horse.  But this is not all the entertainment that can be found in Cyprus.  Since the island is open to tourists, many of their wishes will be fulfilled. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus at the end of September" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/995079.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cultural events in September </h2><p>  The advantage of visiting Cyprus in September is that it is during this period that local holidays are held.  And visiting these events, you can fully get acquainted with the culture of the islanders.  For example, at the end of summer, a festival in honor of Dionysus begins and lasts until the beginning of September (only ten days).  This event has been celebrated year after year since 1961.  This festival takes place in Limassol and is accompanied by festivities, dancing, making sweets and wine tasting.  Absolutely anyone has the opportunity to become a party to the great holiday, so residents of the entire island and tourists come to it at least for a couple of days. </p><p>  Cyprus in September is a mass of festivals with a culinary bias.  They can try national dishes or delicious ice cream.  In the last days of the month, a beer festival takes place in Nicosia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cyprus in September prices" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/995048.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Another event is celebrated at the end of September since 1985.  This is the Ayia Napa festival.  Here, the main attention is paid to the culture, history and agriculture of the islanders.  At Seferis Square, performances and all kinds of performances are organized.  Naturally, it can not do without exhibitions and sales of products with a local flavor and historical bias, as well as opening days. </p><p>  In addition, there is another event that attracts many tourists <span>to Cyprus.</span>  <span>Tours for</span> September are very popular among rally fans, because it is here that the most difficult stage of the World Cup is held. </p><h2>  Prices in early fall </h2><p>  Many travelers hope that everything will be much cheaper for them if they travel to Cyprus in the fall.  In September, prices remain the same as in the summer, so you should not count on this.  The fact is that in the beginning of autumn there are still as many tourists, and the weather does not feel at all that a dull time is coming.  True, shopaholics can feel the joy, since it is in September that most stores begin to attract significant discounts and large-scale sales.  Therefore, at this time you can buy a great quality thing and very inexpensive. </p><h2>  Island Attractions </h2>

Many guides offering their services will gladly show historical values.  For example, this is the bathhouse of Aphrodite, which is unusually beautiful, the <span>castle of Kolossi,</span> remaining from the beginning of the 13th century, the tombs of kings, the first of which was founded in the 3rd century BC  Also, you should definitely visit the ancient village of Eroskipos and the ancient city of Amathus.

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Having once visited Cyprus in September, many tourists dream of returning there at this time of year.  This is evidenced by numerous reviews.
