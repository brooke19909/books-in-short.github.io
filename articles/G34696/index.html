    <p>  Russlavbank offers a variety of deposits.  The product line is simplified to the maximum.  Clients do not have to make a difficult choice between high interest rates and soft partnership conditions.  Today, there are three options to choose from: </p><ul><li>  <em>The program "Golden Mill".</em>  The interest on the deposit can be up to 15.5%.  The maximum income for ruble deposits is provided.  The combustion of interest is not provided. </li><li>  <em>The program "All the pros."</em>  Deposit can be issued at 12.35%.  The deposit currency can be either national or euro or dollars.  Capitalization of interest is provided.  Partial withdrawal and expenditure of funds without loss of accrued interest is allowed. </li><li>  <em>The “Super Deposit” program</em> for deposits in euros or dollars. </li></ul><p>  The bank's customers, evaluating the financial offers available on the market, agree with the fact that Russlavbank offers deposits in foreign currency and in rubles on the most favorable terms.  Compared to the products that were called the most profitable and which Russlavbank offered only a few years ago (special deposit), the new products turned out to be even more profitable and convenient.  However, in a crisis, this parameter is not the main one.  Due to the bankruptcy and restructuring of such giants of the domestic market as “Financial Initiative” and “Finance and Credit”, investors began to actively withdraw their money, turning a blind eye to the loss of interest.  What was their surprise when the bank unconditionally paid the bills.  The most interesting thing is that the massive outflow of funds at the end of 2014 and at the beginning of 2015 did not cause liquidity problems. </p><h2>  2014 Collapse </h2><p>  In 2014, people began to walk around in the company about what could soon turn into a bankrupt and the well-known Russlavbank in the country.  The revocation of the license that many financial institutions of the country encountered did not have a place, moreover, the issue was not even discussed in this regard.  The thing is that it was in the spring of 2014 that the Ministry of Internal Affairs conducted an investigation about "illegal banking activities."  Not only Russlavbank was searched, the reviews of employees about which were always impeccable, but also an organization such as Finprombank and some travel agencies.  The suspect in the case was <span>Alexander Mironov,</span> who holds the post of vice president.  According to law enforcement agencies, seven people were accused of illegally withdrawing funds and withdrawing funds through private one-day companies.  Preliminary data indicated that 2.5 billion rubles passed through hands each month.  Withdrawal of cash cost 3.5% of the amount, and transit cost 0.3%.  Excessive attention to the bank has caused concern among depositors.  In fact, it turned out that Russlavbank (it offers deposits for individuals as convenient as possible today) had nothing to do with fraudulent activities.  The management of the bank provided full assistance, including all requested documents.  There are no claims to the financial institution by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  The current situation is unpleasant, but does not leave an imprint on the fulfillment by a financial institution of obligations to customers.  The bank both worked and is operating normally. </p><h2>  CONTACT - an innovation for customers </h2>

    <p>  As in any computer program, in the CONTACT system, its users had to face a number of inconveniences.  This left a certain negative imprint on the reputation of Russlavbank Bank, the reviews on loans and deposits of which in most cases are positive.  User indignation was due to the system freezing in the early stages of its operation.  It so happened that when it became necessary to send funds, the functional turned out to be completely inoperative.  As the payment system developed and improved, mistakes were eliminated and discontent became less.  However, there are single cases that attract attention.  So, according to one of the bank's customers, when sending a transfer to America, it was never delivered to the recipient.  After a long delay in time, the problem did not resolve, and the funds had to be returned to the sender.  But the most interesting thing is that after a long conversation with the support service, the refund was carried out outside the regulations.  Instead of the promised five days, the transfer was returned for several weeks.  According to statistics, in 95% of situations, Russlavbank has positive customer reviews, and such a collapse is more an exception to the rule than a regularity.  More positive feedback sounds about the design of translations, which takes a minimum of time and is as simple as possible. </p><h2>  To summarize: does the bank deserve trust? </h2><p>  Summing up and looking at the situation in the country's banking sector, we can say that Russlavbank does not have significant shortcomings.  Reviews (Banks. Ru) are both negative and positive.  Gratitude and eulogies are much more than indignation.  You can come across descriptions of unpleasant situations that the support service instantly responds to.  The solution to the question may be delayed, but the result does not change.  Pleasant consultants and a manager live and by telephone answer all questions, try to help clients with all available means.  Despite the problems of domestic banks related to liquidity, Russlavbank continues to actively work and develop.  Deposits are paid, there are no complaints from investors.  Against the background of general losses, the situation can be called a big advantage.  The only thing worth paying attention to is spam mailings in the format of SMS messages.  There are a huge number of complaints on this issue.  According to the bank’s customers, a notification regarding loan approval is systematically sent to the phone with a request to contact the department and apply for a loan.  After a person, throwing all the things, comes to the office, he is refused.  The situation has been repeating for a long time.  Requests to remove the number from the SMS mailing list are not considered, the problem is not solved.  Bank customers also warn that you need to carefully read the agreements for this category of loans.  Interest on them is not always beneficial.  By being vigilant, conflicts can be avoided in the future.  If this deficiency is eliminated, cooperation with a financial institution will bring customers only one pleasure. </p>
