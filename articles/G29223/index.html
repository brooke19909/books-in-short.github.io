Every year more and more travelers decide to go here on vacation.  It used to be that living in the UAE, even in a budget hotel, would be expensive, but now in Dubai there are many five-star complexes offering affordable rooms.  How to choose the best option among them?  First of all, you should focus on the location and reviews of tourists.  If you prefer to live in a city rather than on the coast, then Crowne Plaza Dubai is the place to go.  You can study the photos, description of rooms, infrastructure and entertainment program below. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  It is important to immediately decide where you want to live in Dubai.  This is a huge metropolis, divided into several large areas.  In their reviews, tourists say the hotel has a superb location.  It is located in the central part of Dubai, completely built up with tall buildings and skyscrapers in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãlarge shopping centers.  Because of this, it can be noisy on the streets even at night, but you can easily get to the main attractions of the city.  Crowne Plaza Dubai address may not be required.  Locals will certainly tell you the right direction.  But just in case, write down: Sheikh Zayed Al Nahyan Road, PO 23215, Dubai, United Arab Emirates. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="25.2208018" data-lng="55.28000610000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/9/9/4/16994.png"></div><p>  Opposite the hotel itself is the International Conference Center.  Large shopping centers can be reached in 10-20 minutes by car, bus or metro.  The famous Burj Khalifa, considered the tallest in the world, is 3 km from the hotel.  It can be reached in just 5 minutes.  The nearest metro station is 400 meters from the hotel.  Nearby are also many restaurants, cafes, bars and office buildings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But the local beaches are about 3 km away from the hotel.  Therefore, if you plan to stay in it, then be prepared to travel to the sea every day.  The hotel itself offers its guests a free bus that will daily take them to the city beach and pick them up, so the road to it should not cause you much difficulty. </p><p>  The nearest international airport is located near Dubai itself.  The hotel is approximately 8.5 km from it.  Tourists can reach the hotel in about 20 minutes.  The easiest way to buy a ticket is to include a transfer from the airport and back, but if you wish, you can also get to the hotel yourself by taxi or metro. </p><h2>  detailed information </h2><p>  Crowne Plaza Hotel Dubai belongs to the hotel chain of the same name, whose complexes are open in many major cities of the world.

Since it is very hot in Dubai at any time of the year, each room is equipped with air conditioning.  A mini fridge is provided for a fee, where you can leave drinks and groceries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.goldenbeachtravel.ir" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bathroom" class="if uuid-3204323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/3204323.jpg"></div><p>  Some rooms are additionally equipped with a kitchenette, where there is an electric kettle, dishes and accessories for making hot drinks.  Upon check-in, all guests are provided with a set of bath accessories and towels, as well as bathrobes and slippers.  Upon arrival, tourists are treated to fresh seasonal fruits.  The bathroom has a make-up mirror and hairdryer. </p><p>  Free of charge in the entire hotel tourists can connect to wireless Internet.  You can leave your valuables and documents in the room in the safe.  There are telephones in the living rooms with which you can contact the property.  However, other calls are subject to additional charges. </p><h2>  Catering </h2><p>  The Crowne Plaza Dubai Festival has 5 restaurants, where tourists can enjoy Italian, Japanese, Brazilian and international dishes.  The cost of their visit will depend on the chosen concept of food.  If you pay only for breakfast, then you will eat for free only in the morning.  They are served in the main buffet restaurant.  International cuisine is served.  Gluten-free and vegetarian menus are available upon request for free.  If you want to buy half or full board, then several visits to these restaurants will be included in the price.  To do this, you must reserve a table in advance with the hotel administrator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="roundtravel.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Buffet" class="if uuid-3204315" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/3204315.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that during Ramadan on the territory of the hotel it is forbidden to drink any alcoholic beverages.  Any recreational activities at this time are also not held. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Since the Crowne Plaza Dubai Deira is considered a five-star hotel, it offers the appropriate infrastructure.  For the convenience of guests on its territory there is a 24-hour reception desk, where the administrator will help all guests to exchange currency for a local one, buy tickets for an excursion and an entertainment event, as well as rent a car.  There is a mini market, a beauty salon and a laundry on the ground floor of the hotel.  They provide their services for a fee.  Tourists will always be able to cash money at an ATM.  The hotel has its own car parking, where guests can leave their car for free at any time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ihg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Main hall" class="if uuid-3204327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/3204327.jpg"></div><p>  Celebrate a celebration or a memorable event in the banquet hall.  For businessmen, the hotel has several conference rooms that can accommodate from 60 to 1800 delegates.  All of them are equipped with the necessary computer equipment, as well as projectors. </p><h2>  Does the hotel have its own beach? </h2><p>  Tourists who choose their place to stay in Dubai, often confuse this hotel with another complex Crowne Plaza Dubai Festival City, which has a very similar name.  The fact is that it is located on the coast, and the described hotel is within the city.  Therefore, it is impossible to recommend it for a beach holiday.  Of course, all tourists who want to swim and sunbathe by the sea are taken to the city beach by free bus, but the hotel does not have its own stretch of coast.  Guests are provided with not only a shuttle service, but also towels.  But for the sun loungers and umbrellas will have to pay separately.  The nearest beach at the hotel is sandy, and the entrance to it is flat, without holes.  Therefore, tourists with young children can swim here. </p><p>  The hotel has an outdoor pool for those guests who do not want to spend time on the road for the sea.  Next to it is a sun terrace, where each guest can use umbrellas and sunbeds for free. </p><h2>  Other entertainment options </h2><p>  It is worth recalling once again that this hotel has a similar name to another complex of this network Crowne Plaza Dubai Festival City, which is located right on the coast.  However, this hotel was built in the city center, so there are not too many options for leisure.  Tourists can use the gym, sauna or steam room for free.  The hotel has a spa, but its services are not included in the price and are paid separately.  Crowne Plaza Dubai does not have its own animation, so tourists will have to plan their leisure on their own. </p><h2>  Conditions for placing with small children </h2><p>  It has already been noted above that Crowne Plaza Dubai welcomes tourists with children of any age.  For newborns and infants, a cradle is provided in the room.  Older children can stay at the hotel at a discount if they do not occupy a separate bed.  Babysitting services are available for a fee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goslar.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Children's menu" class="if uuid-3204317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/3204317.jpg"></div><p>  All restaurants in the complex are equipped with high chairs for feeding, which tourists can request for free.  A special children's menu is also provided, but for a fee. </p><p>  But the entertainment for the kids in the complex is quite small.  For younger guests, there is a safe compartment in the pool, as well as a playground.  Board games are available upon request, but there are still no children‚Äôs animations or a mini club at the hotel. </p><h2>  Positive feedback on Crowne Plaza Dubai </h2><p>  Often, tourists are satisfied with the rest in this hotel, noting that the level of service here corresponds to the cost of the trip.  In their reviews, they call it a good place to stay in the center of Dubai, and also recommend it to young couples and adults traveling without small children. </p><p>  What did guests like most about Crowne Plaza Dubai?  In the reviews, they indicate the following advantages: </p><ol><li>  Convenient location.  Near the hotel there is a metro station with which you can quickly get to any part of the city.  Guests liked the nearby famous Burj Khalifa skyscraper and many shopping centers. </li><li>  Friendly staff, especially administrators who are always attentive to the requests of tourists.  All their problems are resolved as soon as possible.  Also, guests of the hotel note that sometimes administrators settled them in more expensive rooms, without requiring an additional fee. </li><li>  Spacious pool located on the third floor.  For tourists, there are always free sun loungers on which you can sunbathe for free.  It also offers fruit and chilled towels. </li><li>  Although the repair in the rooms is already outdated, the living rooms are closely monitored for cleanliness.  Maids carefully clean all rooms daily, towels and bed linen also change in a timely manner. </li><li>  A variety of lunches and dinners.  Tourists can choose to visit several restaurants with different cuisines at once, so they don‚Äôt have time to get fed. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="roundtravel.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel corridors" class="if uuid-3204319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/3204319.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Of course, ideal hotels do not exist, so sometimes tourists leave negative feedback about the Crowne Plaza Dubai complex.  Some of them consider the shortcomings to be insignificant, others - note that the hotel does not correspond to the status of a five-star.  To understand whether this hotel is really suitable for you, before buying a ticket, you should find out about its shortcomings.  In their reviews, tourists most often indicated the following disadvantages of local service: </p><ol><li>  Poor soundproofing of rooms.  Firstly, tourists complain that at night they can hear the noise of passing cars from the street.  Therefore, sleeping with open windows is problematic.  Secondly, guests describe in reviews that noise is also heard from other rooms, especially if their neighbors are not quiet. </li><li>  Outdated number of rooms.  Living rooms are in need of repair, because their condition is clearly not consistent with the status of a five-star hotel.  Some non-smoking rooms also smell like tobacco smoke. </li><li>  Bathrooms are also equipped with outdated equipment, sometimes even broken.  In the shower, either very hot or icy water constantly runs. </li><li>  Unscrupulous hotel staff, namely the cleaning lady.  They can enter the room even if there is a sign on the door indicating that guests should not be disturbed.  In addition, in the reviews, tourists describe several cases of theft of equipment from rooms. </li><li>  Monotonous breakfasts.  Every day, the restaurant serves the same dishes that quickly get bored. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One of the restaurants" class="if uuid-3204313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/3204313.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, the Crowne Plaza Dubai hotel is a good option for those who want to settle in a five-star complex in the central part of Dubai at an affordable price.  But you should be prepared for the fact that the rooms here do not differ in exquisite interiors and need repair.  In addition, be sure to keep your belongings with you or leave them in a safe for storage. </p>
