  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A tree of hearts: beautiful cards and DIY paintings</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A tree with leaf-hearts as a card can be made on Valentine's Day, for your beloved girl or mother on March 8.  Such work is carried out in a variety of ways.  A tree can be made voluminous by setting a craft on a piece of cardboard, or by attaching leaflets to real branches. </p><p>  In the article, we will learn how to make a tree of hearts in the form of an application on thick paper in several ways.  The photographs presented will help to quickly understand the principle of manufacturing and preparing small parts to create a beautiful picture.  Depending on the depicted season, the leaves can be cut out of paper in different shades - from pale yellow to dark green.  You can create a craft of a fabulous plant, in which the leaves convey completely unusual colors for the trees. </p><p>  If a tree of hearts is made as a gift to your girlfriend or mother, then you can cut small details from red paper. </p><h2>  Design paper tree </h2><p>  Postcard looks unusual due to the fact that all the details are cut from printed paper.  That the trunk, that the leaves are not monophonic, but multi-colored, with fragments of some kind of image.  It seems that the pages of the old glossy magazine were used as material for work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.deshilachado.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful card" class="if uuid-3077880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3077880.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, the contours of a tree trunk with branches are drawn with a simple pencil on the back of the paper.  Then all the elements are carefully cut with scissors, and the tree is attached to the background paper with PVA glue.  Next, there will be painstaking work on cutting out leaflets in the shape of a heart.  Here it is necessary to use one template so that all elements of the tree of hearts are the same size. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Stick the leaves in a chaotic manner.  The main thing is to fill the entire space of the crown.  Several copies can be placed outside the circle, giving vividness to the image.  It seems that the wind is blowing and a few leaves come off and fly to the ground. </p><h2>  Drawn tree with volumetric leaves </h2><p>  A tree with hearts with your own hands can be made in the following original way.  On a large piece of thick paper, draw a black gouache tree with ornate branches.  It looks interesting in love with a pair of birds sitting opposite each other in the center of the crown.  Even branches grew around them in the shape of a heart. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ar.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="volumetric leaves" class="if uuid-3077891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3077891.jpg"></div><p>  Then, separately cut out a lot of hearts from double-sided thick red paper.  To make them look voluminous, they are not attached to the sheet itself, but to a low stand.  It can be a plastic bottle cap, a piece of foam sheet or corrugated packaging board.  To attach such elements use a glue gun.  The picture can be framed in a wooden frame and hung on the wall in the room. </p><h2>  Barrel shaped brush </h2><p>  A tree of hearts with a trunk in the form of the contours of a child‚Äôs brush looks spectacular.  It will turn out not only a beautiful card for mom for the holiday, but also a memory about the size of her palm for life.  Crafts can be made both from paper with printed print, and from ordinary color.  Leaflets are made not only from green paper in the shape of a heart, but also from red.  It seems that a flowering tree is depicted, which is especially appropriate for the March postcard. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ar.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tree shaped brush" class="if uuid-3077882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3077882.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see in the picture above, the leaves are made of different sizes.  Large parts are glued first, and then the voids are filled with small elements of the application. </p><h2>  Volumetric tree </h2><p>  The next version of a tree made of paper hearts looks original due to the beautiful arrangement of details on the crown.  The tree itself is painted or cut out from plain paper.  The main work remains on the leaves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heart-shaped tree" class="if uuid-3077868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3077868.jpg"></div><p>  They are created from hearts of different sizes.  Since this is a flowering tree, the first thing they do is make large flowers.  Each petal is assembled from two hearts folded in half and alternately glued with the lower half on a sheet and on top of each other.  The remaining petals are formed in the same way. </p><p>  There are round-shaped flowers in the picture, but there are also semicircles and details consisting of 2 or 3 elements.  The voids are filled with individual small hearts, and it is clearly necessary to arrange a round crown.  You can complement the picture with a couple of birds, in which the wings are also made of a heart folded in half. </p><p>  If you liked the options for making beautiful cards with the image of a tree and original leaves in the shape of a heart, then try to make such crafts yourself. </p>
