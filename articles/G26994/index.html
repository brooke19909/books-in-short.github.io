    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Lake Orlinskoye is a reservoir that stretches from south to east.  Its area is 5 km, width - 500 m, depth - 4 m. A dense forest is located on its shores, in some areas it completely approaches the water, and in others, on the contrary, it is far away.  Here you can find aspen, birch and coniferous trees.  In the northern part of Lake Orlin, the shores are quite low, sometimes marshy.  In the south - high with small hills.  The lake is located at the top of the tributary <span>of the Oredezh River.</span>  Thanks to the waters of Divenka, streams and numerous keys, the main food of the reservoir occurs.  This is the <span>cleanest lake</span> in the area. <strong></strong></p><p>  Some summer residents are happy to overcome the distance of 5 km on foot in order to come to rest on Lake Orlin.  Bathing in it brings amazing pleasure.  The bottom is sandy, but in some places you can stumble on small stones and driftwood.  On one of the shores beautiful alleys are broken, a beach for relaxation is equipped. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Vegetable world </h2><p>  Almost 30% of Lake Orlinsky is overgrown with various <span>aquatic plants,</span> such as egg-caps, reeds, elodea, and reeds.  Coniferous and mixed forests surround it, in some places they are quite dense.  However, spruce is the dominant tree, and birch and aspen trees only complement the beauty of the needles with their green foliage.  Sometimes you will find willows that grow in close proximity to water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eagle lake swimming" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/775396.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Animal world </h2><p>  Orlyn Lake, fishing in which will always please the catch, is rich in many species of fish.  Back in 1950, about a thousand fry of carp were launched here.  In the last century there were quite a lot of them, as the fish took root, but today, unfortunately, only a few instances remain. </p><p>  Here live gudgeons, pikes, perches, roach, bream and others.  At the moment, the most common fish in the lake is pike.  Fishermen who catch on mugs and zerglovniki never leave empty-handed.  Also a good place for fishing would be areas overgrown with grass under steep slopes.  In the area where the lake connects with the river, roach and ide are well caught. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eagle lake fishing" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/775405.jpg"></div>

Even then, there was game, which the locals often hunted, mushrooms and berries grew.  The plant and the future village were separated by a dense pine grove.  An important role in the distribution of the population was played by a certain factor - the nearby location of such a great city as St. Petersburg. </li><li>  <em>The village of Orlino.</em>  Unusual people have long lived in the village.  They believed that Lake Orlinskoye, near which they live, was tiled at the bottom.  But, alas, it is too overgrown with algae, so no one has been able to refute this legend to this day.  Since the existence of the <span>Union of Soviet</span> Socialist Republics (USSR), the number of inhabitants has decreased significantly.  If in 1928 about 1000 people lived here, by 2010 this figure had significantly decreased - 300 people. </li><li>  <em>The villages of Zaozerye and Simankovo.</em>  These settlements are connected by bus.  This provides connectivity with larger villages.  Unfortunately, they also cannot boast of a large population.  This mark is already reaching a critical state.  According to information, today 64 people live in Zaozerye, and only 16 in Simankovo. These figures are due to the fact that the younger generation leaves villages where there are no prospects, taking their parents and other relatives with them.  There are only those who simply have nowhere to go. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="settlements near lake Orlinskoe" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/775409.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  There are many legends about the origin of the name of the reservoir.  One of the most common is about Peter I, who, during a hunt, killed an eagle flying over the surface of the lake.  This legend appeared around 1499 and almost completely replaced the rest of the options. </p>
