The most basic of them is financial.  Of all the existing materials, the foam block has positively proven itself in all respects.  It is not too expensive, practical and durable.  Those who choose it inevitably face the question of how much it costs to build a house from foam blocks.  There is no single answer, but there is a chance to calculate everything individually and independently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does it cost to build a house from foam blocks" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/413873.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The approximate cost of a house of foam blocks </h2><p>  The average cost of building a ‚Äúbox‚Äù falls into the price range of 300-600 thousand rubles.  Why so expensive?  This amount includes not only walls, but also the <span>foundation, basement,</span> frame under the roof.  But windows, doors, the roof itself are not taken into account, only the bare "skeleton". </p><p>  Depending on the region, respectively, the price of consumables varies slightly.  So, for example, in the middle zone of Russia, one cube of foam blocks (28 pieces) costs about 3000-3500 rubles.  In the northern regions, the price is slightly higher.  Depending on the size of the building, the number of partitions in it, the cost of the house from foam blocks also varies. </p><h2>  Foundation </h2><p>  Since foam blocks are a fairly light material, there is no particular need to make a solid foundation.  Lightweight enough with mandatory reinforcing ligament.  Ideally, even at the stage of the project, it is necessary to clearly distinguish between where and what size the premises will be, in order to make a foundation along their perimeter.  This will give the structure strength and durability.  Think about it before you build a house out of foam blocks.  The cost of this will not increase much. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the cost of a house of foam blocks" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/413876.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, for example, you can make high, with the expectation that there will be an attic or, on the contrary, a small one.  The cost of <span>building a house from foam blocks</span> implies that about 5% of the amount will go to the roof frame.  Depending on the price of lumber in your region, it may take from 3,000 to 10,000 rubles. </p><h2>  House 9 * 8.  How to calculate the amount? </h2><p>  Having the approximate <span>dimensions of the house,</span> you can make an elementary calculation.  So, first you need to find out the area and perimeter of the future structure.  This is done according to an elementary mathematical formula.  The area will be 72 square meters, and the perimeter will be 34 meters.  It is noteworthy that the last figure for the foundation is slightly higher - 42. Given the fact that the minimum width for the solid structure is 2 meters.  The cost of building a house from foam blocks consists of the price of the foundation, roofing frame, basement and walls.  The latter - net of windows and doors.  On average, about 100,000 rubles will take to fill the foundation, depending on the prices in your region for the material. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="build a house of foam blocks Price" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/413874.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  No house can be put on a bare foundation.  Requires at least a base of 5-6 bricks high.  This will take about 40 thousand rubles.  Please note that this is without the cost of work.  Typically, builders take about 30-50% of the price of the material. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Further calculation of the cost of a house of foam blocks depends on the number of floors of your building and the height of the walls.  It is optimal to make three-meter ceilings.  Firstly, it will be easier to breathe indoors.  Secondly, with <span>interior decoration</span> it is easier to adjust the material.  If you take as a basis the height of the walls of 3 meters, then foam blocks will require approximately 28 cubic meters.  With a small margin.  At a cost of about 100,000 rubles.  Bare walls without decoration (external and internal).  And, of course, without openings. </p><h2>  Windows and doors - minus </h2><p>  Decide in advance how many windows will be in your house and what size they will be.  For a building size of 9 * 8, it is optimal to make 5-6 windows of medium size.  For example, 1.5 * 1.5 meters.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãone window is 2.25 m. There are 6 of them in the house. So, you need to subtract 13.5 square meters from the perimeter of the walls.  By simple calculations it turns out that you need to lay out much less.  Only 88.5 square meters.  Naturally, the door also needs to be subtracted.  <span>The size of the doorways</span> and their number depends on your desire.  On average, this can save about 20-30 thousand rubles, which significantly reduces the amount of costs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calculation of the cost of a house from foam blocks" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/413871.jpg" width="524"></div>

    <h2>  Floor overlap </h2><p>  This expense item is rolling.  It all depends on the material.  More and more people who are wondering how much it costs to build a house out of foam blocks are inclined to believe that it is better to make floors from concrete slabs.  Provided that the house has more than one floor.  In other cases, a standard wood floor is sufficient.  Be sure to pay attention to how the material is processed.  The term of its operation depends on this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  How much money will it take?  For a house with one floor - at the price of wood.  If you take into account the size of 9 * 8, then this is about 5-10 thousand rubles.  For a house with several floors - at the price of stoves.  It all depends on the quality of the material and the region - from 10 to 50 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the cost of building a house from foam blocks" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/413872.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Solution </h2><p>  What you can not do without in building a house is a cement-sand mortar.  It must be not only done correctly, but also acquired everything you need.  So, for example, the cost of one bag of cement will cost 200-300 rubles.  A large-scale construction such as a house will require about 100 bags.  Given the foundation.  By simple calculations, 30,000 rubles are obtained only for cement.  And it still requires sand.  Here everyone decides for himself: to order or bring it yourself, if possible.  For example, such a building requires at least 1 ton of good sifted sand.  Buy it or carry it yourself - your business.  On average, 1 ton of sand costs 2-3 thousand rubles.  This is not a very extensive expense item, but it does have a place to be. </p><h2>  Insulation </h2><p>  After the ‚Äúbox‚Äù under the house is ready, she needs to settle down.  Foam blocks - this is a material that has a small, but quite noticeable percentage of shrinkage.  To proceed with the internal and external decoration, it is necessary to give the house about a year to upset.  During this time, under his weight, he will take the final form, height. </p><p>  When wondering how much it costs to build a house from foam blocks, include such an article in the estimate as a heater.  Selecting it is a problem.  First of all, because there are so many varieties.  For a house of foam blocks, it is better to choose either polystyrene foam, or angelin.  If everything is clear with the first: it is lightweight, does not let air through, and is durable - then the second needs to be discussed separately.  Angelin is a <span>roll insulation</span> that works according to the principle of a thermos: it does not give up heat from the inside, it does not let in cold from the outside.  In addition, it is moisture resistant, easy to install (mounted on a construction stapler or self-tapping screws), durable.  The cost of materials does not differ much: for one meter about 30-50 rubles, depending on the thickness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the cost of building a house from foam blocks" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/413870.jpg" width="456"></div>

    <h2>  Interior decoration </h2><p>  Perhaps, everything is limited solely by your desires and imagination.  Traditionally, gypsum board is used as a <span>finishing material for walls</span> .  Firstly, it is durable.  Secondly, it is easy to install.  Thirdly, they can make not only straight and smooth walls, but also various kinds of niches, levels, even arches.  The only drawback is the fragility of the material.  But this is not so significant, despite the fact that you are going to build a house from foam blocks.  The average price per sheet of ordinary drywall varies in the region of 200-300 rubles, moisture resistant (for the bathroom, for example) - 50-100 rubles more.  The amount of material depends on the size of the house and the number of storeys.  It is recommended to purchase drywall in batches for each room with a small margin of one or two sheets. </p><p>  Naturally, a frame will also be required for wall decoration.  No matter how smooth the walls were.  Metal or wood is your business.  The cost is not much different: from 100 to 300 rubles per linear meter of staff. </p><p>  Pay particular attention to the rough floor.  If a large load is meant (for example, a huge aquarium in the room), then it is more advisable to make a concrete screed.  It is expensive and long, but durable.  The services of workers in this case amount to at least 50% of the cost of materials.  If there is no need to make a screed, then you can trust the good old floors from the boards.  Remember, the smoother the rough floor, the easier it is to lay the floor covering in the future.  Ceiling coating can be absolutely anything.  There are no specific tips, and the financial side depends only on your capabilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="approximate cost of a house from foam blocks" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/413869.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Exterior finish </h2><p>  Foam blocks, although it is durable, and resistant to natural weather conditions, need external decoration.  Than?  For example, siding so popular at the moment.  Metal expensive, but more durable and wear-resistant, plastic - budget, easy to install, durable.  In addition, you can simply plaster the walls, and then paint.  On average, about 50-150 thousand rubles, including the work of masters, are spent on exterior decoration. </p><p>  When wondering how much it costs to build a house from foam blocks, remember that all expenses are purely individual.  On average, 400 thousand rubles are spent on a bare ‚Äúbox‚Äù.  But all other expenses are significant: finishing material, windows, doors, roofing.  How much can a small foam block house cost?  In 2-3 million.  Not as much as it seems at first glance.  Especially if you approach the costs carefully and wisely.  Do not save on material, it depends on how long and safely your home will serve you. </p>
