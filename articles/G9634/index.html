However, at the same time, not all people are aware that any contribution is a significant risk, especially when it comes to not quite stable currencies.  In this article, we will consider what is the most stable currency in the world today, its features, and also will review other strong national monetary units of the planet, which can also aspire to lead in the future in the financial sector. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.popsci.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The most reliable currency in the world" class="if uuid-2948871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/2948871.jpg"></div><h2>  The situation with the ruble </h2><p>  The Russian currency is far from the best option for imitating other money.  That's all, because if we analyze the trend from the period of the creation of the ruble to its current state, it becomes clear: the currency almost constantly shows negative indicators, decreasing in relation to other money.  Literally over the past 20 years, ‚Äúwooden‚Äù (the name the people have the Russian ruble) has fallen in price relative to the US dollar by almost 14 times. </p><h2>  Absolute leader </h2><p>  When studying world currencies, it is worth paying close attention to a country called Switzerland.  Yes, not every one of us will immediately find this little power on the map, but for many years this country has been confidently holding the palm in its economic and financial stability.  In this regard, we can say with full confidence that the most stable currency in the world is the Swiss franc.  This fact is largely explained by the wise macroeconomic policies of the state leadership, as well as the presence of bank secrecy, guaranteeing confidentiality to an individual, company, corporation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 2011, the franc had a real opportunity to grow against the euro due to the economic crisis in the EU, but the head of the National Bank of Switzerland made a seemingly unpopular decision for many people in the post-Soviet space - not to allow the franc to grow above 1.2 euros, i.e. keep your own currency from strengthening. </p><div class="photo" data-original="peru.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Swiss frank" class="if uuid-2949966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2949966.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, the fact that the strongest currency in the world does not allow its own sharp rise and devaluation is very important from the point of view of investors who can safely make their investments in francs or keep bank savings using these banknotes, without worrying about sharp jumps in the exchange rate in one direction or another. </p><h2>  Miracle from the Middle Kingdom </h2><p>  Of course, it cannot be stated unequivocally that the most stable currency is the Chinese yuan.  Despite its authority, the Asian banknote is still not the undisputed leader.  Nevertheless, this monetary unit confidently holds the second position in the conditional rating of the most powerful national currencies in the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="qz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="World money" class="if uuid-2948883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/2948883.jpg"></div><p>  The yuan began to gain strength after in 2005 it lost its peg to the US dollar.  In the past few years, Chinese government leaders have embarked on a managed devaluation of their own currency in order to increase the economic growth of the state.  At the same time, against the ruble, the yuan has risen in price by 228% over the past ten years. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Third place </h2><p>  Studying the question, what is the most stable currency in the world, one cannot but pay attention to the Israeli shekel.  Many will not understand why he is, but the whole point is that his course, although floating, is still quite stable.  Over the past decade, the shekel has ‚Äúslightly sagged‚Äù against the US dollar. </p><h2>  Norwegian Krone </h2><p>  It was she who was the most stable currency of the planet in 2008-2009 according to HSBC analysts.  It should be understood that <span>the Norwegian economy</span> is very dependent on the volume of oil exports, and therefore the kroon is at risk because the price of oil fluctuates.  But nevertheless, the state managed to accumulate a colossal reserve fund, which allows maintaining the crown at a high and stable level for a rather long period of time. </p><h2>  Money of the Land of the Rising Sun </h2><p>  The post-war ‚Äúeconomic miracle‚Äù of the Japanese has led their yen to be one of the most reliable and stable currencies in the world for many years.  At the same time, inflation in the state is within 1.2%, and denomination has not been carried out over the past 65 years even once.  All this suggests that this currency can be trusted. </p><p>  The Japanese yen to the dollar today has a ratio of 100 to 0.89.  But it was not always so.  Six years ago, the Japanese yen against the dollar had a rate of 1 to 1.25, but due to the decline in interest in high-tech products of Asians, the value of their currency decreased. </p><div class="photo" data-original="techcrunch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chinese currency" class="if uuid-2948909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/2948909.jpg"></div><p>  Rumor has it that soon Japanese bankers will begin to actively allocate very large amounts for the purchase of gold in order to maximize their currency.  By the way, Japan is now in eighth position in the world in terms of gold reserves, which also cannot but have a positive effect on the yen. </p><h2>  Near East </h2><p>  Currently, the Kuwaiti dinar is the most expensive currency in the world.  In rubles, you will need to give more than 200 units for one Kuwaiti dinar.  This course can be explained by the huge export of oil from Kuwait to the world market. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thebalance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="European currency" class="if uuid-2948888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/2948888.jpg"></div><p>  The Bahraini dinar is another national currency of the Middle East region, which is distinguished by its stability in general and high cost in relation to the Russian ruble.  This situation is due to the impressive oil reserves of this small country. </p><p>  Such a currency of the world as the Omani rial also cannot be forgotten in the review of the most powerful monetary units of the planet.  The rial is so strong that the government of Oman issues bills, the face value of which is 1/2 and even 1/4. </p><h2>  European titanium </h2><p>  The EU currency - the euro - is, in principle, not the most stable currency, but is still quite strong.  It goes without saying, but how could it be otherwise if the euro goes to the European continent in several dozen countries, among which there are a lot of economic real ‚Äúheavyweights‚Äù.  In addition, the euro is the second reserve currency in the world, which covers 22.2% of all savings on the planet, while the US dollar, this figure is 62.3%. </p><h2>  Misty Albion Money </h2><p>  The British pound is consistently among the leaders in terms of value on the planet.  By the way, the colonies of the Kingdom also issue their notes, quoted for British money in a 1: 1 ratio, although they have a different appearance.  However, the native English people are extremely reluctant to accept ‚Äúother‚Äù pounds as payment for goods and services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newsrecaps.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="UAE money" class="if uuid-2948892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/2948892.jpg"></div><h2>  American money </h2><p>  The US dollar due to the fact that it is the main world reserve currency, got the opportunity of its "circulation" around the world.  Simply put, with this money everyone can pay in almost any country on earth.  At the same time, in 2018, the dollar is not as good as it was before.  Even the Thai currency was able to show a higher rate of own growth than the US national currency. </p><div class="photo" data-original="techcrunch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Money in the wallet" class="if uuid-2948900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/2948900.jpg"></div><h2>  Australian currency </h2><p>  The Australian dollar is the currency used by the whole mainland.  Largely because of this, this money is quite popular in the world, since it covers a very large planetary region.  At the same time, Australia is torn from other countries of the world geographically and takes a militarily neutral position.  Thanks to all this, the national <span>currency of Australia</span> is strong and stable.  This dollar is also called raw, because with its help they pay for oil, chemical and agricultural products and other supplies to the world market from this continent. </p><p>  I would also like to note that the most reliable world currencies are not only the above money, but also, in the opinion of the respected American financial holding company JP Morgan, the Singapore dollar.  It is this monetary unit that draws attention not only to the giant of the US financial sector, but also to the World Bank, which in turn again predicts the beginning of a new crisis in the period 2018-2019, which repeats itself with a frequency of 10 years.  At the same time, the Singapore dollar seems to one of the most resistant to recession currencies to modern specialists, able to withstand and successfully withstand all the difficulties and threats of a critical period in the global economy and financing. </p>
