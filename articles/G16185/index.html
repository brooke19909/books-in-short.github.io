    <p>  And so what is especially plentiful in this area, so it is shops for every taste and a purse - both huge hypermarkets, and small specialized shops. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  LCD Olympus (Kirov) is located in the central district of the city.  Nearby lies a large road artery - Vorovsky street.  To get to the center in the mornings, nothing prevents, but in the evening short traffic jams are possible. </p><h2>  Residential complex </h2><p>  LCD Olympus (the city of Kirov) offers new ten buildings of twenty-five and nine-story monolithic-frame buildings.  In its size and scale, the complex leaves an unforgettable impression.  From many points of the city, the buildings of the complex are visible.  And, accordingly, the houses themselves serve as an excellent platform for viewing the panorama of the city.  The most impressive vision is obtained at night, when the city shines and shimmers with lights.  For the enjoyment of residents, the developer has provided panoramic glazing in the project.  Some apartments boast windows all the way to the floor, and in others only up to three quarters of the wall. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The construction company LLC Stroysoyuz has been in the construction market for more than a year and has managed to earn the trust of residents.

On the official website of the developer, you can even see the proposed options for arranging furniture, as well as inspect the apartment in reality.  In addition, the developer provided for the construction on the floors of such necessary premises as pantries.  For a fee, residents can buy them in their property and store all sorts of unnecessary things there, for example, bicycles, sledges. </p><p>  For children in the yard provides for the construction of a children's developmental playground.  Moreover, it is built not only for the smallest children, but also for those who are a little older.  Kids will be able to play in the sandbox, and in the typewriter, ride on the carousel.

Even rain will not become an obstacle when playing sports, as the site is prudently equipped with a canopy. </p><p>  It is not difficult to get an apartment in the Olympus residential complex.  It is enough to contact the sales office of the developer.  If it will be necessary to obtain borrowed funds from the bank in the form of a mortgage loan, the housing complex has been accredited by the largest banks in the city.  In this regard, the loan application is considered as soon as possible.  And this is despite the fact that the client will be provided with the most favorable conditions for obtaining a loan. </p>
