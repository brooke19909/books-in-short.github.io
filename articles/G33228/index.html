    <h2>  Restaurants </h2><p>  Many people staying at the Sheraton Sanya Resort 5 * (Hainan) pay special attention to establishments of this format.

    <h2>  More expensive rooms </h2><p>  In Sheraton Sanya Resort 5 * (China, Yalong Bay) there are still deluxes.  This is an apartment of 58 square meters.  m, which differ from the aforementioned only in the presence of a spacious balcony and sea views that open from it.  You have to overpay for these benefits.  The price of a weekly stay is 55-60 tons.  (with breakfast). </p><p>  The hotel also has family suites, an area of ‚Äã‚Äã156 square meters.  m. It is designed for four guests, and for a week they will have to pay 90 tons. </p><p>  But a much more impressive space may surprise guests with an embassy room.  Its area is 213 square meters.  m. And living for two people in it costs 135,000 rubles a week. </p><p>  However, the most luxurious option is the villa.  This is a separate house, which for the entire stay is given to guests.  Its weekly price is 180,000 p. </p><p>  What about the conditions?  They do not differ from those that were mentioned earlier when it came to economical rooms.  The difference is only in area, interior and price. </p><h2>  What do the guests say? </h2><p>  People staying at the Sheraton Sanya Resort 5 * hotel, reviews leave it mostly positive.  And in the first place, they always pay attention to its well-groomed territory.  The hotel is literally immersed in greenery, and this is emphasized by every person who visited it. </p><p>  A private beach with white sand, which is constantly monitored for cleanliness, is nearby, and towels are provided there.  There are sun loungers, which are enough for everyone, because visiting the territory is allowed only to guests of the complex.  The entrance to the sea is also convenient, without stones.  The water is clean and warm, even in February (but not for lovers of "fresh milk"). </p><p>  Many more people leaving reviews about Sheraton Sanya Yalong Bay Resort and give recommendations for the future to other tourists.  They advise you to indicate wishes regarding the desired room when booking.  If you want apartments with access to the pool, you need to ask for settlement on the first floor.  More attracted to sea views?  Then you need to indicate in the wishes of the settlement on the upper floors.  The economy rooms (mentioned above) do not have a balcony and their windows open onto a golf course.  But under the windows there are no construction projects, and indeed the place is picturesque, so if such conditions are satisfactory, you can save. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel with a related name </h2><p>  I would also like to note the attention of Sheraton Sanya Haitang Bay Resort 5 *.  This is a hotel complex belonging to the same hotel chain as previously described.  It is also located in Sanya, but only in Haitanwan Bay.  A private, white sandy beach among palm trees can be reached from the complex in about 5 minutes.  The airport is 35 kilometers away, and the train station is 18 km away.  For some, this is far, but a two-minute walk from the hotel is a duty-free center. </p><p>  In addition to the private beach, the Sheraton Sanya Haitang Bay Resort offers a huge lagoon-shaped pool, SPA center, fitness room and a separate children's park.  There are also four restaurants serving international and local cuisine and one bar with a huge selection of wines and cocktails.  In general, in terms of infrastructure, this complex has everything that is available in the previously described hotel. </p><h2>  About rooms </h2><p>  In this hotel, the most budgetary option is an apartment of 50 square meters.  m. A week of stay is 35-40 t.  These rooms have a balcony with pool views, a plasma TV with satellite channels and a DVD player, a spa bath, ironing facilities, a seating area and a bathroom.  All apartments are soundproofed and have large king-size beds.  In addition to the above, there is an electric kettle, a refrigerator, a minibar inside, as well as such trifles as an alarm clock, towels, bathrobes, slippers, etc. In general, in terms of its amenities, it looks more like an apartment, not a hotel room. </p><p>  The most expensive option at this hotel is a suite of 100 square meters.  m. Price per week - 80 t.  Luxuriously decorated apartment with a private wooden terrace and pool access. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting to know </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the Sheraton Sanya Bay Resort has one feature that distinguishes it from the previous hotel.  And this is its territory.  She is not just picturesque and well-groomed.  This is a real park, which has no edge - with gazebos, hammocks, art objects, ponds and gardens.  People leaving reviews pay special attention to the picturesque lotus pond, which is simply teeming with bright fish!  They, by the way, can be fed.  And in the park there are a lot of different animals, especially ducks. </p><p>  And many come here because the hotel provides its customers with various packages of services at competitive prices.
