And there are several possible answers to it.  The main difficulty here is by no means the remoteness of the country's main air harbor.  The airport is located ten kilometers from the Ring Road, but the Leningradskoye Highway and its exits are almost always loaded with heavy traffic.  The situation worsens even more during peak hours.  Therefore, you should think about how to get to Sheremetyevo Airport long before departure.  It has been repeatedly noted that a trip there sometimes takes longer than the flight itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to sheremetyevo airport" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/303006.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <h3>  <span>Moscow,</span> Sheremetyevo <span>Airport</span> .  How to get there in the best way </h3><p>  Many have long been accustomed to the idea that only a trip there by rail from the Belorussky Station can guarantee timely arrival at the airport for check-in.  Travel time is just over thirty minutes and in no way depends on traditional traffic jams at the entrances to the Leningradskoye Shosse.  Aeroexpress ticket costs a little more than three hundred rubles.  There is an opportunity to make a trip in business class, which will cost much more.  But for regular passengers an extensive system of bonuses and discounts is provided.  In general, Aeroexpress is the best answer to the question of how to get to Sheremetyevo Airport.  And everything would have been just perfect, if it had always been just as easy to get to the Belorussky Train Station, where it leaves from.  Another significant disadvantage of this <span>type of transport</span> is the fact that it is impossible to get to passenger terminals B and C. without transfers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Sheremetyevo airport how to get" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/303004.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h3>  <span>Sheremetyevo-1 Airport:</span> how to get to it </h3><p>  The old name of the airport is preserved only in history.  Since spring 2010, it has been officially called Terminal B, in accordance with international standards for the codification of transport facilities.  Of course, you can get to it from the Aeroexpress stop by transfer to the bus.  But many prefer other modes of transport.  The easiest way to get to Sheremetyevo-1 is from the <span>Planernaya</span> and Rechnoy Vokzal <span>metro</span> stations.  They are the final <span>stops of public transport</span> specializing in delivering passengers to the airport.  The positive point here is the fact that buses and fixed-route taxis operate around the clock.  The interval of their movement is 10 minutes during the day and up to half an hour at night.  Public transport remains the most affordable.  A trip from the subway in one direction on it will cost from 28 to 70 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheremetyevo airport 1 how to get" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/303005.jpg" width="495"></div>  But when thinking about how to get to Sheremetyevo Airport, it is always necessary to consider the possibility of traffic congestion.  It is better to advance in advance, so it will be calmer.  Taxi drivers request for a trip to the Sheremetyevo city center one and a half thousand rubles, but you can bargain with them.  And in the distant future, the line of light metro will pass through Khimki, the terminal station of which will be Sheremetyevo.
