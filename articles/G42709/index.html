The village of Sablino (now Ulyanovka) is located in the Tosno district, forty kilometers from St. Petersburg.  Here, on an area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwo hundred and twenty hectares, there are ancient canyons of the Tosny and Sablinka rivers, rocks of the Ordovician and Cambrian rocks, two waterfalls, ancient mounds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sablinsky caves" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/441713.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the past, Sablinsky caves were mines.  Back in the nineteenth century, <span>quartz sand</span> was mined here <span>.</span>  It was used when cooking Imperial crystal.  Over the years, a huge volume of rocks was taken out from under the ground, and thanks to this, a complex underground labyrinth appeared.  Then nature continued the decoration of the cave - soil lakes and rivers appeared, stalactites appeared on the ceilings.  In 1976, this territory was recognized as a natural monument. </p><h2>  Sablinsky caves: how to get </h2><p>  If you want to see this unique place, you can come here by car.  We leave on the Moscow highway and drive along it to the sign ‚ÄúUlyanovka‚Äù, then follow the signs ‚ÄúSablinsky natural monument‚Äù. </p><p>  There is another way to visit Sablinsky caves.  How to get to them by train?  At the <span>Moscow station,</span> take the train to the Sablino station.  From here there are minibuses and buses to the Sablinsky caves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features and uniqueness </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to say about the unusual relief of this area.  Here, on a flat terrain, along with two waterfalls and caves, two canyons of the Sablinka and Tosna rivers formed.  As a rule, this occurs only in mountainous areas. </p><p>  Scientists and researchers have registered fourteen caves here - eleven in the canyon of Tosna and three in the Sablinka valley.  In the latter case, there are <span>underground passages</span> from ten to fifteen meters long.  They are very narrow and partially collapsed.  They are called fox holes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="excursion to sable caves" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/441712.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the banks of the Tosny River, in the vicinity of the Grafsky Bridge, there are two caves.  The left bank has a labyrinth length of more than five and a half kilometers, and Pearl - more than three and a half kilometers.  In the caves there are three underground lakes with a depth of three meters.  The walls of the caves are covered with red sandstone, and the arches are covered with glauconite limestone. </p><h2>  Left-Bank Cave </h2><p>  The most interesting not only for tourists, but also for scientists and researchers is the cave, which until recently had a very unappealing name - Trash.  That is what she was called because of the banal dump arranged above and along it.  Time passed, all the garbage was removed, the vaults of the cave were strengthened - and the former mine, and now the cave, began to be called Left Bank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Its length is more than 300 meters.  Today, accompanied by an experienced guide, an excursion to the Sablinsky caves, and in particular to the Left Bank.  Here you will see large and beautiful halls with original names: Dome or Star, Little Red Riding Hood, Hall of the Underground King, Big Cosmic, Column and Jubilee. </p><p>  You can see the deposits of the Ordovician and Cambrian seas.  You will definitely be shown the Cat Laz.  You can climb on it only while lying down, while holding your hands along your body. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sablinskie caves how to get" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/441711.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The air temperature in the cave is year-round plus eight degrees.  Flocks of bats live in it.  If you visit the cave in winter, you will see them sleeping.  On white stones in the winter, butterflies sleep. </p><p>  An excursion to the Sablinsky caves passes along several routes.  The most popular of them is a bus trip to two waterfalls, the canyon of the Tosna River and a visit to the left-bank cave.  The route takes two and a half hours, of which tourists spend forty-five minutes in a cave.  Excursion programs have different themes and are created not only for adult visitors, but also for schoolchildren.  They will be useful in the study of natural history and geography. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Thousands of tourists who visited Sablinsky caves, reviews leave enthusiastic.  Excursions are informative, make you feel like a real caver. </p><h2>  Legends and myths </h2><p>  For many years, the inhabitants of Sablino tell the legend of the White Speleologist.  As they say, once a cave explorer died here, and his spirit settled in this place to forever protect the beauty of the underworld.  According to legend, he is very kind to disciplined visitors to the cave, and if they break off stalactites, throw garbage, awaken bats, etc., he can severely punish violators - cause a collapse, lead him into a closed labyrinth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sablinsky caves and waterfalls" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/441710.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Sablinsky caves keep one more secret.  There is a legend that at the very beginning of the twentieth century V. Lenin was hiding from the police in these caves.  He was accompanied by a man who knew secret passages, and he helped Vladimir Ilyich get out through the far exit.  Many cavers tried to find this move, but to no avail. </p><h2>  Dissidents underground </h2><p>  From 1982 to 1984, Sablinsky caves "sheltered" in their labyrinths about three hundred people, united in groups and teams.  Some of them obeyed strict military discipline, while others walked independently, not adjoining any groups.  As they believed, it was a place of freedom.  Having played enough, the participants of this strange action scattered home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sablin caves reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/441709.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Scientists interest </h2><p>  In the near future Sablinsky caves will become a place where a unique scientific experiment will be conducted.  One of the underground galleries will be completely isolated from the outside world.  Scientists want to observe the natural course of natural processes that occur underground.  Many will ask: "Why will the experiment be conducted in the Sablinsky caves?" </p><p>  It's all about a special microclimate.  As you already know, throughout the year the temperature is stable - eight degrees Celsius.  The caves have such an atmospheric regime that the tree, set here for the last New Year, remained in its original form for almost twelve months. </p><h2>  Waterfalls </h2><p>  Sablinsky caves, waterfalls attract a large number of tourists to the village.  And these are not only our compatriots, but also foreign guests.  Waterfalls formed on the flat terrain are an amazing joke of nature.  True, their height is not great, but this is not so important. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sablinskie caves how to get there" class="if" height="238" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/442013.jpg" width="362"></div>

    <p>  <span>The Tosna</span> River is older than the Neva.  She appeared seven to eight thousand years ago.  Its ancient channel is traced under the waters of the Gulf of Finland.  In 1884, the construction of a thirty-kilometer canal began (it was completed in nineteen nine).  He ran from Kronstadt to the mouth of the Neva.  The channel was created for the passage of deep-seated sea ships.  It exists and is successfully operated today. </p><p>  Tosnensky waterfall is the widest in Europe.  Its width reaches thirty meters, and its height varies from two to three and a half meters in different years.  In the canyon of Tosna, between the terraces located at different levels, there are many small streams flowing down the limestone slabs. </p><p>  Sablinsky falls a little lower.  Its height does not exceed two and a half meters.  From the canyon you will have a stunning view of the streams of water rushing down.  As a rule, visiting this place ends all excursions. </p><p>  Sablinsky caves and waterfalls are a unique <span>natural complex,</span> which must be seen by everyone who comes to St. Petersburg. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  An excursion to the Sablinsky caves involves the presence of special equipment (helmets, lanterns, etc.).  They are issued by the instructor, and tourists themselves should take care of closed and waterproof shoes with stable soles that would not slip on the stones.  Clothing should be light but warm. </p><p>  Listen carefully to the instructor before the tour and carefully follow the safety instructions that he will announce to you. </p><p>  A lot of bats live in the caves.  These are protected animals.  If you get an excursion in the winter, then remember that they can not be blinded by the light of a flashlight, touch them, wake them up. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sablinsky caves waterfalls" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/441707.jpg" width="600"></div>
