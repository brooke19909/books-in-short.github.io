So, the sea means a part of the world's oceans, separated by land or elevations of underwater reliefs.

    <p>  In general, it should be noted that the seas differ from the world ocean in climatic, meteorological and hydrological regimes.  This is due to the fact that they are usually located at the edges of the oceans, and due to the limited connection with the open part of the water expanse, they slow down water exchange. </p><p>  And the definition from the geography textbook says that the sea should be understood as a huge amount of salt water, which is connected to the water shell of the Earth, or a large salt lake, completely isolated from the oceans and has no outlet. </p><p>  From each other, the seas, of course, are distinguished by their flora and fauna. </p><h2>  Section 2.

But these data are approximate.  Some scientists insist that in fact the figure can be much larger, just humanity is still not technically ready to measure such segments. </p><p>  Meanwhile, the deepest sea in the world has more than seven thousand very picturesque islands with rich flora and fauna. </p><p>  Among its advantages, one can also distinguish unique Pangaskhan waterfalls, lakes, volcanoes, caves and a rich underwater world represented by whales, <span>sea ​​cows,</span> turtles, sharks, dolphins, huge stingrays, Japanese eels, etc. </p><h2>  Section 3.

The average monthly temperature ranges from +20 <sup></sup>  to +28 <sup></sup> . </p><p>  The name of the Coral Sea is far from accidental.  Due to the abundance of coral colonies, reefs, atolls, islands from petrified coral polyps in it, it received this name. </p><p>  By the way, do not forget that in this part of the world's oceans there is the largest coral structure of the planet - the Great Barrier Reef.  Today, its width is from 60 to 80 km, and it stretches parallel to the coast of Australia at a distance of 30-60 km from the coast more than 2000 km.  Scientists argue that this is far from the limit, because from year to year the reef becomes only larger. </p><p>  In addition to different types of corals, sharks and crabs, many representatives of the underwater world live here: sea anemones, stars, cows, hedgehogs, flying fish, trepangs, huge sea turtles, tridaknas, poisonous stone fish, sticky fish, pteroes, etc. </p><h2>  Section 4.

It’s even hard to imagine that this is exactly the distance that an airplane flying, for example, from Moscow to Khabarovsk has to travel. </p><p>  The climate in different parts of the sea is significantly different.  Why it happens?  The thing is that it lies geographically in different climatic zones. </p><p>  The surface of the sea water in the north warms up to +27 ° C, in the south - only +15 ° C in summer, and in winter drops to +9 ° C. It should be noted that the species of inhabitants of the Tasman Sea is very similar to the variety of Coral species. </p><p>  The underwater world consists of corals, sharks, atolls, sperm whales, whales, killer whales, tuna, mackerel and many other sea creatures. </p><h2>  Section 5.
