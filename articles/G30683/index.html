Vacations are approaching, and you need to plan where to spend them.  On the coast of the sea?  But even better on the spit, when water splashes from two sides.  It would be nice to heal ... So, rest on the spit, not far from the balneological resort.  Berdyansk immediately comes to mind.  Pension "Slavutich" stands out among other bases and resort hotels in an advantageous location, high level of service and developed infrastructure.  Those tourists who rested here in the past say that it is located on the second strip from the sea.  But recently, a boarding house bought the territory of the Meotida base.  She was across the road.  So now we can say with confidence: ‚ÄúSlavutich‚Äù stands on the first line of the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Berdyansk boarding house Slavutich" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1163653.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is located </h2><p>  Berdyansk is a resort of all-Ukrainian significance.  At the base of the spit, at the mouth of the Byrd River, there are estuaries and mineral springs, healing mud and salt lakes.  Many people suffering from diseases of the musculoskeletal system and respiratory system, gynecological, nervous disorders, go to heal in Berdyansk.  Pension "Slavutich" is located outside the city.  It is located on the Middle <span>Berdyansk Spit,</span> at its far end, opposite the island of Big Dzensik.  You can get here from the city by shuttle bus No. 15 (departing from the railway station and Schmidt Park).  The center of the Middle Spit (a bazaar, a number of shops) is one and a half kilometers from the entrance to the Slavutich boarding house.  Nearby there is a cafe "Quiet Harbor".  Near the recreation complex there is a minibus stop called "Meotida". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews boarding house Slavutich Berdyansk" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1163656.jpg" width="600"></div>

It should be noted that growing a sand garden in the steppe climate is not easy.  Tourists noted this green splendor, and many reviews are devoted to landscaping.  It is crossed by a road leading from the edge of the spit to Berdyansk.  Pension "Slavutich" has three four-story buildings.  Two of them (No. 1 and No. 2) are on the ‚Äúsecond line‚Äù.  In 2009, they underwent a complete reconstruction.  The Meotida building, previously owned by the recreation center of the same name, is located on the front page.  To the beach from it - about fifty meters.  Pension "Slavutich" positions itself as a place of family relaxation.  Small guests take precedence over adults.  This is reflected in the availability of highchairs, cots and microwave ovens in the room and discounts on vacations with a child. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pension Slavutich Berdyansk prices" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1163654.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The Meotida building, inherited by Slavutich from the recreation center, was planned according to Soviet standards.  There has not yet been a complete reconstruction, but only partial.  Therefore, he wins in relation to the other two buildings only one - proximity to the sea.  However, block numbers are located there.  That is, the bathroom is designed for two rooms.  But also there are several "Family" rooms.  These are two rooms connected by a common door.  Air conditioning is only in one of the bedrooms.  The buildings on the other side of the road are more comfortable.  They accommodate rooms "Standard", one and two-room "Deluxe".  The last category of guest rooms is equipped with a mini-safe, refrigerator, hairdryer, TV and seating area.  Pension "Slavutich" (Berdyansk) prices for the summer of 2016 set such.  In the low season (September) a double ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù will cost four hundred and twenty hryvnias.  In July, the price for a similar room will fly up to 620 UAH.  Deluxe rooms will cost from 505 to 850 hryvnias per room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pension Slavutich Berdyansk 2014" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1163655.jpg" width="600"></div>

You can move in without food.  You can pay for breakfast or half board (morning and evening meals).  Many tourists use the hotel for an overnight stay, and in the morning they go to mud baths in Berdyansk.  Pension "Slavutich" has two restaurant halls.  Both work on a buffet system.  But in the room for VIP clients, meals are possible on the menu.  If you come to a boarding house with a small child, you can order a microwave in the room.  There is no need to pay extra for the rental of the stove.  Food reviews are very praised.  All dishes are tasty, there was always enough, there were no queues and crowding, although the boarding house often receives participants in conferences, seminars and other collective meetings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pension Slavutich Berdyansk photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1163658.jpg" width="600"></div>

Every winter, improvements are made.  So, experienced tourists note that a kiosk appeared in the territory selling essential goods and beach accessories, a pharmacy kiosk, and a pediatrician began to work in the medical center in case of children's diseases.  And even Russian tourists love the Ukrainian boarding house ‚ÄúSlavutich‚Äù (Berdyansk).  2014, with its tense political situation, did not reduce the influx of holidaymakers who liked a budget holiday on the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov. </p>
