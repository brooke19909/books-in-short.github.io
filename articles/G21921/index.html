  <section class="page js-page"><h1>123 region: location and capital</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If for some reason you asked yourself: ‚Äú123 - which region of Russia?‚Äù, Then we have an answer - this is the Krasnodar Territory.  The one where a considerable number of natives of other regions seek to move. </p><p>  Among Russians who want to change their permanent place of residence, he takes an honorable second place (only Moscow Region is ahead).  So why is he so good? </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The Krasnodar Territory is located in southern Russia, located on the right bank of the Kuban River, in close proximity to the Black and Azov Seas. </p><p>  The administrative center of 123 regions of Russia is the city of Krasnodar, which until 1920 bore the name Yekaterinodar. </p><p>  It is the unofficial capital of the Kuban and does not (yet) reach the metropolis; the number of inhabitants is 899,541.  But population growth is proceeding rapidly, mainly due to the migration of residents of the North, the Far East, Siberia and all those who are tired of long cold winters and dream of living in a warm place and not far from the sea. </p><p>  In the Krasnodar Territory, the average winter duration is only 66 days, it starts most often in early January and ends already in late February.  However, in 123 regions there is practically no sustainable snow cover, so lovers of a winter fairy tale here at this time of year will feel uncomfortable. </p><p>  But connoisseurs of prolonged sunbathing will enjoy life here.  Summer in the Krasnodar Territory begins in mid-May and does not leave until the end of September.  It is always present here - dry and hot, with an average temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sights of Krasnodar </h2><p>  There are many beautiful and interesting places in the 123 region.  Let's go through the three most interesting of them. </p><p>  1. Street Red. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Red Street" class="if uuid-2562136" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88954/2562136.jpg"></div><p>  Or the Krasnodar Arbat.  The central street of the city, part of which on weekends and holidays, is blocked and completely pedestrianized.  Here you will meet musicians, artists, dancers and other interesting people, attracting the attention of passers-by with a wide variety of talents. </p><p>  It is green, well-groomed and clean, with lots of monuments, sculptures, shops, restaurants, cafes.  An ideal place for hiking.  At the beginning of the street fairs are often held, walking along it, you can come to a beautiful park with a pond, where swans swim. </p><p>  2. Monument to Catherine the Second. </p><div class="photo" data-original="poradi.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Catherine the Second" class="if uuid-2562115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88954/2562115.jpg"></div><p>  One of the monumental symbols of the main city is 123 regions.  The monument was originally erected at the beginning of the 20th century in honor of the great empress, who at one time granted the land of the Kuban to the Cossacks. </p><p>  But, like most of the beautiful creations of human hands in our country, with the coming to power of the Bolsheviks, the memorial was subject to demolition.  And only in 2006 the monument was restored, thanks to residents of the region who are not indifferent to their history. </p><p>  3. The stadium of FC Krasnodar. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.insaatderyasi.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.insaatderyasi.com/turkler-dunyanin-en-luks-stadini-insa-etti-1297h.htm"><img itemprop="image" alt="FC Stadium &amp; quot; Krasnodar &amp; quot;" class="if uuid-2562230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88954/2562230.jpg"></div><p>  This ultramodern "coliseum" of the 123 region will not leave anyone indifferent.  A very powerful building, executed in a stylish architectural design, is considered to be one of the best stadiums in the world.  On the territory there is a wonderful park for walks. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Krasnodar Territory is undoubtedly amazing and beautiful, with picturesque marvelous nature and modern, dynamically developing infrastructure.  It‚Äôs not only worth visiting, you will want to come back here again and again to constantly discover for yourself all the splendor and versatility of these places. </p>
