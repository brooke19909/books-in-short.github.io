The one who gets here for the first time is lost among gardens with tropical flowers, marble colonnades and fountains, statues of gods and heroes, admires amazing and outlandish dishes, cools in sea water or in pools - in general, he feels like somewhere in ancient Rome era of decline. </p>

Mediterranean Palace 5 * is a fifteen minute drive from Souk Airport.  It is here that most often planes arrive from our country.  A flight from Russia, if we take, for example, from Moscow, takes seven and a half to eight hours.  There are flights with transfers, say, in Malta.  Then the journey will last about ten hours.  If you come here from mainland Spain, then, as a rule, planes from there land at the second airport of the island - the north.  If you do not have a transfer to the hotel, then you can use the local bus transport.  He is here, according to reviews, excellent and walks well, and the island's infrastructure is very developed.  As a rule, all routes go along the perimeter of Tenerife, and cover all major cities and resorts.

Administratively belonging to Spain, it is actually located on African latitudes.

But here "eternal spring" always prevails.  It is the largest island in the entire archipelago, and it is divided into several areas.  The northern one is greener, but it is colder and it rains more often. </p>
