There are many different interesting and romantic stories and facts associated with this place.  From here, city tours begin, various cultural events are held here, adults and children like to walk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.airbnb.co.id" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.airbnb.co.id/rooms/11525812"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pyatigorsk park" class="if uuid-2977567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2977567.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is it and how to get there? </h2><p>  The Tsvetnik park in Pyatigorsk does not have an exact address.  It is located near the resort area, descending from the spurs of Mount Mashuk, at the beginning of walking spots on Kirova Avenue. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.03670969931199" data-lng="43.08124125872189" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/1/8/7/12187.png"></div><p>  You can get to the park using trams No. 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 or minibus No. 1 and No. 27. You should go to the Tsvetnik stop. </p><h2>  Yesterday and today </h2><p>  The Flower Garden in Pyatigorsk is not just a park, but one of the historical and cultural places of the city.  At the beginning of the XIX century there was a swampy area, from the mountain Goryachaya waters flowed down here, flooding the lowland.  The Italian architects, brothers by the name of Bernardazzi, got the idea to drain the wasteland and organize a walking park in its place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.veronikawild.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.veronikawild.com/2010/11/pyatigorsk-it-must-be-something-in.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Entrance to &amp; quot; Flower Garden &amp; quot;" class="if uuid-2977557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2977557.jpg"></div><p>  The swamp was destroyed, numerous flower beds were smashed, trees were planted.  The park was given the name "Nikolaev Flower Garden" in honor of Emperor Nicholas I. It was opened to visitors in 1829, there were many famous personalities of the time among the guests, including A. S. Pushkin. </p><p>  In the middle of the XIX century, the place became the focus of the resort life of the city.  In the 60s of the same century, stone columns, a musical rotunda and a bowling alley were erected around the park.  A little later, in 1872, entrance to the recreation area became paid.  The price of a seasonal ticket included visiting the iconic places of Pyatigorsk, music concerts and the opportunity to try mineral water from sources. </p><p>  At the beginning of the last century, a metal Lermontov Gallery was erected before plantations, which to this day is considered a symbol of the city.  At the same time, the Tsvetnik park in Pyatigorsk was reconstructed: the rotunda was removed, an arch and a fountain were installed, and trees were additionally planted. </p><p>  Until our time, the park has retained most of the attractions.  In 2014, a lot of restoration work was carried out, new flower beds and shrubs were planted. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  The first structure built in the park was an artificial grotto.  The authors of the project also became the Bernardazzi brothers.  It was marked by the anniversary of the conquest of Elbrus.  Therefore, the grotto received the same name.  It is cut down in a rock and has an entrance from three sides at once.  The floors and walls were tiled.  After 40 years, a rounded glacier with a pointed peak was built over the cave.  Initially, it was used for ice production, since a restaurant worked in the park.  Balls were held in the grotto itself, which were often visited by M. Yu. Lermontov. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.veronikawild.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Castle in the park" class="if uuid-2977565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2977565.jpg"></div><p>  The next building of the Tsvetnik park in Pyatigorsk was Nikolaevsk baths, a little later they were renamed Lermontov baths.  Toward the end of the 19th century, a Chinese gazebo and Ermolov baths were built.  The rotunda was designed by one of the Bernardazzi brothers in the traditional Chinese style, decorated with colored stained glass windows and columns.  They installed it on the top of the mountain, from where a picturesque view opens.  In the 70s of the XX century, it was destroyed and replaced by another. </p><p>  The baths are made in an eclectic style and were a favorite pastime of aristocrats.  After the procedures, vacationers drank tea or dined at local cafes, strolled around the park or listened to performances by artists. </p><h2>  Flowers and music </h2><p>  The idea to create an urban flower garden belongs to General G. Emmanuel, who wanted a place with many flowering flower beds and shrubs in the city.  However, initially there were not so many of them, they were only considered an addition to the existing buildings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="booking.traveltheworld.com.ua" data-author=": " data-source="https://booking.traveltheworld.com.ua/hotel/ru/pyatigorsk/sdaietsia-2-kh-komnatnyi-dom-posutochno"><img itemprop="image" alt="View of Pyatigorsk" class="if uuid-2977568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2977568.jpg"></div><p>  Since 1829, the number of flower arrangements and trees has been constantly increasing.  In addition, a sundial was installed here, every half hour announcing the beginning and end of procedures for vacationers. </p><p>  The park also attracted music lovers and lovers of dance and fun.  From the day of opening, musicians and orchestras regularly play symphonic music and jazz compositions, musical performances are played out. </p><h2>  Park Attractions </h2><p>  The park is surrounded by other equally significant sights of the city.  One of them is Gukasova's coffee house.  It was built over a hundred years ago and is a two-story building with delicate elements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="booking.traveltheworld.com.ua" data-author=": " data-source="https://booking.traveltheworld.com.ua/hotel/ru/pyatigorsk/sdaietsia-2-kh-komnatnyi-dom-posutochno"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lermontov alleys" class="if uuid-2977573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2977573.jpg"></div><p>  Another attraction is the monument to <span>Kise Vorobyaninov,</span> installed during the Soviet era at the entrance to the park.  It was here that this book character asked alms from tourists resting. </p><p>  One of the most beautiful buildings of the Flower Garden in Pyatigorsk is the Lermontov Gallery.  This is a beautiful blue building with large windows and beautiful stained glass windows.  Today it serves as a concert and exhibition venue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="geophoto.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://geophoto.ru/?l=EN&amp;action=show&amp;id=400208&amp;p=0&amp;subaction=&amp;group=0&amp;search="><img itemprop="image" alt="Pyatigorsk hotel" class="if uuid-2978142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2978142.jpg"></div><p>  Following the gallery are the Ermolov baths.  They got their name in honor of General Ermolov.  It was by his order that a resort was created in Pyatigorsk in 1816.  At first, the bathtubs were made of wood, but as it turned out, this material is not strong enough, and in 1880 they were rebuilt from brick.  Here was another structure with therapeutic baths, built in 1831 by architects Bernardazzi.  Later it was called Lermontov baths in honor of the writer who was treated here. </p><p>  Here on the mountain is a statue of a majestic bronze eagle with wings spread before the flight.  They installed it in 1973, at the place where the first source of Pyatigorsk with healing water was discovered. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Many tourists dream of visiting the Tsvetnik park in Pyatigorsk.
