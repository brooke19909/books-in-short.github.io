    <p>  Interesting fact!  In ancient times, the lymphatic system was considered as the main factor determining human temperament.  Temperament, in turn, determined the groups of diseases to which a person is exposed. </p><h2>  What is the lymphatic system? </h2><p>  According to <span>human</span> anatomy <span>, the lymphatic system</span> permeates the entire body.  It includes: </p><ul><li>  capillaries; </li><li>  blood vessels; </li><li>  nodes </li><li>  lymphatic ducts and trunks; </li><li>  lymphatic organs. </li></ul><p>  Liquid connective tissue - lymph, flows along them, the main composition of which is water, salts, proteins, fats.  Its composition is close to the blood plasma that feeds the body.  Lymph is colorless.  In the human body it contains from 1 to 2 liters. </p><h2>  How does lymph formation occur? </h2><p>  Lymph formation occurs in the following way.  In blood capillaries, blood plasma is filtered.  The fluid remaining as a result of this filtration is transported into the intercellular space.  Thus, tissue fluid is formed, part of which returns to the blood, and the other part passes into the lymphatic capillaries.  Its movement largely depends on muscle contraction, the position of the human body and his breathing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Here it is so complex - human anatomy.  Lymphatic system and building <strong> </strong>  it is thought out by nature to the smallest detail.  Consider this component of the human body in more detail. </p><h2>  The structure of the lymphatic system </h2><p>  Lymphatic capillaries are small tubes of different diameters, devoid of membranes, which begin blindly.  They form compounds due to weaving with each other, passing into postcapillaries, which are larger formations containing valves.  These valves push the lymph in one direction, preventing it from moving back. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="human lymphatic system anatomy" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45646/1570046.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Attention!  The word "lymphatic circulation" is incorrect, because lymph is a product of the endothelium and interendothelial layers, each time being updated in the body.  Doctors call this process lymphatic drainage. </p><p>  According to a section of biology called "human anatomy", the lymphatic system also consists of vessels that are formed from post-capillaries.  The largest of them follow the path of veins and arteries and are called collectors.  They collect lymph from the largest sources - upper and lower limbs, organs.  They are divided into internal (located near the blood vessels) and external (located in the subcutaneous tissue).  Also, the vessels are divided into bringing and taking out (depending on the flow of lymph in relation to the lymph nodes). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Lymphatic trunks are formed from the collectors, which are converted into ducts. </p><h2>  The lymph nodes </h2><p>  The human lymphatic system (anatomy has not given due attention to this component of our body for a long time) also has its own ‚Äúcleaners‚Äù.  Lymph nodes are small formations of a round or oval shape, the diameter of which is about 2 cm. They have a pinkish-gray tint.  They are located along the lymphatic vessels.  In young people, oval lymph nodes predominate, while in older people they are elongated.  Their main function is to cleanse the lymph from toxic substances that get there.  Lymph nodes play the role of a kind of filter that traps toxins and "releases" the already cleared lymph. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="human anatomy lymphatic system photo" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45646/1570065.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  Lymphatic organs are the spleen, tonsils and thymus (which develops until adolescence).  Their main functions are to prevent the ingress and development of infection in the body. </p><h2>  What functions in the body does the lymphatic system perform? </h2><p>  One of the most complex and intricate sciences is human anatomy.  The lymphatic system, whose functions are very important for the body, does a great job. </p><p>  First of all, she is responsible for the body's immune response, protecting it from bacteria and viruses.  That is why in response to the penetration of the pathogen (infection, virus), the lymph nodes increase.  It is their increase in children indicates the presence of, say, tuberculosis, although, in addition, the lymph nodes increase and with many other diseases.  The protective function consists of two stages: </p><ul><li>  destruction of bacteria using macrophages; </li><li>  lymphocyte production. </li></ul><p>  Blood filtration.  The spleen destroys red blood cells and kills all the bacteria and viruses that it finds in the blood.  Young red blood cells produce bone marrow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="human lymphatic system anatomy briefly" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45646/1570059.jpg" width="600"></div>  Lymph filtration.  If there are pathogenic microorganisms in the blood, then the lymph nodes filter them out.  For this reason, if cancer is suspected, doctors first of all check the lymph nodes for the presence of metastases.  The human lymphatic system (anatomy is briefly examined) in this case indicates how much the disease has spread throughout the body.

    <p>  The outflow of fluid from the tissue into the blood.  The plasma, which is part of the blood, seeps through the walls of blood vessels into other tissues.  It passes through the <span>lymphatic vessels,</span> cleansed and returns to the blood again.  This circulation is continuous. </p><h2>  Diseases of the lymphatic system </h2><p>  According to human anatomy, the lymphatic system is extremely important for the health of the body, and violations of its work can cause serious complications. </p><p>  Among the groups of diseases of the lymphatic system there are: </p><ul><li>  malformations; </li><li>  injuries </li><li>  inflammation </li><li>  tumors. </li></ul><p>  One of the first symptoms of these diseases is an increase in lymph nodes and a marked decrease in immunity.  Sweating and fatigue increase, patients are disturbed by a headache, the temperature may rise.  <span>Lymphatic edema</span> appears <span>.</span>  Lymphatic diseases are especially dangerous because toxins begin to accumulate in the body.  That is, a violation of its activity affects all organs and systems of the body. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="human anatomy lymphatic system and building" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45646/1570064.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <p>  Methods of treating pathologies of the lymphatic system directly depend on the type of disease.  Treatment can be different - from conservative to radiation or surgical methods. </p><p>  We hope that people who are interested in human anatomy, the lymphatic system (photos showing how complex this component of our body is, are presented in the article) and its functions, learned a lot of new and interesting information about this body environment.  How to keep her healthy? </p><h2>  Lymphatic health </h2><p>  First of all, doctors recommend monitoring their health and preventing violations of the digestive tract, as this entails contamination of the whole body and interferes with the functioning of the lymphatic system.  She can no longer cope with the flow of toxins.  Watch your diet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="human anatomy lymphatic system function" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1571144.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Do massage twice a year.  This procedure effectively accelerates the lymph, but <span>lymphatic drainage massage,</span> which acts directly on the lymph, is especially effective.  If it is not possible to visit a massage therapist, rub the body with a washcloth over the lymph current in the shower. </p><p>  Control your weight.  Lymph is very sensitive to extra pounds.  Lead an active lifestyle and be healthy! </p>
