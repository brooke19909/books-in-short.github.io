And it‚Äôs one thing if we are talking about flagships - the most expensive devices that represent the face of the development company, and completely different when it comes to budget devices or phones from the middle price class that are not endowed with such a set of individual characteristics. </p><p>  In this article we will talk about a fairly typical (if compared with other representatives of the line) phone, which, however, has something individual.  Meet: the hero of today's review will be the powerful Fly 4410 smartphone. The phone was launched on the market in 2013, although in terms of its parameters it could surpass some modern models.  Read more about why this device is so unique and why we dedicated the article to its characteristics, read on. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2>

    <p>  In general, as far as we know, Fly cannot be called a manufacturer of first-class mobile devices.  At least the bulk of the phones operating under this brand are represented in the low and middle price segments (as, incidentally, is our Fly 4410, whose price was $ 290 at the time of release).  Despite the low cost, the smartphone is able to show excellent performance and has a large number of functions implemented at a fairly comfortable level. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To make sure that the device is a worthy representative in the line of models and deserves the attention of the buyer, you just need to read the reviews presented about it on various trading floors.  What we, in fact, did as part of the preparations for writing this review.  Customer reviews and their impressions will be given below. </p><p>  In addition, there are also technical specifications that can also tell many about a particular smartphone model.  In our case, these are the parameters of a high-performance model that clearly claims to be a lot. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  We depart from the general terms and characteristics and begin to more specifically describe what we found during this review.  Let's start, of course, with the box.  It is with her that a user of a mobile gadget gets to know first. </p>

    <p>  The packaging for Fly 4410 is no different - it shows the phone itself, as well as the icons of the functions available in it. </p><p>  In addition to the device, standard accessories are located inside the box: a charger that turns into a USB cable after disconnecting the power supply, as well as headphones.  It is noteworthy that this is not the cheapest headset that can be found on some Chinese devices from the low price segment.  Before us is a quite worthy accessory, presented in black and red colors.  The shape of the headphones is ‚Äúnoodle-like‚Äù (oblong in cross section), due to which there will be no problems with tangling on them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It turns out that for the full use of the device, the buyer will only need to buy a memory card, as well as some kind of protective device for his smartphone (film or case).  These add-ons for <span>Fly IQ</span> 4410 can be called, rather, optional. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Putting aside additional components, we pay attention directly to the device itself.  Its design, of course, does not include any original solutions - it is a ‚Äúbrick‚Äù case typical of many Android models, which has somewhat smoothed corners. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the subtlety of the device‚Äôs case is immediately evident - according to the stated technical data, it does not exceed 8 millimeters.  This is a truly original move for the Fly 4410 Phoenix.  For the sake of convenience, which can give the user such a small size, you can purchase this model. </p><p>  The placement of the navigation buttons on the model is completely standard - the volume control and the lock key are located on the right side;  The standard physical buttons ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù can be found at the bottom under the display. </p><p>  In general, the entire case is made of plastic, but this does not give the device a cheaper look.  On the contrary, the phone looks a little more practical without extra metal inserts;  in addition, such material is not subject to scratching (and does not show their presence even in case of accidental damage). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  As for the screen, the main control element of a mobile phone, it is most likely closed from light scratches and scuffs with a special protective glass.  Thanks to this, the Fly 4410 can be called very practical in everyday use. </p><p>  The diagonal of the display here is 4.7 inches (despite the fact that there is still a lower and upper frame around the electronic field, which perform a decorative function).  The screen resolution on the device (about 720 by 1280 pixels) suggests a high pixel density (317 per inch).  As a result, even the most meticulous expert will not detect signs of graininess on the display. </p><p>  In terms of brightness and level of image display, there can be no complaints about the Fly 4410 - even when the device is rotated, the screen retains its original colors.  Such performance can only be found on flagship devices, so this is a clear testament to the efforts of developers.  The Fly 4410 display can be called high-quality and justifying the overall (good) impression of the model. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Another strength of the device is its ‚Äúheart‚Äù.  As the name suggests, the Fly 4410 Quad has a 4-core Mediatek MTK-6589 processor.  If you believe the technical specifications, the smartphone also has a module that allows for increased security (used for secure payments or <span>data encryption).</span>  If you are an ordinary user and do not understand this, then it will be enough for you to understand the high level of the chipset.  So, thanks to him, the device reproduces without problems even the most ‚Äútop-end‚Äù and colorful games with Google Play, does not slow down or twitch during operation. </p>

    <p>  If you plan to play the simplest arcade games, or even use the phone to read books, browse web pages and communicate on social networks, those features that are available on the Fly IQ 4410 ‚Äúfrom the start‚Äù will be quite enough. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The well-known problem of autonomy for devices running the Android platform.  It should be noted that this model does not stand out too much from this series - if you believe the parameters, then a 1800 mAh battery is installed here.  For a smartphone with such hardware capabilities, of course, this is not enough, but the developers were forced to take a step to reduce the battery volume because of the compactness of the phone‚Äôs case, its small thickness.  Therefore, owners who want to use the options that <span>the Android operating system</span> offers on this powerful gadget will need to stock up on portable batteries.  Or you can purchase a special Fly 4410 case with a built-in battery. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  We have not yet reported, but the mobile phone supports two SIM cards.  This is convenient both in terms of communication and in terms of saving money spent on Internet access services.  Each of the card slots supports both 2G and 3G networks.  Switching between them is carried out in the settings: figuring out when which card is active is very simple - they are marked with different colors.  In addition, due to the capabilities of the operating system on the Fly 4410, it is possible to limit the traffic spent for a certain period of time.  It is very convenient if you do not want to get into the negative on your balance. </p>

    <p>  Also, speaking of modules for communication, it should be noted Bluetooth (available on almost all similar category smartphones) and Wi-Fi for working in high-speed networks.  Another way to transfer data is USB 2.0. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  As you already understood, the smartphone operates on the basis of Android 4.2.1.  At the time of the device‚Äôs release, this particular OS version was relevant.  Most likely, users received their updates in the future.  It is also noteworthy that the Fly company, unlike many other developers, has not released its version of the interface for the smartphone - the shell here is standard, expressed in classic Android 4.2 icons. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  As you can already guess, judging by the photos, the smartphone is equipped with two cameras - front and main.  Their resolution reaches 2 and 8 megapixels, respectively.  Near the back there is also an LED flash, correcting the quality of photographs taken in limited light conditions. </p><p>  If we talk about the abilities of optics in general, we can note the efforts of manufacturers.  The 4410 model has automatic white stabilization in the photo (which does its job pretty well), focus (which, however, sometimes fails when taking pictures from a short distance), various shooting modes.  Thanks to this, the phone can be completely used as a camera to create amateur photos.  Using the front camera, the device can turn into a tool for video communication via Skype. </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  As the phone features Fly 4410 specifications, it supports the operation of memory cards.  They allow you to expand the storage space for data, thus significantly increasing the capabilities of the device, making it a real media center.  The ‚Äúnative‚Äù memory on the device is only 4 GB, of which 1 GB is ‚Äúreserved‚Äù for hosting applications.  For the remaining 3, the user can upload personal files: photos, videos and so on. </p><p>  The RAM here is 1 GB.  This is not so much, but even with such a small volume the device works stably - another 500 Mb remains free (with a normal workload of the model). </p><h2>  Multimedia </h2>

    <p>  As already mentioned, from the apparatus it is quite easy to make a real center for entertainment.  All this is thanks to the support of most of the known and common file formats today.  Also convenient for work is the player installed by the developer on the device by default.  The only problem is the interaction with some audio tracks for video files;  helps to solve it on Fly 4410 firmware or installing a powerful application for playback (for example, MX Player). </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  It was not at all difficult to find specifications and recommendations on the 4410 model - the phone was quite popular, and many users expressed their opinions on it.  It should be noted that the bulk of the reviews about the device is positive, noting its various advantages.  In particular, this is the low cost of the device, its high-quality assembly, high performance and reliable operation. </p><p>  Of course, among the characteristics there are also negative ones.  In particular, users note an insufficient battery life, communication problems periodically arising on some models (audibility during the first seconds of a conversation), unstable operation of the device in cold weather (regarding the correct display of the sensor image).  There are also a few warnings about poor fixation of the charging port, which starts to play during careless handling. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  The results of our review are as follows: the Fly 4410 model, given its cost and overall positioning in the mobile device market, is a worthy device for everyday use.  It has a powerful processor, high-quality camera, colorful display.  Also, the pluses include support for two SIM cards, the ability to expand the internal memory of the phone, a wide list of various communication options, and the like. </p><p>  Regarding the flaws of the device, each user must draw conclusions on their own - perhaps someone will find the location of the buttons, the shape of the device, the selected case materials and so on uncomfortable. </p><p>  If you are interested in this model - hold it in your hands before stopping your choice on it.  In general, the device is really worth the attention and its money. </p>
