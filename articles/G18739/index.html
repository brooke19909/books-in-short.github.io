    <p>  The lender is, as a rule, not only a banking institution.  The lender may be the state itself, as well as legal entities or individuals.  We will not consider how different debtors and creditors behave.  We will study only one example from the set. </p><p>  A private creditor is a person who belongs to the category of individuals.  He has enough money in his account to invest it in any transactions.  As a rule, a private lender works </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="creditor and debtor" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4353/253018.jpg" width="480"></div>  much faster than any financial institution.  He does not require a pile of documents from his client, nor money for considering his application.  More often than not, the only thing he wants to get is proof that the borrower's transaction is safe.  And therefore, exceeding the loan amount by the value of the acquired property is the best condition for cooperation.  Moreover, the purchase is a guarantee.  Naturally, the acquired property (most often this property) should be legally clean and have a certain potential for further sale.  It is also worth insuring.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A private lender is a person whose work is either profitable or fraught with trouble.  Banks can give a loan at higher interest rates, while requiring a number of documents, put forward other unpleasant conditions.  Against this background, a private creditor is, it would seem, an angel-savior.  But not so simple.  Under the guise of individuals, fraudsters often work.  If you intend to work with a private lender, be critical of its terms.  Is the proposed interest rate too low, and what could it be connected with?  Are you required, for example, to have an electronic wallet and replenish it, and transfer the password from it to your "benefactor"? </p><p>  It is much easier to work with a private lender than with a bank.  But there is a number </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="different lenders and debtors" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4353/253017.jpg" width="300"></div>  nuances.  A lender, unlike the banking system, is a living person, sometimes with his own shortcomings and quirks.  He can be guided not only by established rules, but also by his own mood and personal wishes.  If you are looking for private lenders through anonymous services, be prepared to refuse.  A potential lender may decide that the client intentionally hides his face.  Keep in mind that a <span>long-term loan</span> does not shine for you.  Such credentials really do not like risk and therefore they give out amounts for a short time, for a maximum of several months.  In addition, if you have a debt, it will be fraught with big problems, from scandals to serious material losses.  Impact on a negligent borrower can be carried out in various ways, from phone calls and personal meetings to visits to the place of work and going to court.  Private lender and debtor have a very tense relationship.
