Take a large branch, you can branched, as a basis for a tree, as well as a couple of small, dense, strong. </p><p>  Using a secateurs, remove excess processes from the branches, with a knife, peel the bark from the branches and process the ends. </p><p>  In order not to chop a splinter, the installation should be smooth, so polish the branches. </p><p>  If you want to make your tree colored, then you should color the branches now, if not, then proceed to assembly.

This is necessary in order to get rid of the smell of wine, from stains, as well as make them softer, because we need to cut them. </p><p>  When the corks have cooled, take a board and chop them.  Cut them as you wish, along or in circles, it all depends on what pattern you want to lay out. </p><p>  Yes, plugs can be cut along, laid out with a brick, or divided into colors, cut into circles and lay out a simple image.  When cutting in circles, adhere to at least 1 cm thickness. </p><p>  Having cut the cork, we proceed to gluing.  Roughly arrange the pieces on the cardboard, arrange them in the order that you like best, and then gradually glue the parts, firmly pressing them together. </p><p>  When the cork board has dried, it can be decorated.  Paint, add a picture to the frame.  Drive small cloves into the board or place hooks for jewelry so that any jewelry can be placed. </p><p>  This cork board is universal, among other things, it can be used as a note board, leaving notes or photos under the button.

Cut out the office. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crea-diem.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dress organizer" class="if uuid-2693117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2693117.jpg"></div><p>  Cut the vinyl into strips of different widths to fit different decorations.  We decorate the upper edge with braid.  To make the pockets voluminous and place more objects in them, make folds on vinyl tapes and sew them to form pockets. </p><p>  On a fabric basis, mark with soap or chalk where the pockets of the appropriate width will be. </p><p>  Sew the base, leaving space at the neck of the product for the hanger, then place the vinyl tapes and sew them.  Dress the dress itself with braid around the edges.  You can give the shape of a dress or any other thing to your fabric piece.
