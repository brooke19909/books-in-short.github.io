This is a beautiful Soviet-era station, crowned with portraits of the great Russian admirals of the Baltic Sea.  Today it is deservedly a historical landmark of the city. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.9077095" data-lng="30.30011319999994" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/9/5/4/5954.png"></div><h2>  Red branch </h2><p>  The red Kirovsk-Vyborg line of the St. Petersburg metro is the first <span>metro</span> line of <span>St. Petersburg.</span>  It was opened in 1955 and initially united all the Leningrad stations of the city.  Red color was a symbol of that time, communist Russia liked to paint great events with a scarlet color. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pastvu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baltic Station" class="if uuid-2645149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2645149.jpg"></div><p>  The length of the red branch is about 30 km.  The Baltiyskaya metro station is located between the Technological Institute and the Narva station.  It, along with the stations "Ploshchad Vosstaniya", "Vladimirskaya", "Pushkinskaya", "Technological Institute", "Narva", "Kirovsky Zavod" and "Avtovo", were built in the style of Soviet classicism.  Then, the spirit of the era, scale, complexity of architectural decorations and considerable means were invested in the metro.  Due to these circumstances, all of the above stations of the red line were included in the objects of cultural heritage of St. Petersburg. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Station history </h2><p>  The Baltiyskaya metro was built with access to the Baltic Station.  This is a massive building in a classic style.  The architecture of the station is crowned with marble columns and bas-reliefs of Russian admirals.  Naval leaders: Ushakov, Lazarev, Kornilov, Makarov and Nakhimov are forever impressed with the history of the fleet and St. Petersburg. </p><p>  In 2015, the station was completely renovated and reconstructed.  This large-scale repair has preserved and improved the unique architecture of the Soviet era. </p><p>  Art.  Baltiyskaya metro station with a depth of about 40 m, which makes it one of the deepest stations in the city. </p><p>  The station was designed by architect Benoit, its name speaks for itself.  The idea is dedicated to the Baltic Fleet and its outstanding naval commanders.  In this regard, at the station you can meet many marine attributes, anchors and stars.  Florentine-style mosaics adorn the main wall of the central metro hall.  A panel of colored pieces of marble depicts revolutionaries of sailors and workers, and the cruiser Aurora flaunts in the background. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.64bita.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mosaic on the Baltic" class="if uuid-2645166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2645166.jpg"></div><p>  Interestingly, initially in the Baltiyskaya metro station, they wanted to depict the leader of the country, the Stalin councils, but the project was canceled. </p><h2>  Baltic Station </h2><p>  In 1857, the first train departed from the Baltic Station (then Peterhof).  And in 1972 he got his real name.  From the station you can leave for the suburbs of St. Petersburg: Peterhof, Gatchina, Krasnoe Selo.  The station building itself over the years of its existence was being completed and reconstructed.  Today it has reached the maximum point of comfort.  Bright, spacious, with bilingual signs and wide aisles, electronic ticket offices, it gives passengers the opportunity not to get confused and catch their train on time.  Also, the Baltiyskaya metro lobby was added to the station, which further improved the passenger flow. </p><h2>  Attractions around </h2><p>  In addition to the Baltic Station, which is a tourist attraction in itself, within walking distance from the Baltiyskaya metro station there is a museum of railway station technology.  This collection of old railway transport, as well as a visual aid on the work of the railway station, will be curious to all lovers of rare equipment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Railway Engineering" class="if uuid-2645104" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2645104.jpg"></div><p>  Also not far from Baltiyskaya metro station on the Obvodny Canal embankment is the Church of the Resurrection of Christ, built in the early 20th century.  This neat church with two chapels is today a cultural heritage site.  Unfortunately, the temple is now being restored, and its doors are closed to parishioners. </p><p>  On Dekabristov street, 57 you can visit the apartment-museum of the Block, in which he lived for 9 years. </p>
