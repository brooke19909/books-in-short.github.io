Often the amount is so high that such money may not be.  Then you can take a student loan offered by Sberbank.  It is provided for a long period and allows you to cover all training. </p><h2>  The concept </h2><p>  Student loan allows you to get funds for citizens studying on a paid basis.  Money is provided in non-cash form, as it is transferred from the bank to the selected educational institution.  This transaction is governed by a contract.  Payment is made in installments for each semester.  Therefore, misuse of funds is excluded.  And the student has no risk of becoming expelled for non-payment. </p>
