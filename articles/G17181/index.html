    <p>  An important criterion for the final choice is the high quality of sound reproduction. </p><p>  To date, many drivers claim that the best radio tape recorders in the car are media receivers.  These are devices in the design of which a mechanical drive is not provided.  They display information not only from SD- and USB-carriers, but also from iPad / iPhone. </p><p>  The market offers its customers a host of other radio tape recorders that have a different combination.  These devices are more expensive than usual, but they are multifunctional, reproducing information from various types of media.  So, according to the reviews of many drivers, car radio with an MP3 decoder are very popular.  With their help, files with an MP3 extension are played. </p><p>  As for the cassette radio, they have long been out of use, and meeting them in the car is a rarity. </p><h2>  Important details </h2><p>  What else should I look for when buying a player for a car?  <span>The best radio</span> in the car must have a removable panel.  This part protects the device from theft.  A car radio without a removable panel is absolutely unattractive to thieves.  The fact is that the cost of this important part is about 70% of the cost of the device itself.  Due to such unjustified costs, the removable panel guarantees peace to its owner. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Not so important, but still the determining part of the choice is the backlight.  The best car radios in the car are equipped with it, without any doubt.  This part is very convenient and creates additional comfort when using the equipment at night.  In addition, the backlight of the car radio, which coincides in color with the interior of the car, looks very impressive. </p><p>  Choosing a player for a car, you can purchase various models.  They can have either multicolor or monochrome, and interchangeable backlight.  The first of them provides a very wide range of colors that automatically alternate like a chameleon.  In interchangeable lighting, the choice is very small.  It contains only two colors.  Which radio is better in the car?  According to reviews by most motorists, drivers prefer receivers with interchangeable or multi-color illumination. </p>
