This is largely due to the huge assortment of such products that are available on the shelves of construction and garden stores.  In addition, many simply do not have the opportunity to pay for expensive models of equipment, so you have to be guided by the requirements of a tightly limited budget. </p>

Reviews indicate that even at a low cost, this device fully copes with the tasks.  Today we will consider the opinions of customers in more detail, as they can help you make a choice.

    <h2>  Positive feedback </h2><p>  Why is the Interskol rotary hammer so good?  Reviews immediately indicate its low cost: for 1800-2000 rubles, you get a good technique that will help to make repairs or build something.  As experienced craftsmen say, for the money you will still not find anything better. </p><h2>  How are you doing with ergonomics? </h2><p>  Oddly enough, but many buyers do not think at all about how convenient the purchased tool will be.  But in vain, because not only simplicity depends on this, but also the safety of its use.  Let's deal with the most important points. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The basic requirements for the handle are very simple.  First of all, it should be comfortable to hold in your hands.  It is best to choose a hammer drill in which the handle is located at an angle of 70 degrees to the axis of the drill.  Even better, when it is rubberized: in this case, the product will not slip in sweating hands.  Most of the Interskol models fully comply with these requirements.  Buyers believe that the handle of an average rotary hammer is convenient, it does not slip out of the hands. </p><h2>  Other useful options </h2><p>  It should be noted that a stroke limiter (emphasis) can be very useful.  This device allows you to press the tool as tightly as possible to the material being cut.  Given the adjustment, you can get a hole exactly the desired depth.  If the emphasis is turned, then using a punch with the appropriate nozzle, it is easy to create blanks of almost any shape and size. </p>

    <p>  In this regard, the tools from Interskol are pretty good.  Buyers say that their handle is quite oversized, it is relatively convenient to hold on to it.  Only a certain roughness of the coating causes complaints: without normal gloves, you won‚Äôt be able to work for a long time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What other parameters are characterized by the Interskol puncher?  Reviews say that even professional models are not expensive, therefore, are available to almost everyone.  But is it worth it to buy such equipment? </p><h2>  Professional or household? </h2><p>  Like all <span>power tools, rotary hammers</span> can be divided into three main types: professional, semi-professional and domestic.  Owners of private homes in most cases will be quite enough a standard household model.  This choice is largely justified by the low cost of such models. </p>

Unlike ordinary household varieties, they can work for 3-4 hours in a row, so they are ideal for those who work part-time in apartment renovation or construction.  Such models cost from six thousand rubles (for Interskol such a price is very high).

    <p>  <span>Professional rotary hammers</span> are distinguished by a large number of various additional functions and an extended resource.  Their acquisition is advisable only for those who are professionally engaged in woodwork or repair.  Otherwise, you just wasting your money.  Such devices cost from 9-10 thousand.  In the kit often there are several interchangeable nozzles.  Masters say <span>that such a punch</span> replaces several tools at once, practical and quite reliable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Why is the Interskol rotary hammer bad?  Reviews say that the company's models have a negative side. </p><h2>  Negative points </h2><p>  Of course, not without negative responses.  Most often they are associated with the country of the tool manufacturer - China.  Buyers have repeatedly noted that there is a rapid wear of gearbox sprockets, and obviously not very high-quality plastic is used to make the case.  It often cracks, and the smell from it is sometimes not very pleasant. </p><p>  It happens that claims are associated with the high weight of some models: taking into account strong vibration and recoil during shock mode, holding them in hands can be very difficult. </p><p>  Let us characterize some models that are most often acquired by craftsmen. </p><h2>  Interskol 26 </h2><p>  Almost all masters say that the capabilities of this household model are enough for repairs in an ordinary city apartment.  The puncher is powerful, so that you can use it to pave the walls and easily drill holes for hanging kitchen sets.  Its cost is about four thousand, power - 800 watts. </p>

    <p>  Important!  It should be noted that such a tool cannot be handled with a large amount of work.  Almost all experienced buyers say that the Interskol 26 puncher is not designed for this, but many owners have burned it out in an effort to save money. </p><p>  However, you should not think that such products will not allow you to work normally: they are ideal for processing window and door frames, drilling holes for laying electrical wiring, as well as some types of pipes for plumbing.  As a rule, the kit has at least two interchangeable cartridges. </p><p>  As for the shortcomings of this variety, almost all users stop at not too high quality materials used.  Most comments on the cord, which sharply smells of "chemistry".  In addition, it is not uncommon for the gearbox mechanism to fail, as far from the best grades of steel are used in its production. </p>

    <h2>  Interskol P-30 / 900ER </h2><p>  Almost ‚Äútwin brother‚Äù of the variety described above.  If you look at the index, it becomes clear power - 900 watts.  With the exception of greater speed, it is practically no different from 26/800.  The reviews also indicate that all the advantages and disadvantages are completely similar to the model considered above.  Cost - within 4,5 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Interskol P-30 / 900ER </h2><p>  This is an Interskol cordless hammer drill.  Reviews note that in many ways its capabilities are the same as other similar models.  Of course, adjusted for an independent power source.  That‚Äôs something worth talking about in more detail.  The battery capacity is 1.3 A * h, it lasts for 30-40 minutes of medium intensity.  It costs about 5.5 thousand rubles. </p><p>  User reviews about this model are very good.  Owners of such devices say that this tool alone replaces a drill, hammer drill and screwdriver.  Build quality is good, the materials used are not very high quality, but there are no special complaints.  Thanks to nozzles with the help of P-30, you can even cut tiles.  Buyers say it‚Äôs not bad. </p><p>  It is the <span>cordless rotary hammers</span> (reviews confirm this) of this company that are distinguished by good build quality and reliability. </p>

It often happens that the manufacturer applies special nozzles to the tool that expand the functionality of the product.  Buyers report that the paint mixing nozzle helped them a lot during the repair process.  If you buy a special nozzle for cutting metal, then such a <span>punch for the house</span> (reviews about it are very good) turns into an almost universal tool.
