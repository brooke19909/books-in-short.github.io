However, by mistake of the payer, funds may be “lost”.  We are all living people, and people tend to make mistakes sometimes.  It happens that a considerable sum of money goes to a third-party account, not to the sender.  Sometimes customers are mistaken in the details and send funds not to the required phone number or to another bank account.  Many users are interested in the same question - how to cancel the transfer of Sberbank and return the money spent?  Is it possible to do this? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ccn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank canceled transfer from card to card" class="if uuid-3185262" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3185262.jpg"></div><p>  It should be noted right away that money not always transferred can be returned, but only when the payment is recognized as erroneous.  You can return the funds when: </p><ul><li>  Erroneous indication of details. </li><li>  Withdrawal of funds is illegal by third parties. </li><li>  An error in the Sberbank Online system. </li></ul><p>  It will not work to return the funds if: </p><ul><li>  The money was transferred in advance, but the deal did not happen for some reason. </li><li>  The user fell into the hands of scammers and personally transferred the money. </li><li>  Credit payment or work with card accounts. </li></ul><h2>  Cancel a failed payment </h2><p>  Is it possible to cancel the transfer of Sberbank if the amount has not yet passed through the accounts?  If an error was detected at the payment processing stage, then you can return the funds and cancel the operation.  But this is possible provided that it is done through Sberbank Online or through the mobile phone application.  Perfect payments are not processed instantly by bank employees.  Moreover, a transfer made late at night will only be completed after 9:00, when the working day begins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In your personal account, the user can check the current status of the transaction and, if it says “Bank executing”, then withdraw the money transfer.  This can be done through the online customer service system.  If the status is "Processing Pending", you should wait for the change to "Bank in progress" and cancel the transfer of funds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iphonews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="You can cancel the transfer of Sberbank" class="if uuid-3185263" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3185263.jpg"></div><h2>  Error while replenishing a mobile phone account </h2><p>  Often people are mistaken in numbers when replenishing a mobile phone account.  The mobile operator always notifies the customer with an SMS confirmation of payment.  If after some period of time confirmation has not arrived, the transfer of funds has been transferred to someone else's phone number.  How to cancel a transfer in Sberbank to someone else’s mobile phone account? </p><p>  The bank, unfortunately, will not help in solving this problem, but you can fix everything if you contact the operator.  You need to arm yourself with a passport and a check for payment and go to the mobile phone salon. </p><p>  Megafon’s mobile phone owners are more fortunate because there is a special refund service.  If you replenish your phone number, you can call the toll-free number 8-800-550-70-95 and reissue the perfect payment. </p><p>  In some cases, this cannot be done for the following reasons: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  mistake made in more than 2 digits; </li><li>  after payment more than 2 weeks have passed; </li><li>  one of the numbers does not belong to the Megafon operator; </li><li>  one of the numbers does not belong to an individual. </li></ul><p>  In these situations, you can return the payment only through the salon. </p><h2>  Error transferring funds to another card </h2><p>  When making a transfer from a card to a card of one bank, it is difficult to make a mistake: after filling in the data, information about the recipient is displayed - his full name and card number.  If the transfer is made from a payment instrument of Sberbank to a card of another banking institution, only the latter can help. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.azernews.az" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cancel a transfer to sberbank online" class="if uuid-3185267" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3185267.jpg"></div><p>  Could it be that Sberbank canceled the transfer from card to card?  This can only happen if you send money to a non-existent recipient. </p><h2>  Error transferring in the bank itself </h2><p>  When making a payment directly at the bank's cash desk, both the payer and the bank operator, who enters the details, can make an error.  You should carefully check the entered data after filling in the payment to be sure of their correctness and accuracy.  If the error occurred through the fault of an employee of the institution, then it is quite possible to cancel the transfer of Sberbank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to return the funds that were transferred using the online service? </h2><p>  What to do in this case?  How to cancel a transfer to Sberbank Online?  In order to return the money that was transferred through the online service, you need to do the following: </p><ul><li>  Log in to the Sberbank Online service. </li><li>  Find the payment transaction that was made by mistake in the list of payments and see if it has the status "In Work".  If it is available, then the money is still on the card.  To return them, you need to cancel the payment transaction. </li><li>  If there is no confirmation of payment, then you need to select the payment transaction in the list of payments, then click on the “Cancel” message.  To finish this process, click "Confirm Review". </li></ul><p>  In order to make sure that the erroneous payment was canceled, you need to go to the payment archive and look at the status of the transfer that was made by mistake.  If there is a “Recalled” mark next to it, it means it has been canceled. </p><div class="photo" data-original="canopuslab.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to cancel the transfer of Sberbank" class="if uuid-3185264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3185264.jpg"></div><p>  How to cancel a money transfer in Sberbank when the transfer has already passed?  If a payment made by mistake has a confirmed status, you need to act differently here.  In this case, to cancel the erroneous transfer, you need to call the operator or personally contact the bank. </p><p>  In the event of a successful attempt to cancel the payment via a call to the operator in the Sberbank Online personal account, the status of the application “Rejected” or “Rejected by the bank” will be next to the transaction that was to be canceled. </p><h2>  Via telephone </h2><p>  How can I cancel a transfer to Sberbank in another way?  The next method to cancel the transaction in order to return the money is to make a call to the operator via the bank's hotline (the phone number is indicated on the official website).  Since payment transactions are being verified, you have time to cancel the erroneous payment. </p><p>  If you block an incorrect transaction on time, you can save your money in your account.  To confirm the identity of the card holder, the call center operator may ask questions.  If you need to cancel the sending of funds from one card to another, but at the same time they both belong to the same bank, then this is easier to do.  In case of an erroneous write-off of funds, information about the payment made (such as time, amount and code) will help to solve this problem faster.  In reviews, it is often mentioned that Sberbank canceled the transfer by payment number. </p><p>  In the event of a transaction using a terminal or an ATM, information proving the completion of this payment will be a receipt or a check about the operation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.creditcards.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cancel a money transfer sberbank" class="if uuid-3185272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3185272.jpg"></div><p>  If fraudsters use a card, they need to act quickly.  It is necessary to contact the bank within 24 hours.  In this case, it would be good before this to report the theft of the card to the police.  Customer reviews report that in some such cases, Sberbank canceled the transfer fee.  This may occur if the stolen amount is significant. </p><h2>  At the bank branch </h2><p>  How to cancel a money transfer from a Sberbank card?  With a personal visit to the bank, you can also get rid of the problem with an erroneous transaction.  There are two options. </p><p>  In the case when the sender indicated the payment data that does not exist, the money will be transferred to the backup account.  To return them, you need to write a statement to the bank to cancel the payment.  The time during which it will be considered is a month.  According to some reviews, Sberbank canceled the transfer from card to card faster if the payment number was known.  Moreover, both payment instruments belonged to this institution. </p><p>  If existing billing information was indicated, then everything is worse.  Here the problem can be solved either by contacting the one who received the money, or, if he refuses, in court. </p><h2>  How to return an erroneous payment? </h2><p>  If you made a payment transaction, but then noticed that you entered the wrong data, what should I do?  As noted above, if there is no user with such data, the transferred money will be transferred to the backup account and after about a week will be returned back.  If they have not returned, then you need to fill out a statement to search for a payment.  In cases where the money came to an outsider, to solve this problem will have to make a lot more effort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="topbort.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank canceled the transfer fee" class="if uuid-3185268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3185268.jpg"></div><p>  If the status of the erroneous transaction is “Completed”, what should be done in such cases?  Is it possible to cancel a transfer to a Sberbank card in this case? </p><p>  Two options are available here.  The first is relevant if the money has not reached the recipient.  Here the result depends on the speed of action.  If you manage to get through to the bank and cancel the transaction before making the transfer to the wrong recipient, then Sberbank will return the money. </p><p>  According to the employee of the hotline, there is a better chance of a refund if less than one day has passed.  Then you need to submit an application to cancel the payment in writing or in electronic form.  A notification should be received from the bank about the date of cancellation of the money transaction or that it cannot be completed.  A bank may cancel a transaction only if its liability has not expired. </p><p>  The time when the bank ceases to be responsible comes after debiting funds.  When the transaction is completed, the institution can’t cancel it, because it does not have the right to withdraw funds from customer accounts without a court order. </p><h2>  What to do in this case? </h2><p>  How to cancel a transfer in Sberbank if the money has already reached the third party?  A financial institution advises contacting the person who received the money and deciding everything about their return with him.  At the bank branch, you can purchase a copy of the erroneous transaction to confirm it.  If the user who performed the wrong operation does not know where to look for this recipient, or the latter does not give the money, then you can leave a request with the bank about the disputed transaction.  If the bank could not help you, you can contact the police and the court. </p><h2>  Chargeback as one way to get your money back </h2><p>  The way to return using the chargeback is possible only if payment using Sberbank Online has been made in online stores, and not by a private person. </p><p>  This case is suitable in the presence of one of the following situations: </p><ul><li>  if payment has occurred, but the seller does not send the goods to the consumer (delays sending); </li><li>  if changes have occurred and the buyer refuses the order, and the store does not want to return the funds; </li><li>  if the goods have the wrong qualities or not the one that was ordered. </li></ul><p>  How can I cancel a transfer from a Sberbank card in this case?  You can contact the bank office and ask for a service such as chargeback.  It is important to remember that the more documents confirming the grounds for the procedure, the greater the chance of approval.  This can be any, even the most unimportant document: checks, screenshots of correspondence with a store / seller, screenshots of correspondence with a bank, photos of goods that differ from expectations, bank statements, documents to a bank account - that is, all evidence that the situation and procedure takes place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cebuanalhuillier.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="You can cancel the transfer from a Sberbank card" class="if uuid-3185273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3185273.jpg"></div><p>  Then, if the bank is convinced that the funds should be returned to the account, it makes a request to the Ministry of Railways.  The latter, in turn, also analyzes the situation.  If the contents of the client’s application finds confirmation, all documents are sent to the acquirer bank.  In turn, the bank makes a request to its client.  The online store must prove that all the services for which the money was paid have been carried out.  If the evidence does not take place or the organization does not respond to the request, then the amount from the account of the online store is returned to the buyer's account. </p><h2>  How to avoid transaction cancellation? </h2><p>  All possible ways to cancel a transfer at Sberbank are presented above.  However, it is better to prevent such a situation than to try to solve the problem later.  You should be careful when filling out the details, especially if payment is made from a phone or tablet.  A small screen complicates the task in this situation.  When inserting a card, it is necessary to connect SMS protection, so that with each payment a confirmation code will be sent to the phone number.  This helps to avoid fraud and provides an opportunity to re-verify the data that was entered. </p><p>  If a message with a code arrives at the phone number, but the user has not performed any card payment transactions, you should call the bank’s service provider and inform you that they are trying to pay from your account or card and should not perform this operation.  The bank will block this payment. </p><p>  It is never worth distributing the password from the card to strangers, even to bank employees.  If the list of one-time passwords is lost, when contacting the bank, the employee will issue a new one.  Details that are entered automatically regularly should also be checked in order to avoid errors. </p><p>  Sberbank Online is one of the most modern and secure payment systems, if all the safety rules for money transfers are correctly and accurately observed.  If you follow all the instructions, there will be significantly fewer errors.  But if a certain situation has occurred, you need to know what to do right and which option to choose to fix the problem. </p><p>  When making a payment at the bank's cash desk, you should definitely look at the payment receipt that the specialist will issue after the transaction is completed.  It must be remembered that even an experienced bank employee can make a mistake, so it is better to check the payment details.  With quick detection of an error, fixing it is much easier.  In any case, do not waste time and do not wait, but contact the bank in any of the available ways. </p>
