  <section class="page js-page"><h1>White holes. Are there any</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are a lot of various interesting objects in the Universe.  These are numerous planets, stars, comets, asteroids, constellations, galaxies and, of course, black holes.  But few people know that in space there may be white holes - the complete temporal opposite of black.  Scientists suggest that they can appear when the events of the cosmic matter of a black hole, which is located at a different time. </p><p>  Unlike <span>black holes,</span> white exist only for a short time (by cosmic standards) and spontaneously appear in the void.  They emit matter and radiation into the Universe.  After all, if there are objects such as <span>black holes</span> that continuously absorb the substance, then there must be objects that emit it. </p><p>  While white holes in space can not be detected.  But numerous adherents of this theory do not give up their hopes for the discovery of such in the future.  Will they be found?  Indeed, if there is irrefutable evidence of the existence of such holes, then several basic laws of physics will be violated at once, and the foundation of modern science will have to be patched up in some places.  And very thoroughly. </p><p>  The appearance and instant decay in outer space of a white hole, astronomers call the Small Bang, because this process is very similar to the Big Bang, without which our Universe would not exist now.  But at the moment, such objects, which could be called white holes, are unknown.  There are also no prerequisites for the methods of their search (for example, black holes are usually located in the centers of large galaxies). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Recently, astrophysicists Schlomo Heller and Alon Retter made a sensational statement.  It consisted in the fact that the possible cause of the unusual gamma-ray burst GRB060614, which was recorded by several powerful telescopes on the fourteenth of June in 2006, was precisely white holes or a hole.  GRB060614 is located in the constellation of the Indian (from the Earth at a distance of about one and a half million years).  The flash was accompanied by an unusually long light effect, thanks to which astronomers were able to determine the coordinates and measure the parameters of the object.  Why is it unusual?  All known gamma-ray bursts are divided into long (over two seconds) and short (less than two seconds).  But this did not fit both parameters.  Therefore, scientists paid her special attention. </p><p>  Experts believe that long-term gamma-ray bursts occur most often due to the collapse of a number of massive stars, which are then converted into black holes.  Short gamma-ray bursts are the result of the fusion of a neutron star and a black hole, or neutron stars.  This leads to the formation of a black hole.  The outbreak recorded by Israeli scientists lasted 102 seconds.  According to the theory, this should have meant that it would end with <span>a supernova explosion</span> that never happened.  In addition, no gamma-ray bursts were expected in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe sky, nor were the appearance of any new objects. </p><p>  Theoretical physicist Poplavsky Nicodemus proposed a model according to which our Universe is the inner walls of a black hole, which is located somewhere in another Universe.  In his work, this scientist showed that all black holes can be considered as entrances connecting different parts of space.  Also, Poplavsky Nicodemus believes that the other end of the black hole is connected to the beginning of the white one.  At the same time, conditions are created inside the tunnel that resemble a gradually expanding Universe.  From this we can conclude that our Universe may well turn out to be the inner part of the tunnel, and black and white holes - the entrance and exit to the regions of outer space. </p><p>  Poplavsky‚Äôs theory explains the paradox: why when it enters a black hole, cosmic matter disappears and never appears anywhere else. </p>
