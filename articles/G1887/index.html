  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Computer Science and Computer Engineering</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In our rapidly changing modern age, computer science and computer technology have become not just the norm, but have become <span>concepts that define</span> our lives.  Already the quality of human existence begins to depend on how successfully people understand them.  If a person knows how to handle computer technology to "you", then he lives in the rhythm of time and he always expects success. </p><p>  The word "computer science" in virtually all languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world means science, which is associated with computer technology or computers.  Specifically, this term has the following definition: this is the name of science, which has as its main task the study of various methods of obtaining, storing, accumulating, transmitting, transforming, and also using information. </p><p>  Computer science and <span>computer technology</span> help to understand many processes related to all existing information.  Computer science itself explores the following issues: </p><p>  -the ability to enter research objects into programs and databases; </p><p>  -effective and quick solution to information and necessary computing tasks; </p><p>  -determination of the type and method of storing information in a specific form of information and its restoration if necessary; </p><p>  - programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand human interaction with computer programs. </p><p>  Computer science and computer technology have entered human life quite recently.  The very concept of "computer science" was introduced only in 1957 by the German Karl Steinbuch.  And then this word and this concept began to spread throughout the world.  As a separate science, it began to develop since the 1970s, and before that it simply entered, as a separate section, in mathematics and electronics. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This science consists of several sections.  There are three main sections: theoretical <span>informatics, applied</span> and information systems.  The technical foundations of informatics are considered in the information systems section and consist of information networks and systems, as well as information retrieval systems.  Here it can be considered consisting of two parts - these are software and hardware, that is, the hardware of computers, which is sometimes called "hard products" and the software for computer hardware - "soft products". </p><p>  Theoretical computer science is already a mathematical discipline.  She considers many mathematical concepts, for example, the properties of an algorithm in computer science.  Its main essence is the application of mathematical methods for research and construction of different models for obtaining, processing, transmitting and storing information.  These are the theoretical foundations of computer science.  It combines mathematical logic, computational mathematics and geometry, system analysis, <span>information coding</span> theory, decision theory, <span>mathematical programming</span> and <span>operations research.</span> </p><p>  Applied computer science includes its use in society, software, the fight against computer viruses and the information society.  Computer science and computer technology are used in modern life in several main areas: </p><p>  -development of computer systems and the necessary software; </p><p>  -the theory of information that studies all related processes; </p><p>  -Methods of artificial intelligence; </p><p>  -system analysis; </p><p>  -Methods of machine animation and graphics; </p><p>  - telecommunication facilities, which include global <span>computer networks</span> ; </p><p>  - A variety of applications that cover almost all aspects of human activity. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, developing technological progress has an important impact on our lives and constantly presents humanity with new opportunities for obtaining, collecting and storing information. </p>
