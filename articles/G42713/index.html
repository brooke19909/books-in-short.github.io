It also belongs to the category of "3 stars", built here in Side (but somewhat later than the institution we are considering), and is nearby.  Is this a coincidence?  Not at all.  This is the specificity of the hotel business.  <span>Palmiye Garden Hotel</span> Side (the so-called "twin") got its name, like many others, of course, it is no coincidence. </p><p>  For a novice hotel, for "promotion" you need customer reviews.  Having received a similar name, he attracted a part of the comments left by the hotel complex's clients - ‚Äúnamesakes‚Äù.  A similar strategy, obviously, was chosen by another hotel, but with a lower class - Palmiye Hotel Side 2. </p><p>  Of course, the similarity of names is inconvenient.  And it can play a joke with unlucky holidaymakers.  Obviously, it would be fair for the laws of the Country of the Star and the Crescent to prohibit having similar names for hotels within the same settlement. </p>

    <h2>  Tour to Palmiye Hotel 3 </h2><p>  And now we turn directly to the topic of our story.  The three-star hotel complex, which is the subject of our conversation, is located on the fertile territory of the Turkish Riviera - in the ancient city of Side.  It is located on the third line, six hundred meters from the beach and one and a half kilometers from the city center.  From Antalya Airport, it takes 40 minutes to get to it.  The cost of the tour at Palmiye Hotel Side for two adults, including transfer and flight, is 29.9 thousand rubles.  The temptingly low price of a ticket will not disappoint those who choose this hotel.  Let us allow ourselves some explanation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  About the beach </h2><p>  In the Russian market of the resort business, tours to it began to be sold relatively recently.  Prior to this, it (not without success) was used by residents of Western Europe.  Therefore, it is still unclear to the Russians surfing the Internet in search of reviews whether the hotel complex has a beach and will it cost to pay for it? </p><p>  We answer: the hotel does not have its own beach area, its guests use the city recreation area.  Before her - about five minutes walk down the street descending to the sea.  At the same time, note: in Turkey, ‚Äúcity beach‚Äù does not mean ‚Äúgroomed‚Äù or, God forbid, ‚Äúshabby‚Äù.  You will be satisfied, for he is simply gorgeous: sandy, awarded the Blue Flag.  Resting there is a pleasure ... </p>

    <h2>  Nuance </h2><p>  In principle, the beach is free for vacationers in the Palmiye Hotel Side (the money for using it goes to the city‚Äôs treasury from the hotel), however, judging by the reviews of the hotel complex peasants, its employees are doing their ‚Äúsmall business‚Äù selling free trestle beds to newcomers.  Going into conflict is not worth it.  To take a place in the cohort of ‚Äúfreebies‚Äù, we recommend you to be wise: to become familiar with the guards, that is, here at the beach bar, buy a Coke-Phantom Sprite several times, and you will become ‚Äúyour own‚Äù. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In general, given the recreational opportunities available at any time of the day in a chic, comfortable and free beach area, Palmiye Hotel Side is really good for both private and family vacations. </p><h2>  Building and Territory </h2><p>  The hotel complex is relatively small - just one comfortable four-story building.  But the specific architecture of the hotel - with semi-arches and pseudo columns - makes its exterior and, accordingly, stay in it attractive.  A talented (another word is simply inappropriate here) and carefully created landscape design around the outdoor pool Palmiye Hotel Side 3 gives the impression of being in a paradise.  The alley of royal palms landed along the facade of the building is also impressive.  The hotel area is relatively small, but very well maintained.  A shallow walking terrace with an antique fence, consisting of mini-columns, separates the building from a large open-air swimming pool of a bizarre shape.  Architects, planning a recreation area around the artificial reservoir, provided not only terraces for the standard arrangement of sun loungers and umbrellas (in rows), but also peculiar peninsulas, designed for three or four beds, extended closer to the middle of the pool.  It should be noted that although there are enough places for all guests at Palmiye Hotel Side 3, sun loungers in these areas are always occupied first. </p>

The staff is responsive, helpful, helpful, instantly fulfills the requests of the Palmiye Hotel Side 3 guests. Resorts' reviews of the restaurant indicate the quality of this service exceeding three stars. </p><p>  Main dishes include cooked in a good dozen ways with various spices chicken, turkey, liver, three to four kinds of sea fish, meatballs, two types of sausages and several varieties of cheese.

    <p>  Garnishes - various: stewed, fried, steamed vegetables, in salads;  potatoes in various forms;  fig.  All vegetable side dishes are very well prepared, but the most delicious are with eggplant.  Cream soups are also available for lunch / dinner.  Guests of Palmiye Hotel Side 3 (Turkey) are not limited in fruits, there are always a lot of them: melons, watermelons, apples, grapefruits, grapes.  From alcoholic drinks - in the bar beer, vodka, gin, rakia, white / red wines.  Of the usual, you can take tea, coffee, soda.  It makes sense to buy drinking water in the market at the hotel (for one dollar - five liters). </p><p>  At all meals, the chef always vigilantly monitors the work of chefs and waiters, ‚Äúconducts‚Äù this process, listens to the requests of vacationers. </p><h2>  Note to some holidaymakers </h2><p>  The work of the restaurant from Palmiye Hotel <span>Side (Side), the</span> spa people are satisfied.  Of course, there are eccentrics - one of those who, having come to Turkey for the first time and having paid $ 100 for a day's board, wants to see seafood and beef on the menu (here one kilogram costs $ 100).  Let's be realistic: such tourists, judging by their requests, should choose a five-star hotel, pay for a more expensive guesthouse, and then it‚Äôs really possible to deal with gluttony. </p>

    <h2>  Excursion program </h2><p>  Another bonus from the Palmiye Garden Hotel Side 3 * hotel complex is its sightseeing opportunities.  An inexpensive vacation allows holidaymakers to save money on the purchase of a variety of excursions in the ancient land of Asia Minor (as this country was once called).  Guides should not buy them, because travel agencies oblige their employees to ‚Äúgive couples‚Äù excursions with a 50% mark-up.  What to do, business is business.  It is much more profitable to buy them at market prices from city tour agencies.  However, guests of the Palmiye <span>Side Hotel 3 (Side)</span> hotel initially have a significant bonus: they can take a daily free tour to the monuments of ancient ancient architecture.  After all, the hotel complex itself is located in an interesting zone of archaeological excavations.  Once upon a time, just a stone's throw from the hotel, there was an ancient agora (public urban place) with the temple of the fertility goddess and the slave market in the center (unfortunately, the earthquake left them only a foundation and a few fragments).  But the cup-shaped amphitheater in Side is elegantly preserved - with stands in two floors and an arena 60 meters below.  Once upon a time here gladiators fought to the death.  The ancient Roman <span>public toilets</span> (24 of these structures in Side) are perfectly preserved.  It is curious that the sewage system and the supply of clean water are still functioning today. </p>

    <h2>  Guided tours </h2><p>  In Turkey there are objects that you should definitely visit.  This is the calling card of the Country of the Star and the Crescent, the subject of her pride.  Of course, you just need to buy an excursion to Pamukkale (Cotton Palace) - a chic pearl-colored cascade of travertine baths - and swim in the Cleopatra pool, located here.  The water here is healing, thermal.  Bathhouses accept people (believe it or not) from the times of ancient Rome!  Irresistible is the creation of nature and human hands - Cappadocia!  This is a chic combination of unique natural mountains and the whole city, carved into the rocks of sedimentary origin.  The Byzantine fortress of Ich-Kale is majestic.  Children always delight in the sight of the gigantic (stirring and roaring) created by the designers with the anatomical accuracy of the dinosaur figures in Discovery Park. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Lovers of outdoor activities who have chosen this particular hotel do not fail.  In the beach area, there are always diving courses, where everyone can join this magnificent sport at an amateur level.  Even those with specific diving skills will learn a lot from the local instructors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palmiye hotel side 3 turkey" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/503440.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  You will enjoy the Mediterranean Sea.  This is an amazing world with milky warm, stunningly clear water, featuring a charming turquoise tint.  Even the author of the Illiad, the great Homer, called it very poetically - wine-colored. </p><p>  Having paid a few dollars, you can get indescribable pleasure from riding on water attractions - ‚Äúbanana‚Äù and ‚Äúcheesecake‚Äù.  It is breathtaking to fly on a special parachute flying after a boat (parasailing) or to go water skiing. </p><p>  Recall also that in the hotel itself, as part of the all-inclusive service, it is possible to visit the Turkish or Finnish baths for free.  But if you are counting on a session or a massage course, then you will have to pay for it. </p>

    <h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  In Side, it is reasonable to buy small souvenirs for yourself, family and friends.  The prices here are low.  Near the hotel there is an inexpensive shop of oriental sweets - we recommend.  If your plans are more substantial and include the purchase of leather (fur) products or precious jewelry, then you should visit the city of Manavgat.  Here, locals also prefer to buy things at reasonable prices.  If you have looked for a thing in the market - bargain.  The initial price should be halved and announced to the seller.  However, calling it, in the end, the product should be bought - such is the unwritten etiquette of the eastern market. </p>
