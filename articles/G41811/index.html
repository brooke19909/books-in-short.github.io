This is a region where beautifully preserved natural landscapes are combined: traditional European forests, fields and meadows, reminiscent of the scenery for the fairy tales of the Grimm brothers, and large industrial enterprises.  After all, it is precisely on the banks of the Rhine that deposits of coal and iron are located, the desire to own which was one of the reasons for the wars of the beginning of the 20th century.  Today, historical Westphalia is known as the most densely populated federal <span>state in Germany</span> with a population density higher than in Japan.  At the same time, most of the territory is occupied by unique nature reserves. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The state of North Rhine-Westphalia (originally Nordrhein-Westfalen) is located in the west of Germany and is one of the largest administrative and territorial units in the country.  To the north and partially to the east, this vast area borders on Lower Saxony, in the east - on Hesse.  In the south, its "neighbor" is the Rhineland-Palatinate land, and in the west - neighboring states - Belgium and the Netherlands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe territory is 34075 square meters.  km  The Ruhr, Rhine, Ems and Lippe, as well as the shortest <span>river</span> in all of <span>Germany,</span> Pader, flow through it. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The transport situation in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) is extremely favorable for the tourism business.  In particular, there are two airports of international importance, and four - domestic European.  For lovers of traveling by water, there is the world's largest river port, which is located in Duisburg.  In addition, the territory of the earth is surrounded by a dense network of roads and railways, connecting it with any corner of the Eurasian continent. </p><p>  <span>The recreational resources of</span> Westphalia are very rich and diverse, more than 10 million tourists from all over the world come here all year round. </p><h2>  North Rhine-Westphalia: the administrative center </h2><p>  The official capital of this administrative unit of Germany is Dusseldorf.  In addition, this city is the industrial center of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, because it is often bypassed by tourist routes, the purpose of which is to show classical Germany.

    <p>  D√ºsseldorf welcomes tourists with the Royal Alley - a magnificent boulevard that crosses all roads in the direction from the railway station to the city center.  An <span>interesting legend</span> is associated with the name of the boulevard <span>:</span> it seems to be derived from an extraordinary event that occurred here in 1848.  Then on the alley, which was called Kashtanova, the Prussian king Frederick William IV suffered an unprecedented humiliation - the townspeople threw the monarch with manure.  Today in the middle of the boulevard there is a canal, decorated on one side with the famous Triton Fountain. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The main attractions of Dusseldorf </h2><p>  The city occupies the right bank of the Rhine, and on the left are landscaped parks and fashionable sleeping areas. </p><p>  Tourists who come to Dusseldorf are shown: </p><ul><li>  Media Harbor </li><li>  Heinrich Heine's house; </li><li>  J√§gerhof Palace - Goethe Museum; </li><li>  Market Square </li><li>  Castle Square, where you can see the sculpture "Tumbling Boys" - a symbol of the city; </li><li>  embankments decorated with art objects and small architectural forms. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="North Rhine-Westphalia" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1203306.jpg" width="594"></div></h2><h2>  Cities of North Rhine-Westphalia </h2><p>  This ancient Germanic land has been inhabited since time immemorial.  Most of the cities within it were founded in the Middle Ages, and even in ancient times.  In particular, it is known that the history of Cologne and Aachen began with the settlements of the Romans.  By the XIX century, the North Rhine region was called the Ruhr and united the largest coal and metallurgical enterprises in Europe. </p><h2>  Cologne </h2><p>  The main thing that interests tourists visiting the land of North Rhine-Westphalia - the city.  Of these, the largest and one of the oldest is Cologne, also recognized as the information capital of Europe.  Here are the headquarters of many print media and television companies.  The greatest value of Cologne is the cathedral, first built in the 13th century, which houses a relic associated with the gifts of the Magi brought to the baby Jesus.  Despite all the destruction and restoration that the cathedral had to undergo, and possibly thanks to them, it is one of the best examples of Gothic temple architecture.  The tops of its towers are visible from almost anywhere in Cologne, their maximum height reaches 157 m. </p>
