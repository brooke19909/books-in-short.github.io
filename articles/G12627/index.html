Their technical characteristics and setting procedure will be given.  In addition to this, recommendations will be given on how to choose such a device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tariftele2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="setting up a tele2 modem" class="if uuid-2332824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2332824.jpg"></div><h2>  Recommendations for selection.  Main characteristics </h2><p>  Currently, there are various Tele2 modems on sale from the standpoint of technical specifications.  Moreover, the better the device, the higher its cost. </p><p>  The basic solution is labeled 3G.  In essence, this is a complete analogue of the ZTE MF710 model.  Only the difference lies in the fact that the last device can work in the cellular network of any operator, and the modem in question - only with Tele2.  This solution has the following technical specifications: </p><ol><li>  The type of SIM card is standard. </li><li>  The highest data acquisition rate is 21.6 Mbit / s, and the return of information is 11 Mbit / s. </li><li>  Full support for all current modifications of cellular networks of the 2nd and 4th generation. </li><li>  The connection interface is USB. </li></ol><p>  Another model of the modem of this company is marked 4G.  In this case, the previously listed list of cellular networks is supplemented by the LTE standard.  The type of SIM card to be installed is still the same - standard.  Download speed is 100 Mbit / s, and upload - 50 Mbit / s. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Based on the technical characteristics, it can be noted that the purchase of the 4G model is preferable.  It is more versatile and has a higher data transfer rate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tariftele2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tele2 via modem" class="if uuid-2332825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2332825.jpg"></div><h2>  Tariffs </h2><p>  The younger model with the 3G marking can be purchased for 999 rubles at the moment.  But the eldest today is estimated by the company at 2490 rubles.  Again, the modem comes in conjunction with the starter pack. </p><p>  The information and data in ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù through the modem is most optimally received and sent in the following tariff plans: </p><ol><li>  ‚ÄúMy Tele2‚Äù.  In this case, the monthly fee is 7 rubles.  For this amount, the user receives 5 GB of Internet, unlimited social networks and two instant messengers (Viber and WhatsApp).  Also in this case, conversations are also not limited, but only to the operator‚Äôs numbers. </li><li>  ‚ÄúMy conversation.‚Äù  The subscription fee for this tariff is 199 rubles per month.  In this case, the subscriber receives 2 GB of traffic.  Social networks and instant messengers are already moving into the paid category.  Communication within the Tele2 network is still free. </li><li>  ‚ÄúMy online.‚Äù  In this tariff, the monthly cost increases to 399 rubles.  The amount of data transferred increases to 12 GB.  Again, social networks and two main messengers become free.  Conversations to the numbers of this operator are not charged. </li><li>  ‚ÄúMy Online +‚Äù, in which the monthly payment is increased to 799 rubles, and the volume of traffic is 30 GB. </li></ol><p>  Any of the above tariffs is great for the modems in question.  The only thing you need to pay attention to is the amount of data transferred, which should correspond to the needs of the user. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="tariftele2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tele2 modem for computer" class="if uuid-2332826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2332826.jpg"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The delivery list of this device group is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Modem. </li><li>  User's manual. </li><li>  Protective cap. </li><li>  Warranty card. </li></ol><p>  The list above does not contain only a disk with drivers, diagnostic utilities, and documentation.  But now manufacturers are integrating a special chip with this information inside the device.  Therefore, in this case, there is no need to additionally include this disk in the delivery. </p><h2>  General setup </h2><p>  All Tele2 modems are configured as follows: </p><ol><li>  Connection to a PC port. </li><li>  Installation of the necessary software. </li><li>  Reboot the computing system. </li><li>  Connection testing. </li></ol><p>  After that, everything is ready for operation. </p><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  Before you configure the ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù modem, you must connect it.  All modern models of such devices are installed in a wired USB 2.0 format port.  It is in this combination that it is most optimal to use such devices.  But it is also possible to install a similar modem in other versions of such a port.  The procedure in this case is as follows: </p><ol><li>  We remove the device from the package. </li><li>  Install the card of the mobile operator in the appropriate slot. </li><li>  Remove the protective cap. </li><li>  The released connector is installed in the port of the personal computer. </li></ol><p>  At this stage, the switching is completed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tariftele2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="configure tele2 modem" class="if uuid-2332831" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2332831.jpg"></div><h2>  Software setting </h2><p>  As noted earlier, the equipment connection has already been completed.  Now you need to reconfigure the computer shell and install drivers and other control software in it.  Setting up the ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù modem at this stage includes the following actions: </p><ol><li>  After connecting the equipment, the installation of drivers in automatic mode begins.  Following the instructions, you must install them. </li><li>  Then the operator‚Äôs service program is installed, with which you can find out the status of the account and the tariff plan.  Again, in this case, you must complete the instructions of the installation wizard in full. </li><li>  The next step is to reboot the system unit.  With its help, previously made changes correctly take effect. </li></ol><h2>  Health testing </h2><p>  Actually, this answers the question about how to connect the Tele2 modem and configure it, completed.  It is only necessary to verify the operability of this system.  To do this, the following manipulations are performed: </p><ol><li>  Account must be replenished. </li><li>  We launch a browser on an electronic computer and open any information resource from the Global Web in its window.  If it opens, then everything is ready for operation.  Otherwise, you need to find out the cause of the malfunction and eliminate it without fail. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="tariftele2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect a tele2 modem" class="if uuid-2332834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2332834.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Any modern ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù modem for a computer has the following advantages: </p><ol><li>  Low cost. </li><li>  Simple setup procedure. </li><li>  Sufficient equipment. </li><li>  Good technical specifications. </li><li>  The necessary software is recorded inside the device, and there is no need to separately use the CD during the setup process. </li></ol><p>  Regarding the volume of traffic, users indicate that with the right approach, there should not be any problems with its number.  The same can be noted regarding the speed of information transfer. </p><p>  The disadvantages of this equipment are: </p><ol><li>  Ability to work only with a SIM card of the same name operator. </li><li>  The lack of a connector for connecting an external antenna, and therefore such equipment far from communication towers will not work. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="tariftele2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="modems tele2" class="if uuid-2332838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2332838.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As part of this material, various Tele2 modems were considered.  This group of devices does not have significant disadvantages and boasts a solid set of advantages.  Moreover, their cost is quite democratic.  Therefore, this device is great for home or office use.  But again, such a modem will only work next to the cell tower.  With a significant removal, the signal quality will decrease, and the connection to the Global Web will cease to function.  But it is impossible to connect an external antenna to enhance reception in this case: the required connector is not provided for the solutions under consideration. </p>
