    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists visit the resort Malia Galini Apartments 3 * every year.  Reviews about him contain the following positive impressions: </p><ul><li>  thanks to high-quality double-glazed windows, street noise will not bother you, even if the windows of your room overlook the roadway; </li><li>  spacious and well-equipped rooms; </li><li>  the hotel has employees who speak Russian quite well; </li><li>  despite the fact that it takes about 10 minutes to get to the beach, the road is very convenient and runs past neighboring beautiful hotels; </li><li>  the hotel area is very beautiful and well-groomed; </li><li>  nice beach with convenient entry into the sea (without prickly stones); </li><li>  there are a lot of flowers and other green spaces in the territory (there are even <span>banana palms);</span>  The hotel has a relaxed, homely atmosphere; </li><li>  due to the fact that the hotel‚Äôs courtyard is closed, you can not be afraid that children will run outside the territory; </li><li>  happy with the opportunity to cook food on their own; </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The most significant negative aspects of living in this hotel can be considered the following: </p><ul><li>  the device of the shower is very ill-conceived - there are no barriers or curtains, and therefore, after a bath, a flood forms on the floor; </li><li>  despite the fact that cosmetic kits are declared, in fact they are not issued (there is not even a bar of soap); </li><li>  breakfasts, although not bad, but they constantly serve the same thing; </li><li>  there are no mosquito nets in some rooms of Galini Apartments Malia (Galini apartments 3, 8, 9), which is why there are a lot of mosquitoes in the room; </li><li>  the standard rooms do not have double beds (despite the fact that this is indicated in the brochures). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  If you want to relax in a quiet homely atmosphere, then this hotel is just perfect for you.  Everything here is saturated with the atmosphere of coziness and comfort.  The rooms are decorated in pleasant soft colors, and the area is planted with a huge number of flowers and tropical palm trees.  Since the distance to the beach is significant, you will certainly be pleased with the opportunity to swim in the clean pool.  And of course, an important fact is that the hotel is closed, and therefore it is very convenient to relax with children who constantly strive to escape somewhere.  There is a sun terrace, as well as playgrounds and all the necessary equipment for organizing a barbecue. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the hotel does not work on an all-inclusive basis.  The only thing you can count on is breakfast, but they are pretty monotonous, albeit very satisfying.  Nevertheless, your apartment will have its own kitchen area with all necessary household appliances, as well as dishes and other utensils.  You will have the opportunity to cook food at your discretion by purchasing products in the nearest supermarket or in the market.  Also nearby is a huge number of cafes and restaurants where you can eat inexpensively and tasty. </p><p>  The hotel is located at a distance of about 150 meters from the sea (well-kept urban beach), and therefore the road to it can take from 5 to 10 minutes.  Despite the fact that the path goes uphill, it is quite easy to overcome it, because the sidewalk is smooth and asphalted.  In addition, your path will run along the rows of beautiful resort hotels.  Due to the fact that the hotel is located in the city center, you will find yourself in the midst of tourist life.  Also nearby is a huge number of natural, architectural and historical attractions. </p>
