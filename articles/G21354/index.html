It is often used on modern cars.  Perhaps the alarm will not save you from theft, but it will help stop attempts to damage.  It often happens that in the courtyards, children, by chance or by chance, can hook the car.  Shelling cars from airguns is also not uncommon.  With the help of the security complex, the owner will be able to respond in time to the damage.  Alarm can scare offenders - there are many such cases.  It is best to entrust the connection of the alarm to experienced professionals, but if there are none, you can try to do it yourself.  The operation is not so complicated.  Let's see how to connect an alarm. </p><h2>  Standards and schemes of different manufacturers </h2><p>  If we analyze the connection schemes of car alarms from various manufacturers, we can conclude that there are no standard schemes and a single unification.  Wires of the same color from different manufacturers solve different problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect an alarm" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2120548.jpg"></div>  A particular brand has its own method of installing and connecting devices.

    <h2>  Mount the alarm unit </h2><p>  The first step is to install the main unit.  The main problem for many is where to connect the alarm?  It is installed in the passenger compartment, in a place known only to the driver.  If this is a serious security complex, then there are several such blocks - they are best placed in different places.  This will help to gain time when car thieves get involved.  Before connecting the alarm sensor, you need to disassemble the left rack.  It is recommended to install it there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a standard, a simple alarm unit is hidden inside the dashboard, but other places can be found.  The block is desirable to fix.  It can be glued to double-sided tape or attached with self-tapping screws.  Also at this stage, you should deal with the electrical circuit - it shows how to connect the alarm to power, turn signals, central locking solenoids. </p><h2>  Wire pulling </h2><p>  There are usually many cords.  It is better to stretch them in closed places that are reliably protected from moisture and high temperatures.  It is better to stretch the wiring in a braid, and for mounting on the body it is recommended to use plastic clamps.  Tighten them at a distance of no more than 20 centimeters from each other.  Whatever the alarm, it has redundant wires.  The trailer for opening the door and trunk are different wires.  But since there is only one function, they are connected through one cord.  The second is better to trim.  Subsequently, when there are any problems with the alarm system, it will be easier to determine the possible cause and find the circuit in which there are malfunctions.  The practice of mounting alarms shows that complete wires are often not enough.  Therefore, it is better to purchase additional ones in advance. </p><h2>  Power connection </h2><p>  Everything is simple here.  It is enough to find a large thick cable on the car's fuse box - this is a positive wire.  The mass is taken from the body.  The wires are stripped and connected using quick-release terminal blocks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect locks to an alarm" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2120542.jpg"></div>  Manufacturers recommend taking the ‚Äúplus‚Äù and the mass from the ignition.  Other connection points can also be found there.  When installing, use a multimeter.  With it, you can conveniently and safely find the right wires.

The main plus for power can be found in the ignition switch.  The starter contact with negative polarity is also in this place.  The ACC element is located there.  A contact of ignition with a positive polarity can be detected in the contact group of the lock. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect a keychain to an alarm" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2120546.jpg"></div>  The standard lock in most cases is connected via a negative wire.  But there are exceptions.  Doors and their trailer are controlled by positive polarity, but it is better to double-check everything according to the scheme.  Dimensions are connected to the positive wire, and the locations of these wires are marked in the fuse box.  In most cases, these points are enough to solve such a problem as connecting an alarm system to a VAZ (be it Classic or modern Vesta).

    <h2>  Connection of external light signals </h2><p>  In almost all devices, indication is carried out through the direction indicator lamps.  It is better to use two wires - each is responsible for its own side.  It is advisable to connect via diodes in order to exclude the circuit of the parties.  It is more rational to connect through the dimensions - they have less power consumption, and also one wire without diodes is needed to connect. </p><h2>  Connection to the central lock </h2><p>  Perhaps the alarm will not save you from <span>car theft,</span> but it will make the driver‚Äôs life more comfortable.  Many systems implement central locking controls.  Let's see how to connect the locks to the alarm.  We assume that the solenoids are already installed. </p><p>  The first step is to understand the colors of the wires and what commands they execute.  To do this, it is better to use a multimeter.  The search algorithm for the desired contact is quite simple: the device is set to resistance measurement mode.  The minus is connected to one of the contact, press the button that closes the door.  With a multimeter, you need to look for zero resistance.  After that, the button can be released.  When resistance equals infinity, this is the desired contact.  They are also looking for a second contact.  This is done in a similar way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect an alarm system to a vaz" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2120543.jpg"></div>  Then, the threshold is removed from the driver‚Äôs side.  Next, find the necessary wires, which were determined in advance.  They connect alarm wires that are responsible for opening and closing doors.

    <h2>  How to connect the Starline alarm? </h2><p>  The Starline company produces popular modern security systems with an autostart function, as well as ‚Äúquick dialogue‚Äù functions that exclude the possibility of breaking into a security complex with a code grabber.  Most models have 60 or more standard as well as programmable functions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to connect the alarm" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2120547.jpg"></div>  For installation, you will need an alarm, a solenoid on the driver's door, a soldering iron and soldering materials, protective diodes, electrical tape.  Before connecting the alarm, remove the plastic of the steering shaft, unscrew the screws securing the dashboard, as well as other nuts and screws.  Then, an LED is installed in the front windshield rack, as well as an impact sensor.  A service button is installed anywhere.  These security complexes have an antenna.  It is better to mount it on the windshield.  Next, connect the wires from the 18-pin connector according to the instruction diagram.  So, the black wire is connected to the mass, red - to the "plus".  And further according to the scheme.

    <h2>  How to tie a keychain? </h2><p>  In addition to the fact that the driver is faced with the task of installing an alarm, he must solve another problem - how to connect an <span>alarm key fob?</span>  Sometimes they are unprogrammed.  A key fob or radio transmitter is the main device that allows you to control the security complex.  If the alarm is new, then reprogramming is not necessary.  If the car is used, it is better to reprogram. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect a starline alarm" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2120544.jpg"></div>  To begin with, the unit is transferred to service mode, which allows you to perform maintenance on the device.  To switch to this mode, there is a special combination of clicks on certain buttons - each manufacturer has its own. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect an alarm sensor" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2120545.jpg"></div>  First you need to disarm the alarm.  The Valet button is pressed several times, and then the ignition is turned on.  If several beeps are heard, then it was possible to enter the system.  Next, you need to press several buttons specified in the instructions, after which a sound signal will sound.  The key fob is programmed, and the system remembers it.  You can freely use the alarm.

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Here's how to connect an alarm with your own hands.  In general, the process is simple and does not require special skills, but it is not always possible to configure everything correctly independently.  If the car has a lot of electronic systems, it is better to trust professionals.  But a simple budget system can be connected independently, in half a day without experience. </p>
