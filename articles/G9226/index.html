This is not only a convenient means of payment, but also a reliable custodian of the funds of the owner.  Sberbank PJSC is the leader in the number of issued plastic cards in the Russian Federation.  But sometimes bank customers have to face an unpleasant situation: the card balance unexpectedly "went into the red."  There are several reasons why the Sberbank card has a negative balance, and not all of them are cause for concern. </p><h2>  Card balance: how to quickly find out about the availability of funds? </h2><p>  Those users who actively pay with credit cards at retail outlets and online stores, cafes and gas stations want to always be aware of the balance of funds in the account.  Obtaining operational information about the card balance reduces the risk of fraudulent activities, including theft of funds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smashfreakz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why is there a negative balance on the Sberbank card" class="if uuid-2864826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2864826.jpg"></div><p>  The methods provided to users on how to find out the card balance differ from each other in speed, commission and client preferences: </p><ol><li>  Checking at ATMs and terminals.  A proven option that does not require special skills is the use of the Sberbank terminal network.  To check the balance in the ATM, you need to insert the card with the chip in front (it is on the front side of the plastic), enter the PIN code (4 digits), select the "Request balance" tab in the menu that opens, and the method of providing information - with a check or on the screen. </li><li>  USSD request using "Mobile Bank".  This is the fastest way to find out the balance of the card.  To receive information on SMS, you need to send a message with the text "Balance" to the number "900", indicating the last 4 digits of the card with a space.  The cost of the service is 3 rubles.  If there is only one card, just dial * 900 * 01 # and press the call button. </li><li>  Internet banking "Sberbank Online".  Using a mobile application or desktop version, a client can enter the Personal Account and get acquainted with the balances on all accounts.  Registration and use of online banking is free.  Identification is made using login and password.  Login is issued in the bank terminal, passwords come in SMS notifications from the number "900". </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailysmarttech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="negative balance on the debit card of Sberbank" class="if uuid-2864814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2864814.jpg"></div><p>  Having learned how to check the balance, the user can always have an idea about the availability of funds on a plastic card.  If the card is "minus", you should familiarize yourself with the reasons that could lead to the debiting of funds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reasons for the negative balance on Sberbank cards: all cases </h2><p>  There are several options in which the user's card balance becomes negative: </p><ul><li>  overdraft care; </li><li>  account seizure; </li><li>  write-off for annual service; </li><li>  payment for the Mobile Bank service; </li><li>  technical malfunction. </li></ul><h2>  Overdraft cards: what is it, reasons for negative balance </h2><p>  In Sberbank, an overdraft for individuals is a ‚Äúcard loss in the negative‚Äù when the limit of the client‚Äôs own funds is exceeded.  This is a feature of a bank card, which is an analogue of a credit card: unlike the latter, overdraft cards are not issued with a bank limit, but with the possibility of establishing a negative balance up to a certain amount (for example, -30,000 rubles). </p><div class="photo" data-original="businesstech.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why is there a negative balance on the Sberbank card" class="if uuid-2864794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2864794.jpg"></div><p>  The overdraft limit is set taking into account the solvency of the client and his wishes.  It can be reduced at the request of the user.  An increase in overdraft is carried out at the initiative of the bank if the owner actively uses the opportunity of the card and does not allow delays in making borrowed funds.  In this case, there are no negative consequences of the negative balance on the Sberbank card. </p><p>  When making funds late with the client, the credit history worsens.  The bank has the right to reduce the overdraft limit by notifying the client about it in SMS from the number "900". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Since 2017, the opening of overdraft plastic cards has been temporarily stopped at Sberbank.  Customers who previously issued products can use analogues of credit cards without restriction. </p><h2>  Sberbank card arrest: causes, consequences </h2><p>  One of the unpleasant reasons why the Sberbank card has a negative balance is the seizure of a customer account.  A feature of this case is its unlimited limit: an arrest can be imposed on the amount from 1 ruble to several million. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gsmarena.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank overdraft for individuals" class="if uuid-2864808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2864808.jpg"></div><p>  The arrest is imposed by the Federal Bailiff Service at the place of registration of the card holder.  It is always associated with the debts of the client and can be caused by: </p><ul><li>  arrears on loans; </li><li>  non-payment of utilities; </li><li>  delay in payment of tax payments or fines of the traffic police, administrative offenses. </li></ul><p>  Upon the seizure of a Sberbank card account, a client may receive a certificate from the bank stating the reasons for debiting the funds.  The extract shall indicate the number of the enforcement proceedings, the name of the authorized person, the amount debited from the account, the balance of the debt (if any), the date of the document.  With this certificate, it is recommended to contact an employee of the FSSP of the Russian Federation to find out about the debt and ways of returning funds. </p><h2>  Negative card balance in case of non-payment of credit </h2><p>  If the client has repeatedly made delays in Sberbank loans, the debit may be executed by the bank collection service.  In this case, the certificate in the column "Contractor" will not contain the full name of the bailiff, but the name of the supervising department of Sberbank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="paymentweek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="on the Sberbank card minus balance what to do" class="if uuid-2864817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2864817.jpg"></div><p>  In order to get rid of the debt debited from the card, the bank card holder is required to urgently deposit funds under the loan agreement.  Money can be debited from both the owner of the loan and the guarantor specified in the loan agreement. </p><h2>  Annual maintenance: when does the new card go "minus"? </h2><p>  The negative balance on the debit card of Sberbank arises immediately after the registration of the product.  The size of the "minus" is proportional to the amount of annual card maintenance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.diplomacyandcommerce.rs" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="on the card of &quot;Sberbank&quot; minus balance of consequences" class="if uuid-2864822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2864822.jpg"></div><p>  To get rid of debt, the client must deposit funds into the account upon receipt of the product.  This can be done in the bank office, terminals or by transfer from another account.  The fastest way to receive money is when you deposit at a Sberbank ATM: crediting time is from 1 minute. </p><h2>  Payment of the Mobile Bank service </h2><p>  The write-off of funds for SMS alerts from the number "900" is the reason why the Sberbank card has a minus balance of 60 or 30 rubles. </p><p>  The amount depends on the type of card: for instant issuance cards and social cards, the cost of the full package of Mobile Bank is 30 rubles.  In other cases, the client will receive a notification about the write-off of 60 rubles to the account of the service. </p><p>  Charging takes place 2 months after connecting a full package of services.  It makes it possible to quickly receive information about all changes in the balance of the card in the form of notifications. </p><p>  If the cardholder does not want to pay a commission for the service, he can switch to the ‚ÄúMobile Bank‚Äù economical tariff with free service or completely disable the service. </p><h2>  Technical failure: what to do in case of a system error? </h2><p>  The reason why the negative balance on the Sberbank card may be due to a technical malfunction.  This rare occurrence can cause trouble to the cardholder. </p><p>  Write-off due to a bank system error in 90% of cases is associated with a general program failure in Sberbank.  In this case, the client may receive a notification from the bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.idownloadblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank card negative balance: how to withdraw money" class="if uuid-2864824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2864824.jpg"></div><p>  To get rid of a debt arising due to a technical error, the cardholder should contact the Support Service.  Contact Center specialists will accept a request for adjustment of funds and will inform you about the deadlines for correcting the situation. </p><p>  The application will be executed within 48 hours from the date of failure.  If the error was of a systemic nature, that is, hundreds of customers have encountered problems, funds are returned faster: from 1 to 24 hours, depending on the number of applications. </p><h2>  On the card of Sberbank negative balance: how to withdraw money in this case? </h2><p>  If a client has debited funds from a bank card, this greatly complicates their withdrawal.  In some cases, receiving money within a day is not possible.  Such situations include seizure of accounts and overdraft. </p><p>  On the card of Sberbank negative balance: what to do and how to withdraw funds? </p><ul><li>  In the event of a technical malfunction, leave an appeal.  If possible, the cardholder should come to the bank office with a card and passport.  The manager will tell you how to fill out a refund application.  Money can be returned within a few minutes.  Sometimes a visit to the office is the only way to quickly receive funds, since the support service considers the application longer: it takes up to 48 hours to process the application. </li><li>  In the event of a negative balance associated with the seizure of accounts, it is required to contact the Federal Service of Court Bailiffs of the region with an extract on enforcement proceedings.  If the arrest is imposed erroneously, for example, due to a traffic police fine that the car owner has already paid, documents are required to confirm the fact of payment of the bill.  In the case of authorized debiting, funds will be returned to the client's account only after all debts have been paid.  The arrest is withdrawn within 10 days from the date of fulfillment of obligations by a client of Sberbank. </li></ul>
