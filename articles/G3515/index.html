Therefore, it‚Äôs difficult to call it even a hotel.  Rather, it is a resort complex, stretching over 800 meters in length.  Incidentally, it has a pretty good location, because it takes only 45 minutes to go to Male International Airport from here by boat.  This is the first fact about this complex that deserves attention.  But everything else is worth telling in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Deluxe Apartment </h2><p>  Now you can proceed to the description of rooms Olhuveli Beach &amp; SPA Resort 4 *.  The most inexpensive option is a deluxe area of ‚Äã‚Äã50 square meters.  m, designed for two adult guests.  Located near the beach. </p><p>  Deluxe is a room with a balcony with amazing views of the ocean.  Inside there is a huge 2-double bed, there is a CD / DVD player, a plasma TV, a telephone for intercom, a safe, a working and living area, a fan and a climate system, a dressing room, a minibar, Wi-Fi, an electric kettle and even ironing accessories.  Naturally, a bathroom with a shower, as well as a toilet in the room are also available. </p><p>  What about the cost?  Many people decide to immediately buy a <span>tour to the Maldives</span> for two - the price in this case is indicated immediately taking into account accommodation, flight, transfer, etc. But in this case it will not be possible to find out how much it costs just to stay.  Well, it's worth fixing it.  If you book yourself, then the deluxe will cost about 10-12 thousand rubles per day (with breakfast).  Want to order <span>all inclusive</span> right away <span>?</span>  Then the daily price will increase to 30,000 p. </p><h2>  Grand Beach Villa </h2><p>  This is a more expensive option.  The villa has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã55 square meters.  m, located on the beach, like deluxe.  Of the features - the presence of a separate living room and higher ceilings.  The photo above, by the way, shows part of the villa. </p><p>  It is designed to accommodate four adults, although you can move in any quantity.  But the more - the more profitable.  The cost of a daily stay including all inclusive for four will be about 60-65 thousand rubles. </p><p>  By the way, one important nuance should be clarified.  It is actually more profitable to immediately buy a tour to the Maldives for two.  The price will be paid and no additional costs will be required.  But if you plan your trip on your own and book apartments separately, you will still need to pay a tax of 23.2% (and this is almost ¬º of the amount extra!) And a state fee of $ 6 per person per day. </p>
