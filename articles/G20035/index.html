  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ideology is the principle of organization of society</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In a simple sense, ideology is, first of all, a system of views and ideas.  This is a very important social phenomenon, which currently has several types.  All of them were formed in strict dependence on the realities characteristic of a particular era.  Ideology is closely related to politics, since it is part of the state system, on which the implementation of a particular belief system depends.  To better understand this phenomenon, we will consider the history of its occurrence, types, and also study the role that ideology plays in modern society. </p><p>  <strong>Concept of ideology</strong> </p><p>  For the first time, the French started talking about it: A. Destiut de Tracy and Etienne de Condillac at the end of the 18th century tried to create a science whose subject would be devoted to the ideas and principles of their formation.  They believed that this doctrine should structure the rules of leadership in social life, therefore, it should be based on elements of law, <span>politics and morality.</span> </p><p>  But Napoleon rejected the abstract <span>ideas of these</span> scientists, and the concept of ideology was forgotten until Karl Marx began to create his theory, in which it subsequently became one of the key.  According to <span>Marxist theory,</span> ideology is an expression of the interests of a particular class. </p><p>  Currently, it is perceived as a belief system that contains the interests of a small group or society, and also reflects people's attitudes towards reality. </p><p>  <strong>Types of ideology</strong> </p><p>  Since ideology is a multifaceted concept that includes a whole system of views, over time, several of its types have formed under the influence of political and economic factors. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Liberalistic.  This ideology draws attention to <span>human freedom.</span>  Its adherents believe that the rights and freedoms of everyone should be supported by a legal framework.  The greatest freedom to dispose of property is also shown here: legislation minimally regulates this process, allowing a person to use his property as he pleases.  In general, according to liberalism, any personality manifestation (behavior in society, as well as ways of self-realization) should be minimally limited by law: on the one hand, this is a positive quality of ideology, but freedom must be timely, because inappropriate liberalism can corrupt society. </li><li>  Conservative ideology is, first of all, following traditions, values ‚Äã‚Äãand religious doctrines.  Extremism and any radical reforms are denied here, and stability, the strengthening of security and military force are encouraged. </li><li>  Socialist.  This ideology proclaims <span>social justice</span> and <span>equality.</span>  <span>Public</span> ownership is a characteristic feature of socialism.  Citizens are provided by the state, and they, in turn, are working for its good. </li><li>  Anti-ideology.  Recently, it is becoming more popular, which means rejection of any of the existing ideologies. </li></ul><p>  <strong>The main functions of ideology</strong> </p><p>  There are 5 main functions: </p><ol><li>  Orientation of humanity.  Since ideology contains a <span>system of values,</span> as well as basic provisions on the structure of society and the role of the individual in it, one way or another, in the implementation of these views, people's activities are adjusted. </li><li>  Mobilization of people.  Proponents of ideology come together in groups to realize common views, of which they are adherents. </li><li>  Society integration.  Ideology is more global in nature than any personal interest, this is expressed in the integration of people: they accept common views and interests. </li><li>  Depreciation.  Sometimes a mismatch arises between the needs and capabilities of classes and groups of people.  Then ideology serves to weaken, soften the conflict situation. </li><li>  Expression and advocacy.  Ideology is formed taking into account the circumstances of real life.  Despite the presence of sublime ideas in any concept, some of them are of practical importance.  Indeed, ideas that do not bring practical benefits rarely have many adherents.  It follows that any system of views adopted by society corresponds to one's interests, and accordingly, is aimed at their implementation and protection. </li></ol><p>  In modern conditions, as we see, ideology is a necessary phenomenon that allows us to unite society and direct it towards the achievement of common goals. </p>
