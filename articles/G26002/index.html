Even during the financial crisis in the last decade, the decline in construction was minimal, and housing prices rose steadily.  Moreover, the above trend was characteristic not only for the capital districts of the Russian Federation, but also for regional and district centers of almost any region of our country.  The construction boom also did not pass by the Udmurt Territory: since the beginning of the century, a huge number of both large and small construction companies have been registered in Izhevsk.  We offer our readers information about the most promising and trustworthy construction companies in Izhevsk, and the most remarkable reviews about them.  They are engaged in the construction and sale of residential and commercial real estate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="construction companies of Izhevsk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57358/1934599.jpg"></div>
