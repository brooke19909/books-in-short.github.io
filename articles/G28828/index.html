"Holiday Garden Resort" is the name of the five-star hotel, which will be the focus of our article today.  This hotel is chosen by our compatriots.  There are many reviews about her, mostly positive.  We grouped them and analyzed.  The result is a detailed description of the hotel, which, we hope, will be useful to you.  The hotel is located in the village of Okurcalar, the most western satellite resort of Alanya.  This location makes it close to another Turkish city - Side.

    <h2>  Where is it and what is it </h2><p>  The Anatolian Riviera is what Turkey attracts our compatriots in the summer.  Holiday Garden Resort is located in its far west.  35 km from the city of Alanya, and 85 km from <span>Antalya</span> International <span>Airport</span> even further.  You can get to the hotel (if your transfer package does not include a transfer) by bus to Side.  Hotel Holiday Garden Resort is located on the first line of the sea.  Immediately after it passes the road connecting the resort towns of Incekum and Avsallar.  On it with a small interval dolmushi, local minibuses ply.  So, despite the location remote from Alanya, tourists in Okurcalar do not feel cut off from the world.  "Holiday Garden Resort" is a small hotel across the territory, consisting of one six-story building.  It was built in 2005, and the last reconstruction took place in 2010.  This is a chain hotel.  Her management is part of the Alba Resort group.  Although the territory of the hotel is small, but, according to reviews, very beautiful and well-groomed.  The building stands near the road.  It adjoins the magnificent open terrace of the restaurant.  Immediately behind the body are pools with <span>water slides.</span>  And finally, the territory of the hotel ends with its own beach. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Where do they live </h2><p>  Most of the rooms in the hotel are classified as standard.  Each room has a spacious balcony.  It offers amazing views of the sea or the green hills that the Alanya coast (Turkey) is so famous for.  Holiday Garden Resort has specially equipped two rooms for disabled guests so that each guest feels comfortable and comfortable.  The bathroom has a shower.  And the suites are equipped with a jacuzzi.  What pleasantly surprised the guests was the carpeted floor.  The rooms have everything that relies on the Turkish "five": hairdryer, flat-screen TV with cable channels, individual air conditioning and the like.  What the reviews say is a very thorough cleaning.  It is done without any tips.  And if you leave a couple of lire for the maids, they will create different shapes for you from towels: swans, hearts and the like.  A minibar and safety deposit box - warn reviews - are available for a fee. </p>

    <h2>  How to feed </h2><p>  A high-quality ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù is a magnet that attracts Russian tourists to Turkey.  Holiday Garden Resort is no exception.  They also practice the all-inclusive system.  Bracelets provide an opportunity to visit not only the main restaurant.  By appointment, you can enjoy a romantic dinner at the √† la carte restaurant.  The bracelets are also treated to local wines and soft drinks in three bars: in the lobby, by the pool and almost on the beach.  Tourists who have visited the "Holiday Garden Resort", claim that the food is plentiful and very diverse.  During the week of rest, not a single menu was repeated.  Interestingly, this hotel also serves delicious ice cream.  Guests praise delicious Turkish desserts and pastries.  However, even those who are forced to follow a diet also find a decent selection of dishes for themselves.  Breakfasts are classic, with plenty of fruits and vegetables.  Lunches and dinners are a balanced combination of European and Turkish dishes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Pools and beach </h2><p>  Of course, not a single "all inclusive" person lives.  We are attracted by the hot sun and the warm Mediterranean Sea - what summer Turkey is rich in.  "Holiday Garden Resort 5 *" has its own beach, which is located a hundred meters from the building.  But until you reach this wide coastal strip of sand interspersed with pebbles, you will inevitably want to plunge into the pool.  The path to the sea leads through a pretty arched bridge, and then three high slides, from which one wants to slide down so that, raising hundreds of splashes, plop down into the pool.  Tourists claim that young people frolic in these water rides will in no way disturb the peace of other vacationers.  Slides descend into a completely different pool.  There is a third in the hotel - indoor, heated.  It is not crowded and can be relaxed in complete silence.  There are many umbrellas and sunbeds by the pools and the beach.  No need to disgrace and take a seat at six in the morning.  Sun beds enough for everyone, even in high season.  But, reviews warn, you need to bring a <span>beach towel with you.</span>  The hotel gives this only for a fee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Holiday Garden Resort 5 Turkey" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1092814.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Services and entertainment </h2><p>  ‚ÄúHoliday Garden Resort‚Äù (Turkey) is even called a spa hotel.  As a bonus, free access to wonderful baths is included.  You can heat the bones in the Finnish sauna, or you can, on the contrary, drown in foam in the Turkish hammam.  A fitness room with exercise equipment is also free.  In general, the promotion of a healthy lifestyle is the policy of the hotel.  Guests can enjoy a variety of sports for free, from tennis to beach volleyball.  Animators conduct aerobics classes.  Speaking of entertainment.  The reviews say that the animation team is trying in every way to amuse the guests.  Regularly held shows, discotheques with lotteries.  Well, for those who prefer to spend leisure time on social networks, free Wi-Fi is provided.  Reviews say decent speed - you can chat on Skype. </p><h2>  Services for the smallest </h2><p>  In a republic such as Turkey (the Holiday Garden Resort hotel is no exception), they are especially kind to children.  For younger guests, there is a private pool with a small and not at all terrible slide and a playground.  And for them a mini club is provided.  Professional animators-educators are involved with children.  If you arrived at the hotel with a baby up to two years old, they will put a crib in your room.  In agreement with the administration and for a fee, you can use the services of a nanny. </p>

    <h2>  Specifics of Okurcalar (Alanya, Turkey) </h2><p>  Hotel ‚ÄúHoliday Garden Resort‚Äù reviews are called very quiet, designed for families.  But this definition applies to the whole resort village - Okudzhalaru.  The town is new, entirely consisting of hotels.  Near the hotel are "Stella Beach" and "Meriyan" - also very quiet places to relax.  To diversify their stay in Turkey, tourists travel to Alanya or Side.  In the first one you can see the fortress city, towering on a high cliff, the Red Tower, the docks of Cleopatra.  Side is famous for the ancient amphitheater and the ruins of pagan temples.  For shopping, it is not necessary to go to Alanya.  A crowded fair is held on Tuesdays and Fridays in Okurcalar. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel "Holiday Garden Resort 5 *", Turkey: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists liked the food at the hotel.  Some were simply shocked by the variety of dishes in the main restaurant.  For a week - they assure - you will not have time to try everything.  The hotel beach has a very shallow bottom, which is good for young children.  The mountain river, which flows into the sea nearby, only slightly cools the water, but does not make it cloudy.  Hotel "Holiday Garden Resort 5 *" (Turkey) provides its guests with a lot of free services.  The most memorable for tourists is the SPA center and water slides.  You can‚Äôt call this a full-fledged water park, but it's nice to ride a couple of times.  For a more vivid experience, you can go to the Water Planet Hotel in Okurcalar.  There is a real water park, where guests of other hotels are allowed for a fee. </p>
