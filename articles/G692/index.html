    <p>  It's no secret that the beautiful sea and clean beaches - this is exactly what tourists are waiting for, choosing to relax in Egypt.  The Hilton Taba Resort hotel is located almost on the seashore - the hotel territory opens to it. </p><p>  The entrance to the sea is quite convenient, but since the bottom is covered with pebbles and coral reefs are located nearby, you should take care of the availability of special shoes.  The sea is mostly calm and warm.  There are plenty of sun loungers and umbrellas on the shore - they are intended exclusively for hotel guests, as the beach is private and therefore closed to outsiders.  Nearby there is a small bar where you can get drinks and even light snacks. </p><h2>  Water and beach activities for travelers </h2>
