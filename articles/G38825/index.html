    <h2>  Koblevo </h2><p>  This resort has been known since the days of the Soviet Union.  But even now, the small village of Koblevo consists exclusively of hundreds of boarding houses and recreation centers, which stretch along the sea for six kilometers.  There is virtually no private sector.  Pension "Arcadia" (Koblevo) is located here very well - on the one hand, on the seashore, and on the other - in the middle of a very developed resort infrastructure.  After all, there is a water park, a whole city of attractions, and various bars, clubs, restaurants, karaoke.  In the evenings, discos and concerts are held.  On the beaches there is a huge selection of water activities - ‚Äúbananas‚Äù, ‚Äúbuns‚Äù, skis, parachutes, yachts, windsurfing, scooters ... And at the same time, it is an ecologically clean area.  It smells of steppe and pine trees from the centuries-old forest, which are overgrown with local sand dunes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Base Arcadia Koblevo" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1571126.jpg" width="600"></div>
