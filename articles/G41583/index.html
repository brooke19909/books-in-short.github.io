    <p>  <strong>History of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict</strong> </p><p>  Representatives of Armenian and Azerbaijani nationalities live in the territory of the modern Republic of Nagorno-Krabakh.  Of course, every nation is drawn to its roots, its own state, but there are almost equal numbers of people from one side and the other.  How to solve <span>this conflict of</span> Nagorno-Karabakh, to which state should this small belligerent republic join?  During the existence of the Soviet Union, these peoples lived peacefully, as they were part of one large state.  And in 1987, letters began to come to Moscow asking them to join Nagorno- <span>Karabakh, the conflict</span> in which was beginning to gain momentum, to Armenia.  Then the Armenians decided to collect signatures and send them to the Kremlin.  And then Abel Aganbegyan, Gorbachev's adviser, added fuel to the flames, who said in Paris that Nagorno-Krabakh should be handed over to Armenia.  In the village of Chardakhli (north of Azerbaijan), there was a clash between local authorities and Armenians, who revealed disagreement with the newly appointed collective farm chairman.  The police beat these Armenians and they came to rally in Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nagorno-Karabakh conflict" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10576/57172.jpg" width="600"></div>  On February 20, 1988, the Council of People‚Äôs Deputies of the NKAR decided to include this territory in Armenia.  The reaction of the Azerbaijanis was instantaneous, and on February 22, a clash of protesters from both sides took place near Askeran.  People died, and the conflict remained unresolved.  <span>Nagorno-Karabakh</span> in 1989 was partially removed from the control of Azerbaijan.  State troops entered this territory, but skirmishes continued anyway.  As a result of all these actions, a <span>war</span> broke <span>out</span> in 1991 <span>.</span>  <span>Nagorno-Karabakh, the</span> conflict in which at that time reached its climax, was occupied from all sides.  Only after the intervention of Russian troops in 1994, the war ended in the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh.  The history of the conflict provides information that Russia supplied weapons to both sides, although Azerbaijan claimed to have received assistance from Turkey.

    <p>  <strong>Current situation</strong> </p><p>  In the modern world, the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh has not been resolved.  Despite the fact that both the CSCE, NATO, and the European Union have decided on the agenda to solve the problem in the republic, there is no sense of reconciliation here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nagorno-Krabakh Conflict" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10576/57173.jpg" width="600"></div>  The heads of states applying for it should sort it out among themselves.  And since no one makes any concessions, the problem stands still, and Nagorno-Karabakh, a conflict in which there is still no, no, and even ignites bloodshed, formally belongs to Azerbaijan.  Recently, the head of the Azerbaijani community of Nagorno-Karabakh, Bayram Safarov, reported that Armenians can live in this territory only if they accept local citizenship.  And those who refuse to accept him must immediately leave the territory.
