The new generation of the iPhone 6S, presented in the fall of 2015, is not far behind all these parameters.  Traditionally, the device received a lot of updates, and the main one was the color in which the new iPhone is produced - pink.  To be more precise, this combination is called ‚Äúpink gold‚Äù. </p><h2>  Novelty </h2><p>  Each of the devices that the ‚Äúapple‚Äù company represents is expected by millions of device fans around the world.  It is not surprising that in spring and autumn (in the seasons when updated news from the California giant come out), the greatest excitement is expected in electronics stores.  This happened this time, when everyone wanted to buy a pink iPhone.  This color combination became available to users for the first time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="IPhone pink" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29714/1095915.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Due to the fact that the devices were updated, having received a number of additional functions, the demand for them was enormous.  As always, Apple took millions of pre-orders for its products, eventually selling billions of dollars worth of goods in the first days after its debut. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Of course, such a demand for this device model was caused not only because it is the next generation of the iPhone.  It was radically updated (or, at least, only announced such an update).  This primarily affected the materials from which the model is made. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to the manufacturer, the new iPhone (including pink) received an even more reinforced glass, which is stronger than what was used in previous versions of the smartphone.  Thus, now the phone has become less vulnerable to shock when falling from a height.  This is especially true given the shape of the gadget. </p><p>  Another updated component is the alloy from which the device body is made.  According to the developers, the iPhone 6S is made from a new variation of aluminum, more resistant to shock and scratches.  This significantly improves the performance of the phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pink iphone Price" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29714/1095914.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Of course, both the processor (which allegedly became several times faster than on the previous device), but Apple uses this ‚Äútrick‚Äù with a multiple speed increase on all its models), and the camera‚Äôs camera (it acquired a high-precision matrix of 12 megapixels).  Also, according to the assurances of the developers, the response of the sensor became faster thanks to special technology.  This made the iPhone pink much more nimble than the generation of the ‚Äúsix‚Äù. </p><p>  The updates affected the operating system, and the optimization of the energy consumption of the smartphone, and other small details that improve the interaction of the device as a whole. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  As for the price, nothing has changed here.  Apple sets the same prices for its gadgets depending on the date they were released to the world.  Immediately after the start of sales, the new phone cost from $ 899 to $ 1,200 per model.  Now in a regular store you can get it for $ 710.  For a pink iPhone, the price is the same as for the rest of the modifications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pink iPhone" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29714/1095913.jpg" width="303"></div>

    <h2>  Potential buyers </h2><p>  I would also like to make a small remark as to why pink is.  Yes, for glamorous girls from Russia, of course, this device will really be a success.  But, as reported by Apple representatives at official press releases, the iPhone has a pink color for the reason that it is a symbol of wealth and luxury in Asia in the highly developed market for iOS devices.  It was with an eye on this audience that the device was allegedly produced.  And girls who like this color probably go ‚Äúin addition‚Äù to potential customers from Asia. </p><p>  It is only strange <span>that the</span> company did not launch <span>such a variation</span> in production earlier.  Perhaps now Apple would have a certain share of more sales if there was a pink device in the device line since the 5th generation. </p>
