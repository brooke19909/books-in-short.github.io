However, the memory of him has been preserved to this day.  Many historians still argue about the outcome, goals and consequences of the uprising.  The rebellion has been widely described in various chronicles and stories.  The suppression of the rebellion became the basis for the creation of a new hierarchy in Russia.  From now on, Moscow became the new political center.  It was also possible to observe the leveling of cultural differences in isolated lands in the south of Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  The Tver uprising of 1327 was the result of the discontent of the population of Russia with the oppression of the Mongol yoke.  In less than 100 years, the first hordes of invaders set foot on Russian soil.  Before that, the Mongols conquered many nations and finally decided to invade Europe.  The Mongols themselves were a relatively small nation and led a nomadic lifestyle.  Therefore, the basis of their troops were soldiers from other nations and tribes.  With the conquest of modern Siberia, the Tatar khans began to play a huge role in the hierarchy of the empire. </p><p>  In the 1230s, preparations began for a campaign in Russia.  The Mongols chose a very good time for themselves.  By the beginning of the 13th century, the <span>collapse of the ancient Russian state</span> took shape <span>.</span>  The power was very divided.  Feudal destinies - principalities - conducted an independent policy, often at odds with each other.  Therefore, the Mongol hordes decided to begin a systematic invasion.  At first, several detachments were sent, the main purpose of which was to obtain information about life in Europe, the terrain, troops, and the political situation.  In 1235, the Mongols gathered at the assembly of Genghisides and decided to advance.  A year later, countless hordes stood at the borders of Russia in the steppes, awaiting orders.  In the fall, the invasion began. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The fall of Russia </h2><p>  The Russian princes could not consolidate in order to repulse the enemy.  Moreover, many wanted to take advantage of the calamity of a neighbor to strengthen power in the region.  As a result, the principalities remained face to face with many times the superior enemy.  In the early years, southern Russia was almost completely devastated.  And over the next five all major cities fell.  The militia and trained squads gave a fierce battle in each fortress, but in the end they were all defeated.  Russia became dependent on the Golden Horde. </p><p>  From then on, each prince was obliged to receive a label for reigning from the Horde.  At the same time, the Mongols participated in almost all feuds and important political events.  Russian cities were obliged to pay tribute.  At the same time, however, the principalities retained some independence.  And even under these conditions, fierce rivalry continued.  The main cultural and political centers were Moscow and Tver.  The Tver rebellion played a decisive role in the relationship between these principalities. </p><h2>  New prince </h2><p>  The Tver uprising is often associated with Prince Alexander Mikhailovich.  In 1236 he received a <span>label for reigning</span> from the Mongols.  Alexander lived in Tver, in his palace.  However, already next fall, Chol Khan arrived in the city, who decided to establish himself here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tver Uprising 1327 Moscow Prince" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1266399.jpg" width="600"></div>  He expelled the Grand Duke from the palace and settled in it himself.  Tatars, who were far from civilization, immediately caused a wave of indignation among local residents.  Tatar officers enjoyed privileges and behaved arrogantly.  Without asking, they appropriated other people's property and created other atrocities.  At the same time, a conflict arose on religious grounds.  Chronicles brought to our days stories of oppression of Christians and atrocities.

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The local population loved Prince Alexander Mikhailovich and often turned to him for help.  People offered to rebel against the Tatars and expel them from the principality.  However, the prince himself understood the futility of such a decision.  A huge army would inevitably come to the aid of the Horde, and the Tver uprising would be brutally crushed. </p><h2>  Popular discontent </h2><p>  In the summer, rumors began to spread about Chol Khan's plans to usurp power in the principality, and convert all Russians to Islam.  Moreover, people said that all this should happen on the great holiday of the Assumption, which added drama.  These rumors may have been untrue, but they were a natural reaction to the oppression of Christians.  It was they who catalyzed hatred among the people, thanks to which the Tver Uprising of 1327 took place.  The prince initially persuaded the people to wait.  Historians are still arguing about his role in these events.  Some believe that it was he who launched the organized rebellion, while others - that he only later joined him.  In favor of the latter, the reasonableness of the prince speaks, who understood that resistance without the support of other principalities would lead to even greater troubles. </p><h2>  The beginning of the uprising </h2><p>  By the end of the summer, rebellious sentiments were brewing more and more among the people.  A rebellion could happen from day to day.  <span>The boiling point</span> was August 15th. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tver Uprising 1327" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/1268239.jpg" width="600"></div>  The Tatars from the personal guard of Chol Khan decided to appropriate the horse of the local priest.  The people stood up for him, and a skirmish began.  Deacon Dudko, apparently, also enjoyed the personal respect of the townspeople.  And the insult of a church person angered the Russian people even more.  As a result, the retinue was killed.  The whole city found out about the riots.  Popular anger spilled onto the streets.  Tverichi rushed to smash the Tatars and other Horde.  Prince Alexander theoretically could suppress the rebellion on his own, but did not do this and joined the people.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Anger of the people </h2><p>  Tatars were beaten everywhere.  Destroyed including merchants.  This confirms precisely the national character of the uprising, and not just religious or anti-government.  The Tatars began to flee en masse to the princely palace, where Chol-khan himself also hid.  By evening, the people besieged the palace and set it on fire.  The khan himself and all his entourage were burned alive.  By the morning in Tver there was not a single living Horde.  So the Tver uprising took place (1327).  The prince understood that it was not enough just to destroy the Tatars.  Therefore, he began preparations for the departure from Tver. </p><h2>  Moscow </h2><p>  After a short time, all of Russia learned that the Tver uprising had occurred (1327).  The Moscow prince Kalita saw this as a profit.  He had long waged a rivalry with Tver for supremacy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tver Uprising 1327 results" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1266400.jpg" width="346"></div>  Therefore, I decided to strike and change the distribution of influence in my favor.  In a short time he gathered an army.  <span>Khan Uzbek</span> allocated fifty thousand people and his subjects to help him.  The campaign to the south began.  After a short time, the combined Moscow and Tatar troops invaded the principality.  The punitive detachment acted very cruelly.  Villages, cities burned, peasants were killed.  Many were taken prisoner.  Almost all settlements were ravaged.

    <p>  Alexander Mikhailovich understood that under no circumstances could he stand up against such an army.  Therefore, in an effort to somehow alleviate the fate of the Tverichi, he fled with his retinue from the city.  After a while, he reached Novgorod.  However, the Horde and Muscovites overtook him there.  The Prince of Novgorod gave a great deal and gifts so that his possessions would not suffer the same fate.  And Alexander fled to Pskov.  Ivan Kalita requested the rebel.  Acting at the direction of Moscow, <span>Metropolitan Feognost</span> announced that he was excommunicating Pskov from the church.  The inhabitants themselves loved the prince very much.  Ambassadors arrived in the city and suggested that Alexander surrender.  He was ready to sacrifice himself for the peace of others.  However, the Pskovs said they were ready to fight and die with Alexander, if necessary. </p>

    <h2>  Flight to Lithuania </h2><p>  Understanding the danger of the situation and knowing what fate Pskov will suffer in case of an invasion, Alexander Mikhailovich still does not stay here.  He is leaving for Lithuania.  After long wanderings, he nevertheless concludes a truce with Khan Uzbek and returns to Tver.  But this is not like Ivan Kalita.  The Prince of Moscow has already spread influence over many lands and saw a new threat in Tver.  Alexandra was very fond of the people.  He often reproached other princes and boyars for inaction, offering to raise a general rebellion against the khan for the Christian land.  Although he did not have a huge army, the word of Alexander Mikhailovich was very authoritative. </p><p>  However, after a series of conspiracies and intrigues, the Tatars again seized him.  A month later, Prince Alexander Mikhailovich was sentenced to death.  He met his fate with enviable dignity and, as the annals say, "with his head held high, he went to meet his killers." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tver Uprising 1327 Prince" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1266397.jpg" width="384"></div>  Many years after his death, the church canonizes the prince and declares him a holy martyr for the faith.

    <h2>  Tver Uprising of 1327: Importance </h2><p>  The uprising in Tver was one of the first rebellions against the Horde.  It laid bare the obvious problems of Russia and gave an understanding of the political situation.  Competing among themselves, the Orthodox princes were not able to unite in the face of a common enemy.  Also very important is the popular character of the uprising.  In these difficult years, Russian identity and Christian fraternity were forged.  The example of Tverich will inspire people to many subsequent uprisings.  And only after decades, Russia will finally cast off the yoke of the Horde and free itself from oppression. </p><p>  The Tver rebellion is extremely important in terms of the distribution of influence of individual principalities.  It was at this moment that Moscow, thanks to the efforts of Kalita, became the most powerful city and spread its influence far beyond the borders of its land.  These were the first prerequisites for the creation of the Moscow kingdom, which can be considered the first example of Russian statehood in the form in which it exists now. </p>

    <h2>  Tver Uprising (1327): results </h2><p>  Despite all the calamities, the participation of Muscovites in the suppression of the uprising brought considerable peace to Russian soil.  Also, the Horde were henceforth more cautious and no longer allowed themselves to the former atrocities. </p><p>  The Tver uprising of 1327 was reflected in many folk songs and tales.  There are also records of him in various annals.  Bloody events were described by the famous writer <span>Dmitry Balashov</span> in his novel The Great Table. </p>
