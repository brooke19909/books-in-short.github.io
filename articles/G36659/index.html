  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is nomenclature in office work</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In order to properly conduct paperwork, you need to know what a nomenclature is.  According to the definition, nomenclature is a list compiled according to a certain system of listing those parts, materials, structures that were used by production.  In compiling such a list, each mentioned material is assigned a conditionally code of numbers, letters, or an alphanumeric combination ‚Äî an item number. </p><p>  In clerical work, the nomenclature of cases is a systematic list of business papers (or cases) that are documented in the course of work of an organization.  The nomenclature determines how long the papers should be kept, and in what order to be drawn up.  For example, in secondary schools (gymnasiums), school journals are kept by the head teacher for another 5 years after the graduation of students. </p><p>  Main functions </p><p>  The main task in compiling the nomenclature of affairs is to make the work of the administrative apparatus more perfect, productive, to get rid of the bureaucratic trivia.  The prompt and high-quality solution to many problems, the activities of the entire organization often depend on the order in which the documents are contained, how easily they can be found upon request, how competently they are classified and systematized.  Correct classification allows not only efficient work with documents, but also facilitates the work with archives and archives. </p><p>  Let us consider with examples what the nomenclature of cases is, and in which directions it is most effective. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Systematization of documents - when documents were used in a business (drafting contracts, entering into transactions, completing a criminal case, a planned report of a department, etc.), and then, according to the nomenclature, they were withdrawn from active use, they are stored in organizations in a certain order .  This applies to both paper documents and electronic ones stored in the computer database. </li><li>  The content of information about how long the document is stored, how long it can be valid.  Each case included in the nomenclature has its own specified deadlines for the preservation of documents included in it.  The more valuable and important the document, the longer it will remain.  That is, when working with documents in business, they are immediately evaluated - a kind of value examination.  This helps to work with the case itself. </li><li>  Securing indexing <span>cases.</span>  <span>The nomenclature of the case is</span> often used in the process of <span>registration of documents,</span> and the nomenclature index of the case becomes an integral part of the <span>registration number of the</span> document.  This can be observed when compiling an inventory when an inventory is being taken at the production site or facility. </li><li>  It serves as a reference in the study of the organizational structure of an institution, etc. </li><li>  In clerical work, it is considered the basis for a list of cases with a permanent or temporary period of storage and accounting of documents. </li><li>  It is used as a sample, a scheme for creating a file cabinet and help on the documents used. </li></ul><p>  Thus, good knowledge of what the nomenclature and skills in working with it are necessary in any organization or institution, in the enterprise.  The nomenclature should apply to all documentary activities of the institution. </p><p>  Nomenclature classification </p><p>  The nomenclature has its own standards and requirements in the design, they can not be violated.  They are stated in special training <span>manuals and paperwork instructions.</span> </p><p>  It is customary to distinguish three types of business nomenclature: </p><ul><li>  typical; </li><li>  approximate; </li><li>  individual, designed for a specific organization. </li></ul><p>  <span>What is a</span> typical nomenclature, it is clear from the name - these are normative documents, they establish the composition of cases used in organizations of the same type. </p><p>  The approximate nomenclature is intended to establish the approximate composition of the cases that are instituted in the clerical work of the organization where this nomenclature is distributed.  Such samples of office work are not normative, but advisory in nature.  Distinctive feature - in documents of this type indexes are specified. </p><p>  Typical and approximate clerical nomenclatures are developed by organizations higher for their subordinate organizations. </p><p>  Individual nomenclature - designed specifically for a particular organization and taking into account the specifics of its activities.  Typical or exemplary samples are usually taken and the necessary changes are made to them. </p>
