I immediately recall the Black Sea, <span>Anapa, the banks of the</span> beautiful Volga.  But what about the Gulf of Finland and the Tender Beach?  If you will spend the summer in the vicinity of St. Petersburg, then be sure to visit this hospitable coast. </p><h2>  The history of the village of Solnechnoe </h2><p>  It exists for a long time, but if earlier it bore the Finnish name Ollila, then in the post-war time it was renamed to Solar.  It is located on the magnificent coast of the Gulf of Finland.  Even in Soviet times, the beauty of these places was very much appreciated; having a small house here was considered a real luxury.  Due to this, the village grew rapidly, and the number of people willing to lie on the shore of the bay increased.  Later this place began to be called "Tender" beach.  He fully justifies his name.  When distinguished guests visited the Soviet Union, they were often brought here.  In particular, the famous Charles de Gaulle was very fond of spending time on this beach.  Many prominent party figures also did not mind warming themselves here under the warm sun. </p>

    <h2>  Gulf of Finland Baltic Sea </h2><p>  For many, the Baltic Sea is associated with inhospitable, cold waters, which does not harmonize with the name of the object we are considering - Laskovy beach.  But the northern edges are also great in order to get the full pleasure of a beach holiday.  The resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSt. Petersburg is located just along the coastline of the northern coast of the Gulf of Finland.  Attendance here, of course, is less than in Anapa, but the Laskovy beach in Solnechny is the most popular among Petersburgers and city guests. <strong><br></strong> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Surrounding nature </h2><p>  The northern region pleases with lush vegetation.  There is no exotic here, in the village, immediately behind it and near the beach the usual trees grow: spruce, pine, alder, birch.  Everything is familiar and dear to the heart of a Russian person.  The abundance of coniferous trees creates a special microclimate.  The forest is close to the beach, if you wish, after sunbathing, you can hide in its luxurious shade.  It is especially beautiful here in spring and autumn, and this is due to the great merit of rose hips, of which there are a huge number.  Its flowers and fiery red berries are a real decoration of the area. </p>

    <h2>  Coast </h2><p>  There are a lot of pebbles and stones that children love to throw into the water.  But basically the beach is covered with sand.  In the summer, many tend to get out of the city in the village of Solnechnoe.  "Affectionate" is a beach located just 30 kilometers from St. Petersburg, that is, you can reach the resting place in less than 30 minutes.  It is considered the best on the coast.  Here the soft sandy bottom is shallow and the water manages to warm up well.  The southern part of the beach is especially loved by tourists, there are no sharp stones and the depth is sufficient to dive. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you are still considering <span>how to spend the weekend,</span> come to Laskovy beach in Solnechny.  Photos will surprise friends with their beauty for a long time.  By the way, despite the well-maintained condition, the beach is municipal, and admission to it is free, as well as the use of sunbeds and umbrellas.  You will have to pay extra only for attractions. </p>

    <h2>  Best time to visit the beach </h2><p>  Since the Gulf of Finland is quite shallow, the season opens here very early.  However, in June there are still not many people on the coast, the hype begins in early July.  On the advice of experienced tourists, it is better to get on the road in the morning, so that you can catch up on Laskovy (St. Petersburg beach) earlier than others.  How to get there - everyone chooses.  You can go by car, train, bus - all the same, the road flies very quickly.  Arriving after eleven, you risk not finding a free place to relax.  The pandemonium here is normal, but it continues until the end of the season, sometimes longer. </p><p>  The beach is usually very clean.  Sometimes there are cigarette butts buried in the sand, but this is the exception rather than the rule.  This is not surprising, taking into account the enormous number of ballot boxes installed on its territory.  It does not take time to find where to throw the trash. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  It has already been mentioned that the use of the beach is free.  Nevertheless, it is well equipped, decorated with sculptures, ennobled by walkways.  There are a certain number of umbrellas and even awnings.  For vacationers erected toilets, changing rooms, showers, litter bins and even foot fountains.  There is a children's slide.  Visitors are greeted by a huge parking lot designed for hundreds of cars.  Near it is the beach "Tender".  How to get there more convenient and faster, it‚Äôs hard to think of.  But many people prefer traveling by car.  The upper direction of Primorsky highway will lead you where you need to, while the quality of the road surface here is very high, and many road signs will not let you go astray. </p><p>  Unlike the Black Sea coast, you will not find such an abundance of offers of private housing for living here.  There are separate dachas, but they are usually rented for a long time and not too cheap.  You can come with tents for the weekend, for this there are specially equipped camping sites.  Nearby are the pension ‚ÄúDunes‚Äù and the recreation center ‚ÄúSeaside‚Äù, so there is always where to stay. </p><p>  The boarding houses were built long ago and outwardly they have not changed at all since the Soviet era, but their essence has become different.  Now the guests are pleased with the European-quality repair, excellent service, SPA-salons and other benefits of civilization.  Each of the holiday homes has an excellent restaurant where you can have a bite to eat or have a full lunch. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Since 2012, the beach "Affectionate" is closed for those who like to sit by the campfire.  Kebabs can now be tasted only in local cafes and restaurants.  In order to comply with the ban, a serious fine of 15,000 rubles was imposed.  If you wish, gatherings by the grill can be arranged in specially designated places (rental of the gazebo is paid) or rented for a couple of hours from one of the local residents.  Vacationers from these rules only benefit: smoke from dozens of bonfires used to prevent many from tanning peacefully. </p><p>  Water sports enthusiasts are offered a wide selection of swimming facilities.  Circles, mattresses, <span>surfboards</span> - your every wish will come true.  If you want to go windsurfing or go water-skiing with the breeze - nothing is impossible.  Experienced instructors will give you the first lessons, and then you can proceed to practice. </p><p>  There are no problems with nutrition.  If you come for one day, then you can take everything you need with you, and then Laskovy beach will become a place for a picnic.  How to get there, and you can return home after spending about 20 minutes on the road.  Products do not have time to deteriorate or even cool.  A whole network of cafes, eateries, bars and restaurants makes it possible to sit comfortably at a table, overlooking the beauty of the bay.  The closest restaurants to the beach are Atlantis, Chaliapin and Fish at the Cottage, offering a wide selection of delicious dishes, a high level of service, and an entertainment program in the evening.  In beachwear, it‚Äôs not customary to go here, take the time to put yourself in order. </p>

    <h2>  Sporting events </h2><p>  Petersburgers love beach volleyball, every year the ranks of players of different ages replenish.  Affectionate Beach has already become a traditional volleyball venue.  Here you can simply leave the ball in a warm friendly company, hold a team competition or watch the game of professionals.  There is a record number of volleyball courts, and all 10 are open to the public.  On the beach, mini-championships are held between schools, amateur teams, serious training of national teams.  The younger generation gets a good example when adults go in for sports, and not just drink barbecue with beer. </p><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  The bay is shallow, you can‚Äôt argue with that.  You can walk a foot in the water a hundred meters from the shore.  But the minus for adults is turning into a big plus for children.  The soft sandy bottom and warm water, in which you can splash without fear of drowning, is a real paradise.  In shallow water, you can arrange an excellent round of badminton or just leave the ball.  Despite the fact that there are far fewer hot days than we would like, the water manages to warm up and delights vacationers with its temperature. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If this is your first time going to the "Affectionate" (beach), the map will be the best assistant.  According to it, you can navigate in the direction, calculate the distance and estimate the necessary amount of fuel.  In general, the route is not difficult, Primorsky highway is beautifully lit and equipped with the latest signs. </p>

    <p>  It is not necessary to use personal transport.  Every 30 minutes, an electric <span>train</span> leaves from the <span>Finland Station</span> in the direction of the Solnechnoye village.  Upon reaching the desired station, it remains only to cross the platform and move towards the embankment.  The way from the stop to the beach will take about 5 minutes.  Municipal bus No. 411 departs from the Chernaya Rechka metro station, and a K-400 minibus stops here.  These modes of transport are slower and take about 40 minutes.  Also, a K-305 minibus departs from the Staraya Derevnya metro station, and a K-600 from Parnas.  Another route - "Prospect of Enlightenment - Solnechnoe", here you need a taxi K-680.  Another option is good for cycling fans.  On a personal or rental bike, you can easily overcome this distance. </p><p>  Is it summer outside?  Get ready for the journey, you will find <span>Sunny, the beach</span> "Affectionate".  How to get there - everyone will decide for himself, if there is a great desire, you can even arrange a hiking trip.
