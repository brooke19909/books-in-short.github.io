    <p>  For work, in addition to the main material, you need to prepare the thread, needle, scissors, wire or barbecue sticks, as well as floral ribbon, if you plan to make a bouquet. </p><h2>  Blanks for jeans jeans </h2><p>  It is necessary to cut off a strip of jeans, the length of which will be 50 cm and a width of 7 cm, fold it in half with the front side inward and put a mark every 6 cm - these are the places of future petals.  Next, you need to use scissors, focusing on the notes made, to give the upper edge of the undulation.  Then, the side with the petals and the sides of the strip should be flashed, and then turn it on the face. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now you need to skip the thread along the lower edge, making long stitches, so that it is possible to pull the strip a little.  Thanks to this simple operation, do-it-yourself flowers from a fabric will look much more voluminous.  The master class "Rose" for those who wish to decorate any objects with a flower, this actually ends.  It remains only to roll the strip into the bud and secure it with a needle and thread, preventing unwinding. </p><p>  There is also an easier way to make denim roses.  You just need to cut out the strip of the desired size, fluff the top edge and, pulling the base with a thread, as in the first case, roll it into a bud.  Then it can be attached to clothes or any other item. </p><h2>  Create a denim rose for a bouquet </h2><p>  If you plan to make a bouquet, then you need to twist the strip, first placing a wire or a barbecue stick inside it.  When the bud is ready, you should fix it with a thread at the base.  In addition, to create a bouquet you will need another detail, thanks to which artificial flowers made of fabric with your own hands will look more realistic. </p>

    <p>  The master class also involves the manufacture of sepals.  To do this, cut a rectangle and make one of its long sides toothed, and then sew together the short sides of the workpiece from the wrong side.  The finished part should be put on the other side of the kebab stick and, lifting the roses to the base, wrap the sepals on the face to the flower.  At the final stage, you need to wrap the stem with a floral tape. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to make a poppy from a cloth with your own hands: the beginning of work </h2><p>  Now you already know: to get an original brooch or hair ornament, just make flowers from a cloth with your own hands.

To make it, you will need black threads, a needle, PVA glue, scissors, a cotton pad, a piece of cotton wool, a pinch of semolina, a cloth, best of all red (for petals) and green (for the core), a candle or a lighter.  In addition, if you plan to make a brooch, you will need a pin, and if hair jewelry - a hairpin or hoop. </p><p>  Now you can begin to use the information that the master class offers.

    <p>  The core should be made first.  To do this, you need to roll a ball from a piece of cotton wool, and then wrap it with a half of a cotton pad and bandage it with a thread.  Next, a circle of the same diameter as a <span>cotton</span> pad should be cut out of the green fabric <span>,</span> and, wrapping the blank around it, bandage it again with a thread.  After that, using the thread, the resulting ball must be divided into segments and fixed at the base. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The core is ready.  However, inside the poppy there is not only it, but also stamens.  It is them that must be made in the next step.  To create an element, you need to wind a thread with three fingers in 8-10 turns, then remove the skein from your hand and bandage in the middle.  The resulting part should be sewn to the core, and then fluff the threads around it, securing in several places with glue. </p><h2>  Making Poppy Petals </h2><p>  While the core and stamen are dry, you can prepare the petals.  Indeed, without these details it is impossible to create flowers from fabric with your own hands.  The master class involves the presence of 8-9 petals, which must be cut from red material.  Parts should be rounded at the top and have a straight line along the bottom edge.  For convenience, you can pre-prepare a cardboard template, according to which and cut out all the elements.  When the petals are ready, it is necessary to slightly melt the edges of each of them with a candle or a lighter.  During this process, it is recommended to slightly stretch the material, since in this case its lines will be more embossed and, accordingly, more like a real poppy. </p><h2>  Assembling poppy from fabric: photo of the finished product </h2><p>  So all the details are ready, it remains only to collect flowers from the fabric with your own hands.  A master class, photos and detailed instructions for creating a finished flower will allow you to make it even more magnificent than the one you can see below.  However, you must first complete the assembly of the poppy.  To do this, you need to take the core already dried up from the glue, cut the stamens on it, lightly grease the edges of the latter and dip in the semolina. </p>

    <p>  When the inner part of the poppy is completely ready, it will be necessary to sew the petals to its lower part one by one, slightly overlapping them on top of each other.  Ready poppy can be used at will, however, you can be sure that in any case it will be a real eye-catcher. </p><h2>  DIY synthetic fabric peony: preparing materials </h2><p>  If you need to decorate the gown of a ball gown, make an elegant brooch or hairpin, then it will be most reasonable to make flowers from fabric with your own hands.

    <p>  With your own hands, flowers from fabric are made as follows.  First you need to cut 5 circles of the desired size from the base material.  They will determine the volume of the finished product.  It is worth noting that only four cut parts should have the same diameter, and the fifth should be slightly smaller.  The contour of the circle may be a little crooked, moreover, due to some waviness, the made flowers from the fabric look much more interesting with their own hands.  The master class, photo and instructions for completing the work, posted below, as well as your own imagination will tell you the right decisions during the creation of the peony. </p><h2>  Peony Petal Formation </h2><p>  When all the blanks are at hand, you should light a candle and, rotating the parts above the flame, give them the shape of the petals.  It is important to remember that synthetic fabrics melt very quickly, so at this stage you need to be extremely careful. </p>

    <p>  Next, on melted circles from four perpendicular sides, cuts should be made, and then the lines formed should also be held a little above the candle flame.  These will be the petals of the flower.  To give the finished product greater splendor, each of them can be cut in half and melted in the same way. </p><h2>  Master class: peony assembly </h2><p>  A little more, and it will be possible to collect flowers from the fabric with your own hands.  The master class would be incomplete if information on the manufacture of the middle of the peony was missing.  To create this element, you need to take the floss and wind it around two fingers in 6-8 turns, then, without removing the thread, bandage the coils between the fingers.  After this, the part must be removed, cut the floss on both sides, bend the material to the center and slightly fluff.  Also, for the manufacture of the middle of the peony, you can use beads or large beads. </p>

    <p>  Our master class approached the final stage.  <span>With your own hands, flowers from fabric,</span> more precisely from prepared elements, are created as follows: all circles are attached to each other using glue, double-sided tape or a thread with a needle.  In this case, the smallest circle should be on top, and in its center should be fixed the middle of the floss, beads or beads.  So the peony from the fabric is ready, which can be pinned with a pin to clothes, glued to an elastic band or a <span>hair hoop,</span> and also decorate a holiday table with it or use for any other purpose. </p>
