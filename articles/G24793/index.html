    <h2>  History of law </h2><p>  Here you can start telling more from the days of the ancient world.  Even ancient philosophers gave the prerequisites for understanding this simple truth: energy does not appear from nowhere, but is transformed from one form to another. </p><p>  In the Middle Ages, Rene Descartes in his Principles of Philosophy wrote: " <span>When one body collides with another, it can tell him only as much movement as it will lose at the same time, and take away from it only as much as it increases its own movement."</span> </p><p>  <span>A little later, Lomonosov in a letter to Leonard Euler expressed a similar point of view.</span>  <span>He said that if in one place matter disappears, then in another it must certainly appear.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>In the nineteenth century, Michael Faraday, who studied electrochemical phenomena, made similar conclusions, realizing that electric current can have magnetic, electrodynamic, chemical and thermal effects.</span> </p><p>  <span>For many centuries, scientists have proved the <span>inviolability of this</span> law one after another: <span>James Joule,</span> Hermann Helmholtz, Robert Meyer.</span>  <span>All of them proved that energy cannot just disappear somewhere: it just goes into different forms.</span>  <span>Of course, this law categorically denies the existence of perpetual motion machines, as this would mean the possibility of producing energy from nowhere.</span> </p><p>  <span>Well, now a few theoretical calculations and justifications of the above theses.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Scam generator circuit </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The Searl Generator is powered by permanent magnets.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">And this is not the first or last design of a perpetual motion machine based on magnetic fields.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">But, unlike previous Kulibins, who assembled the engine without justification, where does the energy come from, John Searle promotes the theory that this zero-point energy field drives the magnets and provides rotation.</span> </p><p>  <span>In fact, this is a simple <span>interaction of magnetic</span> fields, leading to the rotation of small neodymium magnets around one large one.</span>  <span>But the whole point is that no matter how long these magnets rotate, the energy from their rotation must be somehow extracted, otherwise it will not lead to anything.</span>  <span>And the extraction of energy will lead to a complete stop of the entire structure.</span>  <span>Also, a factor that does not play into the hands of perpetual motion machines is the energy loss due to friction, which inevitably occurs in any structure.</span>  <span>And here no zero point energy will help.</span>  <span>A zero-generator circuit, if you look at it carefully, will turn out to be just a fake, where instead of rotational energy converters there are installations that ensure the operability of the whole structure due to external power supply.</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">And why, in fact, this design has no right to exist?</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">In the pictures of the Searle generator, we can clearly see several magnetic cylinders located opposite other magnets (or, rather, electromagnets powered by a battery).</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">It is argued that when the cylinders rotate, the magnets around the perimeter of the installation will push them in the direction of motion, thereby providing rotation.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">But the rotation will occur only until the rotation energy, applied by the human hand to spin the installation, ends in the system.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">At some point, each cylinder will fall into a magnetic well - that is, into an area where the forces of attraction and repulsion from other magnetic fields are reduced to zero, and the cylinder cannot move.</span> </p><p>  <span>And, in fact, why is this all done?</span>  <span>Yes, only for two things: to assure businessmen and knock out investments (that is, steal money and throw it away), and in order to become famous.</span> </p><p>  <span>It is also alleged that, in addition to the perpetual motion machine, generators based on the ‚ÄúSearl effect‚Äù (the fraudster called his name a fictitious effect) are able to create an anti-gravity field, and with a sufficiently large installation volume it can freeze a meter above the ground.</span>  <span>This is not supported by anything and there are no videos proving this.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Knowledge is power </h2><p>  <span>The main reason that such people exist and are capable of deceiving us is the illiteracy of the population and the holy faith in the existence of an endless source of free energy.</span>  <span>Indeed, you must admit that everyone wants to have an <span>inexhaustible source of</span> energy in their home in order to supply them with whatever they want, and also to sell what they could not use.</span>  <span>But alas, free energy does not exist, and will not exist.</span>  <span>You can‚Äôt get it out of nothing, and the efficiency of converting one form to another never exceeds 100%.</span>  <span>And this is a law that no one can refute.</span> </p><p>  <span>Another utopia that promises including the Searl generator is antigravity.</span>  <span>More on this in the next section.</span> </p><h2>  Antigravity </h2><p>  <span>Two forces acting on a charge in a magnetic field, attraction and repulsion, are also applicable to an uncharged body located in the field of gravitational pleasure.</span>  <span>The nature of gravity is still poorly understood, and it is assumed that there are particles that provide it - gravitons.</span>  <span>It is also interesting that, according to the theory of relativity, the structure of space-time and gravity are very strongly related to each other and to the physical characteristics of bodies in space.</span>  <span>Although these two forces are connected, nothing is known about antigravity, that is, on the contrary, not by attraction, but by the repulsion of bodies from each other.</span>  <span>It is possible that in our measurement antigravity is impossible due to the specific structure of the substance.</span>  <span>But antigravity may well be possible with the interaction of antimatter.</span>  <span>In any case, we know little about all these phenomena.</span> </p><p>  <span>But our knowledge is quite extensive in order to say with accuracy that under any magnetic phenomena it is impossible to create either an anti-gravity field, a black hole or other nonsense.</span>  <span>This is another mistake of the creators of perpetual motion machines, who assure that their cars, among other things, have the property of antigravity.</span> </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  <span>Much has been said about scammers and people who sacredly believe in their cause.</span>  <span>It was said about why this is happening.</span>  <span>But the 21st century has long come, in which fewer people believe in fairy tales about zero energy and perpetual motion machines.</span>  <span>Fewer people are now engaged in such nonsense, but still there are such units as, for example, John Searle, who have been artificially deceiving people for decades.</span> </p><p>  <span>People can be stubborn and stand their own way, but science and common sense should be higher and not allow charlatans to deceive ordinary inhabitants.</span> </p>
