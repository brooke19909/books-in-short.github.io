Elephants, <span>tea plantations,</span> Ayurvedic treatments - all this can be found in India.  But the emotional attitude towards the guests is only on the island of Ceylon.  The specifics of the rest here is "implantation" in the surrounding landscape, unity with nature.  But you will not see any unsanitary conditions and crawling or flying insects in the room.  Especially if you live in a hotel with five stars.  The focus of our article will be just one of them - Royal Palms Beach Hotel 5 *.  It is half of the hotel complex.  The hotel has a common territory with Tangerine Beach Hotel 4 *.  But do not think that the guests of the "four" will eat in your restaurant and create lines.  In two hotels, guests wear different bracelets.  But the whole complex is managed by a single management.  Guests can freely walk around the territory of both hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal Palms Beach Hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1466901.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the Royal Palms Beach Hotel Kalutara located and how to get there </h2><p>  This hotel complex is located on the first line of the beach.  It is located on the southwest coast of the island state of Sri Lanka.  The Bandaranayyak International Airport in Katunayak, near the country's capital Colombo, is seventy-four kilometers away.  If you have a transfer in your ticket, the bus will take you to the hotel gate in two hours.  Officially, the hotel belongs to the Kalutara district.  But in fact, it is located in the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãWaskaduwa in the small town of Wadduwa.  It is somewhere in the middle between Kalutara and Colombo.  The capital is only forty kilometers away.  The reviews show that tourists did not feel cut off from civilization.  In the resort town there are many cafes and restaurants.  Near the hotel there is a grocery supermarket.  Transport links are also well established.  To the huge sandy beach of Vaskudawa go from the hotel buildings about sixty meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal Palms Beach Hotel 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1466904.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, lovers of towering skyscrapers and urban landscapes are clearly not here.  The territory of the Royal Palms Beach Hotel answers the name: it seems as if it is a palm forest.  Among the lush tropical greenery are three-story buildings.  They are made in the Sri Lankan style, in warm colors.  Terracotta walls, wooden decoration of buildings gives the impression that the buildings are an organic part of the landscape.  The pool is also not a dull quadrangle, but a ‚Äúriver‚Äù flowing between houses, which ends with a ‚Äúlagoon‚Äù.  The buildings are built so that from all the rooms you can see the ocean - if not a direct view, then at least a side view.  Throughout the vast territory of the two hotels there are a lot of chipmunks that climb trees and safely treat themselves with nuts from their hands.  Iguans roam the alleys, you can see herons and other birds.  In everything, the spirit of ancient Sri Lanka is felt: aroma lamps, carved elephants, incense.  The hotel was built in 1996, but the last renovation took place this summer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal Palms Beach Hotel Sri Lanka" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1466902.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Royal Palms Beach Hotel reviews are called a small hotel.  On a large territory of three hectares there are only one hundred thirty-six rooms.  The vast majority of them are classified as deluxe.  These are forty-square meter one-room rooms with a furnished balcony or terrace.  There are more expensive guest rooms.  For example, a one-room penthouse suite.  This room is designed for two guests (maximum occupancy is three people), but its area is almost twice as large as the deluxe.  Junior Suites consist of a bedroom and a living room.  The bathroom in these rooms has a bathtub.  The real pride of the hotel are two Royal Suites (213 square meters).  These rooms are duplex.  On the ground floor there is a small kitchen, a dining room, a living room and a bathroom.  On the second level there is a bedroom with a guest area and a working area (there is a computer).  There is also a bathroom with shower and bath.  The Royal Suites adjoins a spacious green terrace with a jacuzzi. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Room features </h2><p>  Even the usual "deluxe" in the hotel Royal Palms Beach Hotel 5 (Sri Lanka) offers its guests impeccable service for a good rest.  Its equipment fully meets the five stars.  Air conditioning reliably leaves tropical heat outside the window.  A TV with satellite channels (there is Russian music) will entertain guests in the evenings.  There is also a telephone and a minibar.  Filling the latter is paid, with the exception of drinking water, the supply of which is replenished every day.  The deluxe bathrooms are equipped with showers.  In addition, there is a hairdryer.  Reviews repeatedly mention quality hygiene items.  In addition to the usual set (soap, shower gel, shampoo), there is a body lotion, a shower cap, ear sticks.  What is incredibly pleasing to the hotel guests is an electric kettle with dishes and daily replenished bags of drinks.  Iron and ironing board are available on the floor.  The rooms have free Wi-Fi.  As for the "suites", their equipment compares favorably with the "deluxe" presence of a bathtub (and even a jacuzzi), bathrobes and slippers.  Sri Lanka has a lot of humidity.  To prevent bathing suits from remaining wet, a dryer is provided in the bathrooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal Palms Beach Hotel 5 SHRM Lviv" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1466890.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Royal Palms Beach Hotel does not constrain its guests in choosing.  You can pay for the minimum diet ("Bad and Brackfast").  With the appropriate bracelet, you will be allowed into the main restaurant only for breakfast.  Reviews about the morning meal are always favorable.  The food is tasty, dense, varied.  They give a lot of pastries and fruits.  You can eat so much that you are full before dinner.  There is another option: half board.  Many reviews recommend choosing this particular diet, because you don‚Äôt really want to dine in the heat.  The dinners in the hotel restaurant are very good, each time thematic, dedicated to the culinary traditions of different countries.  But reviews warn that with half and full board all drinks for afternoon and evening meals (except for drinking water) are paid.  If you want to walk "to the fullest", select "All inclusive". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal Palms Beach Hotel reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1466900.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where did the tourists eat? </h2><p>  On the territory of the Royal Palms Beach Hotel there are, in addition to the main one, two a la carte restaurants (Italian and fish), a 24-hour cafe and two bars (in the lobby and poolside).  Many tourists visited these catering establishments and praised the local cuisine and service.  But judging by the reviews, the Royal Palm Beach Hotel is surrounded by cafes in the resort village.  And very close is a supermarket.  What do the reviews recommend?  If you turn right on the beach, you will see Sea Send.  In this cafe you can not only have a tasty and cheap lunch, but also get a session of high-quality massage.  If you miss Russian cuisine, then nostalgia for the homeland can be dispelled in the Matryoshka cafe.  This establishment is a five minute walk from the hotel.  You need to exit the gate and turn left.  Matryoshka has a free and very fast wifi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal Palms Beach Hotel 5 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1466903.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and Pool </h2><p>  Hotel Royal Palm Beach Hotel (Sri Lanka) is on the first line.  The Indian Ocean is sixty meters from the doors of the buildings.  The beaches in Sri Lanka are municipal.  Therefore, the hotel, although it stands on the first line, is fenced off from the sandy shore by a low fence.  At the gate sits a guard who prevents traders from getting inside.  The beach is unequipped, but long and wide.  The ocean gives the impression of a powerful water element, and few tourists ventured to swim far.  Most were limited to swimming in the pool with hydro and jet massage.  It is made in the form of a beautiful lagoon, surrounded by sun loungers and umbrellas.  The pool is located between the hulls and the ocean, so the noise from the waves will accompany you while swimming in quiet waters.  For children, the hotel has its own small tank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal Palms Beach Hotel Kalutara" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1466891.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Service, entertainment and services </h2><p>  From the very first minutes at Royal Palms Beach Hotel, guests feel like they are in a five-star hotel.
