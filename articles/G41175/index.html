Firstly, this is not in the interests of the manufacturer.  Secondly, this is perhaps impossible.  Therefore, the average user has to deal with iPad activation failure and other problems. </p><h2>  No panic </h2><p>  It so happened that not all users understand the principle by which this or that device works.  As a result, this leads to various malfunctions.  Often there are system failures, viruses get onto the device or important information is deleted.  All these are the reasons for the inexperienced use of tablets and smartphones.  To avoid this, you need to be careful and patient. </p>

    <p>  <span>IPad activation failure</span> could have occurred for various reasons.  But it’s important not to panic right away by pressing all the buttons in a row and taking erroneous actions.  Be patient and read the article. </p><h2>  Causes </h2><p>  As practice shows, a similar problem is encountered by those who independently tried to reset content and settings, reflash the system, update it, or restore it.  Any of these operations leads to the fact that the tablet requires activation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To fix everything, just go the same way as after buying the gadget.  But on it you can expect some difficulties. </p><h2>  IPad activation failed </h2><p>  So, first the device showed you that it needs to be activated, and then it gives an error.  It will certainly appear along with an explanation.  From it you will immediately understand what became the reason and what needs to be done further. </p><p>  If you saw that the “server is unavailable”, you can try to wait a few minutes.  There is a possibility that Apple has some problems.  You can mentally scold the developers and try again.  If after some time the problem remains urgent, you will have to deal with it in more detail. </p><h2>  Modem </h2><p>  Of course, as with any other gadget, there is a chance of irreversible loss.  An error with the servers could appear due to the “death” of the device’s modem.  This can immediately be verified by connecting the iPad to the computer and iTunes.  If no processes occur at this moment, then we will try one more conjecture. </p>

    <p>  There is a small icon on the welcome screen - “i in a circle”.  You need to click on it.  If everything is in order and the iPad 2 activation failure can be fixed, then the serial number of the device will appear. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you don’t see anything like it, and in an additional window the standards appeared, then the probability that the modem “died” is almost one hundred percent.  You cannot activate the device with this problem. </p><h2>  What to do: iPad activation failed due to modem </h2><p>  For starters, of course, it's worth going to a service center.  This is the easiest, safest and surest way.  Experts will tell you the reasons and possible solutions.  The problem in this case is only one - no one wants to take on such a breakdown.  Therefore, finding a specialist who would take up the repair will not be easy.  And after the repair there are no guarantees that such a failure will not happen again. </p><p>  If you are unable to find anyone to handle this problem, you can try other methods.  For example, put the tablet in the freezer.  Yes, the method is strange, and also unsafe.  But if you are completely desperate, it is possible that he will help you.  Contacts can fall into place, and activation will be successful. </p><p>  There is another option, which is to heat the device with a hairdryer.  The principle for fixing the problem is the same.  But again, all this you do at your own peril and risk. </p>

    <p>  If after clicking on the “i in the circle” you see the serial number of the iPad mini 2, the activation failure can be fixed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Diagnostics </h2><p>  When you determine that the problem is not the modem and the gadget can be saved, try a few options.  Immediately what is advised to try is a SIM card.  Perhaps it was damaged or for some reason became inoperative. </p><p>  After we check the Internet connection.  Suddenly, while you were carrying out some operations with the device, did you have it torn? </p><p>  There is also the option that your network does not give access to the company's servers.  Try connecting to another Wi-Fi. </p><p>  The next step is to check the Apple servers.  As already mentioned, it happens that with the release of updates they "fall".  This is due to the influx of those who want to quickly update their device.  In this case, it remains just to wait. </p><p>  To fix iPad activation failure, you need to use iTunes.  Update the software so that there are no errors. </p>

    <p>  And finally, you can try to do a “hard reset”.  To do this, hold down the Home and Power keys.  You will have to hold the buttons until the device turns off. </p><h2>  Beta version </h2><p>  When the iPad 2 activation fails, few know what to do.  It happens that a beta version of the firmware was installed on the device, and the tablet itself turned out to be unregistered by the developer. </p><p>  To fix this, go to the official developer.apple.com website.  Then register the device.  You can also do this through iTunes by installing the latest official firmware. </p><h2>  Problems with the new version </h2><p>  IPad activation failure was noticed with the advent of iOS 9.3.  When this version appeared in March 2016, the owners of the "apple" gadgets faced such an error.  Fortunately, there is nothing terrible in this problem, and the technical support department immediately issued instructions on how to fix it. </p><p>  Many advanced users already know that it is better to wait a week or two so that the specialists “finish” the new version.  Then it can be easily downloaded without any errors. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad cellular network activation failure" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2156135.jpg"></div></h2><p>  If after updating the device is not activated, you need to: </p><ul><li>  Check if you entered the personal data correctly.  You need to go to iCloud.com and find your tablet in the My Devices list. </li><li>  If the data is correct, you need to connect the device to the PC.  Go to iTunes and select iPad there, and then activate it. </li><li>  If all of the above does not help, it remains to deactivate the activation of the lock. </li></ul><p>  For the last stage, there is also an instruction: </p><ol><li>  Turn off the device. </li><li>  Sign in to your iCloud.com account. </li><li>  Select the “Find iPad” tab. </li><li>  We select the device in the "My devices" section. </li><li>  We remove it from the list. </li><li>  Turn on the tablet and activate it again. </li></ol><p>  If all these methods could not cope with the problem, then you need to contact support. </p><h2>  Cell network </h2><p>  Another problem that may overtake the owners of "apple devices" is the failure of activation of the iPad’s cellular network.  Usually this process is accompanied by “No network” or “Search” notifications. </p><p>  This may be due not only to the fact that you went into the subway or in a zone with poor coverage.  It happens that a failure occurs at the hardware level.  To fix this, you first need to check the coverage area. </p><p>  Go to the settings and look at the "Cellular Data" section.  If this situation happened to you abroad, go to the Roaming section.  If everything is fine on these points, then move on. </p>

    <p>  Try simply rebooting the device.  Of course, this is not a panacea for all problems, but often this is enough to "restrain" your device. </p><p>  If all else fails, try removing and reinstalling the SIM card.  Maybe she’s “buggy”.  Then check the network settings and, if necessary, reset them.  This can be done in the "Settings".  Finally, perhaps this failure is due to the need to update the system. </p><p>  If the above methods did not help restore the network, call your service provider.  Maybe a problem on his part. </p>
