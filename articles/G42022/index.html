    <p>  Cooling capacity is 430 BTU.  The evaporator in this case is installed with two filters.  Directly compressors are located on wide rubberized pads.  Are there any drawbacks to this model?  Among the minuses can be noted only fragile tray for vegetables.  There may still be problems with the control module.  It is also worth noting that this model is not available to everyone, since in stores they ask for as much as 173,450 rubles. </p>
