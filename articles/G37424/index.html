    <h2>  What is roaming? </h2><p>  But for starters: what is it all about?  To be honest, not all subscribers understand the term "roaming".  And so they‚Äôre not particularly eager to connect it.  So what are we going to deal with? </p><p>  Roaming is a communication service (in our case, Beeline) outside the home network.  That is, while traveling, you will turn on this feature.  And in order not to spend much on it, you can switch to the special Beeline tariff - Roaming in Russia.  How to connect it?  There are several scenarios.  After all, the company has several similar services.  And you can always choose the most suitable option for yourself. </p><h2>  My country </h2><p>  Perhaps we will start with the most advantageous offer that can only be met by a mobile operator.  There is a very advantageous option of Beeline service (roaming in Russia).  <span>How to connect "Everywhere at home"?</span>  This is what the best solution for travelers is called.  This is not so difficult to do.  But first, a few details about this tariff. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Firstly, now it is called differently.  Now, "Everywhere at home" is "My country."  Just a few years ago, Beeline changed its name to roaming.  But the meaning remains the same.  So do not be alarmed if you have not found the right inscription with a description on the official website. </p><p>  Secondly, this roaming does not have a monthly fee.  For connection you need to pay only 25 rubles.  And then use it without any problems.  All incoming and outgoing calls within the country, as well as SMS messages will cost you 3 rubles.  Pretty profitable, isn't it? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect roaming on beeline in Russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1120992.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Thirdly, this option is very popular.  Probably due to the lack of a monthly fee.  Every traveler seeks to activate Beeline roaming in Russia My Country.  So, you can trust this offer. </p><h2>  Connect </h2><p>  But how to bring the idea to life?  In fact, it is not as difficult as it seems.  Any new subscriber can use Beeline services (roaming in Russia).  How to connect them? </p><p>  For example, call 0611 and communicate your intentions to the operator.  With all this, your account should have enough funds.  Talk about your intentions and wait for an answer.  The operator will inform you of the successful request, and a message will be sent to your number with a notification about the end of the operation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you do not know how to connect roaming on Beeline in Russia under the name My Country, then just use the special USSD request.  It will help quickly and without calling the operator to join the option.  Dial 0683 on your mobile, then click on the call button.  A request will be made during which roaming is connected. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="connect roaming beeline in Russia my country" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1120990.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Opt out of My Country </h2><p>  However, sometimes after traveling I want to refuse this kind of service.  This is as easy as connecting.  The thing is that for this idea, you must again use either the telecom operator or a special request command. </p><p>  To refuse the My Country service, dial 0611 (the call is free) and wait until they answer you.  Inform the operator about the desire to refuse roaming and wait a while.  At the end of the conversation, you should receive a message with the result of processing the request. </p><p>  In addition, if roaming is no longer needed, just dial 0683 and press the call button.  So there‚Äôs nothing complicated about it. </p><p>  There is also a non-standard solution.  The fact is that from November 26, 2015, My Country is not available for ALL subscribers.  If you connect this tariff plan, then roaming will be disabled. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline Internet roaming in Russia connect" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1120988.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Home region </h2><p>  True, our mobile operator does not stop there.  Some are interested in other Beeline services (roaming in Russia).  Connect a "Home region", for example, is trying a fairly large percentage of users.  There is only one small problem. </p><p>  Which one, exactly?  The fact is that this service has been archived for some time.  And it is not available now for connection.  No matter how you try, the idea will not work.  Only if you previously managed to join and did not refuse the "Home Region".  In this case, you will be charged a monthly fee of 90 rubles per month.  So you can forget about the "Home Region" altogether.  This is an archive offer.  We can say irrelevant. </p><h2>  Trust payment </h2><p>  If you look at the Beeline section of the Roaming in Russia official website, you will notice another rather interesting service.  This is a <span>"Trust Payment".</span>  This is a kind of credit for talking.  But not everyone can take it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline roaming in Russia to connect the home region" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1120987.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  For example, if you have a <span>monthly fee</span> charged from the tariff plan, you can take the "Trust payment" within this amount.  In all other cases, you need to be a Beeline network subscriber for more than 3 months and spend at least 200 rubles a month on communications. </p><p>  In addition, the service of providing a "trust payment" is paid.  Up to 200 rubles you will pay 15, up to 400 - 25, up to 600 - 40. Impressive, isn't it?  These are the interesting conditions for the Beeline operator (roaming in Russia).  How to connect in our case "Trust payment" for making calls while traveling?  Before that, you should know that you can borrow a maximum of 3,000 rubles.  And at the same time 180 will be removed from you. </p><p>  ‚ÄúTrust payment‚Äù is activated for roaming in Russia in several ways.  Firstly, you can always call the operator on number 0611 and inform about your intentions.  Secondly, use a special request.  For example, in our case * 141 # will do.  After that, indicate the size of the payment and wait for a response.  Nothing complicated, right?  But what other services can be found in the "Roaming in Russia" section from Beeline? </p><h2>  7 days of the Internet </h2><p>  Do not forget that messages and calls are not the only thing that interests subscribers now.  Some are wondering what to do if you suddenly need to use the Beeline Internet while traveling.  Roaming in Russia allows you to connect a special package that simplifies working with the mobile world wide web.  And in order to do this, just attach a package called "7 days of the Internet."  Pretty interesting and profitable offer.  With it, you can use the Internet on the terms of your tariff plan throughout Russia for a week. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect roaming beeline Kazakhstan in Russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1120991.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The idea can again be implemented in several ways.  So, you have found roaming in Russia at Beeline Corporation.  How to connect the Internet for travel, which would not hit your pocket and budget?  Call the operator and inform about your intentions (the number for this is 0611) - this is the first option.  Among other things, you can use the "My Account" on the official website, find there the service "7 days of the Internet" in the "Travel to Russia" section, and then click on the "Connect" button.  Using the USSD command is also acceptable.  Dial * 115 * 361 # and send a request.  A few minutes of waiting - and all problems are resolved.  Plus, if you dial 0674090361 and click on the subscriber‚Äôs call button, you will also be connected to the ‚Äú7 days of Internet‚Äù package.  Nothing complicated or special. </p><p>  Important: please note that these services are paid.  You will be charged 99 rubles for connecting the package.  Make sure you have enough funds in your account in advance.  Otherwise, it will not work to implement the idea. </p><h2>  30 days of the Internet </h2><p>  How to connect roaming on Beeline in Russia to the Internet for more than a week?  For example, take advantage of a rather interesting package called "30 days of the Internet for traveling around Russia."  This is a service that allows you to use the world wide web on your usual terms for 30 days.  An analogue of the previous option, but longer. </p><p>  It costs 199 rubles.  Valid, as already mentioned, 30 days.  This option is suitable for long trips. </p><p>  To connect it, it‚Äôs enough to either use the ‚ÄúMy Account‚Äù on the official Beeline website, or call the operator and inform about the desired actions.  The USSD request * 115 * 261 # or number 0674090161 is also suitable. Disconnection occurs by similar methods. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline roaming in Russia how to connect everywhere at home" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1120989.jpg"></div>
