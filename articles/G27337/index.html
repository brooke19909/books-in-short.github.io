Nevertheless, the development prospects for regional tourism are very good.  The recreational potential of the nature of the Southern Urals is quite high, and the Administration of the Chelyabinsk Region has done a lot in recent years for its successful implementation.  <span>Recreation facilities</span> on the Chelyabinsk lakes annually host many guests, new modern tourist infrastructure facilities are being built and projected. </p><h2>  About alternative tourist destinations </h2><p>  It is customary to look forward to summer vacation.  For many, it can not be imagined without air travel in the direction of beach resorts and the associated financial costs.  Only no one has extra money.  And, unfortunately, not everyone is aware of the alternative directions of summer travels, one of the options of which may be a vacation on the Chelyabinsk lakes.  A visit to the South Urals can become not only a source of new vivid tourist impressions, but also significant savings for the family budget.  Naturally, a visit to this region of the Russian Federation will not require visas: neither Schengen, nor any other.  And the expressiveness of the nature of the Southern Urals is capable of competing with mountain Switzerland, Saxony, and the Pyrenees. </p>

    <h2>  In the southern Urals </h2><p>  Despite numerous jokes from the Internet about the severity of Chelyabinsk manners, the climate in the southern Urals is quite familiar to a middle-class person.  This means that rest on the Chelyabinsk lakes does not require a period of acclimatization.  In the summer, in the south of the <span>Ural region, it is</span> even warmer than in central Russia.  Chelyabinsk lakes, as a rule, are located in hollows between mountain slopes, overgrown with mixed coniferous-deciduous forests.  The foothills of the Urals are very picturesque and expressive at any time of the year, but it is best to relax in this region after all in the summer.  The service infrastructure for servicing tourists has not yet been adequately equipped yet, but for many people it‚Äôs attractive as a ‚Äúsavage vacation‚Äù.  There are more than enough opportunities for this at Chelyabinsk lakes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What to look for </h2><p>  As you know, the South Urals is a region with developed heavy industry, which cannot but have a negative impact on the state of the environment.  This circumstance should be taken into account when planning a vacation on the Chelyabinsk lakes.  The feedback of those who have already visited the Southern Urals will help to correctly draw up vacation plans and adjust them if necessary, if convincing arguments are presented to your attention. </p><p>  Rest on Chelyabinsk lakes involves a wide selection of routes and options.  It should be noted that the eastern foothills of the Ural Range, where the main tourist attractions are located, are separated from industrial sites by significant geographical distances.  This contributes to environmental well-being in these areas.  And, of course, we should not forget that the well-being of nature depends not only on the availability of industrial enterprises, so you should adhere to the principle: everything in the forest and pond should remain as it was before your appearance. </p>

    <h2>  According to individual preferences </h2><p>  Organized recreation on the <span>lakes of the Chelyabinsk region</span> is quite affordable for ordinary tourists by price parameters and pleasantly surprises with the choice of many options.  There are a lot of tourist bases in the region, some of them host guests even throughout the winter season, temporarily reassigning themselves to skiing centers.  And one of the most important moments forcing potential tourists to choose a vacation on the Chelyabinsk lakes is prices.  They are pleasantly pleased with their availability.  The predominant segment of temporary housing rented to tourists by price criteria should be attributed to the economy class.  But this does not mean at all that there are no more expensive apartments on the coast of the Ural lakes.  They can also be used at prices that are much lower than in other tourist regions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The so-called "wild vacation" is attractive for the main category of tourists.  On Chelyabinsk lakes for him there is everything necessary (the exception is only a few specially protected protected areas, where entry for "savages" is limited).  But you should be prepared for the fact that in some places you may be required to pay a fee for the opportunity to drive to the shore using your own transport.  Everyone is free to choose the style of rest in accordance with their individual preferences. </p>

    <h2>  Lake Uvildy </h2><p>  Turning our eyes to the natural tourist attractions of the Southern Urals, it is customary to speak first of all about Lake Uvildy.  And this is completely justified, since we are talking about one of the most expressive corners of the Ural nature.  Lake Uvildy has a large water surface and at the same time is characterized by a significant indented coastline, which means the presence of numerous bays and bays, convenient for stopping when traveling by water and by land.  In the northern part of the reservoir there are many islands of different sizes.  Their names are noteworthy in that they convey the characteristic signs of vegetation or other distinctive features: Alder, Birch, Elm, Beech, Spruce, Dolgonky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Lake Uvildy is well known far beyond the Ural region.  People come here from far away, often even from outside the Russian Federation.  Among other things, the attractiveness of the lake is due to the properties of its water.  It has long been noticed that due to its unique salt composition, it has healing wound healing properties.  That is why on the shores of Lake Uvildy, in addition to numerous tourist camps and children's summer camps, there are also excellent medical sanatoriums. </p><p>  The most popular recreation centers here are Zarya, Birch, Red Stone, Seagull and Amber.  The cost of a day stay ranges from 250 ("Dawn") to 750 rubles per day.  A threefold difference in price level implies a different level of comfort.  In contrast to other, positive, some negative reviews are about the recreation center "Birch".  Tourists complain about the unsanitary conditions in the rooms and on the territory, as well as the rudeness of the staff. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on chelyabinsk lakes reviews" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/464877.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h2>  Turgoyak Lake </h2><p>  This unique reservoir is often called the "younger brother of Lake Baikal."  Since the maximum mark of its depth reaches 40 m, he, of course, cannot compete with him.  But Lake Turgoyak is quite comparable with Baikal in terms of purity and transparency of water, and in the steep steepness of its shores.  Widespread fame in tourist circles gives the lake, located on its western shore, the island of Vera.  Until the beginning of the twentieth century, it housed a secluded Old Believer monastery.  In addition, the <span>island of Vera</span> and the coast of Lake Turgoyak have a large number of archaeological sites.  Tourist camps are located at a distance from the lake.  Basically, "wild rest" is practiced on its shores.  There are enough places on Chelyabinsk lakes to place a tent on them, but Turgoyak is considered to be the "pearl of the Urals".  Recreational facilities located nearby are "Silver Sands", "Trout", "Crystal".  Prices for accommodation in the Lake Turgoyak region are relatively high.  They start at 1800 rubles per day.  But the conditions of comfort in tourist houses correspond to the stated figures.  The reviews on the forums about rest in these places are extremely complimentary and thankful. </p>

    <h2>  Big Kisegach Lake </h2><p>  This pond is equally attractive both for lovers of "wild" rest in tents on the picturesque coast, and for those who prefer comfortable living conditions in camp houses.  Big Kisegach Lake has a significant depth, the water in it is clean and transparent.  The water level is subject to significant seasonal variations, which leads to changes in the coastline.  In the waters of the reservoir there are twelve large islands.  This is a very good place for both water sports and fishing lovers.  In winter, many lovers of ice fishing go out on the ice of the lake.  You can stay here at the Squirrel recreation center, in a hotel and in separate cottages near the Kisegach sanatorium.  The minimum cost of living is 1000 rubles per day.  Reviews are positive. </p><h2>  Spruce Lake </h2><p>  This is not a very large body of water, its opposite shore can be seen from almost anywhere.  But <span>Lake Elovoe</span> has clear water and picturesque shores overgrown with dense coniferous forests.  This makes it a favorite vacation spot for residents of the regional center and attracts tourists from other regions to its shores.  On the shores of Lake Elovoy there are such popular tourist infrastructure facilities as the Sosnovaya Gorka and Elovoye sanatoriums, the Lesnaya Skazka recreation center and the Ural Dawns.  Tourists who do not want to stop anywhere except their own tent on the shore are also willing to come here.  The influx of people wishing to relax on Lake Elovoy is increasing every year.

The cost of living in recreation centers in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLake Elovoy starts at 1,500 rubles per day.  Guest reviews are dominated by positive. </p><h2>  Itkul Lake </h2><p>  In the north of the Chelyabinsk region there is such a popular tourist attraction as <span>Lake Itkul.</span>  This hydrological monument of the Ural nature differs from other Chelyabinsk lakes in that the water in it is cold even at the height of the summer season.  This is due to the action of cold key sources at the bottom of the reservoir.  Therefore, only those who are accustomed to low temperatures can expect a swim in Lake Itkul. </p><p>  The most famous tourist attraction on Itkul is the so-called <span>Shaitan-Kamen.</span>  <span>This</span> bizarre geological formation is located near the southeastern shore of the reservoir.  Shaitan-Kamen in ancient times was a cult place for the peoples living in the Urals.  Here shamanistic rites and sacrifices were performed.  From the recreation centers, only the "Arakul Village" is known here.  These are 6 guest houses.  The rental price of each is 5000 rubles.  per day.  Those who visited them respond positively to the recreation center. </p>
