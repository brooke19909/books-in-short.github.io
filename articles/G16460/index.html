So, they are a set of technical means that are used to detect a fire in a timely manner, as well as unauthorized entry into a protected area.  In the case of fixing problems, a signal is sent to the control room to send a quick response detachment and mechanical methods of influence are activated (if we talk about fire alarms, the automatic fire extinguishing system starts).

These include control panels for fire and security. </li><li>  Directly the sensors themselves, which record violations of activity, as well as warning devices (for example, loudspeakers). </li></ol><p>  Installation of fire alarm systems differs from security ones usually by the location of sensors.  So, for the safety of the premises, it is necessary to keep windows under control, monitor whether someone is moving at the wrong time, and carry out many other operations.  Whereas to monitor fires, it‚Äôs enough to simply place the sensors on the ceiling after a certain distance to cover the entire area as efficiently as possible. </p><h2>  Integration </h2><p>  Their connection is carried out at the level of centralized management and monitoring of the system.  At the same time, they are administered by independent units or posts.  Thus, their autonomy is maintained.  If a small object is controlled, then all the necessary tracking functions can be performed in an automated mode.  Invaluable benefit in such cases is the control panel.  They allow you to receive alarm notifications, generate messages about problems, and also transmit them to central monitoring stations.  Depending on the complexity of the integrated system used, other components of the automated complex may also be notified of problems.  Moreover, if the installation of an automatic fire alarm is something more or less real, then security is not so easy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Implementation issues </h2>

We will find out about him.  It is relatively easy and cheap to place an automatic <span>fire extinguishing system</span> on it.  To do this, only tanks with a fire extinguishing mixture are required, and a method of supply to any place.  But security is much more complicated.  So, let's say that someone has penetrated an object (or, to be more precise, into a research laboratory).  The security will be notified about the presence of someone outside, a quick response team will leave, but until they arrive at the scene, it turns out that there is no one there.  A peculiar solution can be seen in the most advanced places on the planet in this matter: the treasuries of countries and mints.  So, if there was an unauthorized entry and the security system was hacked, it is envisaged that a passive security system is activated hitherto, which closes all possible exits again.  But it is expensive and difficult to implement, so you do not have to expect that something like this can be seen a lot.  And now let's find out what is needed to make the installation of a security and fire alarm system qualitatively.

If you have a plan to take care of the house on your own (or even some sort of shed), then you need to carefully study all the information that can only be obtained.  It is also necessary to draw up a project plan, which will be carried out taking into account the regulatory documents that are currently in force, as well as coordinate the installation with state licensing authorities (this applies to professional services in the first place).  For installation, it is best to use certified equipment, since homemade products can carry a certain danger if they were created by an inexperienced person.  And at the very end, it will be necessary to carry out <span>commissioning,</span> correct all inaccuracies, solve problems and draw up technical documentation.  In the future, it will only be necessary to maintain mechanisms and maintain their operability.  It is very desirable to maintain the functioning of the same person (or company) who performed the setup.  He must be technically competent.

Sensors, as well as connecting wires are key components of the system that determine the reliability of its operation as a whole.  At the same time, they are laid in such a way that they are not striking.  For confidence, cables with at least two wires are used.  As used sensors there is a significant choice.  You can stop at the good old reed "caps".  Although if we talk about the kitchen, here we need elements that can respond not only to heat, but also to smoke.  Near places of storage of values, the placement of motion sensors will be very desirable.  Fortunately, the cheapest options cost only a few hundred rubles, so if you want, you can force the whole house.  Also, in order to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhether they work or not, you can select devices equipped with a signal diode.  In the event of failure, they will immediately report problems.

They contain provisions that, on first examination, may seem too soft, but this is a misleading impression.  So, they provide for the option of using the room by smokers with the possibility of a false alarm, and also provide technical recommendations on the placement of system elements.  And indeed, there is a number of useful information that is useful to those people who do not have good experience in this field.
