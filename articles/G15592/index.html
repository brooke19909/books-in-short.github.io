  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hippopotamus: mythology, etymology, species</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The name of one of <span>the largest animals</span> on earth has not been ignored by either the Bible or mythology.  Hippopotamus, hippo - a monster from the Old Testament or an ordinary inhabitant of fresh water?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><h2>  First mention </h2><p>  In the Bible, in the book of Job, the word "hippopotamus" is first mentioned.  The etymology of this name is unclear.  Most likely, the word comes from the ancient Hebrew ◊ë◊î◊û◊ï◊™, which means simply ‚Äúanimal‚Äù.  According to the biblical legend, the Lord created from nothing two mythical animals called to prove his power.  Their names were: Leviathan and the Hippopotamus. </p><p>  Mythology assigns the title of kings to these monsters.  Studies of Jewish legends indicate that, according to the ancient inhabitants of Israel, Leviathan was the title of king of all marine life, and the biblical Hippo was considered the lord of all land animals.  <span>European mythology</span> claims that this beast is large and gluttonous, it is able to drink all the water from the Jordan and eat all the grass on its shores. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hippo mythology" class="if" height="464" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1087407.jpg" width="495"></div>  Therefore, God created only two of these monsters that could not mate and give offspring.  Otherwise, the animals and people would have no food and water left.  Traditions endowed animals with all kinds of vices.  Leviathan was considered the embodiment of pride, meanness and betrayal.  The Behemoth became the personification of greed, vanity and gluttony.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mythology and reality </h2><p>  Bible scholars believe it is possible that stories convey the impressions of ancient people about some real paleo-animal.  It could be an ancient elephant or another monster.  By the time the Jews settled on the Sinai Peninsula, these outlandish animals were most likely on the verge of extinction. </p><p>  Eyewitness accounts were overgrown with legends and terrifying new details, which resulted in a classic (mythological) interpretation recorded in the book of Job.  So from the depths of centuries with the additions and distortions, the biblical Hippopotamus has survived to this day. </p><h2>  Medieval mythology </h2><p>  The revival occurred in the Middle Ages.  Theosophy and scholasticism called this animal out of the darkness of Jewish traditions and gave it new features.  Now the hippo is a demon, a servant of the devil.  It can take the form of various animals and introduces destruction and chaos into a measured existence. </p><p>  A female hippo in the guise of a woman can seduce monks who have vowed fidelity and integrity.  Having achieved the desired, the demon tears the man by the power of lust and ultimately destroys him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mythology hippo hippo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1087408.jpg" width="465"></div>

    <p>  In addition, the title of the executioner of the underworld was assigned to the hippopotamus.  With a trumpet cry he announces sinners about his approach, and they tremble upon hearing his measured tread. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the retinue of Satan, he is the keeper of the Great Cup and the main cupbearer.  Sometimes he is represented as an antagonist of St.  Petra: in the clutches of a hippopotamus are the keys to hell, and he himself is considered the night watchman of the underworld. </p><h2>  Image in literature </h2><p>  Perhaps the most impressive incarnation of a hippopotamus is in Bulgakov.  As the author himself assures, he took a detailed description of the devilish beast from an old book setting out the history of the relationship between man and the devil. </p><p>  The amazing variability of the biblical hippo was embodied in the pages of the Bulgakov book.  He seems to be both a fat impudent cat, "fixing a primus", and a fat man in a cap. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="biblical hippo european mythology" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1087411.jpg" width="437"></div>  At the very end, the Hippo shows its true face and becomes a slender young man, a page demon, the best jester of all living.  Perhaps this is the most beautiful embodiment of the image of an animal in modern literature.

    <h2>  Hippopotamus for children </h2><p>  The hippo, whose mythology is imbued with adult fear and awe, turned out to be a harmless and good-natured fat man in the world of children.  From the books of Chukovsky, these animals surround our kids in a variety of images, very far from those that mythology offers. </p><p>  Hippopotamus hippo is often found in modern children's literature.  This is a big and good-natured beast, a little lazy and very clumsy. </p>

The mythology depicting the terrible monster was completely forgotten, the amazing beast acquired new features.

    <p>  The character of the mythological hippo and its childhood variety has nothing to do with the nature of the living African prototype - the hippo.  But the amazing transformation of the biblical beast into modern images may interest even readers who are far from religious and philosophical literature. </p>
