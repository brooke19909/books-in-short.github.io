In addition, the doors to the park area and the surrounding area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe house are open to visitors.  In these places you can walk on your own.  The only thing is that you must adhere to strict rules of conduct: do not damage property, do not take with you any items taken from the museum.  There is also a ban on the use of alcoholic beverages and drugs. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The Venevitin family itself in the territory of modern Voronezh region appeared at the beginning of the 17th century.  The first owner of the inheritance in these open spaces was Lavrenty Gerasimovich and his son.  They acquired about 10 thousand acres of land on the left bank <span>of the Don River.</span>  Several peasant families were immediately relocated to this place.  New residents were from the village of Animal.  To preserve the memory of their small homeland, it was decided to call the new settlement Novozhivotin. </p><p>  Later, the church was moved here, because the village turned into a village, which became the main settlement in the vicinity. </p><p>  But the residential building itself was not there.  Only at the beginning of the 18th century a pond was dug and a park planted on the site of a modern building.  Venevitinova estate, according to experts, was built within the 60-70s of the 18th century.  A decade later, the Archangel Church was also renewed.  Since then, it has become stone. </p><p>  We learn from the business book of the early 19th century that, in addition to the residential building, there was also a cellar, a couple of outbuildings, a glacier and a barn. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

The owners again plastered the facade and demolished the second floor.  In the days of the USSR, Venevitinov's estate served for the needs of a school, an orphanage, during the Second World War, the military were stationed here.  Accordingly, each new owner changed the layout depending on the purpose of the building.

    <h2>  Restoration </h2><p>  By the time of restoration, the room was unrecognizable in comparison with the option that was originally.  Venevitinova estate was rebuilt several times before it took on its current shape.  The first redevelopment was carried out only in 1988.  The work lasted 6 years, so that then the museum-estate of Venevitinov is located here. </p><p>  This family took part in many charity events, and also made a significant contribution to shipbuilding.  However, the most famous representative of the clan was Dmitry Vladimirovich - poet, philosopher, prose writer. </p><p>  Since 2005, a monument of authorship by Maxim Dikunov was erected on his estate. </p><p>  Museum-estate of D. Venevitinov (Voronezh, 27 kilometers from the estate) as if looking at his master, imprisoned in bronze. </p>

The most modern technologies were used for restoration, due to which the museum-estate of Venevitinov has become a popular pastime for many Voronezh residents. </p><p>  In the evenings, you can see the silhouettes of a moving aristocracy in the windows, and holographic pictures are transmitted to the building‚Äôs facade in the dark.

And who knows, maybe your print will lie exactly on the trail of Dmitry Vladimirovich or his friends. </p><h2>  Modern building life </h2><p>  A favorite place for romantics and dreamers is the estate of Venevitinov.  Voronezh is rightfully proud of the pearl of the region.  Almost every day at the gates you can meet a wedding procession, regardless of the time of year. </p><p>  It is forbidden to take pictures without permission.  Before you start shooting, you must definitely agree with the administration. </p><p>  The Museum-Estate of Venevitinov (Voronezh is an hour away) is open for visits every day, except Mondays and Tuesdays.  It is also necessary to clarify the schedule in advance, as it differs at different times of the year. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The territory of the museum occupies a very advantageous position - it is not far from Voronezh, and at the same time it is at a sufficient distance so that the visitor can escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. </p><p>  From Voronezh, only 23 kilometers away is the Venevitinov estate.  Every local knows how to get to it, because for this you just need to go onto the M 4 ‚ÄúDon‚Äù highway and then turn towards the Novozhivotinnoe signpost. </p><p>  If you do not have a private car, that is, daily bus services from the Central Bus Station of Voronezh. </p>
