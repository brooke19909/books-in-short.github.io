This beautiful place is considered the hallmark of the city.  The name of the embankment is associated with the sports giants located next to it.  This is the complex "Olympian" and the stadium "Dynamo". </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="43.1220503" data-lng="131.87485600000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/7/9/5/16795.png"></div><h2>  How did the embankment </h2><p>  In the museums of Vladivostok, you can find information that in the XIX century, on the site of the current embankment, baths were located in which the water of the Amur Bay had increased salinity and was considered healing.  By the beginning of the 20th century, a market spontaneously formed on the bay, which became popular for citizens.  It always had fresh fish and seafood that the fishermen brought immediately after the catch. </p><p>  In the middle of the last century, a city beach began to be equipped with sports fields, solariums and water stations.  Locals called the beach a beach of health, then the name ‚ÄúSports Harbor‚Äù was fixed to the beach. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel-vse.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embankment in Vladivostok" class="if uuid-3197242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/3197242.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to the promenade </h2><p>  If you are guests of the city, you can get to Vladivostok Sports Embankment, the address of which is 2A Batareinaya St., by bus or minibus.  Vehicle numbers are listed below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Bus </td><td>  rest  "Gray Horse", No. 7t, 13d, 31, 39d, 45, 49, 51, 57, 59, 60, 62, 81, 99, 106, 107, 111, 112 </td></tr><tr><td>  Route taxi </td><td>  rest  "Gray Horse", No. 63, 114t </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Favorite vacation spot of citizens </h2><p>  In any resort town there are embankments along which vacationers make their promenade in the evenings.  If you ask the citizens in Vladivostok what their favorite vacation spot is, they will of course answer that it is Sportivnaya Embankment.  They love to come here. </p><p>  Walking alleys lined with pavers stretch from the promenade.  The embankment in 2016 experienced a period of renewal.  For a long time, one of its parts remained neglected.  Thanks to the city‚Äôs development program, the first street food avenue in the Far East appeared with numerous cafes, whose menu includes American and Chinese cuisines.  Near the Sports Embankment is the noisiest place in the city - the amusement park for children and adults "Carousel".  And having visited the Ferris wheel, you can see not only the city, but also the hills. </p><div class="photo" data-original="na7dney.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fountain on the sports promenade" class="if uuid-3194476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/3194476.jpg"></div><p>  Walking along the Sports Embankment of Vladivostok (photo above), you can look into a cafe with open summer terraces or stand by the fountain.  This is an impressive bowl with gushing music to the water.  Water splashes are synchronized with musical melodies and highlighted with all kinds of shades.  On summer evenings, citizens of all ages love to relax at the fountain and admire the play of light in its jets.  In the near future, the city authorities plan to combine Cape Kungasny and Sportivnaya embankment into a single walking zone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Art objects on the embankment </h2><p>  In 2013, an original art object appeared on the Sports Embankment of Vladivostok.  All residents of the city are in love with him.  These are two beautiful bronze tiger cubs.  They are established here as a symbol of caring for a rare breed of feline squad.  An equally interesting art object is the "Heart of Love".  A romantic place where you can make a declaration of love, hang locks, throwing little keys into the water, make a secret wish, and also strengthen the marriage bonds at a visiting session. </p><p>  In the summer of 2018, near the Sports Embankment of Vladivostok, next to the amusement park, another unique art object opened - the creative street ART AVENUE A2.  The street fell in love with the townspeople and guests of the city.  Near the decorated sections, standing along the street, and an intricate fence, you can take a picture, as well as walk along the path, painted with all the colors of the rainbow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dv.kp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New art object on the waterfront" class="if uuid-3197167" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/3197167.jpg"></div><p>  But another art object "Seven hills", located in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSports Embankment of Vladivostok, did not surprise the townspeople.  They did not notice the art in the concrete structures of the project, although the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe authors of the architectural object - to acquaint the townspeople and visitors with the names of hills and the heights indicated on the steles of these hills initially seemed useful. </p>
