Anapa, holidays with children: reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Rest in the Krasnodar Territory is perhaps the most popular destination in the summer.  Here you can meet vacationers from all over the country: both young and old come to enjoy the healing air, sea, sun ... On the embankments and beaches of the region at least take photos for social advertising: completely smiling happy families, shining faces.  And it‚Äôs so easy to believe that happiness is near!  And in order not to be convinced of this until the end of the vacation, you need to take care of everything in advance. </p><h2>  Ah, Anapa ... </h2><p>  Anapa is a world famous resort, but they come here not only for the strength of the sea and mineral waters: only landscapes heal any spiritual wounds.  The proximity to the Caucasus and the abundance of balneological hospitals will make you feel like a character in Lermontov‚Äôs ‚ÄúHero of Our Time‚Äù.  In the vicinity of the mountains are blooming valleys that are especially pleasing to the eye.  It‚Äôs hot enough during the day, but in the evening, walking along the promenade, you can feel a breath of light breeze.  The heroic past of the city will provide food for the mind and make you take a different look at the cozy bay. </p><h2>  Entertainment in the city </h2><p>  If you decide to go to Anapa, then surely the main purpose of the visit is to visit the sea: sunbathing on the sand, boat trips, water and beach sports.  It is unfortunate that not everyone can talk about the sights of the city.  It‚Äôs good if the magnet shows the sea or the promenade, and if the gates of the Turkish fortress, where didn‚Äôt you go? </p><p>  In order not to get sunburned during your searches, rather arm yourself with an Anapa map and explore all the monuments!  There are many historical ‚Äúentertainments‚Äù in the city: in addition to the aforementioned gates of the fortress, there is a lighthouse, the Gorgippia archaeological museum under the starry sky, the Big Utrish Nature Reserve, the monument to Suvorov and the magnificent dolphinarium. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Paradise in a hut </h2>

    <p>  The best accommodation option for tourists, which Anapa has, is a guest house.  Holidays with children will no longer turn into torment due to the lack of conditions.

Remember that you can save on housing, because you didn‚Äôt come to admire the apartments and stay in your room.  For those who are looking for guest houses, Anapa offers all kinds of prices.  You can settle in a hotel for 200 rubles, and for 1500 rubles per day.  It all depends on the area and amenities offered to vacationers. </p><h2>  Hummingbird </h2><p>  This place is located at ul.  Shevchenko, d.183, Anapa.  The guest house (rest with children there is quite comfortable) has been popular for years.  The three-story building accommodates 15 double and triple rooms.

    <p>  And here is another beautiful guest house located near the city of Anapa.  Rest with children is the most comfortable.  The village of Vityazevo is located near the center, but it is ideal for a secluded vacation.  The Golden Maple complex is recommended by almost all families with children.  Roomy rooms (extra beds are provided), amenities, free parking are what adults will appreciate.  But your playground and children's indoor pool will surely appeal to your kids.  The sea is about 20 minutes walk, which is not very popular with families with small children.  As for the cost, it is quite democratic: a double room at the peak of the season will cost a little more than 2000 rubles.  Address of the guest house: Krasnodar Territory, the city of Anapa, s.  Vityazevo, Blagoveshchensky per., D.12. </p><h2>  Retro: guest house, Anapa, Vityazevo </h2>

    <p>  As we can see, there are many housing options in Anapa.  The guest house (vacation with children you are planning or not) will welcome you with open arms.  "Oriole" is a great option.  In addition to the standard amenities in the rooms, there is absolutely everything that young children need: from the playground to toys and the playpen.  A room for a family of three will cost 850 rubles at the beginning of the season and 3000 rubles in the middle.  It‚Äôs not long to go to the sea, near a sandy beach.  Families with young children will especially enjoy the shallow sea.  You can find a guest house at the address: pos.  Dzhemete, Pioneer Avenue, 74. </p><p>  Let luck smile at you, and every traveler will find a paradise for himself! </p>
