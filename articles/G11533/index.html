  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make paper boats yourself.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An unusual quivering feeling is sometimes caused by the simplest things.  In the endless stream of days, it‚Äôs not the hypnotizing brilliance of the windows of civilization that attracts you, but the alluring warm light of cozy handicrafts.  A crunchy notebook sheet, a businesslike childish participation - and a mysterious world comes to life on the table, mentally taking away cute paper boats somewhere into the distance. </p><h2>  Useful paper activity </h2><p>  It is known that working with paper is not just a creative process.  Joint home leisure strengthens family relationships, gives joy not only to children, but also to parents.  In children's institutions, teachers specifically teach children the artistic design.  Such exercises help to develop fine motor skills of hands, increase alertness and perseverance.  Telling children how to make a paper boat, adults pass them the good light of many generations.  Neither gadgets nor computer games will replace the invaluable experience of manual skill. </p><h2>  Where do paper boats come from? </h2><p>  The art of creating unusual crafts originated in the East.  Paper was first invented in China many years ago.  Later in Japan, they picked up and perfected the secrets of a mysterious production. </p><div class="photo" data-original="heartstonepaper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where did the ships come from?" class="if uuid-2830151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106013/2830151.jpg"></div><p>  Paper was treated with sacred reverence, crafts were used to decorate temples, and used in ceremonies.  Gradually, such needlework grew into a kind of creativity, gained a lot of fans around the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is known that paper ventures delighted the famous Leo Tolstoy.  Origami was also fond of the popular English leader Lewis Carroll, who wrote "Alice in Wonderland."  The folding paper folding was facilitated by the talentedly developed system of iconic drawings and drawings developed in the last century.  Akira Yoshizawa, a Japanese origami guru, invented them to describe the technology for making paper shapes.  Today, this system is generally accepted throughout the world. </p><h2>  About ship paper </h2><p>  The toy folding algorithm is simple.  First you need to determine what to create the craft from, and then how to make it. </p><p>  A paper boat is made of strong, fairly thin paper, without the use of glue.  Scissors may only be needed to prepare the sheet.  Felt pens are needed to finish important elements on the boat.  The paper should be clean, not wrinkled, resistant to folding.  Well suited for work: </p><ul><li>  Kits for origami - colored sheets of square shape with a side of 15 - 20cm.  They fold well, retain their shape, and do not form cracks. </li><li>  Office paper of all colors - the most convenient for beginners. </li><li>  Wrapping - easy to fold, not torn, has large sizes, but a small range of colors. </li><li>  Paper from notebooks and magazines. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="thelittletreasures.blogspot.com" data-author=": Maya Kuzman, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Festive decor &quot;Ships&quot;" class="if uuid-2830060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106013/2830060.jpg"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that the figure is made up of a rectangular sheet of paper, not square.  Having trained to collect paper boats step by step, many in the future stop looking at the schemes.  If necessary, you can trim the sheet, giving it the desired shape.  The instructions for folding paper fun are simple. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Step by step: design a toy </h2><p>  The most popular paper boats are made according to the classical scheme.  The assembly algorithm assumes a sequence of the following actions: </p><div class="photo" data-original="cuteness-studies.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Classic boat assembly diagram" class="if uuid-2830077" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106013/2830077.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Put a rectangular sheet of paper in front of you vertically and fold in half on yourself.  The fold line will divide it across. </li><li>  It is necessary to determine its central point.  To do this, without turning, fold the workpiece again in half and straighten it straight away.  The center and midline are indicated.  The position of the workpiece - free edges down. </li><li>  Bend the top towards the midline towards you. </li><li>  Bend the lower part of the workpiece: the upper layer is forward and upward (towards itself), the lower layer is backward, respectively.  In this case, bend the small angles along the edges of the first layer back.  Get a triangular pocket. </li><li>  Open it and flatten it. </li><li>  Fold up the free edge of the resulting square. </li><li>  Turn the workpiece over and repeat the same.  Carefully smooth all kink lines. </li><li>  Open the pocket, connect the lower free corners and flatten. </li><li>  Get the shape by pulling the top corners. </li><li>  Fix the boat.  The product is ready. </li></ol><h2>  How to fold a ship </h2><p>  Another simple paper boat awaits its embodiment.  Assembly instruction is easy.  For this cute steamer it is better to take colored double-sided paper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="origami.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper steamer assembly diagram" class="if uuid-2832373" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106013/2832373.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Fold and unfold the paper in half diagonally in both directions. </li><li>  Work with the top of the paper according to the scheme. </li><li>  Bend the top layer of the workpiece along the dashed line. </li><li>  Unscrew the tip of the paper along the dashed line. </li><li>  Fold the resulting creation in half. </li><li>  Fold the paper along the dotted line on both sides.  This is an external reverse fold. </li><li>  Rotate the model in the desired direction. </li><li>  To fix and decorate the finished steamer (add windows, anchor name of the ship). </li></ol><p>  The seaworthiness of the boats can be improved by slightly adding foam to the bottom. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="ha2AAfKIPVg" data-url="https://youtu.be/ha2AAfKIPVg" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/9/0/6/8/9068.jpg"></div><p>  Beautiful figures can decorate interiors, arrange holidays, use in games.  There are many models.  Build paper boats with your kids!  Fair wind! </p>
