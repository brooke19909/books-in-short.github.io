    <p>  Every car owner is worried that his "iron horse" did not go to the hijackers.  So let's talk about <span>what is an immobilizer</span> in a car.  This is such equipment that is capable of obstructing the movement of the vehicle on its own.  It simply breaks or blocks the power system, ignition, and so on. </p><p>  True, it happens that installing an immobilizer involves a different scheme of work.  In this case, the attacker will be able to start the engine and even drive a few tens of meters.  However, after this, the engine starts to interrupt, after which it stalls.  Start it will not work, and the hijacker will be left alone with the faulty car in a crowded place.  As a rule, a car is thrown by a criminal. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Device </h2>

    <p>  What is the immobilizer in the car, perhaps, have understood.  As for his device, the anti-theft tool is equipped with three, less often two circuit breakers.  So-called "microimmobilizers" are also used.  These are the relays that the central unit controls with the help of high-frequency signals transmitted through the vehicle‚Äôs standard electrical circuit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many of you have heard about <span>car thefts.</span>  With an immobilizer, which is mainly installed in the back of the cabin, this is not easy.  To find it is almost impossible due to the fact that the wires <span>of the control</span> unit are not connected to the device <span>.</span>  And if the microimmobilizer is mounted in a <span>safety block,</span> then the ability to distinguish it from the rest of the fuses is reduced to zero. </p><h2></h2><h2>  At least a dozen </h2>

    <p>  We continue to understand what an immobilizer is in a car.  It is fair to say that such microdevices can be installed in unlimited quantities.  Some owners also order 10 each.  Imagine how long it will take the hijacker to at least find them all, not to mention the disposal. </p><p>  Recently, contactless immobilizers have become increasingly popular.  In this case, the receiving antenna is hidden in the place indicated by the customer under the skin, and the plastic card or key fob takes control.  When boarding a car, the owner is required to bring the keychain or card to the antenna, as a result of which all chains will be unlocked, and the car will be disarmed.  Or it will be enough for the driver to carry a card in some pocket, and the system will automatically recognize it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2></h2><h2>  Domestic market </h2><p>  Domestic manufacturers today can offer several excellent models of immobilizers.  One of them is equipped with a single relay, which is controlled by a dedicated wiring unit and can block the ignition when the driver tries to start the engine without carrying a transponder card.  It does not matter whether it was started before or not, the engine will start / continue its work, and the car will begin to move.  After a short time, the immobilizer will simulate a malfunction (interruptions in the operation of the power unit).  After that, the movement will be stopped. </p>

    <p>  Another model as standard is also equipped with one relay, however, it is capable of more, unlike the above.  A microimmobilizer, controlled by the standard wires of the machine, is already mounted here.  This device makes it possible to install up to ten of these reels.  As we have already said, the more they will be in the car, the more difficult it is to carry out theft to an attacker. </p><h2></h2><h2>  What to choose? </h2><p>  Some motorists do not stop arguing about which is <span>better, an alarm</span> or an immobilizer.  Therefore, we will express one more opinion on this subject.  Alarms are much more expensive than immobilizers, and they are also not so compact.  It will be just great if the latter will complement the factory security system of the car. </p><p>  What about immobilizers becoming an independent protection device?  And even this is quite real.  After all, there are three advantages over the alarm system.  Now we will consider them. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Firstly, the possibility of an intelligent hacking hijacker is very low.  This is due at least to the fact that the immobilizer "communicates" with a card or key fob at a very short distance, while the car alarm radio signal covers a considerable space.  Therefore, the so-called "radio interceptors" in the case of the first will be ineffective. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to steal cars with an immobilizer" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11194/340891.jpg" width="595"></div></h2><p>  Consider a different situation.  In some car service centers, car thieves may like your car.  If this happens, the employees will be able to make a duplicate of your key without any problems, as well as program for themselves a keychain that will "make friends" with the alarm system of your car.  But copying the key to the immobilizer without having the appropriate card is almost unrealistic. </p><p>  Secondly, dimensions need to be mentioned.  Immobilizers are so small that their hidden installation can really be called hidden.  Conscientious installers are able to hide this equipment so skillfully that the hijacker simply will not be able to determine where this anti-theft device is located even for a long period of time. </p><p>  Thirdly, it is passive protection.  The immobilizer allows you to implement the so-called "robbery protection" without the presence or participation of the driver. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  Finally, a few useful tips.  Be sure to get at least two active keys.  One, of course, will always be with you, put the other in your house.  If the loss of the first occurs, the second will allow you to continue the independent movement of the car. </p><p>  If at least one key to the immobilizer has been lost, be sure to recode your system in the very near future.  Until you do, the car runs the risk of being stolen.  Also, do not keep this key together with all your keys in one bunch. </p><p>  To increase the recognition range of the card, orient it parallel to the antenna plane of the reader.  Do not trust the installation of anti-theft equipment to non-professionals.  It can also lead to sad consequences.  Now you understand what an immobilizer is in a car and what are its advantages over an alarm system. </p>
