Although in this <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof the Bryansk region</span> there is something to see.  Mostly Novozybkov is visited by passage.  Indeed, 32 kilometers from the city there is a state border with the Republic of Belarus.  Therefore, the federal highway A240 runs here.  But why not move out to spend the night with all kinds of comfort at the Green Park Hotel (Novozybkov), and in the morning, after having a delicious and satisfying breakfast, not go on?  Let's examine the conditions at this hotel: where it is located, what are its rooms.  Does the hotel provide additional services and entertainment?  In this article, we made a brief analysis of the reviews of those tourists who have already managed to visit the Green Park Hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Green Newbie Park" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1821303.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located, how to get to it? </h2><p>  It can be seen that Green Park (Novozybkov) is designed for motorists coming to or from the Republic of Belarus.  The hotel is located near the entrance to the A240 federal highway.  His exact address: st.  Michurina, 46a.  Judging by the reviews, then tourists really like the location of the hotel.  It is located not in the center of the city, but rather at the exit from it, on the southeastern outskirts.  The train station is located two kilometers from the hotel.  <span>Bryansk Airport</span> is immeasurably further - almost 200 km.  The center of Novozybkov can be reached by taxi in five minutes.  All the sights of the city are at a distance of two and a half kilometers from the hotel.  You can get to the Green Park Hotel by taxi or by buses No. 14 and 8. You should get off at the Tekhnikum stop.  From there, to the entrance to the hotel is a couple of steps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Green Park Novozybkov Hotel" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1821302.jpg" width="600"></div>

And the fact that he is on the outskirts does not in the least diminish his merits, but, on the contrary, adds.  After all, the hotel building stands in the middle of a pine forest.  Pure nature and tranquility, a well-equipped recreation area lure customers from central hotels to the suburban Green Park.  The hotel was opened relatively recently - in 2013.  The two-story building is very stylish in cream and chocolate tones.  The hotel also has a tire service, car wash and sauna with swimming pool.  This once again underlines what kind of tourists the hotel is designed for.  Reviews praise the bucolic silence and tranquility of the pine forest.  It is nice to relax here after a busy and eventful day.  The building has a playground.  There is also parking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Green Newbie Park photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1821304.jpg" width="600"></div>
