    <p>  The only significant drawback is the absence of balconies in some rooms.  Of course, for a hotel located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãa beach resort, this is not logical, since it is necessary to dry bathing suits and towels daily.  When booking rooms, pay attention to this nuance, indicating that you need a terrace or balcony. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  The food at Marmara Hotel Apartments is pretty good.  Many tourists are limited only to breakfast in the restaurant.  In general, living in a hotel, you can cook yourself, which is what most tourists do.  You can have breakfast in your room, and for dinner you can visit one of the nearest restaurants.  By the way, near the hotel there are three large malls, in each of which you can find cafes and fast food establishments, if you want a quick snack.  There are grocery stores near the hotel, so you can always cook something in your room.  In general, guests note that there are no problems with food.  On the contrary, the presence in the apartments of a full kitchen allows you to save a little on food. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  The beach of Marmara Hotel Apartments is located at some distance from the hotel.  However, the property provides a free shuttle service to the coast.  Buses depart from the hotel entrance every hour.  The first car leaves at 9.15.  The hotel has a certain rule.  At the reception, you must pre-register for the bus at a specific time.  Unfortunately, not all tourists follow this rule, and therefore the confusion begins.  The hotel staff does not control this process, so not everyone who is recorded can leave.  In principle, the coast can be reached by taxi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marmara hotel apartments food" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2158180.jpg"></div>

    <p>  One-way fares are approximately 320 rubles.  A shuttle takes tourists to a free beach near the famous sail building.  On the ground floor of the hotel you can always take beach towels and umbrellas.  The coast of Dubai is always crowded with vacationers.  Nevertheless, relaxing on the beach is beautiful, and the water of the bay is very warm and clear. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Description of the hotel Marmara Hotel Apartments would not be complete, if not to recall its infrastructure.  According to tourists, it is quite good.  In principle, the hotel has everything you need for relaxation.  However, it is worth considering the fact that the hotel is a city institution and does not have its own territory.  The complex itself consists of one multi-storey building, on the roof of which there is a small pool and a beach.  In the lobby of the hotel there is a representative of a tour operator who is always ready to offer interesting trips. </p><p>  The convenient location of the hotel makes it possible to easily reach the nearest metro station to get to any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.  In addition, the hotel provides a transfer not only to the beach, but also to the nearest mall.  Literally within walking distance there are three well-known malls: Emirates Mall, Lou Lou and Al Barsha.  There is a grocery store right behind the hotel.  Al Barsha Pond Park is located in the same quarter as the hotel.  Its definitely worth a visit.  The park is incredibly green, in the middle of it there is a lake. </p><h2>  Service Reviews </h2><p>  In addition to its convenient location, the hotel offers excellent service.  Marmara Hotel Apartments has very nice staff.  At the reception, only one person on duty speaks a little Russian, but with the help of an interpreter on the phone you can understand each other.  The hotel does not take a deposit.  According to tourists, the hotel staff responds quickly enough to the requests of guests.  Therefore, if a breakdown occurs, then it is worth informing the reception about it.  Soon the staff will try to resolve the issue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marmara hotel apartments beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2158182.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, the hotel makes a very good impression.  Tourists are very pleased with the stay in it.  The complex has many advantages, thanks to which the stay in it is incredibly comfortable.  But there are some inconveniences, which, for example, relate to transfer to the beach.  Although such nuances are not so important as to pay attention to them.  In general, tourists highly recommend the institution.  Its beautiful apartments are very good for living, which is why the hotel is popular among holidaymakers. </p><h2>  Entertainment and Attractions </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, the hotel is very convenient in terms of location, since next to it there are shopping centers, shops and all kinds of entertainment.  Marmara Hotel Apartments is located next to the metro station, from which you can reach interesting places of the resort.  In addition, you can use the services of local guides and go on an exciting tour.  Resting at the resort, it is worthwhile to take time to explore its beauties, breaking away from a beach stay. </p><p>  It is impossible to relax in Dubai and not to see the famous Burj Khalifa, which is the tallest building in the world.  Its height is 828 meters.  The shape of the building resembles a stalagmite.  At an altitude of 555 meters, there is the highest observation deck, which you can climb to view the city from a height. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marmara hotel apartments reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2158185.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Dubai has a large number of mosques.  Among them, the most interesting for tourists is <span>the Jumeirah Mosque.</span>  This is the largest religious building in all the emirates.  By the way, this mosque is one of the few that tourists who do not profess the Muslim religion can visit. </p><p>  Any tourist will certainly be interested in the local water park, executed on the same scale as all buildings in Dubai.  Wild Wadi Water Park is equipped with attractions that will give amazing emotions.  The water park is considered one of the best in the Middle East. </p><p>  If you are interested in the history of the country, then you should go to Fort Al Fahidi.  On its territory you can see the traditional reed houses of the local population.  The fort is equipped with serious dungeons, equipped during its construction.  In addition, his exposition has many interesting exhibits dedicated to the prehistoric, medieval and modern era. </p>
