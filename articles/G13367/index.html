The coasts of the Azov and Black Seas are inviting tourists to visit beautiful sandy and pebble beaches, walk along mountain trails, and breathe in fresh sea air.  In Crimea, there is everything in order to have a good rest and be energized for a year ahead. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lavanda.life" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Swallow, southern coast of Crimea" class="if uuid-2752173" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2752173.jpg"></div><h2>  "Swallow's Nest" - the main attraction of the Crimean coast </h2><p>  Anyone who has ever visited Crimea knows that this peninsula is firmly associated in the minds of tourists with one of the main attractions - the Swallow‚Äôs Nest castle.  There are more than enough enthusiastic reviews about the Swallow's Nest.  This picturesque castle is built on a steep cliff, from its sites overlooking the endless Black Sea, extending beyond the horizon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sibvoyage.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the Swallow's Nest" class="if uuid-2752177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2752177.jpg"></div><h2>  Castle fame </h2><p>  After Crimea was annexed to Russia, it became fashionable among wealthy people to buy land in the south of the country and erect buildings for summer vacations there.  The famous Soviet film based on the work of Agatha Christie ‚ÄúTen Little Indians‚Äù was shot in these landscapes.  The picturesque area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe coast of the peninsula impressed artists and ministers of various muses.  The paintings here were painted by Aivazovsky and Bogolyubov. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Castle history </h2><p>  For the first time, this building was erected from wood for a retired general after the Russo-Turkish war.  It was a kind of cottage, which later changed both the owners and their appearance.  The general, who owned this site and the construction of the first wooden house, called it the castle of love. </p><p>  The look that this castle now has was given to it by the industrialist Steingel.  Many believe that the German by birth missed his homeland so much that he wanted to have something in his eyes that could remind her of it.  That is why Baron von Steingel approved the sketch and began construction.  The Gothic castle resembled the culture of the Middle Ages and the knightly buildings of that time. </p><p>  During the period when the First World War began, the castle was redone from the living quarters into a restaurant.  Due to its unique location, it was in great demand among holidaymakers.  "Swallow's Nest" had a lot of positive feedback from the officers and their ladies.  During the Civil War, the building was abandoned.  After the Soviet regime came to the peninsula, this building was transferred to the common possession. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotokto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Castle &quot;Swallow's Nest&quot;" class="if uuid-2752187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2752187.jpg"></div><h2>  Castle reconstruction </h2><p>  In the thirties of the last century, an earthquake brought down a part of the garden and a platform near the house, but the building itself remained intact.  In the second half of the twentieth century, the authorities found funds for the reconstruction of the castle.  This was done by strengthening the cliff and building a new observation deck.  The building was opened for tourists only at the beginning of the twenty-first century.  Over time, this castle became one of the symbols of the Crimea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 2015, the state of the castle was once again declared in emergency condition; specially allocated money was spent on its repair.
