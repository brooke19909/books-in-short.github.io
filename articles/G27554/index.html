  <section class="page js-page"><h1>World History Pages: Cordoba Emirate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the Middle Ages is full of events related to the collapse and formation of states, the struggle between religions: Islam and Christianity, with the rapid increase in the number of colonies and liberation wars.  One of these states that emerged in the medieval era is the Cordoba Emirate in the Iberian Peninsula.  After the emirate, a Cordoban caliphate existed on these lands.  It is important to determine these concepts. </p><h2>  Cordoba Emirate: what is it? </h2><p>  This is a state that was formed on the territory of modern Spain in the Middle Ages.  The center of the emirate was the city of Cordoba in Spain.  The state religion of this entity was Islam. </p><p>  The formation of the emirate is associated with the name of the emir Abd ar-Rahman I of the Umayyad family.  The state was founded by him in 756. The Cordoba emirate lasted about 170 years. </p><p>  So what is the emirate?  This is a type of Islamic state whose head is the emir.  In this case, the emir of Cordoba.  In contrast to this domain, the caliph is the head of the caliphate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cordoba Caliphate" class="if uuid-2758236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2758236.jpg"></div><h2>  Conquest of the Arabs, as a prerequisite for the formation of the emirate </h2><p>  The history of the conquests of the Arabs in European territories began with the act of retaliation of the ruler of the city of Ceut Julian.  Ceuta at that time belonged to Byzantium.  It was the only city that fiercely resisted the Arab ruler Walid I, who expanded the borders of the Arab caliphate to the ocean coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This neighborhood was very dangerous for Christian Europeans.  Julian decided to surrender Ceuta to the Arabs after the Visigoth King Roderich dishonored his daughter Cava, sent to court in Toledo for training and education. </p><p>  Julian and Walid I united and sent an army against Roderich.  During the hostilities, which lasted a total of four years, almost the entire Iberian Peninsula was subordinated to Arab power. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kopilkaurokov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Territory of Cordoba Emirate" class="if uuid-2758237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2758237.jpg"></div><p>  Three years later, the Arabs seized Narbonne, and after eight more - the Aquitanian possessions of Nime and Carcassonne. </p><p>  A special place in the Arab-European wars was occupied by Abd al-Rahman I, who cracked down on his opponent, compatriot Utman ibn Naissa (Munuza).  Then he sent his troops against his ally Ed of Aquitaine and captured the cities of Albizhua, Ruerg, Zhevodan, Vele, Autun, Sans, Oloron, Lescar, Boyon, Osh, Dax, Er-sur-Adur, Bordeaux, Garonne, Limousin, Perigueux, Saint , Angouleme, Bigorre, Commenge, Labour, Saint-North and Saint-Saven abbeys.  His army reached Burgundy and repeatedly invaded Gaul. </p><p>  This period of active hostilities ended thanks to the military alliance of Ed the Great and Karl Martell with the temporary success of the Europeans and the achieved balance of political forces. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Stages of formation </h2><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Chronological framework </td><td>  Events </td></tr><tr><td>  711 - 718 years </td><td><p>  The province of the Umayyad Caliphate (center in Baghdad) with the capital in Spain in the city of Cordoba was founded, it was governed by the emir.

In connection with the intense internecine struggle between the largest feudal powers of Western Europe, the rulers of European states had to conclude temporary disadvantageous political alliances with Muslims.  The Catholic Church and the Order of the Knights organized Crusades against the Arabs. </p><p>  The same thing happened from the point of view of civil strife between Arab rulers.  And also their response military operations against Christians were organized. </p><div class="photo" data-original="history.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ferdinand of Aragon" class="if uuid-2758248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2758248.jpg"></div><p>  A successful European decision during the Reconquista was the conclusion of a dynastic union between <span>Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon.</span>  As a result of the unification of their armies, it was possible to end the war, the purpose of which was to conquer the Iberian Peninsula from the Arabs and expel them from Europe.  The Spanish lands became Christian territories. </p>
