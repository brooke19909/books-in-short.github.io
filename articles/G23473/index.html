    <h2>  Why exactly the "ruble"? </h2><p>  The modern currency of Russia is the ruble.  Numerous versions agree that the verb “chop” is the same root for the word “ruble”.  There is also an exotic version claiming that the “ruble” has one root with the ancient Indian word “rupee” and means “processed silver”.  For the first time as the monetary unit "ruble" is mentioned in the letters of Veliky Novgorod.  During the reign of Dmitry Donskoy began his own coinage in Moscow.  At the beginning of the <span>monetary reform,</span> 1 Moscow ruble was equal to 100 Novgorod money or 200 Moscow money, which were called pennies.  At present, the price of the ruble is equal to one hundred kopecks. </p><h2>  When the first ruble and other interesting facts about the Russian currency were minted </h2>

The bill depicts a monument to Peter the Great against the background of the river and sea stations, on the back side you can see the panorama of the Solovetsky Monastery.  Around Solovki, many copies were broken on banking forums.  Even the theme of the image on the back of the bill of the training ship of the Argentine Navy's Libertad ship with links to sources, where its full description is given, was exaggerated.  Until 2010, the churches depicted on the bill are crowned with four-pitched roofs, not domes, which gives the right to assume that this is the Solovetsky camp, and not a monastery.  Subsequently, the modification of the bill changed: the image of the monastery is presented from a different angle and with domes, and the ship is missing.  There is another misconception that the Sedov barque is depicted on a bill of five hundred rubles.  The version is erroneous because the vessel on the bill is three-masted, and the Sedov is a four-masted vessel.

At present, there are 4 types of such notes in circulation: a 1997 sample, and the same sample, but modifications of 2001, 2004 and 2011.  All four types are accepted for payments throughout Russia.  Since this bill is the most popular, the Bank of Russia is constantly increasing the level of money protection and introducing more modified options into circulation.  A banknote of five hundred rubles in 2010 is considered the most secure.  The prevailing color of the bill is violet-blue, size 150x65 mm.  Two-tone and gray fibers, subtle embossed strokes, security threads and <span>watermarks are</span> embedded in the paper <span>.</span>  When combining the reverse and front sides, their fragments coincide, forming a solid pattern.  The numbers of the serial number of the banknote five hundred rubles of the 2010 modification are gradually increasing from left to right, the image has changed on the back, some of the elements of which have magnetic properties. </p><h2>  The largest bill in Russia </h2>

Many people remember that in 1997 the currency of the Russian Federation was nominated and the bill went not to millions, as it was before, but to thousands.  The production of a <span>five thousandth banknote is</span> characteristic of a period of hyperinflation or a low ruble exchange rate relative to other world currencies.  Banknotes in denominations of 5,000 rubles were issued in different years both by the government of the country and by separatist associations.  On the front side of the banknote is a monument to <span>N.N.</span>  <span>Muravyov-Amursky,</span> on the back - a bridge over the Amur River, the dominant color is red-orange.  Interestingly, on the Internet there are several sites for the sale of banknotes with very unusual numbers.  Many love the magic of numbers and are willing to pay a lot of money for numbers on their phone or car.  No less in demand among collectors are banknotes with numbers like 1234567, 0000001, 7777777, etc.  There are even orders from those who want to receive a bill with a home or mobile phone number.  We hope that our article helped you learn more about the ruble currency, as well as about the popular banknotes currently in circulation.
