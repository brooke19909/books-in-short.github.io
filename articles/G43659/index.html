Although the products manufactured by this master, we get acquainted at an early age.  All of us in childhood visited the zoological or local history museum.  It is there that we first encounter the fruits of the labor of this specialist. </p>

    <h2>  Profession history </h2><p>  In antiquity in Russia, such a master was called a "scarecrow" or a "scum".  This profession reached a special peak in the <span>Victorian era.</span>  It was at these times that stuffed animals were not just made, stuffed with sawdust, straw or hay to give them maximum resemblance to a living specimen.  They were objects of art and luxury. </p><p>  Taxidermist is a person of a unique profession.  These rare masters carefully preserve professional secrets and pass them only by inheritance.  Old stuffed animals have been living for more than 200 years, but the secrets of their manufacture have been lost, but modern products with the right technology are stored for no more than a hundred years. </p><h2>  Who can become a taxidermy? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="taxiderm services" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/328122.jpg" width="462"></div></h2><p>  Many people mistakenly believe that everyone can master this profession.  But because of its unattractiveness (working with chemicals, animal carcasses, etc.), it is not very popular.  A good taxidermist is a person who has knowledge in many areas: anatomy, zoology, he is a sculptor and artist in one person.  In addition, you must have some knowledge of chemistry and veterinary medicine.  This creativity is in its purest form, because it is necessary to achieve maximum resemblance to the original. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Taxidermy services are in demand not only among private collectors.  Many museums are proud of the works of true masters.  Prestigious hunting clubs, mansions of rich people cannot do without such exhibits. </p><h2>  Taxidermy development </h2><p>  Abroad, this rare profession is booming.  In the West, a taxidermist is a specialist working on new technologies using modern materials.  You can get this <span>prestigious profession</span> in higher educational institutions, and you can start working only after obtaining a license.  In our country, educational institutions where you could get this rare profession do not exist.  Russian taxidermists work in poorly adapted rooms.  Only some studios are adequately equipped and can compete with foreign ones. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="taxidermy stuffed" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/328121.jpg" width="600"></div>  Taxidermy Workshop </h2><p>  If you have a rare chance to get into this room, you will be struck by its resemblance to the studio of an artist or sculptor.  And this is not surprising.  Taxidermist is a creative person.  Around are sketches, drawings of animals, sculptures.  You smell stubborn chemicals, paint, glue and alcohol. </p><h2>  Eternal dispute: is this profession humane? </h2><p>  Resentment about the <span>humanity of this</span> profession is frequent (after all, killed animals and birds serve as the main material for it).  This is a moot point.  With the same success, inhumanity can be blamed on fur farmers and representatives of all professions related to the harvesting of meat.  Although it should be recognized that the decoration of suburban villas can not be more important than the protection of the animal world. </p>
