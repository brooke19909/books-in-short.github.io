Description, terms of use, as well as opinions of subscribers will be presented to your attention.  It‚Äôs not so easy to choose a profitable tariff that best meets the requirements of a modern user.  But current mobile operators offer a fairly wide range of services.  What can you count on in this situation?  What conditions does the Smart Unlimited tariff plan offer? </p><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  This offer is a real gift for those who are used to communicating a lot.  In particular, with the help of the World Wide Web.  Smart Unlimited, the description of which is presented, is a tariff plan for active Internet users. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart unlimited description" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1456820.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  With it, it will be possible to access the network on a mobile device without restrictions.  That is, unlimited Internet access is guaranteed.  Just what modern active users need so much!  What are the main features of this proposal?  What do you need to pay attention to? </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  Now you should find out the full description.  ‚ÄúSmart Unlimited‚Äù is a tariff plan, which, as already mentioned, is intended exclusively for outgoing subscribers.  It helps to use traffic without restrictions.  What about the Internet on a mobile device? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Specifically, Smart Unlimited, the description of which is presented, allows you to work inside the home region without taking into account traffic.  A distinctive feature is the fact that when traveling around Russia, you can also use the mobile network without restrictions.  You won‚Äôt have to pay for it.  But in roaming, you already need to either connect additional option packages, or pay according to the conditions set by this or that region.  Usually the first scenario takes place. </p><h2>  Calls to MTS </h2><p>  The tariff of MTS "Smart Unlimited", the description of which is presented in the article, is not only unlimited calls.  This offer, according to numerous reviews, is suitable for active subscribers, in whose environment many use the specified mobile operator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart unlimited tariff description" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1456818.jpg" width="500"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Why?  The thing is that 200 free minutes of conversation are provided here.  The tariff of MTS "Smart Unlimited" (its description is presented below) is communication without restrictions.  The first 200 minutes of calls will be absolutely free.  And this cannot but rejoice. </p><p>  So why is this plan perfect for people whose friends and relatives use MTS?  The thing is that Smart Unlimited allows you to even communicate with MTS subscribers for free even after the specified limit has been exhausted.  Not only within the home region, but also throughout Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Other talk </h2><p>  What's next?  What features should you pay attention to before switching to Smart Unlimited (MTS)?  Description of this offer cannot bypass calls to numbers of other mobile operators.  With MTS, everything is clear - always and everywhere for free.  But what if a person actively communicates with all operators? </p><p>  Do not be scared.  Many note that the indicated tariff is a rather advantageous offer.  Why?  All thanks to the fact that 200 minutes of free conversation are provided.  But only the first of the month are taken into account.  After exhausting this limit you will have to pay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart unlimited pay description" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1456819.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  How much and in what cases?  Smart Unlimited, the description of which is presented to your attention, requires payment of only 1.5 rubles per minute of conversation if the subscriber calls on phones within the home region.  While traveling in Russia, you will have to pay only 5 rubles for a similar call.  Many indicate that these are very competitive rates. </p><h2>  Around the world </h2><p>  But this is not all the features.  Some call not only in Russia, but also in other countries.  In this area, you can see that the "Smart Unlimited" description is not much different from most MTS tariffs.  Why?  The thing is that when calling to other countries, the minute of conversation has the following rates: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  35 rubles - CIS countries; </li><li>  49 rubles - calls in Europe; </li><li>  70 rubles - all other states. </li></ul><p>  These services are not so often used, but they are taken into account.  Similar rates are encouraging.  Especially taking into account all the previously listed features! </p><h2>  Messages </h2><p>  What other surprises did the MTS Smart Unlimited tariff offer?  The description of this proposal indicates that this plan provides for free SMS.  That is, you can even exchange messages at no extra cost.  But with some limitations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff pay smart unlimited description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1456821.jpg" width="494"></div>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The thing is that in a month it is allowed to send only 200 SMS and MMS to any mobile phones in Russia.  Only after the specified limit you will need to pay.  Both within the home region and beyond.  If we are talking about the local exchange of SMS, then you will have to pay 1.5 rubles for 1 letter.  Messages to all other regions of the country cost 1.95 rubles.  You can write to international numbers for 5.25 rubles.  Therefore, it is worth paying attention to this tariff plan.  MMS is also free until a certain point.  When the specified limit expires, you will have to pay 9.90 rubles per 1 multimedia letter.  And this is for any message in Russia. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  What else do you need to know about the Smart Unlimited offer?  The tariff description (Moscow or any other region - this is not so important) must necessarily contain information about the cost of a particular offer from the mobile operator.  Otherwise, one cannot say with confidence that the chosen communication option is beneficial. </p><p>  What prices in other regions does Smart Unlimited offer?  The Krasnodar Territory tariff description allows you to find out in the company‚Äôs offices open in the region.  It is no different from offers for other regions.  So, the first month the monthly fee will be only 12 rubles 90 kopecks per day.  And then you have to pay 15 rubles a day.  About 450 rubles a month come out. </p><p>  Not the cheapest offer.  But you will have to take into account all the advantages that the tariff plan gives.  If you notice that you can talk with MTS for free, as well as exchange SMS, MMS and use the Internet on your mobile without additional payment, then 450 rubles is a completely humane solution to problems with mobile communications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart unlimited tariff description Moscow" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1456817.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what Smart Unlimited is.  Moscow knows the tariff description, since the conditions are absolutely the same for all regions.  A similar proposal attracts an audience.  But how beneficial is it?  Reviews will help to understand the task. </p><p>  In general, Smart Unlimited (the tariff description was presented earlier) makes a good impression on customers.  Especially happy are those who have been using MTS communications for a long time.  It is noted that this tariff plan is an excellent solution for people who actively use social networks, the Internet and communication.  That is, it is a real find for outgoing people. </p><p>  There are no complaints about the quality of communication.  Failures are rare.  But no one is safe from them.  Some complain about the cost of the Smart Unlimited package.  The description indicates that a month, as already mentioned, will have to pay a little less than 500 rubles.  I would like to <span>have a</span> lower <span>monthly fee</span> .  But these are very good indicators.  Given the free connection with MTS throughout Russia, of course. </p>

    <p>  Some complaints have been voiced regarding Internet connectivity.  The speed of the <span>mobile network,</span> as many claim, leaves much to be desired.  In the evening, crashes quite often occur, during the day the speed is not as high as we would like.  Some say that working so simply is impossible.  But such sayings are extremely few. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what Smart Unlimited is (MTS).  Description of this proposal pleases many.  For only 450 rubles you can get: </p><ul><li>  mobile Internet without restrictions; </li><li>  200 minutes of free conversation with operators in Russia; </li><li>  unlimited communication with MTS within the country; </li><li>  200 SMS and MMS. </li></ul><p>  Basically, this is enough even for the most active subscriber.  Here is a description of the "Smart Unlimited".  Reviews indicate that the benefit is also the payment of the tariff.  It provides daily billing.  That is, a person pays for the days of using the offer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart unlimited description reviews" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1456816.jpg" width="570"></div>
