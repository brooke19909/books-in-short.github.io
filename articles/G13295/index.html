As in almost all other similar devices from this manufacturer, a choice of potential customers were offered modifications with one or two SIM cards.  An interesting feature of the novelty was the desire of developers to ensure its affordability. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy Ace 3" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/749993.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Despite the constant criticism received by South Korean designers related to the almost identical exterior of all Samsung phones, the novelty received the same appearance as other smartphones of the company.  More specifically, that device is made in the shape of a classic rounded rectangle.  The power and power button is installed on the right side, and the <span>volume control</span> is on the left side.  Above and below, respectively, a jack for standard headphones and a port for connecting the gadget to other devices are provided.  The only significant and incomprehensible innovation, compared with the previous generation of the model, was the complication of access to the slot for installing additional memory - from now on, to replace the card, you need to remove the cover.  The weight of the smartphone was 115 grams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The display can be called one of the main advantages of the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3. The screen characteristics have changed slightly compared to the previous version.  In particular, the size of the diagonal increased by 0.2 inches and reached the mark of 4 inches.  The resolution at the same time remained the same - 480x800 pixels.  As a result, the image density dropped to 233 dots per inch.  Be that as it may, it is impossible to visually notice these deteriorations.  The matrix can be called very good: its viewing angles are quite extensive, and the color rendering is natural.  According to the reviews left by the owners of the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3, the only drawback of the smartphone‚Äôs display is the not very high brightness of the backlight, which affects the image quality under the influence of direct sunlight.  Be that as it may, comfort when working with the screen does not cause special complaints.  As for the sensitivity of the sensor, it reacts rather quickly to user commands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 reviews" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/751298.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  On the phones from the Ace line, the South Korean manufacturing company installs rather unusual chips that are not found anywhere else.  This model was no exception.  It is built on the Broadcom BCM-21664 platform.  The processor consists of two cores, each of which operates at a frequency of 1 GHz.  The amount of RAM was 1 GB.  As for the internal drive, its capacity is 4 GB.  As noted above, users can install an additional memory card. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Concerning the performance of the device, there may be a double impression.  The basic parameters and resolution of the display to run videos in Full HD format is not enough.  On the other hand, the interface works without much delay.  There are no problems with scaling pages, as well as scrolling them in an Internet browser.  Even the relatively heavy games launched on the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 smartphone do not ‚Äúslow down‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 Game" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/749996.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with a 1500 mAh battery, borrowed from the previous version.  Its full charge is enough for 4 hours and 20 minutes of playing HD clips with the highest brightness.  This is significantly less compared to the second generation.  According to experts, the increased power consumption is associated with a more powerful processor installed on the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3, as well as with a higher clock speed.  In other words, the device can be called a phone, which must be kept near the outlet.  If you do not use the device intensively, then a full battery charge will last for a whole day, but with active use of the Internet and heavy applications, it will discharge in a few hours. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Model <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Ace 3 is equipped with a main camera with a matrix of five megapixels.  With its capabilities in terms of creating high-quality images, it is not able to surprise.  Photos look about the same as other devices with mid-range cameras.  Macro photography as a whole can be called very good.  Along with this, in the presence of a large number of small-sized objects, problems associated with <span>white balance</span> become apparent <span>.</span>  The device fails to cope with the noise in the pictures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 Specifications" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/749990.jpg" width="588"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  In general, the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 smartphone can be called a typical workhorse with acceptable functionality and cost corresponding to its capabilities.  It is on the ratio of price and quality that the developers of the device made the main emphasis.  As for the main disadvantages, they are not very many.  First of all, they are associated with the familiar design of the device, as well as with the rather quickly dirty materials that make up the case.  This applies to both the display and the back, which are instantly covered with dust. </p>
