  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Android Root App: list, top of the best, developers, features and user reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Root rights in the Android operating system are superuser rights that make it possible to fully control the platform without any restrictions.  The holder of such access gains full control over the system files of the mobile gadget.  Here we have an analog of the developer mode for solving serious problems, only without losing the functionality of the platform. </p><p>  Many, especially inexperienced users, very often ask the question: ‚ÄúHow to get Root rights for Android and what steps should be taken?‚Äù  There are many scenarios for obtaining and using such access, and not all of them benefit your mobile device, especially if you do not fully understand what you are doing and why you need it at all. </p><p>  There are special applications for obtaining Root rights on Android.  On the Internet, there are a lot of them, and beginners just have their eyes flashed, while advanced users have long decided on a list of the most sensible programs.  We will help the first by adopting the experience and feedback of the second. </p><p>  We present to your attention a list of the best applications for obtaining Root rights.  Consider the characteristics, capabilities of the programs and find out what users think about them. </p><h2>  Types of Administrator Rights </h2><p>  Before moving on to the list of applications for obtaining Root-rights, we will understand what they are in general.  Almost all software of such a plan can be divided according to the principle of action into three types: Full, Shell and Temporary. </p><h2>  Full root </h2><p>  Software marked Full Root is an application for obtaining Root rights on Android on an ongoing basis.  Here you have full access to everything and everything on your mobile gadget.  Removing such rights will require additional and consistent steps. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Shell root </h2><p>  Programs from the Shell Root category are also applications for obtaining Root rights on Android, but in this case you will not have access to the system files and the System folder as well.  Removing such rights is noticeably easier than full rooting, but there are still some specific nuances. </p><h2>  Temporary Root </h2><p>  The Temporary Root software is a temporary solution when you need to give Root rights to an Android application for a short time.  After rebooting the mobile device, administrative access disappears, so that there are no problems with the removal. </p><h2>  Top apps </h2><p>  Next, we consider specific programs of such a plan.  You should immediately warn that other applications are responsible for managing administrator rights, and the software described below only allows you to get them or, conversely, remove them.  Vivid examples of programs for managing a rooted device are SuperSu or SuperUser. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jamesnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="android root app" class="if uuid-2932117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2932117.jpg"></div><p>  Top best apps for getting Root rights on Android: </p><ol><li>  KingRoot </li><li>  FramaRoot. </li><li>  360 root. </li><li>  TowelRoot. </li><li>  Root master </li></ol><p>  We will analyze each product in more detail. </p><h2>  Kingroot </h2><p>  This is one of the most popular applications for obtaining Root rights on Android.  Almost all reviews of this program are positive.  Users note that the software is not only easy to manage, but also as efficient as possible.  The developer is the studio of the same name, which still maintains its project up to date and periodically releases updates. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="zidroid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="king root" class="if uuid-2932118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2932118.jpg"></div><p>  The software will help not only grant Root rights to the Android application, but also completely cover the platform with its code, opening up access to all system files and data.  Moreover, judging by the same reviews, it does it correctly and painlessly for the OS. </p><p>  This application for Root rights on Android is suitable for most firmware and mobile gadgets.  The developer provides a list of supported devices and platforms, which include about 10 thousand devices and more than 40 thousand versions of the OS. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kingrootdownload.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="king root application" class="if uuid-2932115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2932115.jpg"></div><p>  The program interface is very simple.  To get administrator rights, just start the application, select the type of rooting and click on the Try to Root button.  The operation takes about five minutes, and the specific speed of the procedure depends on the performance of your device. </p><p>  Removing the program also does not raise serious issues.  To remove administrator rights, just disable them in the program itself by selecting the appropriate item, and after rebooting the device, remove the software in the usual way through the application manager. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Framaroot </h2><p>  Another convenient and fairly popular program for obtaining root rights.  Software is also very popular and has a large number of positive reviews from users.  The developer is an active member of the XDA Developers community of mobile developers under the nickname alephzain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tenorshare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="framaroot application" class="if uuid-2932116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2932116.jpg"></div><p>  The application provides access to administrator rights such as Full and Shell (selected in the settings).  To activate Root, you need to run the executable file with the extension APK directly from your mobile device and agree to the system warning about the possible consequences of platform damage. </p><p>  The program, like the previous software, has an impressive list of compatible gadgets and firmware.  The application interface is simple and intuitive.  After starting, you need to choose which rights you want to get: full or stripped down, and then click on the ‚ÄúForward‚Äù button.  Next, the device should reboot. </p><p>  The execution time of the procedure depends on the performance of your mobile device.  The program is uninstalled in the same way as KingRoot: first we disable administrator rights in the application, reboot the device, and then remove FramaRoot from the dispatcher. </p><p>  Feedback on the program and its effectiveness is mostly positive.  Users liked the simple and intuitive application interface, as well as the quick and hassle-free reception of administrator rights in just a couple of clicks. </p><h2>  360-root </h2><p>  This program attracts users not only with effective work, but also with its simplicity.  In order to enable administrator rights, just click one button and you will have full access to the system files of the Android platform.  The developer is the well-known company Qihoo 360 in its circles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="androidmtk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="360 root" class="if uuid-2932119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2932119.jpg"></div><p>  The application supports about 10 thousand mobile devices: Sony, Lenovo, Samsung, Fly, Xiaomi and models of other brands.  There are also no problems with firmware.  The developer monitors his product and releases updates on time. </p><p>  The program interface is maximally simplified, and even a beginner will understand it.  To get administrator rights, just run the application, after which it will automatically determine the model of your mobile device, the firmware version of the platform and offer the best way to root - full or stripped down (Full / Shell).  You just have to click on the ‚ÄúRoot‚Äù button, and the program will begin the process of obtaining rights. </p><p>  Upon completion of the procedure, your phone will reboot, and you will gain access to the system.  To remove a product and its code, you must first disable root-rights from the program itself, and then remove it from the application manager in the usual way. </p><p>  Users, judging by the reviews, are happy with the software.  The abundance of supported gadget models and firmware allows us to call the program a universal product, and simple, fast, and most importantly - the correct receipt of administrator rights - an effective tool. </p><h2>  TowelRoot </h2><p>  The program allows you to quickly and painlessly obtain administrator rights for your device.  The application was developed by the famous hacker with the nickname Geohot, who was the first to hack the iOS operating system, as well as the Sony Playstation 3 game console. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ijailbreak.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="towelroot app" class="if uuid-2932122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2932122.jpg"></div><p>  The program is designed primarily for such tough nuts from Samsung, like Galaxy S5 and S4, Nexus-5 and Laptop-3.  Owners of these devices very often run into problems of gaining administrator rights.  If the previous solutions do not help, then you should try TowelRoot.  Judging by the reviews, this program helped many.  Other devices can also be rutted, but the local list of supported gadgets is not as impressive as other more universal solutions. </p><p>  The application interface is simple and straightforward.  In addition, the latest versions received Russian-language localization, which greatly simplifies the work with the product.  After installing the application and launching it, a window should appear where the model of your mobile device and the firmware version will be indicated.  By pressing the ‚ÄúMake it ra1n‚Äù key, the rooting procedure will start. </p><p>  The speed of obtaining administrator rights depends on the power of your device.  After the slider reaches 100% in the dialog box, the gadget will reboot, the Root mark will appear in one of the corners (you can disable it in the application settings).  The program is deleted just as easily: we disable the rights in the application itself and after restarting the device we remove the software from the dispatcher. </p><h2>  Root master </h2><p>  This is a one-stop solution from a group of developers from the aforementioned XDA Developers.  The application allows you to obtain administrator rights on devices running the Android platform in the shortest possible time.  The program can work both from a mobile gadget, and from a personal computer via a USB connection. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rootmasterapk.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="root master" class="if uuid-2932121" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2932121.jpg"></div><p>  The application supports more than 10 thousand models of smartphones and tablets.  In the list you can see popular devices from Sony, Lenovo, Huawei, Xiaomi, LG, and even problematic Samsung.  The latter, although in a very limited number, but still some models are supported. </p><p>  Judging by user reviews, managing the program is very simple.  It is enough to start it, select the rooting method from the available options and click on the "Start" button.  If the application was able to determine your device, as well as the firmware version, then there should not be any problems with obtaining administrator rights.  Otherwise, rutting options are limited and do not always work.  But users note that this happens in extremely rare cases and, as a rule, at Samsung. </p><p>  The procedure for obtaining root-rights is quite fast, and after rebooting the device, the application will notify you that the process went as it should, and you are a super-administrator.  Or it will give out logs about failures, if any. </p><p>  The only thing users complain about in their reviews is the procedure for removing this software.  Root Master is good at ‚Äúrooting‚Äù the system, and getting rid of it in the usual way is very problematic.  You have to delete the programs associated with it (for which root-rights were obtained), then disable administrator rights in the settings, reboot several times, and only then the program becomes available for uninstallation in the application manager. </p>
