    <p>  V.K. Blucher - the first Knight of the Order of the Red Star.  The hero of the civil war, who later became a marshal.  He received the award not for past merits, but for very specific actions to protect the CER, which was attacked by the Chaykanshists.  The Order, like the deeds of past years, did not become a defense against the repressions of the late 30s.  Blucher was shot. </p><p>  Silver and enamel became the materials from which the order is made.  In the center is a composition consisting of a figure of a Red Army soldier with a bayonet at the ready in a roundish frame with the motto ‚ÄúWorkers of all countries, unite!‚Äù, USSR inscriptions and the hammer and sickle emblem.  The number of the Order of the Red Star is applied on the back, below the round nut through which it is fastened.  He was awarded not only individual heroes, but also military units, ships and collectives. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The pre-war fate of the Order of the Red Star in general terms corresponds to its purpose.  <span>The conflict on Lake Khasan,</span> Khalkhin-Gol, the successes of Soviet aircraft designers Ilyushin and Tupolev, long-distance record flights, weapons developments by Degtyarev, Tokarev - all that the country was proud of, and that to one degree or another was connected with its protection, was noted by him.  In 1930-1941, "Stars" were awarded to 21,500 people. </p><p>  In 1942, a practice developed that became an unwritten rule, according to which, when manifestation of heroism associated with mortal risk, the Order of the Red Star was awarded.  Awarded soldiers and officers carried it on his chest next to the badge of his bad wound.  In conditions of mass heroism, the <span>mint,</span> on which government awards were made, worked at full capacity, more than 2.8 million copies were issued. </p>

    <p>  Many cavaliers of the Order of the Red Star found out about their awards years and even decades after the victory, performances could be lost, such cases were not uncommon.  In the sixties and seventies, the central newspapers published articles with catchy headlines ‚ÄúThe award found a hero!‚Äù  The "Red Star" was the most massive order in the years of the battle with Nazism. </p><p>  Peacetime was calm not for everyone; there were enough cases to accomplish a feat.  At the beginning of the sixties, a doctor who had a plane crash helped injured passengers, although he himself suffered from injuries sustained when the plane crashed.  Minesmen cleared terrible fields - the legacy of war.  Then there was Afghanistan.  The tasks accomplished by our soldiers in this country were no simpler than those of their grandfathers. </p><p>  After the existence of the USSR, the motto of the Order of the Red Star has lost its relevance, the proletarians are no longer united.  Other awards took his place, but the glory of the heroes who shed blood for their homeland will never be forgotten. </p>
