    <h2>  Location and climate </h2><p>  The village of Nikolaevka is located on the western Black Sea coast, in the <span>Kalamitsky Gulf.</span>  The modern resort is located in the coastal-steppe zone with a mild climate, which has a beneficial effect on the human body. </p><p>  The day breeze, which does not meet forest or mountain barriers, brings the sea coolness and freshness to the steppe, and the night breeze is filled with aromas of flowers and steppe grasses.  Neighborhood with the steppe provides lower humidity than in other resorts of the peninsula.  Many tourists note that rest in Nikolaevka is remembered by the fact that it is very easy to breathe here even in the most intense heat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weekend tours" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1307750.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another indisputable advantage of this village is the absence of seaports and industrial enterprises in the district.  In summer, the weather is dry and hot (+ 27 ° C).  Surprisingly, unlike the southern coast of the peninsula, Nikolaevka does not have a velvet season.  The sea in the second half of September is no longer too comfortable for swimming, although the water warmed up during the summer gives off heat for a long time.  Thanks to this, the winter here is snowless and very mild.  In January, the temperature does not drop below + 2.5 ° C. </p><h2>  Rest in Nikolaevka </h2><p>  Without a doubt, a beach holiday is the main one in this resort village.  The beach here stretches for eight kilometers.  The shore is covered with sand and colorful pebbles.  The sea is shallow with a smooth approach.  It is very convenient for families with small children.  The beach strip continues beyond the territory of Nikolaevka.  In the north-west there is a <span>wild beach,</span> on which there is practically no infrastructure.  South of the pier, on the other side of the village, are the beaches of boarding houses.  And if you walk along the coast for another 300 meters, you can find yourself on a <span>nudist beach.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in Nikolaev" class="if" height="230" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1307747.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Despite its relatively small size, in terms of the number of entertainments, this village is not inferior to the larger and more popular resorts.  In Nikolaevka there is an excellent Luna Park with various attractions for both adults and children, many restaurants, cafes and bars.  Fans of nightlife will not be bored here.  They will always be welcomed at the popular nightclubs “Babylon”, “Sky” and “Baikonur”. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And for younger guests in the village built wonderful playgrounds, trampolines, slides.  Thanks to such a set of entertainment, weekend tours have been actively sold by many agencies to the village. </p><p>  Fans of outdoor activities will also not be disappointed with the trip.  The village has a very decent football field, basketball and volleyball courts, tennis courts.  And, of course, there is a full range of standard beach activities: jet skiing, pills, bananas, parachuting, boat trips and sea fishing.  And if these entertainments do not seem enough to you, then you can go to the “Banana Republic” - one of the <span>largest water parks in Crimea,</span> located 30 km from the village. </p><h2>  Boarding houses </h2><p>  The hotels and pensions located in Nikolaevka are distinguished, first of all, by large well-groomed territories and developed infrastructure.  As a rule, in their territories there are saunas and pools, libraries and concert halls, sports grounds, tennis courts, etc. The following pensions are located in the village: </p><ul><li>  "Radiant". </li><li>  "Power Engineer". </li><li>  Helios. </li><li>  "Solar". </li><li>  "Paradise." </li><li>  "Emerald". </li><li>  "Southern". </li></ul><p>  In addition, there are comfortable hotels and <span>recreation centers.</span>  The latter most often serve weekend tours.  Youth companies that have come for a couple of days to relax from the bustle of the city and stuffiness like to stay here. </p>

    <h2>  Nikolaevka: "South" (boarding house) </h2><p>  It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most popular guesthouse in the village.  It is located in a picturesque park with an area of ​​more than five hectares and is considered one of the best in the south-west of Crimea.  The park was designed by specialists from the <span>Nikitsky Botanical Garden.</span>  I must say that they worked hard for fame - exquisitely designed flower beds, year-round flowering perennial and annual plants - all this pleases the eye. </p><p>  In 2009, a holiday was held in the village of Nikolaevka.  Yuzhny (boarding house) celebrated its thirtieth anniversary.
