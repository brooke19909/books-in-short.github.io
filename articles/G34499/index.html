    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  The complex is located in Strelna.  Since 2003, he was given a new name.  It has become a state complex called the "Palace of Congresses".  <span>The architectural ensemble</span> is located on the rivers Kikenke and Strelka.  From the center of St. Petersburg to the ensemble - only 19 kilometers. </p><h2>  Historical information.  Occurrence </h2><p>  The Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna was built in the XVIII-XIX centuries.  The Russian imperial family owned the estate until 1917.  Peter the Great was her first master.  By the end of the XVIII century, this place turned into private grand-ducal possessions.  Later, by Paul I, the estate was donated to his second son.  The Grand Duke gave her the name that the park and the Grand Palace of Konstantinovsky have preserved to this day. </p><h2>  Further development </h2><p>  The place on which it would be possible to build a ceremonial imperial residence, Peter I watched for a long time.  According to his plan, she was to surpass the famous Versailles.  The monarch made this decision back in 1709.  Later, the project was considered, which was composed by the Roman architect Sebastian Cipriani.  However, it turned out to be quite difficult to execute.  Next, agreements were signed with two famous architects.  One of them was the French master J.-B.  Leblon and the other Bartolomeo Carlo Rastrelli.  The first won the competition for the right to implement the project.  However, Leblon soon died.  Design was left to the architect Nicolo Michetti.  Konstantinovsky Palace became the main part of the whole complex.  It was laid in accordance with the project of the architect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/473239.jpg" width="425"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Difficulty </h2><p>  The aim of the entire project was to surpass all European palace and park ensembles.  For this, it was necessary to establish round-the-clock functioning of fountains and supporting mechanisms.  They had to work continuously for several months.  In this case, in the storage tank it was necessary to maintain an appropriate water level.  Suddenly there were a lot of related problems.  Because of them, the question arose of the advisability of building a residence in Strelna.  The smooth functioning of the fountains required a corresponding rise in water.  This mark was about ten meters above sea level.  Such a decision would inevitably lead to flooding of the basins of two rivers - Kikenki and Strelka.  Also in danger were the territories surrounding them, which were located south of the Peterhof Road.  The total flooding area could be truly huge.  Special <span>hydraulic structures</span> could solve this problem.  However, their cost was too high.  In addition, the continuation of the work was simply inappropriate.  To the west of Strelna was an ideal landscape created by nature itself and capable of providing round-the-clock water supply.  The talented hydraulic engineer B. Minich had to do a tremendous job.  He managed to prove the impossibility of fulfilling the royal plan in this place with the help of his calculations.  As a result, the engineer had to go against the will of the monarch.  The construction was moved to Peterhof.  Only after the death of Paul 1 did all work finally cease here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Petersburg Konstantinovsky Palace" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/473240.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Construction in the second half of the 18th century </h2><p>  The architect Rastrelli became responsible for the reconstruction of the ensemble in 1750.  The palace was redeveloped.  The east wing has acquired a large front staircase.  However, construction work was not completed.  By the end of the century, the estate finally ceased to be considered imperial possessions.  Just at that time, Konstantin Pavlovich (son of Paul 1) became its owner. </p><h2>  Functioning in the 19th Century </h2><p>  Later, the interiors of the palace were redone again.  The interiors were decorated in antique style.  After a fire in 1803, L. Ruska and Voronikhin began to work on the decor of the ensemble.  A superstructure of the belvedere was made.  The front suit appeared in the mezzanine.  The complex boasted rich pictorial decoration.  The masters J. Ferrari and F. A. Shcherbakov were responsible for its creation.  The next reconstruction was already carried out by decree of the new owner.  Konstantin Nikolaevich invited other masters - A.I. Shtakenschneider and H.F. Meyer.  The facades acquired balconies and bay windows.  The design of personal chambers belonged to the eclectic style.  The house church was built right in the palace.  Later, only the family of Konstantin Konstantinovich lived here.  As a rule, she stayed here for the summer and autumn periods.  The actual owner of the ensemble was Dmitry Konstantinovich - brother of Konstantin.  Personal apartments owned by the Greek Queen were also located in this palace.  Olga Konstantinovna lived here after the death of her husband. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Konstantinovsky palace how to get" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/473241.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  The fate of the complex in the XX century </h2><p>  The first Strelninskaya school-colony was located in the palace after the end of the October Revolution.  Later, a sanatorium was opened here.  Then there were organized courses to improve the skills of the Navy.  During the Second World War, the Konstantinovsky Palace was almost destroyed.  All that remains of the ensemble building is a stone skeleton.  Later, the palace was partially restored.  It housed naval departments, radio engineering and geophysical departments, and libraries of the Arctic College.  Later, the last institution was closed.  In the 90s, the complex actually turned into an ownerless structure.  The palace was on the verge of destruction. </p><h2>  Reconstruction work </h2><p>  Later, the palace was under the care of the Office of the President.  The complex includes the palace and the surrounding area.  Its area totaled about one hundred and forty hectares.  After that, large-scale construction and reconstruction works started here.  This was largely facilitated by ancient drawings.  With their help, the interiors of the palace and its facades were restored.  The canal system and the park were also reconstructed.  The main objective of the construction was to ensure state-level receptions.  With the help of the efforts of hydraulic engineers, the channels of reservoirs were deepened.  Now it was possible to receive river vessels and yachts.  Fountains and bridges began to function.  Previously, they existed only in projects.  The complex was equipped with three drawbridges.  The fountains that appeared in the park were conceived by the Emperor himself. </p><h2>  Creation of a "consular village" </h2><p>  It was built near the palace.  The village is located on the shores of the Gulf of Finland.  It consists of twenty two-story cottages.  A hotel called the Baltic Star has opened.  It is a five-star hotel complex, which is stylized as an old Russian manor.  The building of the former yacht club has become a modern press center.  It is equipped with satellite communications.  The administrative building of the complex is located on the site of the former royal stables.  In 2003, the grand opening of the palace took place.  The complex has a tour desk.  It was built in 2006. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Konstantinovsky Palace working hours" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/473242.jpg" width="550"></div>
