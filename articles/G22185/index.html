The name of the state can be translated as "the country of southern Vietnamese", but until 1945 it was called Annam, and its current name was used in the literary language.  Emperor Bao Dai made it official.  Today we offer you a virtual excursion to the most developed and popular resort of the country, a place that has many opportunities for great relaxation and various entertainment - the city of Nha Trang, located in the south of Vietnam. </p><p>  We invite everyone who has been to this resort to join our conversation and in the comments to the article to tell about their impressions of the city, which has changed over the past years: many hotels, bars and cafes have appeared there, and the resort's popularity is growing every year. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.2387911" data-lng="109.19674880000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/2/1/9/17219.png"></div><h2>  Nha Trang Areas </h2><p>  The city is conditionally divided into three areas: </p><ol><li>  South. </li><li>  Central. </li><li>  Northern. </li></ol><p>  Next, we briefly talk about each of them. </p><h2>  Southern District </h2><p>  It is a 30-minute drive from Cam Ranh Airport and the pier, from which water excursions depart daily.  There is also a cable car to VinPearl.  The area is calm and quiet, despite the fact that there are noisy discos in Central Park.  Here are concentrated a lot of small budget hotels, cafes.  One of the most popular is the cafe in Central Park - Louisiana. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="exclusives.webjet.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City districts" class="if uuid-3211353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3211353.jpg"></div><p>  Of the attractions located in this part of the city, many tourists recommend visiting: </p><ul><li>  Central park. </li><li>  Bao Dai Villas. </li><li>  Museum of Oceanography. </li></ul><p>  If you were impressed by any interesting place, advise it to travelers going to Nha Trang for the first time. </p><h2>  central District </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, the busiest place in Nha Trang.  The European quarter, which among our compatriots is known as Russian, in which the number of bars, cafes, shops and restaurants per square meter just rolls over, is located here. </p><p>  In the Central District it is crowded and noisy, there are many tourists from Russia, there is always where to go - everything is within walking distance: minimarkets and fruit shops, night markets.  In this area there are many hotels of different levels of comfort, including chain hotels - Best Western, Sheraton, Novotel and others.

The area is calm, somewhat remote from the center.  If every day you plan to ride a taxi, then living here is expensive.  The sea in the bay is very calm, and the beach admires the cleanliness.  There are not too many hotels here, usually houses are rented in this area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  European Quarter in Nha Trang </h2><p>  First, let's figure out where it is.  The fact is that in this city there is no line of demarcation of areas.  However, the first three lines from the famous Lotus located on the embankment are conditionally attributed to this section.  The European quarter in Nha Trang got its name due to the fact that tourists with a European appearance like to relax here: Americans, Slavs, Europeans.  The reference points are the first, second and third lines of the European quarter. </p><p>  On the opposite side of the European quarter of Nha Trang is a wonderful green square with gazebos, exercise machines and benches.  On the seashore, one of the most popular restaurants in the city - Sailing Club Bar.  The local beach is wide and clean, but the closer to the Lotus Tower, the more noisy and crowded it becomes. </p><h2>  What to see in Nha Trang on your own? </h2><p>  This city has many architectural and historical attractions.  Many of them can be examined on their own, as they are located within walking distance.  Let us introduce you some of them. </p><h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  Built at the beginning of the last century, the temple is made in the Gothic style, familiar to Europeans.

The height of the cathedral, where today the residence of the ruling bishop is located, is almost 40 meters.  Its windows are decorated with magnificent stained-glass windows of colored transparent glass.  They fill the building with bright sunlight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.vietnam-guide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang Cathedral" class="if uuid-3211390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3211390.jpg"></div><p>  Three large bells, which were cast by local craftsmen from copper, were installed on the tower two years after the completion of construction.
