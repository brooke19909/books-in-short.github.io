Abkhazia, Gudauta - reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Going on vacation to Gudauta, many expect to visit a city of European type.  But Abkhazia is unique and original, the atmosphere here is completely different.  This city is especially interesting for those who want to communicate with nature.  It is small and compact, the local population does not live as much as in neighboring Sukhum.  If you love solitude, then Abkhazia opens the doors for you.  Gudauta is a resort where even in the season there are few vacationers, so the beach is always free and there is no annoying city bustle. </p><h2>  Gudauta History </h2><p>  It goes back centuries, since the first settlements on this fertile land belong to the Neolithic period.  Since then, they have grown, developed and strengthened.  Medieval times became the heyday of the city; it was a large trading port.  Then, for unknown reasons, he was abandoned.  New settlements in the 19th century were subjected to constant raids by Turkish soldiers, so it re-flourished and received the status of the resort town of Gudauta in the 20th century, namely in 1926. </p>

    <h2>  City location </h2><p>  Photos taken from above demonstrate the beauty of the bay, surrounded by woodland.  It is this climatic resort that Abkhazia is famous for.  Gudauta once had the status of an all-Union health resort.  When entering a city, tourists first of all note its special comfort, cleanliness and neatness.  It is very quiet, but if you quickly get tired of the calm environment, you can visit the neighboring Gagra or Sukhum.  By the way, unlike them, the air temperature in Gudauta is almost always several degrees lower. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Lost here is almost impossible, the whole city is built wonderfully linearly, as if broken into squares.  The streets are quiet, almost deserted, lie strictly parallel to each other or intersect at right angles.  The population of the city is only 8,000 people.  There are few apartment buildings, mainly houses and cottages are represented here.  If you want to save on vacation, then you have come to the right place, Gudauta (Abkhazia) will provide you such an opportunity.  The private sector is a place where you can cheaply rent a bed, room or the whole house. </p>

    <h2>  Urban transport </h2><p>  He is not here at all.  The whole city can be walked around, as well as getting to the sea.  But a taxi service is developed, and land, air or <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãtransport</span> of your choice can offer it.  Intercity minibuses stop outside the city and will be taken to any neighboring settlement.  You can save money if you bargain for the fare, drivers usually do not have a fixed rate. </p><h2>  Resort area </h2><p>  The city owes its status of a recreation center to a mild subtropical climate.  Hospitable Abkhazia awaits its tourists all year round.  Gudauta is famous for its mild, temperate climate.  In summer, the air temperature does not rise above 28 degrees, and after short <span>autumn rains there</span> comes a time of dry and reasonably warm winters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Without exception, tourists admire the nature of these places.  Tender vegetation from cold winds is protected by the northern mountain range of the Caucasus Range.  This formidable ridge is admirable; it is located only 15 km from the village.  Almost 7 months of the year its snow-white peaks sparkle in the sun.  Real Alps, if you forget that Abkhazia stretches before you.  Gudauta is famous for its parks that deserve to compete with the Sochi Arboretum. </p>

    <p>  October is rather boring here.  This is a period of gray, cool rains, so it‚Äôs better to reschedule the trip.  Already in November, warm and snowless weather has been established.  At a temperature of +10 degrees, it‚Äôs good to wander around the surroundings, admire the natural beauties of these places.  But March and April are not so favorable, at this time cool winds often blow, and in general it is uncomfortable on the street.  At any time of the year, nature is beautiful in its own way, this is the uniqueness of the Gudauta resort.  Abkhazia, reviews of which are always saturated with warmth, is a welcoming hostess, she meets each guest as the dearest and closest. </p><h2>  The best hotels for tourists </h2><p>  A trip to the sea is always a costly event, so it is logical to want to rent decent housing at the lowest possible price.  In this regard, the attitude of the population of the city of Gudauta (Abkhazia) towards tourists is always surprising.  The private sector provides vacationers with separate rooms or whole houses.  If you are resting alone, then for a modest fee you can rent a bed in the house with the owners.  This is a chance to get to a family dinner and taste delicious local dishes. </p>
