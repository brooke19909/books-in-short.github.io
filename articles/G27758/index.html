    <p>  So, how does the Aquarium in Murmansk.  5 days a week.  The weekend here is non-standard - this is Monday and Tuesday.  These days you will not be able to see the performances of marine artists, they relax and rehearse new programs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On all other days, three performances were prepared for the audience.  The first (at 11 am) - for those who are not too lazy to get up early.  Then immediately after lunch (at 15 hours) and the final - at 17 hours. </p><p>  An adult ticket will cost 500 rubles, a child will cost 100 rubles cheaper.  Kids up to 3 years old can get to the show absolutely free. </p><h2>  History of the Aquarium </h2><p>  The oceanarium opened its doors in 1984 for the first time.  Murmansk at that time was still not as popular with tourists as it is today.  The city was just starting to attract visitors from all over the globe. </p><p>  It all started with the opening of a unique laboratory for the study of marine mammals.  The results of the work of scientists shocked everyone - it turned out that Arctic seals can be taught circus numbers.  After that, hard work with coaches began. </p><p>  In 1992, the first Arctic performance of trained seals took place.  Then it took place under the open sky on Semenovsky Lake.  Such entertainment in Murmansk was still new. </p><p>  Naturally, such a complex could not work all year round, so the question arose about the construction of a stationary building.  Its construction began in 1995.  A year later, on the anniversary of the 80th anniversary of the city, the oceanarium first opened its doors.  Murmansk has become a city in which circus seals can be seen year-round. </p><h2>  The uniqueness of the aquarium </h2>

To learn all the secrets of these marine mammals failed so far. </p><p>  Another of the main activities of this institution is conducting educational tours for children and adolescents.  From the age of 4, children are shown educational films about the harsh nature of the Arctic, and a special program from first to eleventh grade has been developed for schoolchildren. </p><p>  Teachers and researchers of the Pedagogical University are constantly developing new educational programs for students of different ages.  Including - for children with disabilities. </p><p>  And those who are imbued with sincere love for these animals are recorded in the Kitten Club.  In it, schoolchildren prepare to participate in scientific and practical conferences, develop their own projects and scientific works, and are engaged in research.  You can get to classes both in an organized group and individually.  It all depends on the subscription you purchased. </p><h2>  "Do not spill water" </h2>

It has become a tradition for many young families to call here on the way from the registry office to a restaurant.  After all, these are unforgettable impressions with which their happy family life begins.

    <p>  Newlyweds can not only order a photo session with Arctic marine animals, but also register a marriage in the oceanarium.  The program has been running for almost 10 years.  Over the years, more than fifty pairs have taken advantage of this unique opportunity. </p><p>  The main marriage manager is the star of the oceanarium - Philip.  This is a gray seal about 2 and a half meters long.  He was born under the happy North Star, so he now transfers his luck to every couple of newlyweds. </p><p>  In addition to registering marriage, seals organize circus performances for guests, give young people a special gift and a special certificate. </p>
