Tariffs increased by 40%.  How much now will drivers have to pay for the insurance policy? </p><h2>  Legislative changes </h2><p>  Currency devaluation, increase in the maximum payment limit, loss-making segment of the auto citizen in the insurance market - all these reasons led to higher tariffs and the expansion of the payment corridor in 2015. </p><p>  The territory insurance coefficient has been increased for 11 regions of the Russian Federation and has been reduced for the same number.  The maximum growth of indicators of 25% is provided for Chuvashia, Voronezh, Kurgan regions.  In the Magadan district, tariffs will decrease by 41%.  In Dagestan, Tuva, Ingushetia, Chechnya and the Leningrad Region, the compulsory motor liability insurance ratio for the regions decreased. </p>

According to the data received, in some regions it was necessary to increase the tariff for public <span>modes of transport by</span> more than 400%.  The real change was 100%.  The market has been waiting for an adequate increase in tariffs for several years.  According to the SAR, it will now be possible to improve the quality of protection and balance interests. </p><p>  Additionally, a new system has been introduced to receive quick payments for the very fact of damage to the life and health of the victim.

    <h2>  How is the cost calculated </h2><p>  The formula is quite simple: CTP <span>insurance ratios are</span> multiplied with the base rate.  But both values ‚Äã‚Äãdepend on a number of factors: the length of service of the driver, the region where the car was located, the state of the vehicle, etc. The usual calculation formula looks like this: </p><p>  Policy = BT x CT x BM x FAC x OK x KM x S x KN x P, where: </p><ul><li>  BT - basic rate. </li><li>  CT - territorial coefficient of compulsory motor liability insurance. </li><li>  PIC - an indicator of age / length of service. </li><li>  BM is a bonus malus. </li><li>  OK is a limiting indicator. </li><li>  KM - engine power. </li><li>  C is seasonality. </li><li>  KN - coefficient of violations. </li><li>  P - an indicator of the term of insurance. </li></ul><p>  The policy will be most expensive for young people who drive powerful cars in large cities.  The cost of experienced drivers with a trouble-free driving experience of more than 10 years will be minimal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Base rate </h2><p>  The cost of the insurance policy varies by region.  For each type of transport, depending on the number of seats and tonnage, its own tariff is set.  For car owners, it is divided by belonging to an individual or legal entity.  It has not changed since 2004.  For contracts concluded after April 1, 2015, the following OSAGO insurance tariff coefficients will be used: </p><p>  Motorcycles and scooters - 1507 rubles. </p><p>  Cars: </p><ul><li>  legal entities - 2945 rubles; </li><li>  individuals, FE - 2455 rubles. </li></ul><p>  Cars used as taxis - 3677 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Osago new odds" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/821834.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The largest coefficient of OSAGO territory is used in megacities with active traffic and a high concentration of traffic accidents (Kazan, Perm, Yakutsk, Chelyabinsk).  For powerful cars, high rates are additionally calculated.  Therefore, it is better for vehicle owners to register an SUV or truck for a relative living in the region.  The new OSAGO ratios for 2015 are presented in the table below.  For 11 districts, indicators were increased, and for the rest, they were reduced.  In Moscow, the value of the indicator remained the same. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  <em>Region</em> </p></td><td><p>  <em>CTP - new odds</em> </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Leningrad Region, Kamchatka Territory, <br>  Adygea </p></td><td><p>  1.3 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Republic of Tuva, Chechen Republic, <br>  Jewish Autonomous Region, Baikonur </p></td><td><p>  0.6 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Trans-Baikal Territory, Magadan Region, <br>  Dagestan </p></td><td><p>  0.6-0.7 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Ingushetia </p></td><td><p>  0.6-0.8 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Saha Republic </p></td><td><p>  0.6-1.2 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Murmansk region </p></td><td><p>  1.2-2.1 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Mordovia </p></td><td><p>  0.8-1.5 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Amurskaya Oblast </p></td><td><p>  1-1.6 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Voronezh region </p></td><td><p>  0.5-1.1 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Ulyanovsk region </p></td><td><p>  0.9-1.5 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Chuvashia </p></td><td><p>  0.8-1.7 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Kurgan region </p></td><td><p>  0.6-1.4 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Chelyabinsk region </p></td><td><p>  1-2,1 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Mari El Republic </p></td><td><p>  0.7-1 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Bonus malus </h2><p>  Otherwise, this indicator is called a trouble-free ride discount.  It can significantly affect the cost of the policy.  This coefficient is assigned on the basis of data on the presence / absence of payments to a specific driver, not a car.  So the replacement of a vehicle or an insurance company does not affect the change in this indicator.  The class is updated one year after the conclusion of the contract.  OSAGO ratios are calculated according to the data of previous policies, if the break between the contracts was no more than 12 months.  Otherwise, the car owner is assigned a basic third class. </p><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  If over the past period the driver became the culprit of the accident, then the <span>increased</span> OSAGO <span>ratios</span> are applied to him.  A new policy will cost 50% more.  For a trouble-free year, the client receives a 5% discount.  If the policy is issued for the first time, then the value of the indicator is 1. The maximum discount is 50%.  If several drivers are entered in the policy (for example, the father draws up documents for his son), and one of them has recently <span>received a license,</span> then the indicator is calculated at the minimum rate.  Thus, the cost of the CTP policy is changing. </p>

    <p>  New BM coefficients determine the driver class.  If, for example, a person had 5th grade with an indicator value of 0.9, and then an accident occurred through his fault, then next year the discount will decrease to 5% and the rating to 3. If the next 12 months go by without a break, then the driver expects a higher 6th level. </p><h2>  Receiving the information </h2><p>  The bonus-malus is formed on the basis of the history of insured events.  To track them, in 2013 a special SAR base was created.  Each insurer transfers the data to the regulator within 15 days after signing the contract. </p><h2>  Age / experience </h2><p>  The more experience a driver has gained, the lower the value of this indicator will be.  But there are two important figures: the age of the driver (22 years) and 36 months of driving.  In this case, the value of the indicator will be the highest - 1.8.  If there are several drivers, then the maximum value of the indicator is taken into account. </p>

    <h2>  OSAGO limiting factors (2014) </h2><p>  You can include several drivers in the insurance.  If in the policy they will be indicated by name, then their number does not matter (2 or 5).  The coefficient of this will not change.  But if the driver cannot exactly say who else will use the car, but admits such an opportunity, then the value of 1.8 is applied. </p><h2>  Seasonality </h2><p>  Many drivers use the vehicle only in the summer, and leave it in the garage for the winter.  Or operate the car during long business trips.  In such cases, a seasonal policy is issued for any period of 3 months.  The value of the indicator, equal to one, begins with 10 months of operation.  With a shorter period, you can count on a small discount. </p><h2>  Violation rate </h2><p>  It is used in such cases: </p><ul><li>  the provision of false information; </li><li>  drunk driving; </li><li>  intentional provocation of an accident; </li><li>  departure from the scene; </li><li>  driving a person who is not included in the policy. </li></ul><h2>  Indicators of insurance period and engine power </h2><p>  The first varies from 0.2 to 1 and is used only for foreigners or if the car is in transit.  Engine power can be viewed in the TCP.  This ratio is calculated based on horsepower.  If kilowatts are indicated in the documents, the conversion is as follows: 1 kW = 1.359 liters.  from. </p>

    <h2>  Cars with a trailer </h2><p>  For such vehicles, a separate tariff is now not provided.  But a special coefficient has been developed, which depends on the type of trailer: from 1.15 to 1.45. </p><h2>  From scratch </h2><p>  The insurance history is started for a person who has rights and controls the vehicle.  But the data is reset, if within 12 months the driver has not been entered in any insurance policy.  Example: not the owner of the vehicle may ask the owner of the car to conclude a contract without specifying the persons authorized to drive.  After 12 months, his story will be reset to zero, it will be possible to independently sign a policy.  Vehicle owners will have to first reissue documents for a relative, and then travel by proxy. </p><h2>  Other changes </h2><p>  The opportunity to conclude a contract for a period of less than one year is now absent.  Such a need may arise, for example, if a car is purchased in one region, and the driver wants to register it in another.  Previously, for such purposes, a policy was bought for several days.  Now, such insurance can be issued only for foreign cars.  Therefore, the warriors can only conclude seasonal contracts.  For owners of vehicles on gas equipment there is a 15% discount. </p><h2>  The base cost of policies in major cities of Russia </h2><p>  As an example, we take the maximum tariff data for a driver of 23 years with a vehicle management experience of more than three years, which has a car with an engine capacity of 70-100 liters.  from. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  <em>Town</em> </p></td><td><p>  <em>Old price (rub.)</em> </p></td><td width="128"><p>  <em>New price (rub.)</em> </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Vladivostok </p></td><td><p>  3964 </p></td><td width="128"><p>  6342 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Khabarovsk </p></td><td><p>  4814 </p></td><td width="128"><p>  7701 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Irkutsk </p></td><td><p>  4814 </p></td><td width="128"><p>  7701 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Krasnoyarsk </p></td><td><p>  5097 </p></td><td width="128"><p>  8154 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Novosibirsk </p></td><td><p>  4814 </p></td><td width="128"><p>  7701 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Ekaterinburg </p></td><td><p>  5097 </p></td><td width="128"><p>  8154 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Chelyabinsk </p></td><td><p>  5663 </p></td><td width="128"><p>  9513 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Moscow </p></td><td><p>  5663 </p></td><td width="128"><p>  9060 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Krasnodar </p></td><td><p>  5097 </p></td><td width="128"><p>  8154 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In April 2015, the Bank of Russia changed the OSAGO ratio by region and base rates.  Innovations will be justified by the growth of the maximum amount of payments and the <span>economic crisis</span> in the country.  In general, tariff growth amounted to 40-60%.  The coefficients of territorial affiliation have changed only in 11 regions.  Base rates have also not increased in all areas.  A new coefficient has appeared for cars with a trailer.  It is possible to take out insurance for several months for vehicles registered in the Russian Federation only seasonally. </p>
