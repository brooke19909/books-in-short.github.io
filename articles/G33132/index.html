However, it is often not possible to purchase the necessary element of decor.  In most cases, customers simply cannot find the most suitable model.  And if it does come across, the cost may turn out to be too high and you have to refuse the purchase. </p><p>  Experienced needlewomen are convinced that beginners can make any kind of product.  The main thing is to follow the instructions.  In the presented article, we will study the technology for making covers on a corner sofa with our own hands.  Consider both simple options and more complex ones. </p><h2>  Necessary materials and tools </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="covers for a corner sofa master class" class="if uuid-3023809" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3023809.jpg"></div><p>  To realize your idea, you need to prepare well.  Better to start by choosing the fabric that will be used to create the idea.  Professional seamstresses note that it is much easier to work with knitted material.  Especially if the sofa has an uneven back.  Although novice masters can choose a different option.  But at the same time, you need to be prepared for the fact that you will have to work hard on the work.  Also, the following tools will be required for creativity: </p><ul><li>  large tailor's scissors; </li><li>  piece of chalk; </li><li>  tape measure; </li><li>  special pins; </li><li>  piece of paper and pen. </li></ul><h2>  Measurement Technology </h2><p>  Obviously, the easiest way to do it yourself is the covers on the corner sofa, which consists of even rectangles and squares.  If the studied interior item is decorated with a carved back, you should not be upset.  You just need to use any stretching material.  But in any case, you should first measure the sofa.  To think through the work, build a pattern and sew a beautiful cover, you need to find out the following parameters: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  sofa height; </li><li>  the length of each back is from the corner to the armrest; </li><li>  the width of each back is from the highest point to the seat; </li><li>  the length, width and height of each seat. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself corner sofa covers" class="if uuid-3022492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3022492.jpg"></div><p>  When cutting a cover on a corner sofa with your own hands, it is important to consider that the length of the backrest of interest is not equal to the length of the corresponding seat.  And the difference between the first and second parameters will help to draw a diagonal - the junction of the two parts of the corner sofa.  But more on that later. </p><h2>  Cape Cover </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen advise masters who are just beginning to master the technology, not to tackle complex products.  The first step is to make a cover that looks more like a cloak.  For its implementation, you can prepare any fabric, even more dense.  But you should remember that you will have to flash it.  And the thicker the material, the harder it will be.  In any case, the first thing to do is to prepare the fabric and build a pattern on it according to the image proposed below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="simple sofa covers" class="if uuid-3022514" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3022514.jpg"></div><p>  However, it should first be adjusted taking into account the size of its interior.  It is also worth noting when it is possible to cut a cover on a corner sofa with one's own hands, its edges can be carefully wrapped, framed with a satin ribbon or tied with a hook.  Each needlewoman should choose the most preferred option on her own. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to make a one-piece case </h2><p>  If the reader decides to carry out this version of the studied product, it is immediately worth preparing for the fact that he will have to tinker with it.  Especially at the stage of cutting parts.  However, you should not be afraid, the technology is quite accessible even for novice masters.  After all, further we will explain in detail how to make a cover pattern on a corner sofa with our own hands: </p><ol><li>  We are preparing a piece of fabric whose width is equal to the sum of the following parameters: sofa height + back width + seat length + seat height.  And the length is the sum of the lengths of both backs + two heights of the sofa. </li><li>  We spread the prepared piece of material. </li><li>  Using a centimeter tape and chalk, mark the indicated points. </li><li>  Then add the length of each seat. </li><li>  Lower two vertical lines to the bottom edge of the canvas. </li><li>  We draw the diagonals from the end of each horizontal segment to the junction of two backs. </li><li>  Thus, we manage to outline the "house", which should be cut.  In the diagram, it is grayed out. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="covers on a corner sofa pattern" class="if uuid-3023446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3023446.jpg"></div><h2>  Assembly of a one-piece cover </h2><p>  Having prepared the part of the right size, we proceed to stitching.  To do this, use a machine or work manually using a needle and thread.  Our task is to connect the two parts of the seat box together, sewing the sides that formed after cutting out the excess ‚Äúhouse‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the diagram, the junction is indicated by a red zigzag line.  Next, fold the canvas, separating the main part of the sofa from the backs.  Fold points are indicated by green zigzag lines.  As you can see, it‚Äôs much easier to sew a cover on a corner sofa with your own hands than to cut it.  However, we have not finished our work.  We folded the canvas, as a result of which we were able to form two backs.  Now you should flash them in zigzag lines marked in blue on the diagram. </p><p>  At this stage, it is safe to say that the bulk of the work is behind.  In fact, we have already managed to make a cover on the corner sofa.  But in order for him not to slip when sitting, it should be supplemented with an elastic band, which must be sewn along the entire lower edge of the resulting frame. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="corner sofa covers" class="if uuid-3022475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3022475.jpg"></div><h2>  Pattern of a stylish cover with a frill </h2><p>  To reveal this version of the product is no more difficult than the previous one.  But it is important to understand that in this case, the work involves slightly different actions.  Experienced needlewomen say that readers who get tired of a one-piece case sewn according to the previously studied instructions can easily turn it into a stylish model with a frill.  To do this, simply determine the length of the frill, and then cut off the strip of the desired width along the lower edge. </p><p>  If you have to cut a cover on the corner sofa with your own hands, the photo scheme proposed above should be slightly adjusted.  However, it is important to consider that a smaller rectangle is required to implement the idea.  That is, its width will be less than the sum of the following parameters: sofa height + backrest width + seat length + seat height.  The difference will be as much as the length of the frill is conceived.  Accordingly, the length will also decrease: (the sum of the lengths of both backs + two sofa heights) - the length of the frill. </p><p>  After making simple calculations, we go to the store and buy the desired segment.  It is also important not to forget about the frill.  Traditionally, it is made of cotton.  Less commonly used light and airy fabric.  For example, organza.  But in this case, you need to make a multilayer frill so that you do not see the worn sofa.  It is also important to consider that the length of the frill should be one and a half to two times longer than the length of the lower edge, because this part will be wavy, and this can only be achieved if more material is used. </p><h2>  Assembly of a cover with a frill </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="covers for corner sofa with frill" class="if uuid-3023374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3023374.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, you can make any options for covers on the corner sofa with your own hands.  The photos proposed in the article demonstrate that it is best to use any stretching fabric to create this thing.  Mostly knitted.  A ruffled cover is sewn as well as a one-piece one.  And then a frill is sewn along the bottom edge.  Moreover, experienced needlewomen are advised to attach it to the gum first.  This will create a neat and smooth "wave".  It is also worth processing the bottom edge of the frill so that it does not crumble, and the product looked more presentable and expensive.  If desired, it can be decorated with a satin ribbon of a suitable color. </p><h2>  Pattern cover on the corner sofa and chair </h2><p>  Many beginning needlewomen do not dare to give new life to the shabby interior items, because they are afraid to not cope with the task.  The technology of <span>sewing a cover</span> on a sofa, we disassembled.  We hope that it will help readers create a really beautiful and original thing that will decorate any room.  But the method of sewing a chair cover has not yet been studied.  But professional craftswomen like to joke that those who managed to successfully cope with the cover on the corner sofa, cutting and sewing a similar product on the chair will seem like a real fairy tale. </p><p>  According to reviews of covers on a corner sofa (photos of the best options are presented in the article), if you delve into the process, this statement can be considered justified.  Because the chair, like a regular sofa, does not have a difficult angle.  This means that it does not require constructing a pattern taking into account this detail.  Thus, we need a rectangle whose width is: chair height + back width + seat length + seat height.  And the length is the length of a single backrest + two chair heights.  Similarly, the size of the rectangle required to sew a cover on a regular sofa is calculated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="covers for corner sofa and chair" class="if uuid-3023501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3023501.jpg"></div><h2>  Assembling the cover on a chair or ordinary sofa </h2><p>  It is important to note that, in contrast to the self-made pattern of the cover on the corner sofa, the photo of which we examined in one of the following paragraphs, this option does not involve cutting out excess detail.  We only need to fold the canvas, departing from each edge of the height of the chair.  In the diagram, the folds are marked with a green zigzag line.  And then, having selected the armrests, stitch the sides marked in blue. </p><p>  As you can see, the technology is quite simple and affordable for beginners.  Therefore, professional needlewomen recommend starting with sewing a chair cover, and then switch to a more complex version of the product under study for a corner sofa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.maxicovers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="corner sofa covers step by step" class="if uuid-3023788" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3023788.jpg"></div><p>  In the article we presented a photo of beautiful covers on the corner sofa.  Novelty will undoubtedly decorate any interior and will demonstrate the taste and skill of households. </p>
