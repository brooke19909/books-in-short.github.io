  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tape recorder: review, specifications, models and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Although now the age of computers (and the corresponding computer acoustics) has come, there are still people who need standard tape recorders (boomboxes and others like them).  But now the consumer wants an all-in-one device.  That is, a tape recorder with a USB flash drive, a CD player, a tuner and more.  The modern market for such devices is no longer as rich as in the 90s or early 2000s, but even now very interesting models can be found.  The main thing is to understand what exactly is needed, and then just choose.  We will consider the most interesting and popular models.  But first, some general information. </p><h2>  Why do we need a radio tape recorder? </h2><p>  The answer to this question cannot be in one sentence.  The fact is that the main advantage of such tape recorders is compactness and mobility.  Not everyone will pull out a laptop with speakers on nature.  Yes, and the laptop will not work for a long time.  But the tape recorder with a USB flash drive is quite capable of working for 5-8 hours on battery power.  At the same time, such devices manage to provide fairly high-quality sound.  This fact is generally incomprehensible.  How can plastic ‚Äúit is not clear what‚Äù provide high-quality sound, being in the same case with a distortion source (amplifier)?  But the sound is surprisingly high quality.  Of course, much depends on the specific model and manufacturer.  But as a rule, such devices are not particularly different in terms of sound quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.soundspare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tape recorder" class="if uuid-2360385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2360385.jpg"></div><p>  Also, many users consider the all-in-one system a plus.  That is, there is no need to purchase a separate amplifier, speaker system, radio tuner, etc.  With a strong desire, you can even connect such a device to a computer.  But there will be little use for this.  A tape recorder with disks and a flash drive is still relevant only because of its mobility and compactness.  If these two advantages were not there, this device would have sunk into oblivion, like the notorious cassette decks, music centers and other ‚Äúvintage‚Äù audio equipment.  Since now the era of "numbers" has come.  And those who want to get high-quality sound, choose kits from receivers and speakers.  However, we were distracted.  Consider the most interesting models of radio tape recorders. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  BBK BS01 </h2><p>  This portable speaker system cannot please the user with a variety of playback sources.  Her kit includes only the ability to play songs from a flash drive.  Moreover, the device supports both USB-drives and micro SD cards.  The radio tape recorder can play MP3 and WMA formats.  She is not capable of more.  But there is an audio input through which you can connect any sound source (including a smartphone) to the device.  The rated output power of the speakers is 4.5 watts.  But we all know what these watts really are.  Well, if it will be one and a half.  The speaker design is single-band.  So to hear well-traced high frequencies (as, however, and low) will not succeed.  The sound will resemble porridge.  The only plus is the low price.  This is the most budget tape recorder with a flash drive for the home.  It will cost about 1,200 Russian rubles.  Cheaper only for nothing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bbk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tape recorder with disks and flash drive" class="if uuid-2360389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2360389.jpg"></div><h2>  Telefunken TF-CSRP3481 </h2><p>  The device is a bit from a different category.  This tape recorder with a flash drive has a wider functionality.  As sources of playback used flash drives, CDs and radio tuner.  The device can play MP3, WMA and Audio CD.  The tape recorder has an interesting design.  It can also work both from an electric network, and from batteries.  However, one cannot expect unrealistic power from it.  The manufacturer declared output power is only 3 watts.  This is catastrophically small.  Nevertheless, Telefunken perfectly shows itself in travels.  It is lightweight, compact and easy to use.  The radio also has an analog audio input.  With the help of a simple adapter, you can connect any playback source to it.  Also a plus can be considered the low cost of the product - about 3000 Russian rubles.  Buying this radio will not break a perceptible gap in the family budget. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="market.yandex.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the tape recorder does not read the flash drive" class="if uuid-2360400" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2360400.jpg"></div><h2>  Sony ZS-PS50 Black </h2><p>  This tape recorder for a flash drive is already much more serious than the two previous models.  This device has a rated output power of 4 watts, can operate both from an electric network and from batteries, and is capable of reproducing compositions from various sources.  This radio comes with a CD player, radio tuner, memory card slots and USB drives.  There is also an analog audio input for connecting playback sources.  There is a headphone jack.  But the most valuable thing is that the radio is equipped with a Bluetooth adapter and an NFC sensor.  This allows you to directly play music from the user's smartphone.  The radio supports MP3, WMA and CDDA formats.  The device is equipped with two single-band speakers.  There is also an LCD display to display track information.  But the device does not know how to display the Cyrillic alphabet.  Of course, the price for this device is appropriate - already 4,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.carrefouruae.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tape recorder for home" class="if uuid-2360402" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2360402.jpg"></div><h2>  Panasonic RX-D55EE-K </h2><p>  This company probably has the most expensive tape recorders with a flash drive.  The price of the Panasonic radio is not democratic - from 9,200 rubles for the mentioned model.  But there is something to give such money for.  The device has a total output power of 20 watts and is equipped with two two-way speakers.  The radio is capable of running on batteries, but it feels great when connected to the network.  There is a digital tuner, a CD player, a connector for a USB drive and (which is absolutely unbelievable) a device for playing audio tapes.  The same ones.  Originally from the 90s.  There is also a good LCD display with full Cyrillic support.  And the case materials themselves clearly make it clear that we have a serious device from a renowned manufacturer.  There is an analog audio input and headphone output.  There are no such fashionable things as Bluetooth and NFC, but they are not needed.  In fact, this is the best tape recorder for the home that you can imagine: it is lightweight, compact, easy to operate and capable of playing music from almost any source. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="kupi.tut.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tape recorder and flash drive" class="if uuid-2360407" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2360407.jpg"></div><h2>  Mystery BM-6109U </h2><p>  The company "Mystery" is well known in Russian open spaces.  And she produces pretty high-quality products.  "Chip" radio from this manufacturer - ease of operation.  That is why you can consider these products as a "children's" tape recorder with a flash drive.  Indeed, even a child will deal with the management of the Mystery, despite its ‚Äúfrightening‚Äù appearance.  This is all excess design.  The radio is equipped with a CD player, support for USB-drives, a tuner and other necessary attributes.  There is support for battery operation and a high-quality (and informative) screen.  The output power of the device is 9 watts.  For use within the standard room is enough.  The materials of the case did not raise questions.  High quality plastic is used.  Everything is done soundly.  Nothing creaks anywhere, does not play and does not fall off.  Very high quality tape recorder.  And it‚Äôs not as expensive as the previous one.  Only 2,500 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="children tape recorder with flash drive" class="if uuid-2360420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2360420.jpg"></div><h2>  Supra BB-47MUSB </h2><p>  It is also one of the most affordable options.  Its price is 1300 rubles.  A tape recorder from a Supra flash drive is capable of playing MP3s and WMAs from memory cards and USB drives.  Also, a tuner is built into the radio.  But that‚Äôs all: no CD support, no cassette player, no Bluetooth.  But that's okay.  But there is a high-quality screen, ease of navigation and control and an analog input for connecting any device.  The radio can work both from an electric network, and from batteries.  The total output power of the device is only 3 watts.  The device is equipped with two single-band speakers.  The radio tape recorder can be successfully used to sound a small room.  Also, this tape recorder is very good for various trips.  As they say, expensive and cheerful.  But why overpay for unnecessary options? </p><div class="photo" data-original="bigi.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tape recorders in a car with a flash drive" class="if uuid-2360426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2360426.jpg"></div><h2>  If the tape recorder does not detect the USB flash drive </h2><p>  And that happens.  If the tape recorder does not see the flash drive, then this can be several explanations.  First (and simplest): the flash drive has an inappropriate file system.  The fact is that modern radio tape recorders are well defined only by drives formatted using the FAT32 file system.  If the flash drive is in NTFS, then there may be problems with its recognition on the radio.  You just need to insert a memory card or drive into a computer and format it in the FAT32 file system.  Then you can copy the music to the USB flash drive again and try to play it on the tape recorder. </p><p>  If the tape recorder does not read the flash drive further, then there can already be only one option: the wrong format for music files.  The fact is that almost all recorders reproduce only MP3 and WMA formats.  And if you have any OGG, FLAC or WAV on the USB flash drive, the tape recorder will not read it.  You need to insert a memory card into a computer and copy tracks to it in MP3 format on it.  Or start the converter and transcode the songs on the USB flash drive to MP3 format.  After that, everything should work.  There is another reason: the failure of the connector for a USB flash drive on the tape recorder itself.  But on a new device, this is unlikely. </p><h2>  Radio with a flash drive in the car </h2><p>  A separate material could be written on this topic.  For every manufacturer of car audio devices has such models in its arsenal.  But still, if you need tape recorders in a car (with a flash drive), then it is better to turn to the products of well-known and trusted manufacturers.  Such are the "Pioneer", "Sony", "Alpin".  Each company has models that support playing music from a USB drive (almost all models).  If we are talking about memory cards, then you have to choose a product a little longer, studying all the models of interest.  But there are many. </p><h2>  Reviews on tape recorders with a flash drive </h2><p>  It is clear that "audiophiles" do not buy such devices.  They are purchased by people who know exactly why they need such an apparatus.  Therefore, there are very few negative reviews.  If we take only manufacturers, the most praised devices are from Panasonic and Sony (who would have thought).  The lowest rating was awarded to devices from VVK and Supra.  This is to be expected, since the latter offer devices with rather meager functionality and low power.  Users note that if you take them to nature, then they are not able to shout even the noise of the forest.  But consumers like their unusual design.  At Panasonic, for example, it is classic and austere.  But more functions.  In general, and here, as we see, we should focus on eminent manufacturers.  Then you can buy something really good quality. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined a certain number of devices such as a tape recorder with a flash drive.  There are various models, with different options and power.  Everyone chooses what he needs. </p>
