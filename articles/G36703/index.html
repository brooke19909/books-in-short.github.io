Spain, Italy, Greece: beach holidays in August</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  August is the time when summer in our area is approaching its logical conclusion.  Everyone at this time wants to go to some beautiful corner of our planet, so that the vacation is not in vain, so that it is filled with new impressions, joy, the sun and a warm sea breeze, or maybe even a real fairy tale.  What is a <span>beach vacation</span> in August, where is it best to spend it and which corner of the planet is the most profitable to visit at this time?  Let's try to consider the most famous European resorts, starting from relatively cool to very hot. </p><h2>  History, mass of attractions and the warm sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ancient world </h2><p>  In our ranking, Greece will be the first country.  A beach holiday in August is especially beautiful because it is at this time that it is warmest here.  The sea warms up to 25-28 degrees, the air temperature is 32, or even all 35 degrees.  However, summer light heat is not at all the most important attraction of this corner of the world.  The country is one of the richest in the world in the field of cultural heritage.  Numerous pantheons, ancient temples, acropolis, parfaeons and amazingly beautiful aqueducts.  You will be able to spend a whole day exploring all these structures that our ancestors once erected, and perhaps you will discover a lot of everything new.  Of course, a beach holiday in August in Greece cannot do without sea air and a breeze.  All the beaches that are available here are very clean and well maintained.  Among them you can find both noisy city, with numerous discos and cafes, and quite wild, where, besides you, there will be no more souls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beach holidays in august" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/459228.jpg" width="600"></div>

A beach holiday in August here is especially beautiful because, as in many other regions of Europe, this month is the hottest.  The temperature of each sea, which washes the country's coast, is approximately the same - up to 30 degrees, and the thermometer in the air often exceeds the mark of 35. Visiting Italy in the summer, you can find absolutely everything here.  There is stunning beauty of nature.  The coast is literally buried in verdure, after which it goes beyond the endless horizon along the sea.  Numerous architectural monuments of various times, art, painting and music, shopping, motels and health centers and much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="italy beach vacation in august" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/459223.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The main resorts of Italy on various seas </h2><p>  Many Russian tourists spend beach vacations in August in Liguria.  This is a small but very picturesque corner of Italy, which is located on the coast of the <span>Ligurian Sea,</span> near the border with France.  Due to the fact that it is very lush vegetation, on the shore there are many cozy bays in which it is especially nice to swim and enjoy the view of the endless expanses of water.  No less popular is Tuscany.  This is a paradise consisting of coniferous thickets, golden long beaches and cultural heritage of the country.  All the coasts here are filled with numerous hotels, villas and entertainment complexes, where everyone can find a rest to their liking.  But on the <span>Adriatic coast</span> , the resort of Lido di Jesolo <span>is</span> popular.  In this place, golden long beaches, the blue transparent sea, and also a huge number of night clubs are most valued. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best beach vacation in august" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/459225.jpg" width="550"></div>

Beach vacations in August are most popular here due to the warm climate and the huge influx of tourists from around the world.  Of course, Spain is the country with the largest cultural heritage, but few people go here in the hottest month of the year to see the sights.  The main property here is considered to be the golden beaches that stretch along the entire Mediterranean strip, starting from Barcelona and ending with Cadiz.  There are large resort cities - Barcelona with its many entertainments, Valencia, Malaga - where you can find a hotel for every taste and budget, which can be said about nightlife.  Between them are small towns, former fishing villages, where the rest is quiet and measured, ideal for large families with children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain beach holidays in august" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/459224.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Northern resorts of Spain </h2><p>  But the cooler, but still quite warm and attractive is the climate of the region of Asturias.  Everyone who prefers the waters of the Atlantic Bay to the Mediterranean Sea goes there.  It is noteworthy that the rest on the beach there is completely different, fundamentally different from all the usual resorts.  Asturian sand valleys that extend along the bay are wide and deserted.  Here you can meet the stunning beauty of the sunrises and see off the sunsets.  Also on this territory is a huge number of bays.  In them, the waters of the ocean are calm and transparent, which for children will become a real paradise.  But, despite all the silence of natural wealth, Asturias is a very developed region.  Shopping, restaurants and nightlife here will surely please you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on the beach" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/459227.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Countries where there is always heat and joy </h2><p>  Of course, the best beach vacation in August will be waiting for every tourist in Latin America.  This region is famous for the lack of difference between summer and winter.  The only exception may be Cuba, where it is in the last summer month that it rains constantly and the sea is very stormy.  The most profitable vacation solution would be Mexico.  Here, on <span>the Yucatan Peninsula, a</span> huge number of long beaches, covered with fine white sand <span>, are</span> concentrated.  On the peninsula there are equipped recreation areas with numerous sun loungers, as well as wild ones.  Far from cities, you can find beautiful bays in which the water warms up to incredibly high temperatures.  Summer heat is easier to carry thanks to the numerous tropical greenery, which rises with its thickets directly to the waters of the <span>Caribbean Sea.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="greece beach vacation in august" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/459226.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  South America and its features </h2><p>  If in summer you are not going to Central, but to South America, then it is worth remembering that winter is now here.  In countries located near the equator, it is by no means cold, but very hot, but the sea can be a little pump up.  The fact is that in the middle of summer on the Pacific coast (Ecuador, Colombia, Peru) high waves often rise due to strong winds, so the usual bathing in warm water may become impossible.  If you are a fan of windsurfing, then keep your path to this region of the world.  Here you can ride on the waves in plenty, improve in your own skill and get a lot of new impressions of your vacation. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  A beach holiday in August is, you can say, the least problem for every tourist.  A month of summer, hot for almost every corner of our world.  Therefore, wherever you go, almost everywhere you will be met by the warm sea, hot sand and a lot of entertainment.  Even the resorts of Russia at this time are famous for the inconceivable heat and light sea breeze.  Therefore, choose for your cruise the country that most attracts you with its culture, where you will like to ‚Äúlight‚Äù or just spend days in silence, and buy tickets in this direction.  And do not forget to bring not only beautiful photos from your vacation, but also your own vivid impressions that will cheer you up for the next year. </p>
