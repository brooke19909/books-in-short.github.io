After viewing them, many people formed the opinion that the U.S. Specialists are people who can shoot an innocent person with virtually no trial.  That these people are not familiar with the concepts of mercy and compassion, justice and honesty. </p><p>  So who are they - special?  <span>Are these fanatics who</span> wanted to plant any person, or people on whose shoulders a heavy burden fell on the shoulders during World War II?  Let's figure it out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Specialists are" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1407491.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Special department </h2><p>  It was created at the end of 1918 and belonged to the counterintelligence unit that was part of the Soviet army.  His main task was to protect state security and the fight against espionage. </p><p>  In April 1943, special departments began to bear a different name - SMERSH bodies (stands for "death to spies").  They created their agent network and started business for all soldiers and officers. </p><h2>  Specialists during the war </h2><p>  We know from films that if a special police officer came to the military unit, people could not expect anything good.  A natural question arises: how was it really? </p><p>  At the <span>beginning of World War II, a</span> huge number of military personnel did not have certificates.  A huge number of people without documents were constantly moving across the front line.  German spies could easily conduct their activities.  Therefore, it was quite natural that the Specialists increased interest in people who fell in and out of the circle.  In difficult conditions, they had to establish the identities of people and be able to identify German agents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For a long time in the Soviet Union, it was believed that special forces were created by the special forces, who were supposed to shoot the retreating military units.  In fact, everything was different. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="special department" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1407490.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <p>  Specialists are people who risked their lives no less than the soldiers and commanders of the Red Army.  Together with all of them, they participated in the offensive and retreated, and if the commander died, they had to take command and raise the soldiers to attack.  They showed miracles of selflessness and heroism at the front.  At the same time, they had to deal with alarmists and cowards, as well as to identify enemy scouts and spies. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><ol><li>  Specialists could not shoot soldiers without trial and investigation.  In one case only, they could use weapons: when someone tried to go over to the side of the enemy.  But then each such situation was thoroughly investigated.  In other cases, they only transmitted information about the revealed violations to the military prosecutor's office. </li><li>  At the beginning of the war, a large number of experienced, specially trained and having legal education, employees of special departments died.  In their place were forced to take people without training and the necessary knowledge, which often violated the law. </li><li>  By the beginning of World War II, in special departments, there were a total of about four hundred employees. </li></ol>
