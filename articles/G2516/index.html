Its weight is distributed on eight cables that are attached to the support.  It hangs over a precipice and in windy weather its swaying is especially felt. </p>

The bridge is 125 meters long and 1.8 meters wide.  At its edges are platforms of a triangular shape.  They play the role of viewing platforms where you can stand and enjoy the magnificent views of the Andaman Sea, the island of Langkawi and neighboring islands.  Thanks to its curved shape, you can appreciate the landscapes from different angles. </p><h2>  Cableway </h2><p>  Today, Malaysia has become very popular.  Lankawi is an island that is famous for its cable car.  It originates in the village of Oriental Village.  A modern cabin lifts tourists to the top of Mat Chinchang Mountain.  From this point the whole island is in full view. </p><p>  In clear weather, you can see the Thai coast in the north, and the silhouette of Indonesia in the west.  A cable car is included in all hiking trails.  It is located at an altitude of 708 meters.  The air temperature at the top is about five degrees lower than at its foot. </p>

    <h2>  Oceanarium </h2><p>  "The Underwater World of Langkawi" is the largest oceanarium in Asia, which is famous for the fact that it has more than 5 thousand marine inhabitants living in one hundred tanks.  The uniqueness of the structure is that it is a 15-meter tunnel, which is filled with 800 thousand liters of sea water.  Here you can enjoy the diversity of the underwater world. </p><p>  Predatory sharks swim very close to visitors.  They are separated from marine life by 38 mm high-strength flat glass.  It is considered very rare in the world. </p><h2>  Mausoleum of Mahsuri </h2><p>  This building is located very close to the capital of the island - the city of Kuah (12 km).  A sad but slightly embellished tradition is associated with him.  Legend has it that the sandy white coast of Langkawi Island is nothing more than the bright blood of an innocently ruined extraordinary beauty - Princess Makhsuri, who was accused of treason to her husband and killed. </p><p>  In vain she tried to explain that her enemies had spoken about her - the judges were inexorable.  The executioner, piercing the beauty with a dagger, like all the inhabitants of the island, saw that the blood of a young woman was white.  This indicated its purity and, therefore, confirmed that an unjustified murder had been committed.  Dying, the princess said that in the future the island will face various troubles - black buffaloes will produce white cows, the sand will turn black (this is the sand that covers Pasir Hitam beach), and the island of Langwari will completely disappear. </p><p>  At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Thais repeatedly tried to wipe off the island of Langkawi from the face of the Earth, and the man who blamed the unfortunate princess died unexpectedly.  On the site of the murder of an innocent victim, the Makhsuri Mausoleum was built from white marble, like her soul,.  Today, tourists from all over the world come here to pay tribute to innocence and cleanliness. </p>

    <p>  The tomb of Mahsuri is now a place of worship, when entering the mausoleum, you need to remove your shoes.  In the garden you will be shown an ancient well, which, according to legend, the princess dug up herself.  Even in the driest months, it does not dry out.  Local residents claim that if you wash your face with water, happiness will never leave you. </p><h2>  Telaga Tujuh </h2><p>  So called seven magnificent lakes, which are located one above the other on the gentle slope of the mountain.  Icy water flows from lake to lake.  An ancient legend says that beautiful fairies came down from the top of the mountain to wash their luxurious hair and wash themselves with crystal clear water.  And nearby is Durian Perangin Waterfall.  Nature divided it into seven streams.  The height of this giant is ninety meters.  At its foot, below, there is a so-called bath - a natural depression, which was chosen by tourists for swimming.  You can approach it along a narrow path cut through the jungle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="langkawi island malaysia reviews" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1060214.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Along the way, you will likely meet dozens of curious monkeys.  If you are not careful, they will try to steal something from you.  Children will be happy to slide into the water along the slopes of the lower "wells." </p><h2>  City Kuah </h2><p>  This small town is the capital of Langkawi.  It is located in the southeast of the island.  Its population is about 24 thousand people.  Until recently, it was a small village. </p><p>  The name of the city is translated as ‚Äúgravy‚Äù or ‚Äúsauce‚Äù.  He owes this strange name to two legendary giants who, competing in power, knocked over a jar of spicy curry sauce exactly at the place where the city stands today.  In any case, such a version of the origin of the name is contained in an old legend told by local residents. </p>
