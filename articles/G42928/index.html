To get acquainted with this beautiful place, you need to allocate at least a week, because there are many historical, architectural and natural monuments scattered not only throughout the town, but also far beyond its borders.  Europeans relatively recently discovered this resort, interest in it manifested itself in the 30s of the last century.  Until now, it remains a mysterious, unexplored until the end of the earth, attracting a magnet to itself.  There are no surging waves of the ocean, snow-white beaches, huge hotels - this alpine resort attracts a calm, relaxing atmosphere, clean air and breathtaking surrounding views. </p><h2>  History of Ubud </h2><p>  ‚ÄúMedicine‚Äù - this is how the name of the city of Ubud is translated.  Bali has always been famous for its peaceful atmosphere, but its cultural center has a special effect on the health and psychological state of people.  A lot of medicinal herbs grows here, and the merger of the two rivers concentrates the energy of the earth, which makes a person cheerful and cheerful.  It is known about Ubud that in the VIII century Rsi Markendya, a Japanese Vishnuite, meditated here.  It was he who became the founder of the Pura Gunung Lebach temple.  In the XI century, Hinduism began to spread actively in these parts, which led to the emergence of new temples: in the caves of Goa Gadzhah, near Mount Kavi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ubud bali" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/371100.jpg" width="600"></div>

The Dutch were the first to visit Bali, it was they who made the island part of the Dutch East Indies at the beginning of the 20th century.  Europeans treated local culture with respect, encouraging its development in every way.  Thanks to this, the people have preserved their centuries-old traditions, which are honored to this day.  The first places to stay here appeared in 1936, since then a lot of things have changed on the island, hotels and numerous bungalows grow like mushrooms after the rain, but Ubud manages to maintain its original appearance. </p><h2>  Ubud - a city of creative people </h2><p>  Tourists from Europe reached out to Indonesia after visiting these places by Walter Spies.  It was the choreographer and film director who discovered the delights of the city of Ubud for Europeans.  Bali on the map seems like a very tiny, inconspicuous island, but many do not even imagine what beauties here open to travelers.  Shpis staged the famous Kecak - a spectacular dance of monkeys, which today still gathers crowds of spectators.  In the twentieth century, Ubud was considered one of the bohemian places, as artists, composers, actors, directors, musicians, in general, all creative people gathered here to gain strength, to be inspired to create new masterpieces.  Among the outstanding cultural figures, it should be noted Charlie Chaplin, Dorty Lamur, Margaret Mead, Sting. </p>
