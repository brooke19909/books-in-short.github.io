    <h2>  Taverna del campiello remer </h2><p>  Like many restaurants in Venice, this restaurant offers its visitors to taste one of the traditional Italian dishes from the extensive menu.  In addition, the tavern offers magnificent views of the Grand Canal.  The restaurant offers <span>a buffet</span> with chopped ham, sausages, pasta, risotto, many salads, desserts, wines and other drinks.  The cost of such a meal will be only 20 euros.  However, going to a tavern for lunch, keep in mind that on Wednesdays this establishment does not work. </p><h2>  Bacaro lounge </h2><p>  As a rule, all the restaurants and cafes of Venice, located near San Marco Square, which is very popular with tourists, have very high prices.  A pleasant exception to this rule can be called an institution called Bacaro Lounge.  <span>This</span> Benneton family owned <span>restaurant</span> is located in an old movie theater.  ‚ÄúBakaro‚Äù is a favorite place for lunch or dinner of gondoliers, who most often order <span>roast pork</span> and spaghetti.  Such a meal costs only 10 euros. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

The institution works all seven days a week. </p><h2>  Al muro </h2><p>  If you are looking for restaurants in Venice where you can have a leisurely and inexpensive lunch on a Saturday, then pay attention to Al Muro.

The Antiko Pignolo menu for the most part consists of traditional regional dishes.  Restaurant visitors are mainly wealthy and business people.  In this regard, going here for lunch or dinner, be prepared to fork out for delicious dishes. </p>

    <h2>  Traditional venetian cuisine </h2><p>  Delicious <span>Italian cuisine is</span> offered in all Venice restaurants.  Reviews of tourists are almost always admired, regardless of whether they visited expensive elite establishments or had a snack in ordinary pizzerias.  This is not surprising, because Italians know how, and most importantly, love to cook deliciously.  If this is your first trip to this country, keep in mind that the cuisine will not be the same everywhere.  So, the main Venetian dishes are moleche, black risotto, ricotto de go, Venetian liver, tiramisu and baicoli.  Let us dwell on these culinary delights in more detail. </p><h2>  Moleche </h2><p>  Moleche is one of the integral components of the Venetian cuisine, widely represented by fish and seafood dishes.  You can order it almost everywhere.  It is a milder dish of fried small crabs.  It goes well with a variety of sauces and side dishes. </p>

    <h2>  Black risotto </h2><p>  This dish, which in Italian is called risotto nero, is a special kind of world famous risotto, which is made from cuttlefish.  The meat of this marine inhabitant gives the rice a density and a special taste, and also affects its color.  So, due to cuttlefish juice, rice becomes black, which makes the dish even more original. </p><h2>  Rigoto de go </h2><p>  This dish is another combination of rice and fish.  And it‚Äôs very harmonious.  Rice perfectly absorbs the great taste of go fish (Italians also call it gobi). </p><h2>  Venetian liver </h2><p>  Restaurants in Venice offer this dish called fegato alla venetian.  It is a real delicacy that will surely appeal to meat lovers.  A unique recipe for this dish is a harmonious combination of pulp of the liver and roasted garlic. </p><h2>  Tiramisu </h2><p>  This dish is a traditional <span>Italian dessert that has</span> become popular all over the world.  However, it is unlikely that somewhere they can cook tiramisu better than in its homeland.  Therefore, be sure to try this delicious dessert, which is offered to its guests by many restaurants in Venice. </p><h2>  Baikoli </h2><p>  Baikoli cannot be considered a full-fledged dessert.  However, it is also one of the symbolic Venetian dishes, which will certainly be appreciated by lovers of sweets.  Baikoli is a dry cookie that goes well with coffee.  They are also complemented by various cream desserts. </p>
