During this time, six monarchs were replaced, each of which stood for certain political forces.  <span>IN.</span>  <span>Klyuchevsky</span> very aptly called it that - the era of palace coups.  The table presented in the article will help to better understand the course of events.  The change of power, as a rule, went through intrigue, betrayal, and murder. </p><p>  It all started with the unexpected death of Peter I. He left behind him a "Charter on the succession to the throne" (1722), according to which a large number of people could claim power. </p>

    <p>  The end of this troubled era is considered the coming to power of Catherine II.  Many historians consider her reign an era of enlightened absolutism. </p><h2>  The background of the palace coups </h2><p>  The main reason for all previous events was the contradiction between many noble groups regarding succession to the throne.  They were united only in that a temporary stop should be made in the implementation of reforms.  Each of them saw this respite in their own way.  Also, all groups of nobles equally eagerly eager for power.  Therefore, the era of palace coups, the table of which is given below, was limited only by a change in the top. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Already mentioned the decision of Peter I regarding succession to the throne.  He broke the traditional mechanism by which power was transferred from the monarch to the senior male representative. </p><p>  Peter I did not want to see his son on the throne because he was an opponent of reform.  Therefore, he decided that the monarch would be able to independently name the applicant.  However, he died, leaving on the paper the phrase "Give everything back ...". </p><p>  The masses were alienated from politics, the nobles could not divide the throne - the state was overwhelmed by the struggle for power.  Thus began the era of palace coups.  The scheme, the table will make it possible to better trace the blood ties of all applicants to the throne. </p><h2>  The coup of 1725 (Ekaterina Alekseevna) </h2>

    <p>  At this time, two opposing groups formed.  The first consisted of A. Osterman and A. Menshikov.  They sought to transfer power to the widow of Peter <span>I, Catherine</span> Alekseevna. </p><p>  The second group, which included the Duke of Holstein, wanted to enthrone Peter II (son of Alexei and grandson of Peter I). </p><p>  A clear predominance was in A. Menshikov, who managed to secure the support of the guard and put Catherine I on the throne. However, she did not have the ability to manage the state, and so the Great Privy Council was created in 1726.  He became the highest government body. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The actual ruler was A.

    <p>  The reign of <span>Ekaterina Alekseevna</span> lasted a little over two years.  After her death, the question of succession again loomed over the state. </p><p>  This time, the "Holstein group" was headed by Anna Petrovna.  She initiated a conspiracy against A. Menshikov and A. Osterman, which ended unsuccessfully.  The sovereign was recognized as a minor Peter.  His mentor and educator was A. Osterman.  However, he failed to exert the necessary influence on the monarch, although he was still enough to prepare and conduct the overthrow of A. Menshikov in 1727. </p><h2>  The reign of Anna Ioannovna since 1730 </h2>

He was subsequently replaced by A. Osterman.  He fired the field marshal.

    <p>  On November 25, 1741, another coup took place.  He passed quickly and bloodlessly, power was in the hands of Elizabeth Petrovna, daughter of Peter I. She raised a guard behind her with a small speech and proclaimed herself empress.  Count Vorontsov helped her in this. </p><p>  The young ex-emperor and his mother were imprisoned in a fortress.

Therefore, she brought her nephew from Holstein.  He was given the name Peter III, he converted to Orthodoxy.  The empress was not enthusiastic about the nature of the future heir.  In an effort to rectify the situation, she assigned teachers to him, but this did not help. </p><p>  To continue the family, Elizabeth Petrovna married him to the German princess Sofia, who would become Catherine the Great.  They had two children - son Paul and daughter Anna. </p><p>  Before death, Elizabeth will be advised to appoint Paul as heir.  However, she did not dare to do so.  After her death, the throne passed to her nephew.  His policy was very unpopular both among the people and among the nobles.  Moreover, after the death of Elizabeth Petrovna, he was in no hurry to crown.  This was the reason for the coup on the part of his wife Catherine, over whom the threat of <span>divorce</span> hung long ago (this was often stated by the emperor).  It officially ended the era of the palace coup (the table contains additional information about the children's nickname of the Empress). </p><h2>  June 28, 1762.  The reign of Catherine II </h2>

    <p>  Becoming the wife of Peter Fedorovich, Catherine began to study the Russian language and traditions.  She quickly learned new information.  This helped her get distracted after two unsuccessful pregnancies and the fact that her long-awaited son Pavel was taken from her immediately after birth.  She saw him only after 40 days.  Elizabeth was engaged in his education.  She dreamed of becoming an empress.  She had such an opportunity, since Peter Fedorovich did not pass the coronation.  Elizabeth took advantage of the support of the guards and overthrew her husband.  Most likely, he was killed, although death from colic was called the official version. </p><p>  Her reign lasted 34 years.
