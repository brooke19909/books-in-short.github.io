    <h2>  Lloyd George Biography: Childhood and Youth </h2><p>  The future famous politician was born on January 17, 1863 in Manchester in the family of a teacher from Pembrokeshire.  At the age of one, the boy lost his father, and his mother with three babies (David's sisters was 2 and 3 years old) moved to the village of Llanistamdvi, where her shoemaker brother lived.  Uncle played a huge role in the life of orphans.  Therefore, becoming an adult, David George added to his and his last name - Lloyd. </p><p>  After graduating from the parish school in Llanistamdvi, the young man passed 3 exams and received the right to hold the position of solicitor.  He had an active character and soon founded a law office in Krichchit. </p><p>  At the age of 25, David married the daughter of a wealthy farmer - Maggie Owen, despite the fact that her father did not consider the beginning lawyer a suitable party for his daughter.  However, marriage added solidity to the young lawyer, and a few months after the marriage, he was elected alderman of the county of Cairnarvon.  Moreover, after another 2 years, the young man was already a member of the Chamber of Deputies from the Liberal Party. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Cabinet work </h2><p>  In 1890, David Lloyd George moved with his family to London.  The impudent, sarcastic and witty young man was able to prove to be an excellent speaker and soon became the leader of the Welsh deputies from the Liberal Party. </p><p>  In 1905, it was this party that came to power in Great Britain.  Lloyd George was invited to the government, but he stipulated his participation in 2 conditions: the expansion of self-government for his native Wales and the amendment of the current law on education.  His terms were accepted, and at the age of 32, David first became UK Secretary of Commerce. </p><p>  He was actively interested in the rational exploitation of the colonies and was a supporter of the expansion of the empire.  In 1908, D. Lloyd George took over as Chancellor of the Treasury, considered the second largest in the British cabinet. </p><h2>  World War I </h2><p>  Back in the years of the Boer armed confrontation in Great Britain and abroad, Lloyd George built up a reputation as a peacemaker.  However, when German leaders promised an early victory at the beginning of World War I, he spoke at a rally and called on the British to defend Belgium's independence. </p><p>  At the end of 1916, D. Lloyd George took over as prime minister of the United Kingdom and led the coalition government for almost 6 years.  The beginning of his reign was simply triumphant, and in those years the politician was very popular in his country and in many European countries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  End of war </h2><p>  In the last days before the signing of the truce, Lloyd George, in his speeches in parliament, did everything possible to create the impression that the British were victorious.  It is known that the politician even tried to delay the dissemination of information about the cessation of hostilities until he appeared before the deputies. </p><p>  His tricks were successful, and the press even began to call the prime minister "the organizer of the victory."  Moreover, Lloyd George organized a troop review in London, which his associates hastened to call a "victory parade," and invited Clemenceau, Foch, and Italian Prime Minister V. Orlando on this occasion.  All this allowed him to stay at his post, and in 1918 he formed a government for the second time. </p><h2>  USSR policy </h2><p>  In 1918, as Prime Minister, Lloyd George declared a crusade against the young Soviet state.  His goal was to create a ‚Äúzone of influence‚Äù, which included the Baltic states and the oil-rich Caucasus.  It was under him that the British interventionists landed in Arkhangelsk and in Baku.  In addition, Lloyd George has repeatedly called for support for <span>White movement leaders.</span>  However, by 1920, he took an active part in the preparation and signing of a trade agreement with the USSR, thereby recognizing Soviet power as the de facto government of Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Treaty of Versailles </h2><p>  Many historians consider David Lloyd George one of the initiators of the signing of <span>the Treaty of Versailles,</span> according to which England received the German colonies and Mesopotamia.  As a result, almost 75% of the world's oil resources explored by the 20th year turned out to be under the control of this country. </p><p>  Under Lloyd George, England also consolidated its dominance in Persia, Arabia and Egypt, and also gained Palestine and Iraq. </p><h2>  Resignation and subsequent years </h2><p>  In 1922, <span>the</span> Lloyd George <span>coalition government</span> crashed.  There were several reasons: </p><ul><li>  the prime minister was unable to make concessions on the part of the USSR; </li><li>  opportunities to organize coal exports to Northern Europe were not created; </li><li>  Lloyd George's policy did not lead to the signing of an agreement on preferences for English goods when they are imported into Central European states. </li></ul><p>  After his resignation, Lloyd George continued his active political activity and until the beginning of the 30s remained the most respected political figure in the West.  However, he hoped to return to the government.  However, during the formation of the new cabinet in 1931, he was not invited, which was partly due to his serious illness.  Moreover, a few months later the liberal party split, and Lloyd George refused to lead it. </p><p>  After a full recovery, the politician began to write "Military Memoirs", which brought him success with readers and huge fees. </p>

    <h2>  The Second World War </h2><p>  During a visit to Germany in 1936, Lloyd George lavished praise on Hitler.  However, after the events in Spain, he spoke out in favor of rapprochement between Britain and France and the USSR.  When W. Churchill became Prime Minister, he proposed a policy to become a member of his government, but Lloyd George rejected both this and the offer to take up the post of ambassador of the United Kingdom to the United States. </p><p>  At the height of the war, the wife of a politician died, with whom he had not lived for a long time.  He married his longtime lover Francis Stevenson.  Shortly after the wedding, Lloyd George was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor that developed rapidly. </p>
