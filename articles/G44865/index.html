The only salvation in this case are specialized devices that help greatly facilitate the process of maintaining cleanliness in the house.  A good example of this is specialized robotic vacuum cleaners.  They automatically clean the room.  If you are not sure which equipment is best to buy, then it is worthwhile to study in detail the reviews of the 5 best models of robotic vacuum cleaners. </p><h2>  Criteria for choosing a robot vacuum cleaner </h2><p>  Any person who wants to purchase a modern device must understand the criteria for his choice, as well as focus on the ratio of "price / quality".  If we talk about the company, then there are no special criteria.  Now many manufacturers from China are creating not only high-quality, but also not inferior in terms of value to European analogs devices.  In addition, there are vacuum cleaners of Asian brands, which are included in the group of premium appliances and are considered the most high-quality and effective when cleaning the house. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.courts.com.sg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Equipment Selection Criteria" class="if uuid-2857400" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106249/2857400.jpg"></div><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Due to the fact that such devices operate on a special battery, the buyer should pay special attention to their autonomy.  For an apartment with three rooms, you can purchase a robot vacuum cleaner, designed for two hours of work.  If the device works less than the necessary time, then it will not be able to completely remove the apartment and it will have to be replaced with a new one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dust collector capacity </h2><p>  Another important factor when choosing a technique is the capacity of the dust bag.  The containers for collecting garbage in an automatic type vacuum cleaner do not differ in their large size, for this reason it will depend on the volume of the dust collector how often you will have to clean the equipment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.samsung.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to service" class="if uuid-2857401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106249/2857401.jpg"></div><h2>  Route building </h2><p>  The built-in function of automatically building a route around the apartment is the next criterion.  All devices work autonomously, that is, a person does not exert any efforts during their work.  For this reason, the robot vacuum cleaner needs to somehow navigate the house.  Especially the route building function is important for cleaning an apartment with several rooms.  Models from the budget class for the first time remember the whole apartment, and after that they already work along the previously laid route, which helps to quickly and efficiently clean the entire apartment. </p><p>  Such devices can be controlled through a specialized control panel or using the remote control.  The second method is considered more comfortable to use, since a person can, even without getting up from the couch, return the vacuum cleaner to its original place or install a program of re-passage to a certain place in the house that seems poorly cleaned. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Instrument size </h2><p>  The size of the device will affect which interior items in the apartment the vacuum cleaner will be able to call in and which ones will drive through.  Another quite important factor is the fact that many modern models of robot vacuum cleaners are equipped with special wheels that can lower or rise, that is, they have peculiar shock absorbers.  Using this function, the device can easily overcome obstacles in its path (for example, low objects and wires).  In technology from the budget class there is no such function, so it just gets stuck in place. </p><h2>  Brushes and sensors </h2><p>  Also, special attention should be paid to the number of built-in brushes and sensors.  There are such models of robotic vacuum cleaners that have only one main brush.  Such a model is considered to be the best option, since the device cannot drive close to the wall and collect garbage in the immediate vicinity of it.  The same can be said about the corners of the room.  They spin and throw all the dirt on the main brush. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vacuumstest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacuum cleaner device" class="if uuid-2857436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106249/2857436.jpg"></div><p>  For orientation in space, special infrared sensors are built into the vacuum cleaner, which automatically detect the obstacle in front and help to go around them in time.  In addition, such a sensor prevents severe contamination of the device.  In some devices, there is a sensor that takes into account the height of the object in front.  This will prevent the vacuum cleaner from getting stuck under the cabinet or other furniture in the room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Functional Robot Vacuum Cleaner </h2><p>  In vacuum cleaners from an expensive category, an automatic cleaning function is built in.  The principle of its operation is as follows: the charging base empties the container in the vacuum cleaner, which allows the device to continue cleaning.  After cleaning, the owner of the equipment only needs to remove rubbish from the charger from time to time. </p><p>  There are situations when in a room you need to delimit a certain space that a vacuum cleaner should not call into.  This can be achieved with a simple magnetic tape, which is glued to the floor.  For ease of use, some devices have a special program that allows you to configure it to work on the days of the week or a special timer. </p><p>  The built-in parts of the robot vacuum cleaner may break down over time.  Especially often this happens with batteries and filters.  For this reason, when purchasing a device, it is important to remember that after a year or more, its parts may have to be replaced with new ones, which means that one-day firms will not work. </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to the following factors: </p><ul><li>  dust collector volume; </li><li>  Battery capacity; </li><li>  the presence of the function of scanning the room and remembering the route; </li><li>  control from the remote control or electronic panel; </li><li>  the presence on the market of parts suitable for this model of vacuum cleaner; </li><li>  other additional functions in the device. </li></ul><h2>  Which robot vacuum cleaner is good? </h2><p>  Reviews indicate that the domestic manufacturer of Kitfort robotic vacuum cleaners is considered to be of high quality and in demand.  Devices from this brand can be found in almost every chain store.  Designers create models in different colors, which helps each buyer to choose a model that is more suitable in terms of technical characteristics and color. </p><p>  Kitfrot is mainly involved in the development of kitchen appliances.  Any, even the most budgetary model from this manufacturer is distinguished by its wide functionality, affordable cost and decent technical parameters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="2track.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Popular models" class="if uuid-2857432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106249/2857432.jpg"></div><p>  The constant expansion of the company's product range has led to the creation of robotic vacuum cleaners.  They became the main assistants in cleaning the house for any housewife.  Many buyers of equipment from Kitfort leave only positive reviews about the device.  Many are attracted to the technique of ease and comfort of use, as well as affordable cost.  The main disadvantage of technology is its low productivity. </p><h2>  1. Kitfort KT-511 </h2><p>  Such a model is included in the rating of the 5 <span>best models</span> of robot vacuum cleaners, reviews of which are the best.  It is easy to manage and quickly copes with tasks.  The device is considered relatively cheap and includes only the functions necessary for cleaning the house.  Among the main advantages of this model, the reviews include the simplicity of the design, because of which the probability of device failure is minimal. </p><p>  The technical characteristics of the device are as follows: the height of the case reaches nine centimeters (the average for this type of equipment).  Such a case will not interfere with the operation of the device, it can easily reach all corners of the room and eliminate accumulated debris and dirt from them. </p><p>  The power source in this model is a nickel-metal hydride battery.  Its capacity reaches 800 mAh - this will be enough to work for 30 minutes.  Charging time of the device reaches eight hours.  The described characteristics of the model can be called its main disadvantages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kitfort vacuum cleaner" class="if uuid-2857848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/2857848.jpg"></div><p>  To clean the floor, two brushes are installed on the sides of the device.  They help to efficiently and quickly clean skirting boards, corners in the room and furniture.  The size of the waste bin is 300 milliliters. </p><p>  The robot vacuum cleaner also allows you to clean the intake air.  For this, coarse filters are built into it.  If we talk about the noise of the product, then it is minimal.  In rare cases, the volume of the device reaches 68 dB. </p><p>  The functionality of the device can not be called diverse - the device only works in one mode.  But if you recall its price, then you can not pay attention to it.  The device is used for dry cleaning of smooth surfaces in an apartment (laminate, linoleum, tile, tile and carpet with a small pile). </p><h2>  2. <span>Panda X600</span> Pet Series </h2><p>  In Russia, a greater number of robotic vacuum cleaners with the function of wet cleaning from Panda are sold.  Models of such a company, like other Japanese products for the room, are considered not only functional, but also attractive in their design. </p><p>  The main advantage of the device reviews are that there is a chance to program it for a specific time.  The suction power ranges from 50 to 85 watts, at full power, the device starts working on carpets - where it really is needed, which significantly increases the duration of the work.  In addition, the device does not provoke excessive noise, its volume fluctuates in the limit of 50 decibels. </p><p>  The volume of the container is 450 grams.  With the help of good software and a large number of built-in sensors, the device quickly passes all obstacles, moves cables and thresholds, a special ultraviolet lamp helps to recognize the floor.  The price for the device varies from 13 to 16 thousand rubles, and the kit additionally includes rags for the floor polisher, side brushes, cleaning brushes and air filters. </p><h2>  3. IRobot Roomba 980 </h2><p>  The device from the American manufacturer is among the top 5 models of robotic vacuum cleaners.  Reviews say that this model is well suited for dry cleaning of floors and carpets in the room.  The battery of the device allows you to clean a room with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã185 square meters at a time. </p><p>  Cleaning the device takes place in three stages.  At the first stage, the device with the help of built-in side brushes collects all the dust near itself and in the corners of the room, and then forwards it to the two main rollers.  At the second stage of cleaning, soft rubber rollers comb out and scrape off dirt.  At the end of the work, the air is sucked and cleaned in the room by means of a strong vacuum.  It is considered useful that such a device includes a modified container with a volume of up to one liter, which helps to absorb and preserve even the smallest dust particles, including those that provoke allergies. </p><h2>  4. Philips FC 8820 </h2><p>  We continue to find out which is the best robot vacuum cleaner.  This model is used for dry cleaning.  The average cost ranges from 20 to 31 thousand rubles.  It is important to note that this price is not considered the highest for a vacuum cleaner that has so many built-in functions.  For example, with the help of its thin body, the device helps to clean the space efficiently even under furniture.  Long brushes on the sides eliminate debris in the corners of the room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.e-katalog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips Vacuum Cleaner" class="if uuid-2857859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/2857859.jpg"></div><p>  A specialized TK sensor is built into the product for avoiding obstacles.  If there are places in the room where the vacuum cleaner should not be, then you can program a special "wall" in it.  The dust collector can hold trash up to 400 milliliters. </p><p>  The main advantages of the device reviews included 2 hours of continuous operation from a powerful battery.  In addition, the vacuum cleaner can pass through the thresholds in the room up to 15 centimeters without obstacles. </p><h2>  5. Miele SJQL0 Scout RX1 </h2><p>  Such a robot vacuum cleaner is considered compact and attractive.  The model is not cheap at all, and its average price reaches 50 thousand rubles.  Well suited for a person who appreciates comfort and quality. </p><p>  The vacuum cleaner has a wide built-in functionality: it quickly collects garbage and dirt in the corners of the room and inaccessible places.  The device is well suited for dry cleaning an apartment with a large number of rooms.  A fully charged battery can clean a room of up to 150 square meters, and a dust collector holds up to 600 grams of dust.  The device comes to the starting place on its own. </p><p>  The device can operate in five modes: it performs routed cleaning of rooms, can function in turbo mode, if you need quick cleaning of the room, using the side brushes the device can quickly remove dirt and dust in the corners.  The device can be controlled independently, using the manual mode for this. </p><h2>  Reviews of the best models from the rating of robotic vacuum cleaners </h2><p>  Many users leave positive feedback on the operation of such a device.  They note that if a robot vacuum cleaner suddenly gets stuck in some place in the room, then it will try to free itself.  If he does not succeed, then he will start to emit a signal, and then turn off.  Reviews of the best robotic vacuum cleaners report that such smart devices at an affordable cost help save time and effectively clean the room. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nymag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Furniture cleaning" class="if uuid-2857430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106249/2857430.jpg"></div><p>  Which <span>robot vacuum cleaner is better?</span>  To begin with, it is important to decide what budget the user is willing to spend on the purchase of a new technological device for cleaning the house.  It is also important to evaluate the required battery life of the device.  If the apartment has three rooms, it is best to purchase a vacuum cleaner that can work for several hours.  The suction power of dust and dirt will directly depend on the power of the device.  For lightly loaded floor coverings, a vacuum cleaner with a low power - up to 60 watts is well suited.  Reviews of the 5 best robot vacuum cleaner models recommend paying special attention to the Philips and Kitfort brands. </p><p>  The size of the device will directly depend on its patency.  The more compact the device, the greater the likelihood that it will be able to independently reach the most inaccessible places. </p>
