With it, people easily pay for purchases and services.  To control the balance of banking plastic, many banks offer mobile banking.  By connecting it, the client will be able to carry out various operations with the card through USSD commands and SMS requests.  Next, we will try to figure out how to connect the Mobile Bank from Sberbank.  This question worries the bulk of people.  Indeed, Sberbank is one of the largest and most reliable financial organizations in Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oceanbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Mobile Bank&quot; for the phone" class="if uuid-2454391" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2454391.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  What is the Mobile Bank service?  As we have already said, this is an option that allows you to perform various actions with plastic through mobile devices.  It can be extremely useful. </p><p>  For example, through mobile banking you can: </p><ul><li>  Receive SMS about the current status of the account; </li><li>  request details of card transactions; </li><li>  make money transfers; </li><li>  transfer money to a mobile phone. </li></ul><p>  These are the most common options that interest modern customers.  Paying for services and making purchases through mobile banking will not work.  However, the option under study is really useful. </p><h2>  Activation methods </h2><p>  How to <span>unlock Mobile Bank?</span>  There are several ways to connect this option. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="sbankin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Search for Mobile Bank service at an ATM" class="if uuid-2454390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2454390.jpg"></div><p>  To cope with the task, you can do this: </p><ul><li>  seek help at any office of Sberbank; </li><li>  use any payment terminal or Sberbank ATM; </li><li>  call Sberbank employees and activate the option. </li></ul><p>  In fact, all of these methods do not deliver any real difficult.  And therefore, even a person who does not understand anything in technology will be able to activate the Mobile Bank service. </p><h2>  Connection in the department </h2><p>  Let's start with the least popular, but fairly simple trick.  This is a visit to Sberbank to bring ideas to life. </p><p>  Thinking about how to connect the Mobile Bank, a citizen needs to prepare: </p><ul><li>  passport; </li><li>  bank card </li><li>  application for connection (the form is taken directly at the company branch); </li><li>  a mobile phone to which plastic will be attached. </li></ul><p>  Then you have to act like this: </p><ol><li>  Take prepared in advance documents and things. </li><li>  Contact any Sberbank branch. </li><li>  Inform about the desire to connect mobile banking. </li><li>  Fill out the request form. </li><li>  Submit an application for connecting the service to employees of a financial institution. </li><li>  Wait for a message about the successful activation of the option. </li></ol><p>  It is done.  It usually takes about a few days to process the application.  And so this option is not suitable for everyone.  You can cope with the task much faster. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="frombanks.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connection of mobile banking at an ATM" class="if uuid-2454387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2454387.jpg"></div><h2>  Via telephone </h2><p>  The next option is to use the phone.  As we already said, a person can call the bank and activate the studied option.  This alignment is found in real life more often than the first method. </p><p>  <span>How to unlock Mobile Bank?</span>  In the case of Sberbank, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Dial 8 800 555 55 50 or 900 on the phone. </li><li>  Press the "Call Subscriber" button. </li><li>  Wait for operator response. </li><li>  Announce that you want to connect to mobile banking. </li><li>  Name the cardholder's full name, secret word, bank plastic data. </li><li>  Report the mobile number to which you want to bind. </li></ol><p>  It remains only to wait a while.  After a couple of minutes, a citizen will receive a message on the mobile phone about the successful connection of the studied option.  Sberbank's Mobile Bank number is 900. This combination will help in processing requests made with the card via telephone. </p><h2>  Instructions for working with ATMs </h2><p>  How to connect "Mobile Bank" via phone?  The answer to this question will no longer make you think.  Everyone will be able to bring the idea to life without much hassle.  It is enough to follow the previously proposed manual. </p><p>  Nevertheless, modern customers prefer to learn various ways of self-service.  They help to receive certain services at any time.  For example, connect and disconnect new options to bank cards. </p><p>  How to connect "Mobile Bank"?  Every modern client can use the ATMs of financial companies.  With their help, the mentioned service will be activated very quickly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techgoondu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A call to the bank to connect mobile banking" class="if uuid-2454389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2454389.jpg"></div><p>  The step-by-step instructions for activating Sberbank's mobile banking through an ATM will look something like this: </p><ol><li>  Find a suitable ATM and insert a bank card into it. </li><li>  Specify the PIN of the plastic. </li><li>  Select "Mobile Bank" in the main menu. </li><li>  Click on the "Connect ..." button. </li><li>  Click on the line with the selected tariff.  There is a package "Economy" - it is often free, but you have to pay for some of its services.  There is a sentence "Full".  This tariff costs 60 rubles per month, but all banking services will be completely free. </li><li>  Enter the phone number to which the card will be linked. </li><li>  Confirm procedure. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  From now on, it‚Äôs clear how the Mobile Bank option is activated at Sberbank through ATMs.  This option is found in real life more and more often. </p><h2>  Payment Terminals and Connection </h2><p>  Further, it is worth noting such a technique as unlocking and connecting the mobile banking option using payment terminals.  This solution saves people from finding ATM. </p><p>  In this case, you will have to act in the same way as in the case of ATMs.  The main thing is to remember that not all Sberbank payment terminals can work with plastic.  Therefore, you have to look for a suitable car. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sbankami.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The program &quot;Mobile Bank&quot;" class="if uuid-2454394" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2454394.jpg"></div><h2>  Sberbank Online and mobile banking </h2><p>  We have already figured out how to connect Mobile Bank via phone.  The last method of solving this problem is to turn to the help of Internet banking.  In our case, we are talking about the Sberbank Online service.  By connecting it to yourself, each client will be able to carry out various kinds of operations with cards via the Internet.  A distinctive feature of this technique is that it can be used at any time. </p><p>  Some people believe that through Sberbank Online it is possible to connect any options to bank cards.  But actually it is not.  Mobile banking cannot be activated in this way.  Therefore, citizens need to use one of the previously listed tricks. </p><h2>  Application for work </h2><p>  Now a few words about how to work with the studied option.  In general, it allows you to send SMS and USSD requests.  But you can download the specialized Mobile Bank application for mobile devices.  With this software, a person can save himself from unnecessary requests via SMS. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sbankin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Application for connecting the Mobile Bank option" class="if uuid-2454392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2454392.jpg"></div><p>  You can find the Sberbank Mobile Banking application in the AppStore and Google Play.  After installation, just run the program and study the proposed menu.  By clicking on the corresponding software tabs, a person can easily carry out certain operations with a bank card. </p><h2>  Main teams </h2><p>  It's time to talk about the basic operations of the Mobile Bank.  How to transfer money?  And to recharge a mobile phone from a card?  We will talk about SMS requests and USSD commands.  There are a lot of them, so we will focus on only a few operations. </p><p>  Here are the main USSD requests that help you work with Sberbank's mobile banking: </p><ul><li>  * 900 * 1 # - information about the status of the plastic account; </li><li>  * 900 * replenishment amount # - transfer money to a phone attached to the card; </li><li>  * 900 * recipient_number * amount # - payment of any mobile phone; </li><li>  * 900 * 12 * receiver_phone_number * money # - money transfer to a card linked to the number specified in the request. </li></ul><p>  That's all.  These are the main operations that interest Sberbank customers.  But how to send an SMS request of one type or another? </p><div class="photo" data-original="cardoteka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to transfer money through the Mobile Bank" class="if uuid-2454393" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2454393.jpg"></div><p>  The generated message is sent to number 900. Here are a few forms that allow you to use mobile banking (message text options): </p><ul><li>  transfer amount - transferring money to a phone attached to a card; </li><li>  balance XXX, where XXX is the last 4 digits of the plastic - receiving SMS about the status of the account; </li><li>  tel. recipient_number sum - replenishment of another's number; </li><li>  transfer recipient_number money - money transfer to plastic, attached to the specified phone number. </li></ul><p>  In fact, everything is not as difficult as it seems.  And even a novice client of Sberbank will be able to cope with the task.  Now it‚Äôs clear how to unlock the Mobile Bank for future use. </p>
