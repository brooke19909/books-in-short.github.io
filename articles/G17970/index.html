  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best hotels in Miami, according to tourists.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  More and more tourists are choosing Miami hotels for <span>holidays in the USA</span> .  This is due to the mild climate of the resort, traditional American service and a well-developed hotel infrastructure, which allows you to combine a business trip with a relaxing vacation on the beach.  Some five-star Miami hotels are especially popular with tourists. </p><p>  <strong>Trump International Sonesta Beach resort 5 *</strong> </p><p>  This hotel is built near Bel Harbor. </p><p>  The rooms have a balcony, minibar, safe, cable TV, game console, <span>ironing board,</span> clock radio, telephone with <span>voicemail</span> and much more.  For cooking, there is a refrigerator, kettle and microwave, which allows you to have a bite to eat without leaving the room.  Daily newspapers are brought to guests. </p><p>  It offers tourists on-site shops, car rental, laundry, bar and restaurant. </p><p>  For children, there are playgrounds, entertainment programs, <span>babysitting services</span> and special cots in the rooms. </p><p>  A large selection of entertainment allows you to have fun.  Vacationers are offered numerous water activities, a gym, SPA - salon, fitness center, etc. </p><p>  Near the hotel, a municipal sandy beach. </p><p>  Like many other Miami hotels, Sonesta Beach resort does not offer guests animation.  Therefore, in its territory it is always quiet and calm.  For entertainment you can drive to the nearby Art Deco district, where there are many nightclubs and restaurants. </p><p>  Visitors to Sonesta Beach have repeatedly noted the quality of service, comfortable rooms, furnished with the latest technology and furniture, good, varied food. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The disadvantages of the hotel include a large number of Russian tourists (if for someone it's a minus), and complaints from tourists about the additional charge of money when leaving the hotel. </p><p>  <strong>Ritz Carlton South Beach 5 *</strong> </p><p>  This fashionable hotel is located on <span>Miami Beach.</span>  Nearby there are shops and restaurants. </p><p>  Stylish rooms with views of the <span>Atlantic Ocean,</span> equipped with everything necessary for a comfortable stay.  For those who combine vacation in Miami with work, the rooms have a computer with fax.  The marble bathrooms include towels, bathrobes, a hairdryer and all the necessary hygiene products. </p><p>  The developed infrastructure of the hotel makes it an ideal place for business trips.  A modern conference room and a business center allow organizing meetings and negotiations. </p><p>  A gift shop on site will offer a large selection of gifts for your friends and family.  The Ritz Carlton has all the facilities for weddings and other celebrations. </p><p>  The hotel is famous for its SPA - center, where guests are provided with a variety of treatments for body and facial skin. </p><p>  Dishes from the hotel's restaurants will appeal to all vacationers. </p><p>  Ritz Carlton is not in vain won the love of tourists.  The service in it is simply impeccable.  The food is very tasty and varied.  Throughout the hotel, including the beach, perfect cleanliness is always maintained. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, the hotel is just perfect.  Even demanding guests are unlikely to be able to find its negative sides.  Even with some problems with settlement, everything is solved very quickly.  The only minus of the rooms: relatively low ceilings. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <strong>Ocean Point Resort &amp; Club 5 *</strong> </p><p>  Located on Sunny Isles Beach, this hotel is close to some of Florida's attractions. </p><p>  Large, bright rooms offer beautiful views of the Atlantic Ocean.  The room has almost everything that other five-star Miami hotels offer, plus a kitchen, washing machine, internet and heating.  Rooms for non-smokers and people with reduced mobility are available. </p><p>  In addition to plenty of entertainment, the hotel's guests are offered a wide selection of SPA treatments, massages and other wellness programs. </p><p>  Ocean Point Resort's property is within walking distance. </p><p>  The hotel's restaurants will win you over with famous seafood dishes and other dishes. </p><p>  The hotel deserves grateful reviews from tourists.  Well-trained staff copes with their duties.  The area is very clean and well maintained.  Like other Miami hotels, Ocean Point Resort does everything to make your stay comfortable.  Moreover, the cost of rest in it is much lower than in other hotels of this level. </p><p>  But even in such a fabulous place, demanding vacationers are able to find minor flaws.  Unreasonable furniture in some rooms and high prices in restaurants - this is perhaps all that can overshadow your vacation. </p><p>  The delighted reviews of the Miami hotels mentioned above confirm their comfort.  Therefore, there is no doubt that your vacation spent in one of these hotels will be remembered as one of the best. </p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
