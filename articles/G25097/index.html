  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thrice Heroes of Socialist Labor: list, brief information</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  More than 200 thousand citizens of the USSR have been awarded the title Hero of Socialist Labor since the appearance of this award in the country.  The first medal, dubbed the Hammer and Sickle, was awarded to JV Stalin in 1939.  The second awarded in 1940 was V. A. Degtyarev, a renowned designer who was involved in the development of small arms.  The topic of the article is three times Heroes of Socialist Labor, a list and brief information about them. </p><h2>  About the atomic project of the USSR </h2><p>  In May 1940, a decree was issued on the possibility of receiving the Hero of Socialist Labor award twice or even thrice.  In 1973, the restrictions were lifted, which gave a hypothetical opportunity to the most honored workers of science and industry to receive a medal for the fourth time.  However, during the period of the award no one received such an honor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kemokiev.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Julius Borisovich Khariton" class="if uuid-2764217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/2764217.jpg"></div><p>  In the course of work on an atomic project in the USSR, a nuclear bomb was created, after which in 1953 five scientists, production organizers and designers, for the first time in history became three times Heroes of Socialist Labor.  We list them: </p><ul><li>  I.V. Kurchatov, project manager.  Today, the name of the physicist is assigned to the scientific center, the founder of which he was.  Until his death in 1960, he headed the Institute of Atomic Energy. </li><li>  Yu. B. Hariton.  He was in the position of chief designer.  The scientist lived a long life, until 92 years old he headed KB-11 (Sarov), created at the USSR Academy of Sciences, at Laboratory No. 2. </li><li>  K. I. Shchelkin, First Deputy Yu. B. Khariton.  Kirill Ivanovich passed away at the age of 57 years, in 1968.  He went down in history as the first scientific supervisor of a nuclear center, known as Chelyabinsk-70. </li><li>  Ya. B. Zeldovich, a physicist who headed the theoretical department.  Yakov Borisovich passed away in 1987.  He led an enterprise developing a nuclear shield for the country. </li><li>  <span>N. L. Dukhov,</span> another deputy of Yu. B. Khariton.  The lieutenant general was a developer of nuclear weapons, but he is also known as a designer of heavy tanks.  Three times Hero of Socialist Labor Nikolai Leonidovich since 1941 engaged in the production of KV tanks on the basis of ChTZ (Chelyabinsk Tractor).  From 1943 to 1948, he served as chief designer, setting up their conveyor production.  Among his developments, the following modifications: IS, KV-1s, KV-85.  The scientist passed away in 1964 at the age of 59 years. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.biblioatom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikolay Leonidovich Dukhov, designer of heavy tanks" class="if uuid-2764242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/2764242.jpg"></div><p>  It is curious that the fact of rewarding the participants in the atomic project has been kept secret for a long time, so the Uzbek cotton grower was officially the first three times Hero of Socialist Labor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Figures of the CPSU and agricultural production </h2><p>  Hamrakul Tursunkulov received the 3rd medal in 1957.  He headed the cotton farm, whose name - "Star of the East" - was booming throughout the country.  After the death of Hamracul in 1965, his name was given to the collective farm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="amarok-man.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hamrakul Tursunkulov" class="if uuid-2764224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/2764224.jpg"></div><p>  Three CPSU figures on the list of thrice Heroes of Socialist Labor.  All of them are quite famous: </p><ul><li>  N.S. Khrushchev, who received the medal in 1961.  After 3 years, the first secretary of the Central Committee also received the star of the Hero of the USSR. </li><li>  D. A. Kunaev, party leader in Kazakhstan.  He was awarded the third medal in 1981. </li><li>  K.U. Chernenko, Secretary General of the CPSU, who received the award for his 73rd birthday. </li></ul><h2>  Statesmen and aircraft designers </h2><p>  It is curious that the <span>nuclear industry</span> for a long time belonged to secondary engineering, so in the list of three times Heroes of Socialist Labor you can see the minister and his deputy, who were leaders in the development of nuclear weapons.  This is Slavsky E.P., who received the last medal in 1962, and Vannikov B.L., who was awarded almost simultaneously with scientists - in 1954. </p><p>  In the 70s, the most eminent aircraft designers joined the ranks of three times awarded: </p><ul><li>  A.N. Tupolev, head of OKB-156.  Andrei Nikolaevich, who raised a galaxy of scientists and aircraft designers, passed away in 1972 at the age of 84. </li><li>  S.V. Ilyushin, founder of the design bureau of his own name and developer of the famous IL-2.  The designer passed away in 1977 at the age of 82 years. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="museum-moshkovo.nsk.muzkult.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thrice Heroes of Socialist Labor" class="if uuid-2764213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/2764213.jpg"></div><h2>  Scientists </h2><p>  It remains to name three more scientists, one of which is associated with space exploration and two with nuclear energy.  Thrice Heroes of Socialist Labor: </p><ul><li>  <span>Mstislav Keldysh, a</span> specialist in applied mathematics, a member of the team of S. Korolev and who has done a lot for the flight of both an artificial Earth satellite and a manned spacecraft.  He passed away in 1978 at the age of 67 years. </li><li>  A.P. Aleksandrov, who headed the NRC <span>"Kurchatov Institute"</span> after the death of the great scientist.  He died at the age of 91 in 1994. </li><li>  <span>A. D. Sakharov,</span> one of the creators of the hydrogen bomb, became the youngest among scientists who received a third medal called "Hammer and Sickle."  This happened in 1861, when the theoretical physicist was only 40. </li></ul><p>  In 1980, Andrei Dmitrievich was stripped of all awards and was expelled from Moscow for participating in human rights activities.  Therefore, it is officially considered that only 15 people are awarded with the Hammer and Sickle Medal three times. </p>
