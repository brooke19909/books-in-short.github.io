The works accumulated since then cover almost all aspects of the political, cultural, and economic development of the tsarist, republican, and imperial periods.  As a result of the class struggle between powerless plebeians and omnipotent patricians, a new post was formed, designed to protect the lower layers of the population. </p><h2>  The origin of the Institute of National Tribunes </h2>

    <p>  The people's stands are an elected post, the main purpose of which was to ensure legal protection of the common people from the arbitrariness of the authorities. </p><p>  Plebeians are a practically disenfranchised category of the population that was formed as a result of social struggle.  They were entitled to a small piece of land.  But it was precisely on the plebeians that the Roman imperial power sought to rely on; they wanted to make them the main force of the army.  For the first time, a mixture of the lower and upper layers of the population occurred during the reign of Servius Tullius.  He carried out a reform of the administrative system - in place of tribal tribes came territorial.  The male population was divided into 6 categories, regardless of origin.  In the tsarist period, the election of authorities was virtually eliminated, but with the establishment of the republic, public assemblies began to gather.  Century commissions replaced the king and had similar powers.  Patricians monopolized power in the Senate.  At the same time, the plebeian struggle for rights escalated - they wanted to get equal opportunities with the patricians in public life, sought to limit the debt percentage.  In 494 BC  e.  - in protest against the Senate - the plebs gather on <span>Sacred Mountain.</span>  This was the first secession.  The Senate made concessions and allowed the organization of a magistrate and the post of defenders of popular rights. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What does the word "people's stands" mean?

    <p>  The plebeians were able to offer armed resistance, since by that time many were in the army and had certain skills.  The people's stands are a position that arose as a result of a campaign against the patricians.  The latter were scared and made concessions.  But not everyone was happy about the formation of a new position.  A fierce struggle was waged by Marcius Coriolanus - he launched a large-scale war.  The battle was stopped at the request of the patricians themselves, who wished to establish peace.  Then it became clear what the word ‚Äúpeople's stands‚Äù really means - not just an elected position, but the result of the aspirations and struggles of the entire incompetent people of Rome.  Social struggle showed the viability of the new post and its strength. </p><h2>  Powers and Responsibilities </h2>

The stands could affect the decision of the magistrate, the Senate.  They did not have power only over censors and dictators.  Their rights were expressed in the ability to veto, fine magistrates, ordinary citizens for various violations.  Over time, they received legislative rights. </p><p>  The doors of his house should always be open to the people - the people's stands, a sacred person in Rome, was obliged at any time to provide support and protection to those who needed it.  We can say that he was attached to Rome - it was impossible to leave the city for more than a day. </p><p>  This position was the center for the development of democratic ideas and aspirations.  But they had to work harmoniously, otherwise the confrontation caused stagnation and the inability to make a single decision.  At different times, powers and rights were different and gradually disappeared during the empire. </p><h2>  New post development </h2><p>  With the approval of the tribune of enemies, the plebeians did not become smaller.  The most large-scale struggle with them was the patrician clan Apiev Klavdiev.  The chronology of events of the republican period is studied at school, the theme is ‚ÄúAncient Rome‚Äù (Grade 5). </p><p>  Over time, the stands became larger - the number increased to 10. During the rule of the Decemvirs, the position was temporarily abolished.  The resumption of the activities of the stands is associated with the adoption of the laws of the ‚ÄúXII tables‚Äù.  They have changed a lot: rights, powers, composition of tribes. </p><p>  According to the laws of Valery and Horace, the plebiscite had national power.  The rostrum in Rome gradually gained legislative rights.  Soon the <span>unequal marriage of</span> plebeians and patricians was resolved.  By the 4th century BC  e.  The comitia of the tribunes became the legislative assembly.  At that time, a great victory was achieved - obtaining part of the land from the ‚Äúcommon field‚Äù of conquered lands, <span>debt obligations</span> became not so burdensome.  The plebeians were able to apply for the post of consul - the first was Licinius Stolon.  For the IV century BC.  e.  The people's stands are an inviolable state person with the right of <span>legislative initiative.</span> </p><h2>  The time of great laws </h2>

    <p>  Guy and Tiberius Gracchi - the people's stands, which managed to pass the most fateful laws related to the agrarian situation in the country.  A special commission was created to work on the bill.  The essence of the proposal is the nationalization of the lands, thanks to which many centuries it became rich to know, and their transfer to the people.  The popular assembly passed the law, but the patricians began to show armed resistance.  Tiberius was killed, but Guy continued his activities. </p><p>  He was also elected by the people's tribune, but pursued a different policy.  His laws were more flexible in relation to all strata.  <span>Judicial reform</span> elevated the riders, almost equating their influence with the greatness of the senators.  Guy put a lot of effort into creating overseas colonies.  Its main goal was Carthage. </p><p>  Guy's activity frightened the patricians.  The Senate gave preference to the opponent of Gracchus, as a result, the reformer was also killed - by his own order, the slave inflicted a mortal wound on the podium.  This decision was made due to the death of Guy's supporters in an armed duel with the Senate.  <span>Reforms of the Gracchus brothers</span> were defeated. </p><h2>  Years of decline </h2><p>  The Senate gradually restricted the rights of the stands.  For a short period, due to the confrontation between optimists and populations, their influence and prestige increased again.  But the unresolved land problem hit the popularity of the tribune.  Livia Druz‚Äôs attempt to implement his agrarian bill ended fatally - he was killed. </p><p>  Weakened the stands and the dictator Cornelius Sulla.  According to his law, the senate was to confirm legislative initiatives.  And the stands could not apply for the position above.  During the time of the consuls Crassus and Pompey, all privileges were temporarily returned. </p>

    <p>  The post lost its former meaning after Julius Caesar came to power - he declared himself an eternal tribune for the people.  All emperors did the same.  The post finally disappeared in the 3rd century A.D.  e.  The people's stands - it was only a relic of the republican period of the development of Rome. </p>
