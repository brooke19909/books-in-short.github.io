    <p>  <span>Feudal fragmentation</span> in Russia, the reasons for which are hidden in the economic and <span>political development of</span> early feudal society, existed until the end of the 15th century.  The formation of large land ownership against the background of the predominance of subsistence farming in the Old Russian state inevitably contributed to the transition of estates to independent production complexes.  However, their economic ties were limited to the nearby district.  The craftsmanship and trade needs that existed at that time could easily be met in fairly rapidly developing political and economic centers - cities.  At the same time, the number of cities grew and the population increased due to the rise of productive forces.  Developed and those settlements that previously did not have significant economic value. </p><p>  Feudal fragmentation in Russia was formed in conditions of inevitable social contradictions between the lower and upper ranks of early feudal society.  The resulting class of land owners sought to establish in various forms of dependence (both legal and economic) the agricultural population.  However, the class antagonisms (disputes) that took place in the 11th-13th centuries were mostly local in nature and, as a rule, local government intervention was sufficient to resolve conflicts without involving state forces. </p><p>  The feudal fragmentation in Russia took place under the conditions of the need for social and economic independence of the patrimonial boyars (large landowners) from the central government.  In this case, the boyars were against the need to share their income with the Grand Duke.  In addition, they supported the rulers in individual principalities in their struggle for political and economic independence. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Feudal fragmentation in Russia was an inevitable fact.  As part of this process, there was a further development of the culture and economy of the state as a whole.  At the same time, one should speak of a more solid establishment of the emerging system of relations between feudal lords. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, the collapse of the former single state had certain negative consequences.  The main of them, historians call the weakening of the protection of the country's lands from external attacks, especially if a sufficiently strong invader is likely to appear. </p><p>  The feudal fragmentation in Russia outwardly represented the actual division of the country's territory between members of a significantly enlarged princely family. </p><p>  It should be noted that some signs of decay began to appear after the death in 1054 of <span>Yaroslav the Wise.</span>  The system of isolated principalities arose as a result of the struggle between his descendants, who enjoyed the support of local boyars. </p><p>  For a short period, during the <span>reign of Vladimir Monomakh, the</span> rise of Kiev happened.  He again became an all-Russian center.  During this period, the separatist sentiments of local rulers were suppressed, the external enemy, the Polovtsy, was defeated. </p><p>  The country fell into decline again with the death of Monomakh.  At the same time, feudal fragmentation began in Russia.  The causes and consequences of this period have historical significance for the whole country. </p><p>  After the death of the son of Monomakh, Mstislav the Great, about fifteen independent regions were formed on the site of one state.  Among them are Polotsk, Chernihiv, Galitskaya, Novgorod, Rostov-Suzdal, Smolensk and others.  Moreover, within each of them, the process of political fragmentation and economic isolation continued.  Thus, each of the parts of a large state turned, in turn, into a system of small semi-independent principalities. </p>
