The Vysotsky Monastery with the blessing of Sergius of Radonezh in 1374 was founded by Prince Vladimir the Brave - a relative and associate of Dimitry Donskoy.  The monastery rises on a hill, surrounded by tall and dense forests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vysotsky Monastery in Serpukhov" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/601540.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Serpukhov </h2><p>  Vysotsky Monastery is not the only thing this small town is famous for.  The first mention of it can be found in the spiritual letter from Ivan Kalita, dating back to 1339.  Built on the Oka borders as a fortress during a long confrontation with the Mongol-Tatar conquerors, and later became an obstacle for the Polish invaders, this settlement was long considered an outpost of the <span>principality of Moscow.</span> </p><p>  Serpukhov is famous for its history: Ivan IV and Boris Godunov held troop reviews here, Vasily Shuisky and peasant leader Ivan Bolotnikov gathered regiments. </p><p>  Today, there is a male Orthodox monastery and Vladychny <span>female monastery,</span> as well as a cathedral in honor of Nikola Bely and many temples.  Here is also the only miraculous ‚ÄúInexpressible Chalice‚Äù on the territory of our country.  Serpukhov annually receives thousands of pilgrims and simply people who come to the icon to heal them from many ailments and ‚Äúsorrows‚Äù, including from addiction to alcohol. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Foundation History </h2>

This period is marked by the time of the service of St. Sergius.  The Vysotsky Monastery <span>in Serpukhov</span> was founded in 1374, when, as the chroniclers testify, Prince Vladimir began to equip this settlement.  Fencing it with oak walls, Vladimir appointed his governor in it.  Then the prince turned to the Monk of Radonezh with a request to give a blessing to decorate the capital city with a holy building.  Sergius at that time lived here in Serpukhov.

    <p>  About when and by whom the Vysotsky Monastery was founded in Serpukhov, an inscription narrated in detail on the outside of the church, erected in honor of the Monks Sergius and <span>Athanasius of Athos</span> and existed in the ensemble until 1967.  The holy elder recited the prayer, which is still daily offered here during the service. </p><p>  Athanasius became the first abbot of the holy monastery.  He - his beloved disciple - was appointed by the Rev.  The monastery got its name from the place where it was built.  It was founded on a beautiful high hill, which the people called "High". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  First Rector </h2><p>  Even while serving in the Holy Trinity Monastery, the disciple of St. Sergius gained fame as a book writer and pundit, who worked hard in the name of the revival of spiritual traditions lost by Russia during the years of the Tatar captivity.  Thanks to this, under his leadership, the Vysotsky Monastery in Serpukhov gained fame as a center of Byzantism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Serpukhov Vysotsky Monastery how to get there" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/601536.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 1374, Nikon of Radonezh became the first prince in this holy monastery.  Over time, Prince Vladimir Andreevich built a cathedral in the monastery, a warm church, a refectory, which at that time was a rarity. </p><h2>  Historical meaning </h2><p>  One of the features of the Vysotsky Monastery is its border position: it was located on the southern borders of the Moscow Principality.  Until the 17th century, the Oka, being a border, divided the Russian lands with the Steppe.  Defensive lines were created along it, which protected the state from the frequent attempts of devastating raids by restless neighbors from the south. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Serpukhov Vysotsky Monastery" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/601538.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Vysotsky monastery in Serpukhov was often used as a fortress, so it was constantly under threat of destruction. </p><h2>  Annals </h2><p>  In 1382, the Khan of the Golden Horde Tokhtamysh, having attacked Russia, tried to force her to pay tribute again.  During the war, along with Dmitrov, Rostov and other cities, Serpukhov was destroyed, and the Vysotsky Monastery was devastated. </p><p>  The half-world-semi-military position of this holy monastery could not but affect her life.  Here, a very active inner life subsided for a long time.  From the point of view of her external splendor, the end of the 15th - beginning of the 16th centuries did not become a time of her prosperity: powerful clerical support declined with the death of Prince Andrew. </p><h2>  Hard times </h2><p>  In the era of Ivan the Terrible, the economic life of the monastery was restored again.  The first tsar visited the Vysotsky monastery in Serpukhov three times.  His pilgrimages were accompanied not only by rich contributions, but also by the provision of benefits.  By the 50s of the 16th century, the monastery on Vysokoye had 4 graveyards, almost 90 villages and a forest. </p><p>  Boris Godunov no less favored her.  However, royal mercies were relegated to the background before the threat of an invasion of foreigners.  Especially difficult for the monastery was the end of the XVI - the beginning of the XVII centuries.  It was at this time that not only the monastery, but the whole Serpukhov district was ravaged and burned. </p><h2>  Rebirth </h2>

    <h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  The main building of the monastery is a summer cathedral church, erected in the name of the Conception of the Virgin.  Existing today, according to architectural traditions, it belongs to the style of the middle of the XVI century. </p><p>  The cathedral is built in the shape of a regular square.  Its two-light quad is set on a high basement, in the masonry of which there is the foundation of the predecessor church, which burned down during the next invasion of the Golden Horde.  An altar ledge adjoins the eastern part.  <span>This apse</span> has a unique faceted appearance, decorated with narrow slit-like windows.  On three sides around the cathedral there is a covered stone porch in two tiers, like a bypass gallery.  The various-sized arches of the gallery rest on massive square pillars. </p><p>  Initially, the entrance was arranged using stone stairs.  However, by the beginning of the 20th century, only one of them remained - located on the southwestern facade of the cathedral.  The lower part of the cathedral was once used as a tomb.  At the end of the XVII - the beginning of the XVIII centuries, using the Naryshkin means, they rebuilt the upper part of the cathedral, changing the arches and arranging a four-sloped roof. </p><h2>  Recovery </h2><p>  Until the end of the 20th century, the Vysotsky Monastery in Serpukhov was in desolation.  And only in 1995, full-scale restoration work began in it.  In September 2001, on the day of memory of St. Athanasius, the great consecration of the cathedral took place.  The rite was performed by the Metropolitan of Krutitsky and Kolomenskoye Juvenal at the service of several bishops.  This is exactly what everyone who comes to see Serpukhov sees it. </p><h2>  Vysotsky monastery - how to get there </h2><p>  Pilgrims and tourists come here by buses No. 3, No. 8 and No. 20, departing from the city forecourt.  From the stop to the cathedral two minutes walk.  By car, you can drive to Serpukhov first along Simferopolsky, and then along Borisovsky highway.  At the first intersection from the traffic light, you need to turn left onto Tsentralnaya Street, then right - onto Progonnaya, and then onto Second Moskovskaya.  From it to the first big turn to Bolshaya Vysotsky Lane is only three hundred meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vysotsky monastery in Serpukhov reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/601539.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Miraculous icon </h2><p>  The monastery is famous for the fact that it is here that the "Inexpressible Chalice" is located.  Serpukhov annually receives thousands of pilgrims who come here in the hope that she will help get rid of alcoholism and smoking, drug addiction and many ailments.  Initially, this icon was installed in the local Vladychny Convent, but was subsequently lost.  There is a version that it, along with other images of saints, was burned on the banks of the Nara during the years of hard times. </p><p>  In the 90s of the last century, two copy-lists of this icon were written.  One of them is now in the <span>Vladychny Convent,</span> and the second in the Vysotsky <span>Monastery</span> .  It is believed that both of them are equivalent, since the icons do not have copies at all, they all have the same power. </p><h2>  Impressions </h2>

    <p>  Male pilgrims can stay at the monastery for three days.  For each day of stay you need to donate from 280 rubles, and for this you can get not only an overnight stay, but also lunch and dinner.  Those who want to extend their stay in this holy monastery will need to turn to the dean and receive his blessing.  After that, the pilgrim will turn into a worker who does not donate money, but is obliged to work hard in the monastery. </p>
