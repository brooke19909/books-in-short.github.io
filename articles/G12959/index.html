These amazingly beautiful places of the <span>Altai Territory are</span> presented in orderly rows of mountain ranges, dense forests, picturesque banks and spacious river valleys. </p><p>  <span>This is a wonderful</span> Mountain Charysh.  The photo, location and description of this beautiful earth corner are presented in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fr.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Mountain Charyosh Nature" class="if uuid-2814421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2814421.jpg"></div><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Charysh called the basin of the river of the same name, surrounded by <span>mountainous terrain</span> with spurs of ridges.  The picturesque coast is amazing in its beauty.  The banks seem to squeeze the water flows of the river in their grip, sometimes weakening them, thereby contributing to the formation of a beautiful flowering valley. </p><p>  The source <span>of the Charysh River</span> is located on the northern slope of the Korgon Range (Ust-Kansky District).  He carries away the bubbling waters of the tributaries of the Korgon and Kumir, and as a result he turns into powerful bubbling streams that jump over numerous rapids and rapids. </p><h2>  Location and characteristics of water resources </h2><p>  This taiga mountain zone is located in the Altai Territory.  It covers the interfluve of Charysh and Anui. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lakes of the Mountain Charysh" class="if uuid-2814472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2814472.jpg"></div><p>  There are no large lakes in the area, only in the upper reaches of the Charysh River tributaries there are small, but rather deep carafic lakes, which are a kind of natural attraction of the area.  On the Beshchalsky ridge (its north-western part) at an altitude of 1750 meters there is Lake Bashchelakskoe up to 23 meters deep, filled with clear turquoise water.  A little further away is the deeper Lake Talitsky.  There are also very small natural reservoirs (in diameter up to 100 meters), however, they are also very picturesque.

They are located on the steep banks of the middle reaches of the river.  Most of them were cleared by the locals, as they believe that they can find a treasure.  Bats caves, the Bastion and the Novo-Chagyrsky mine are popular with tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Caves of the Mountain Charm" class="if uuid-2814422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2814422.jpg"></div><p>  There is an archaeological complex in the Mountain Charysh called the Royal Mound.
