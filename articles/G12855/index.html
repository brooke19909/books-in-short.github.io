  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Money evolution</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Money, of course, is a historical category that arose as society developed.  The evolution of forms and types of money has been considered by many economists, and not all of them come to a single classification.  Some authors identify full and inferior forms of money.  Others, taking as a basis natural-functional signs, subdivide money into commodity, full-fledged and irreplaceable. </p><p>  The evolution of money has led to the fact that by now their commodity form has already disappeared.  From here comes a new interpretation.  Money, as an instrument of social economic relations, are: </p><p>  - a medium of exchange; </p><p>  - a measure of value; </p><p>  - accumulation method; </p><p>  - means of payment. </p><p>  But there is another definition that directly takes into account the evolution of money.  It was formulated by K. Marx.  Money is a product that has stood out from the commodity world in a spontaneous manner, it is the universal equivalent and acts as a crystallization of exchange value.  Based on these definitions, it is possible to classify the types and forms of money as follows: </p><ol><li>  Presentation of money has the following forms: <ul><li>  cattle, furs, slaves, shells, etc. </li></ul></li><li>  Full money: <ul><li>  gold and silver bullion; </li><li>  gold and silver in coins. </li></ul></li><li>  Defective money: <ul><li>  treasury bills; </li><li>  tickets </li><li>  <span>bill coin.</span> </li></ul></li><li>  Quasi-Money: <ul><li>  <span>cash</span> on savings and term deposits in banks. </li></ul></li></ol><p>  The evolution of money was also due to the development of commodity production.  As a result, two types of money appeared: real (metallic money and equivalent goods) and value signs, which, in fact, are substitutes for real money (credit and paper money).  Speaking about real money, we must remember that their <span>face value</span> corresponds to real. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Let us consider in more detail how the general evolution of the forms of money took place. </p><p>  Initially, metallic money, as a rule, gold, silver or copper, was in use in a piece and weight form.  Then came the ingot forms and curly (jewelry).  The prototype of the coins was the bean-shaped form of ingots of the same mass and size.  The word coin was coined in Rome in the 3rd century BC.  The Roman Mint printed coins that had a state stamp guaranteeing their solvency.  Coins made a very important change in money circulation - now they are not taken into account by weight, but by the face value indicated on them, which meant the amount of metal used. </p><p>  Metal money has an independent intrinsic value.  The establishment of value signs on coins over time was associated with a number of reasons that led to an increase and expansion of commodity circulation. </p><p>  - High consumption of precious metals and the inability to mine more precious metals. </p><p>  - High costs of servicing coin circulation. </p><p>  - The difficulty of moving a large mass of metal for cash settlement. </p><p>  - Lack of elasticity - the ability to contract and expand. </p><p>  - Gold and silver had limited consumption in other areas. </p><p>  - The state, using the monopoly on the minting of coins, made profit from this, reducing the sample and the mass of metal and leaving the face value unchanged. </p><p>  The presence of the above factors led to the continued evolution of money.  Substitutes for real money - credit, paper money and a bill coin.  Their nominal value has already begun to exceed the real value. </p><p>  The state emits paper money, assigning it a course at its discretion, since they do not have independent value.  For the state, this is an additional <span>source of income.</span>  As a rule, the issue of money increases at a time when the state is at war or in a state of crisis. </p><p>  With the development of commodity production, credit money also appears.  They become necessary if the purchase and sale involves an installment plan or a <span>deferred payment.</span> </p>
