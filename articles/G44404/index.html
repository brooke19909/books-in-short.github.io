  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Principles of Education in Pedagogy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The learning process is a complex system that includes the learning activities of both the teacher and the student, and based on real or perceived patterns that become the pedagogical principles of learning. </p><p>  The principles of teaching in pedagogy can be divided into general teaching and methodological.  General didactic principles of teaching in pedagogy are principles that are proclaimed by general didactics and are mandatory in the study of any subject. </p><p>  Methodological principles are divided into general and particular methodological principles of teaching in pedagogy.  General principles include principles such as: a differentiated approach, the use of various exercises, techniques and teaching methods, the identification of specific landmarks (showing, explaining, reinforcing), motivation and an integrated approach to motivation.  Particular methodological principles of teaching include such principles as the principle of oral advancing, parallel learning, communicative orientation, the principle of oral basis. </p><p>  The didactic principles of teaching in pedagogy include the principle of scientificness, systematicity and consistency, visibility, consciousness and activity, accessibility and feasibility, the principle of taking into account age-related characteristics and the principle of strength of knowledge and skills acquired by students. </p><p>  The principle of scientificness consists in the formation of a system of scientific knowledge among students, in the analysis of educational material, the allocation of important, significant ideas in it, in the identification of possible intersubject connections, in the use of reliable scientific facts and knowledge, as well as in the use of accepted scientific terms. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A major role in the implementation of the scientific principle is played by <span>technical teaching aids,</span> videos, educational films, cinema films, and so on. </p><p>  <span>The principle of consistency</span> implies that knowledge and skills will be inextricably linked and form an integrated system, that is, the training material will be learned at three levels: the level of reflection, understanding and assimilation.  At the first level, the student should have a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe subject, at the second he should master the theoretical knowledge of the subject, and at the third - the practical skills that are achieved as a result of exercises and training. </p><p>  The essence of the <span>principle of accessibility</span> is to reflect the principles of continuity, gradualness and sequence of training.  That is, first you need to identify previously formed knowledge, skills, and only then gradually give new ones, without forcing this process and without jumping over certain stages.  When organizing training, you need to choose such methods, means and <span>forms of training</span> that would correspond to the level of mental, psychological and <span>physical development of the</span> student. </p><p>  The principle of visualization involves not just an illustration of the studied subject or phenomenon, but the use of a whole range of tools, techniques and methods that provide the formation of a sharper and clearer perception of the reported knowledge.  A large role in using the visual method belongs to verbal comments. </p><p>  For example, when teaching any kind of motor action, you need not just to show this or that exercise, but be sure to comment on it, getting the student to become aware of each phase of the movement.  The student must not only form his motor idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe action being studied, but also feel all the features of this action. </p><p>  <span>The principle of consciousness and activity is</span> based on the formation of students' motivation, internal need for the need to study a particular material, systematic excitement to the material being studied.  If the student has no desire to study this or that material, then there will be no benefit from classes. </p><p>  The principle of the strength of the formed knowledge, abilities and skills is impossible without highlighting the main thing in the educational material and connecting it with the knowledge already available to the student.  In order for the knowledge and skills to become the internal property of the student, you need to include them in the student‚Äôs belief system.  It is also necessary to ensure a constant connection of educational material with practical activities. </p><p>  The principles of training and education should be carried out taking into account age and individual characteristics.  However, in each group of schoolchildren - both by age and in each class, some individual differences are often manifested, manifested in the peculiarities of the development of any mental processes, in the difference in the level of development of abilities, as well as the orientation of interests and needs. </p><p>  The individual characteristics of boys and girls also differ.  All pedagogical principles of teaching should take into account these real differences.  In no case can you rely on the fact that there is any completely universal recipe suitable for all cases. </p>
