Surely you heard something about her.  This is an important section of modern biology.  It became, like physics, one of the main priorities in the world economy and science at the end of the 20th century.  Half a century ago, no one knew what biotechnology was.  However, the foundations were laid by a scientist who lived in the 19th century.  Biotechnology received a powerful impetus to development thanks to the work of Louis Pasteur, a researcher from France (years of life - 1822-1895).  He is the founder of modern immunology and microbiology. </p><p>  In the 20th century, genetics and molecular biology developed rapidly using the achievements of physics and chemistry.  At this time, the most important direction was the development of methods by which it would be possible to cultivate animal and plant cells. </p><h2>  Surge in research </h2>

    <p>  In the 1980s, there was a surge in research in biotechnology.  By this time, new methodological and methodological approaches had been created, which provided a transition to the use of biotechnology in science and practice.  There was an opportunity to extract from this a great <span>economic effect.</span>  According to forecasts, biotechnological products were to make up a quarter of the world production at the beginning of the new century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Work carried out in our country </h2><p>  Active development of biotechnology occurred at this time and in our country.  In Russia, a significant expansion of work in this area and implementation of their results in the 1980s was also achieved.  In our country, during this period, the first national-level biotechnology program was developed and implemented.  Special interdepartmental centers were created, biotechnology specialists trained, departments were founded, and laboratories were formed in universities and research institutions. </p><h2>  Biotechnology today </h2><p>  Today we are so used to this word that few people ask themselves the question: "What is biotechnology?"  Meanwhile, getting to know her in more detail would not be out of place at all.  Current processes in this area are based on methods of using recombinant DNA and <span>immobilized enzymes,</span> cellular organelles or cells.  Modern biotechnology is the science of cellular and genetic engineering technologies and methods for creating and using transformed genetically biological objects in order to intensify production or create new types of products.  Three main areas are outlined, which we will now discuss. </p><h2>  Industrial Biotechnology </h2>

    <p>  For the field of green biotechnology, genetic engineering is of particular importance.  Using it, prerequisites are created for transferring the genes of one plant species to others, and thus scientists can influence the development of stable characteristics and properties. </p><p>  Gray biotechnology is used to protect the environment.  Its methods are used for the treatment of sewage, soil rehabilitation, gas and exhaust air purification, and waste processing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But that is not all.  There is also white biotechnology, which covers the scope of use in the chemical industry.  Biotechnological methods in this case are used for an environmentally friendly and efficient production of enzymes, antibiotics, amino acids, vitamins, as well as alcohol. </p><p>  And finally, the last variety.  Blue biotechnology is based on the technical application of various organisms, as well as marine biology processes.  In this case, the center of research is the biological organisms that inhabit the oceans. </p><p>  We move on to the next direction - cell engineering. </p><h2>  Cell engineering </h2>

    <p>  She is engaged in the production of hybrids, cloning, the study of cellular mechanisms, ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù cells, and genetic mapping.  Its beginning dates back to the 1960s, when a method of hybridization <span>of somatic cells</span> appeared <span>.</span>  Cultivation methods have already been improved by this time, and methods for growing tissues have also arisen.  Somatic hybridization, in which hybrids are created without the participation of the sexual process, is carried out today by cultivating various cells of lines of the same species or using cells of different species. </p><h2>  Hybridomas and their meaning </h2><p>  Hybridomas, that is, hybrids between lymphocytes (ordinary cells of the immune system) and tumor cells, have the properties of parental cell lines.  They can, like cancers, divide indefinitely on nutrient artificial media (that is, they are "immortal"), and can also, like lymphocytes, produce homogeneous <span>(monoclonal) antibodies</span> with a specific specificity.  These antibodies are used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, as sensitive reagents for organic substances, etc. </p><p>  Another area of ‚Äã‚Äãcellular engineering is the manipulation of cells that do not have nuclei, with free nuclei, as well as with other fragments.  These manipulations come down to combining parts of the cell.  Such experiments, along with microinjections of dyes or chromosomes into the cell, are carried out to find out how the cytoplasm and nucleus affect each other, what factors regulate the activity of certain genes, etc. </p><p>  Using the compound in the early stages of development of cells of various embryos, so-called mosaic animals are grown.  Otherwise they are called chimeras.  They consist of 2 types of cells that differ in genotypes.  Using these experiments, they find out how differentiation of tissues and cells occurs during the development of the organism. </p><h2>  Cloning </h2>

    <p>  Modern biotechnology is unthinkable without cloning.  Experiments related to the transplantation of the nuclei of various somatic cells into enucleated (i.e., nucleus-free) egg cells of animals with further cultivation of the resulting embryo into an adult organism have been ongoing for more than a decade.  However, they have gained very wide popularity since the end of the 20th century.  Today we call these experiments animal cloning. </p><p>  Few people are not familiar with the Dolly sheep today.  In 1996, near Edinburgh (Scotland), the first cloning of a mammal was carried out at the Roslyn Institute, which was carried out from an adult cell.  It was Dolly the sheep who became the first such clone. </p><h2>  Genetic Engineering </h2><p>  Appearing in the early 1970s, <span>genetic engineering</span> has made significant strides today.  Its methods transform the cells of mammals, yeast, bacteria into real "factories" for the production of any protein.  Such an achievement of science provides an opportunity to study in detail the functions and structure of proteins in order to use them as medicines. </p>

    <p>  The basics of biotechnology today are widely used.  Escherichia coli, for example, has become in our time a supplier of important hormones of growth hormone and insulin.  Applied genetic engineering sets itself the goal of constructing recombinant DNA molecules.  When introduced into a specific <span>genetic apparatus,</span> they can give the body properties that are beneficial to humans.  For example, you can get "biological reactors", that is, animals, plants and microorganisms that would produce substances that are pharmacologically important for humans.  Advances in biotechnology have led to the possibility of breeding animal breeds and plant varieties with traits that are valuable to humans.  Using genetic engineering methods, it is possible to carry out genetic certification, create DNA vaccines, diagnose various genetic diseases, etc. </p>
