    <h2>  Interior layout </h2><p>  Kontinent shopping and entertainment complex has an unusual arrangement of internal premises.  The main characteristic of the layout is the inner central "street".  Only instead of houses on it are shops, as well as places for entertainment and relaxation.  Thought out in the shopping center and the movement of visitors.  In order to be able to quickly and conveniently get to the desired room, ‚ÄúContinent‚Äù operates slow escalators, as well as fast elevators.  Hiking is possible with the stairs located right there. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bowling Park </h2><p>  Guests of the Continent shopping center have the opportunity to get real pleasure and plunge into the colorful world of entertainment.  For them, the complex operates a bowling alley.  The Continent on Stachek offers visitors twenty-four tracks that run until six in the morning every day.

    <p>  It is worth noting the interesting decor of this entertainment area.  The attention of visitors is attracted by the lighting of bumpers, running lights and the glow of the tracks.  Bowling Park offers an extensive range of services.  Here it is possible to order a turnkey complex event, which, depending on the budget, can be a modest buffet or the most luxurious celebration.  Dividing the park into three zones, each of which has four, six and fourteen tracks, allows individual companies to play. </p><h2>  Cinema opening </h2><p>  In March 2006, the Karo Film network invited Petersburgers to the building of the Continent shopping and entertainment complex, located in the Kirovsky district of the Northern capital.  Here, on the fourth floor, the opening of the Karo Film Continent movie theater on 99 Stachek was held. This is a seven-day modern multicomplex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Cinema "Karo Film Continent" on Stachek has a favorable location.  It is located at the intersection of several highways of the metropolis, which are classified as major.  In addition, the Kirovsky district, where the Continent shopping center is located, is one of the most dynamically developing in the city.  All this, as well as the modern equipment of the cinema, allowed him to enter the list of the best multiplexes in St. Petersburg and gain great popularity among the audience.  Nearby is the Komendantsky Prospekt metro station. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The style inherent to the Karo Film multicomplexes is easily recognizable by the audience.  First of all, the design of all cinemas has a tendency to futurism.  The same characteristic can be given to the Continent complex on Stachek.  In the lobby of the cinema, the viewer finds himself in a bright world of shiny surfaces and rich colors. </p>
