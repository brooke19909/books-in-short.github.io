    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Going on vacation, it is worth considering that at the hotel you can expect not only positive moments, but also some shortcomings and shortcomings.  Unfortunately, Avala Resort &amp; Villas (Montenegro) is no exception.  Guest reviews indicate the following: </p><ul><li>  there is practically no ventilation in the corridor, and therefore there is a smell of dampness and the walls are covered with mold; </li><li>  the furniture is very old and shabby, and also obviously has not been cleaned from accumulated dust for a long time; </li><li>  the shower room in the standard room is equipped so that the water not only spills on the bathroom floor, but also enters the bedroom; </li><li>  wireless internet is very slow; </li><li>  there are a lot of cigarette butts on the beach (it would not hurt to install ashtrays or ban smoking altogether); </li><li>  room cleaning is rather weak; </li><li>  in the shower and sink, the drain is clogged, and therefore the water leaves very slowly; </li><li>  despite the fact that the territory of the hotel is relatively quiet, music is playing loudly in a nearby hotel late, which will interfere with your relaxation; </li><li>  if you choose a credit card payment method, then be prepared for the fact that there may be confusion and more funds will be written off from the account than is required; </li><li>  breakfasts are repeated every day (it is especially strange that in the morning they serve salads that have remained in the restaurant since the evening); </li><li>  the pool is very small for such a large number of vacationers, and there are very few umbrellas around it, which creates unpleasant conflict situations between vacationers; </li><li>  there is no ladder to go down to the beach, and therefore you have to get to it along an inconvenient slope; </li><li>  quite often, hotel staff forget to collect pre-ordered lunch boxes for guests; </li><li>  any malfunctions constantly occur with door locks; </li><li>  maids regularly have to remind about the need to clean the room, replace bedding and towels, as well as replenish the cosmetic set; </li><li>  almost all surfaces in the bathroom are covered with fungus; </li><li>  very strong audibility between the rooms, as well as from the corridor; </li><li>  overpriced, if we correlate it with the quality of services and living conditions; </li><li>  a lot of sharp stones on the beach; </li><li>  the wellness center works only a couple of hours in the afternoon, and therefore visiting it is very inconvenient; </li><li>  upon registration, guests are required to make a deposit, and after leaving, they will not remove the lock from the account (in fact, this money is not returned to guests); </li><li>  When booking an airport pick-up and transfer, you cannot be completely sure that your request will be fulfilled. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  A rather positive impression is formed about the resort hotel Avala Resort &amp; Villas 4 *.  Budva is a beautiful city with lots of historical sights.  And given the convenient location of the hotel, you will have the opportunity to get to know this resort as close as possible.  In addition, it is worth noting that the territory itself deserves attention.  Given that the main building adjoins the mountain on which the villas are located, the landscape promises to be interesting. </p><p>  An unforgettable impression on travelers is such a resort as Montenegro, Budva.  Hotel Avala Resort &amp; Villas 4 * can serve rather for sleep and relaxation than to become a full-fledged place to stay.  The fact is that the situation in the hotel is very old, and therefore, if you stay here all day, you will certainly begin to annoy it.  It is also worth noting the poor quality of cleaning in the rooms.  As for the beach, it is better to look for something outside the hotel if you do not want to walk on sharp stones and cigarette butts. </p><p>  You should also pay attention to nutrition at the Avala Resort &amp; Villas.  The reviews suggest that the maximum that should be included in the price of the stay is breakfast (and this is because in the early morning you are unlikely to want to look for a suitable cafe).  The fact is that the food here is monotonous and not very tasty.  In addition, there is a practice of leaving the next day those dishes that were not sold out in the evening.  And this, as you know, is fraught with poisoning and other unpleasant consequences.  It is better to get acquainted with the cuisine of Montenegro in numerous local cafes and restaurants. </p>
