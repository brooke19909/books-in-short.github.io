  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Belgorod and Voronezh. Two cities with difficult transport accessibility</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Belgorod and Voronezh are two cities that constantly compete for the title of the capital of the Black Earth Region.  Despite the fact that the regions are nearby, moving from one locality to another can be quite difficult.  Let's try to figure out together how to get from Voronezh to Belgorod and vice versa. </p><h2>  How to get there by car? </h2><p>  Traveling in your own car will be a difficult challenge.  The reason for this is the distance in km.  Voronezh and Belgorod are equidistant from each other by more than 250-300 kilometers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newslanc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian roads" class="if uuid-2390269" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2390269.jpg"></div><p>  The problem is that between these cities there is no normal highway on which you can move at a speed of more than 110 km / h.  You will have to travel mainly through large and small settlements, which means that there is a high risk of catching a speeding ticket.  Just think about it, 250-300 kilometers, not exceeding the citywide speed limit!  Leaving Voronezh for Belgorod, you should move along the so-called "Kursk" highway in the southwestern microdistrict of the city, and then carefully follow the signs. </p><p>  So the road by car is a very tedious and long enterprise.  Therefore, we will consider other ways of delivering ourselves from Voronezh to Belgorod. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get on the bus? </h2><p>  From the bus stations of both cities there are regular bus services.  Several buses per day allow you to get to Voronezh and Belgorod at the required time of day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="evobsession.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://evobsession.com/moscow-getting-ev-buses-2016/"><img itemprop="image" alt="russian bus" class="if uuid-2390265" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2390265.jpg"></div><p>  True, this scheme also has its pitfalls: </p><ol><li>  Firstly, for a bus trip around the Chernozem region it is very expensive.  A ticket costs on average from 600 to 700 rubles. </li><li>  Secondly, the daily flight is 6 hours.  Imagine that in the same time you can get by train from Voronezh to Moscow. </li><li>  Thirdly, the bus goes with stops, which makes the trip especially uncomfortable, not to mention the fact that the bus will not be the most convenient and modern. </li></ol><h2>  How to get there by train? </h2><p>  The distance from Voronezh to Belgorod was not a serious reason for launching regular trains between the two cities.  An open schedule does not exist.  But you can clarify the possibility of moving to some suburban station at the station, but this option, of course, is far from the most convenient.  Among other things, long-distance trains run between the two regions.  I don‚Äôt really want to use them, because they go even longer than the bus.  Yes, and the cost of the trip is more than a thousand rubles, which makes this option of travel absolutely uncomfortable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the train is going" class="if uuid-2390268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2390268.jpg"></div><h2>  A plane, or the last hope for a fast and comfortable road </h2><p>  Experienced travelers know that flights are a more economical and faster way to travel.  But this condition does not apply to Belgorod and Voronezh.  You can fly only with a change in Moscow.  Surprisingly, the travel time, taking into account the transplant, will take about 4 hours 20 minutes.  This means that it is even faster than a day bus.  True, prices bite, because for an air trip you will have to pay more than 4 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  What to do? </h2><p>  If you urgently needed to get from one capital of the Black Earth region to another, at first glance, you can only sympathize with your situation.  But everything is not so bad, use our recommendations, and the situation will be saved: </p><ol><li>  Try using the travel search service.  Someone needs from Belgorod to Voronezh or vice versa?  Well, for 300-400 rubles you can take one of the places in a car.  It happens that under the guise of a driver looking for a fellow traveler, a private bus is hiding.  But this is not a problem if you are brought quickly and inexpensively. </li><li>  Call the bus station in advance and book a ticket with a convenient schedule. </li><li>  The central stations of both cities always have private buses, which are ready to deliver you to the desired point faster and at affordable prices. </li></ol><p>  Now you know how to solve this problem. </p>
