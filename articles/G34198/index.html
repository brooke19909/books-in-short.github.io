    <p>  <strong>What money to take to Turkey</strong> </p><p>  In Turkey, the currencies of many countries are popular, they are readily accepted in stores and in markets.  The dollar is considered the most popular.  When asked about how much money to take to Turkey, you will never get a definite answer.  If you are traveling to the country on a package tour, you can not even go beyond the borders of the hotel, as they have beaches and entertainment, and all expenses are already included in the price of the trip.  Another thing if you decide to visit the famous Turkish markets.  Here you should already recall the main rule of the eastern bazaar - you must bargain!  Here, of course, keep your wallet wider, because you have not seen so many temptations anywhere, especially since the prices here are an order of magnitude lower than in your native country: T-shirts from 2 to 10 dollars, jackets for <span>100 dollars.</span>  It is because of this that avid shopaholics bring with them an extra suitcase with new things and souvenirs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>How much to take money to Turkey</strong> </p><p>  A big surprise awaits you about prices.  Here they grow like mushrooms, and fall like bricks from the sky.  It all depends on how you look!  If you are a girl, then the price of the goods will be lower.  If several girlfriends came with you, then there will be a discount even more, but the most profitable company for someone who wants to save money is a Turkish citizen.  The most disadvantageous company is a European or an American: prices will be very high.  However, there is good news - these rules do not apply to stores.  There the prices are fixed. </p>

    <p>  <strong>What money to take to Turkey and how much</strong> </p><p>  We remind you that the most useful currency for you will be dollars.  We advise you to put most of the money on a bank card for the convenience of transportation and storage, but we warn you that if you decide to pay by credit card in stores, you should specify how much interest will be charged for this.  Sometimes even 7% of the amount of purchases can be deducted from you!  We also do not recommend using electronic cards late in the evening, when the banks either no longer work or are going to close, because if your ATM card is swallowed, it will be very difficult to return it.  The same applies to the day you leave home.  Do not risk withdrawing money before returning.  In case of problems with the card, you can linger for a few more days - here these issues are not quickly resolved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <strong>What money is in Turkey</strong> </p><p>  The state currency of the country is the lira.  It used to be extremely inconvenient to use this currency unit due to high inflation, which added a lot of zeros to the banknotes.  However, the economic reform carried out last year simplified monetary relations, and now it is as convenient to pay with local currency as it is with dollars.  Do not forget to bring Russian rubles with you so that there is something to return home from the airport for. </p>

    <p>  <strong>What money to take to Turkey: lira</strong> </p><p>  If you are worried about whether it is worth stocking up a lyre while you are still at home, the answer will be this: the dollar is most popular in this country, and this currency is accepted at all retail outlets.  The exception is remote rural areas, where you hopefully will not get.  Buying a lyre in advance is not worth it.  If necessary, you can easily exchange rubles for local currency at the nearest Turkish bank.  Just do not use the services of private "money changers", otherwise pay too much.  Even in your own hotel you can sell the local currency much more expensive than the real rate. </p><p>  On average, one trip to this country costs about $ 1,000 if you were very modest in your expenses, and more than $ 2,000 if you allowed yourself to relax a little.  Of course, you will have something to remember and put on, but will you have time to demolish all this for a year before the time comes again to go on <span>vacation abroad?</span> </p>
