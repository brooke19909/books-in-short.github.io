  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to delete music from iPhone?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Congratulations!  You have become the happy owner of the brand new iPhone that you have been dreaming of for so long!  But not even a month passed, as you realized that in order to download the latest game or a movie that just appeared at the box office, there is not enough space in your smart iPhone.  There is only one way out - to delete some of the music files from it.  In this article, you will learn how to remove music from your iPhone and thereby free up the space you need for recording movies, games, photos and e-books. </p><p>  I must say that Apple products are in great demand all over the world today, and the iPhone has become one of the most popular and coveted phone models.  Nevertheless, many happy owners of these phones face certain problems in their operation, the most common of which is how to delete music from the iPhone. </p><p>  You won‚Äôt be able to delete music from your iPhone in the old "old-fashioned" way (by connecting the phone to a personal computer and simply deleting the selected files) for one simple reason: the iOS operating system, under which your device actually works, is a file system closed type.  As a result, the computer does not recognize your iPhone as a removable disk, which makes it impossible to view the information contained in your phone, edit or delete it.  All you can do is drop pictures and photos from your phone to your computer. </p><p>  But do not panic, considering that you haven‚Äôt bought such an advertised phone in vain.  In fact, removing music from the iPhone is quite real, and there‚Äôs nothing complicated about it.  All you have to do is install iTunes on your computer, which you can download on the Internet.  If you need to update the program, you can do this after installing it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So how to remove music from iPhone?  All downloaded music tracks will be in your application ‚ÄúMusic‚Äù.  Of course, it‚Äôs not at all necessary to download music there.  In this case, it will be necessary to remove it from the installed program - sometimes it is easier, but you should not rely on it.  Just swipe your finger on the musical composition, the ‚Äúdelete‚Äù icon will appear, and with a simple click the song will be deleted.  The same method may work with the Music application.  But as soon as you connect the phone to the computer and start the iTunes program, all the tracks that you have deleted will be downloaded to your iPhone again.  Someone may consider this a flaw in the iPhone and turn out to be wrong: this is how the iPhone takes care of the safety of your library. </p><p>  But back to our problem, <span>how to remove</span> music from the iPhone.  As mentioned above, first of all, you need to install the convenient iTunes program on your computer and run it. </p><p>  Connect the phone to a personal computer using a usb cable.  ITune will detect your phone - you can see it in the "Devices" section.  Device synchronization starts.  Once it is finished, you will need to click on the inscription ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù in the iTunes section of the program ‚ÄúDevices‚Äù.  Activate the "Overview" section in the menu of your phone.  In this section you can see all the information about your phone.  In the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù subsection, be sure to check the box that you want to synchronize your selected songs, and then go to the music section (already on your iPhone, but not iTunes) and check the boxes for what you want to sync. </p><p>  Next, go to the "Music" section of iTunes.  Select the files you would like to delete.  Important: if you hold down the Ctrl button, you can select not only individual music tracks, but even entire albums. </p><p>  When the selection of files for deletion is completed, press Delete on the keyboard of your computer.  All is ready.  Music you don‚Äôt need has been removed from your iTunes library.  As you can see, nothing super complicated.  Of course, if you figure out what and how to do it. </p><p>  We hope that now you will not have any problems with your phone, but you already know how to delete music from the iPhone. </p>
