    <p>  About six months ago, a new generation of tablets appeared on the market - Huawei MediaPad T3 10.  Reviews about the device are ambiguous, so there is nothing to deal with, especially since the gadget received a good "stuffing" and an interesting design.  The tablet is not so different from its younger brothers in this series, but there are some noteworthy innovations. </p><p>  So, the subject of this review is almost a ten-inch tablet (9.6 ") Huawei Mediapad.  Customer reviews about the model, its advantages and disadvantages, as well as the main characteristics of the gadget will be considered in our article. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The device is delivered in a box of a blue color, familiar to the brand, from thick cardboard.  The front part of the package is occupied by the image of the tablet itself, and at the back you can see a brief specification for the gadget and icons of awards received by the device at exhibitions.  At the ends, barcodes, labels, stickers and more are habitually located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The box can not be called cheap, as well as the internal content, where all the accessories are beautifully in place and do not interfere with each other thanks to competent floor inserts.  The manufacturer did not save on packaging and this is evident. </p><p>  The kit consists of: </p><ul><li>  Huawei MediaPad T3 10 tablet itself; </li><li>  <span>mains charger</span> ; </li><li>  universal USB cable (micro) for synchronization with PC and charger; </li><li>  tool for working with SD- and SIM cards; </li><li>  case-stand (optional); </li><li>  documentation. </li></ul><p>  Options ordinary.  In some cases (as a nice bonus) comes across a cover-stand.  According to reviews on the tablet "Huawei MediaPad T3 10", users have no complaints about the delivery set.  Other surroundings (for example, handbags or styluses) can be purchased separately to your taste and color.  Any additional accessory to the basic version adds an already considerable price, which the domestic consumer does not need. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The first thing that catches your eye is the compactness of the gadget.  It is very easy to confuse it with the younger brother in this line and even easier - with eight-inch devices.  Here the whole thing is in a very thin framework around the perimeter of the gadget, which can definitely be added to the advantages of the tablet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Reviews on the ‚ÄúHuawei MediaPad T3 10‚Äù regarding such a framework are mixed.  On the one hand, we have a stylish and compact solution for a 10-inch device, but on the other, the ergonomic part suffers.  Many people are accustomed to working with the tablet on weight, that is, putting their fingers on the display, and narrowing the frames, as well as reducing the "safe zone", provokes accidental clicks on the screen, which is sometimes annoying. </p><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  The body of the device is made of aluminum.  The exception was the plastic insert.  Underneath is an antenna.  In the upper right part there is a peephole of the frontal camera, which slightly enters the rounded end. </p><p>  On the upper edge (in horizontal orientation) you can see the decorative microphone grill, and on the opposite side below - the speaker hole.  On the left side is a micro-USB port and a hybrid interface for SIM cards.  There is also a receiver for external media and an audio output mini-jack (3.5 mm).  On the right side there is only a power key and a rocker for adjusting the volume. </p>

    <p>  Judging by the reviews on the tablet "Huawei MediaPad T3 10", users are satisfied with the design of the device and the build quality.  The gadget makes a good impression with its appearance, and the interface elements are tightly fitted to the case, so you will not see and will not hear squeaks, backlashes and other budget problems. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The tablet was equipped with a mediocre IPS-matrix with a scan of 1280 by 800 pixels and a density of 157 ppi.  Pixelization is not striking, but if you look closely, individual dots become visible.  HD-resolution is the maximum, the matrix capabilities are not designed for more, so lovers of super-sharp pictures are better to choose something else for themselves. </p><p>  There are no air gaps - this means that the angular view of the Huawei Mediapad T3 10 is in the maximum range (for the IPS-matrix).  With a strong change in the angle of color, they do not lose their original gamut, but darken, and the display itself appears highlighted. </p><p>  The device lacks an automatic light sensor, so you have to manually adjust the contrast and brightness.  Users in their reviews have repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with such an omission: after all, the tablet is for 10 thousand rubles, and not for 6, and it would be possible to equip the device with at least some kind of environmental sensor. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The filling of the tablet looks quite modest.  Performance fell on the shoulders of the 425 quad-core Snapdragon chip on four cores, and the same mediocre Adreno 308 is responsible for the graphics. </p>

    <p>  2 GB of RAM is enough for the interface to work flawlessly, but the device, alas, does not always pull serious and modern gaming applications.  If the latter successfully starts, then the graphic part will have to be reset to average or minimum values.  There are no problems with games of two years or more ago - everything works, flickers and runs without subsidence on the FPS. </p><p>  16 GB of internal storage (of which about half is available to the user) is enough to store music, photos and other files.  But for video content you have to get an external SD-card, since the volume of those is limited to as much as 128 GB. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The tablet is equipped with a 4800 mAh battery.  Given not so productive stuffing, along with a mediocre screen matrix, the battery life of the device is at an acceptable level. </p><p>  If you properly load the device with a ‚Äúheavy‚Äù toy or video sequence at 720p, then the battery will discharge in 6 hours.  In a combined mode of operation (Internet, an hour of games, reading, viewing a photo), the gadget is enough for the whole day.  Using it as a book for a night or a couple of hours a day, the battery charge can be extended for two, or even three days. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  Before us is the Internet tablet Huawei Mediapad T3 10 LTE.  He showed himself perfectly as a conductor, but only partially pleased with multimedia capabilities.  Yes, he does not pull on the flagship model, but this is not required of him.  He "fulfills his value" and, as an everyday working assistant, will fit 100%. </p><p>  If you are a fan of serious modern games and applications, and also you can‚Äôt live without a high-quality picture on the screen, then it is better to look at other gadgets from the premium segment.  And our respondent can be called a solid middle peasant in his class without claims to leadership. </p><p>  The estimated cost of the tablet is about 10,000 rubles. </p>
