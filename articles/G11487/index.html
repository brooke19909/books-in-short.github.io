    <h2>  Phone niche </h2><p>  Initially, Highscreen Hercules was positioned as the flagship device.  Its price compared to others was significantly lower.  This contributed to a significant increase in sales of this device in 2015.  Now this gadget can still be bought.  Since the start of sales of this smartphone, there has been a significant update to the lineup of this class of digital devices.  This led to the fact that the hero of this review has already become a mid-range solution.  But this does not mean that its performance will not be enough to solve any problem.  He will cope with any program for Android. </p><p>  This smartphone has 2 color variants of the case.  One of them is black, which is more practical (fingerprints and occasional scratches are not so noticeable on it).  And here is Highscreen Hercules White <strong> </strong>  requires a more accurate attitude and is better suited for the weak half of humanity. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Typical configuration, as for most ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phones, the hero of this review, which includes this: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li><p>  The gadget itself with a battery. </p></li><li><p>  Wired headphones and a microphone. </p></li><li><p>  Charger with USB output port. </p></li><li><p>  Interface cord. </p></li><li><p>  Warranty card. </p></li><li><p>  Gadget User Guide. </p></li></ul><p>  In the above list, there is not enough protective film for the front panel of the device.  Although it is protected by 3rd generation GorillaGlaz impact-resistant glass, this does not mean that under certain adverse circumstances scratches or any other undesirable damage will not appear on the surface. </p><p>  The body of the device is made of carbonate.  Although this material is quite durable, it can also be damaged.  Therefore, to maintain the original state of the gadget, you must immediately purchase a case for Highscreen Hercules immediately upon purchase of the device.  Another accessory not included in the initial delivery is a memory card.  In principle, without it, you can work quite comfortably on this device, but some of the most advanced users of the integrated storage capacity of 16 GB will not be enough.  In this case, without such an accessory will simply not do. </p>

    <h2>  The design of the device, its ergonomics </h2><p>  Most of the front panel, like many similar devices, takes a touch display.  Under it is a control panel of 3 touch buttons.  A peephole of the front camera, a spoken speaker and a number of sensors are displayed above the display.  A lock button (it is also used to turn the device off and on) and a wired audio jack are placed on the upper edge of the device.  On the opposite side is micro-USB and a talk microphone.  On the left are two slots for SIM cards, and on the right is a slot for a flash drive and volume controls. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the back cover is the main camera with LED backlight and a loud speaker.  Here is the hole of the second microphone, which provides during the conversation, the suppression of external noise.  As noted earlier, this gadget can be purchased in 2 color options.  One of them - Highscreen Hercules Black is more practical.  It does not attract dirt so much, and possible damage to it is almost invisible.  And here is Highscreen Hercules White <strong> </strong>  this just can not boast.  In this case, the owner of the digital device will be required to use his digital friend more carefully. </p><h2>  The semiconductor heart of a smartphone </h2><p>  A very powerful processor solution is used in Highscreen Hercules.  Reviews add to this that this smartphone without any problems copes with almost any task, including the most difficult one.  There is nothing surprising.  The gadget uses the MT6592 CPU developed by Mediatek.  It immediately includes 8 computing modules.  On the one hand, they are based on the A7 architecture.  Its distinctive feature is a high degree of energy efficiency.  But, on the other hand, the frequency of each module can reach a maximum load of 2 GHz.  So it turns out that in this processor energy efficiency and performance are harmoniously combined.  Therefore, even the most demanding software today on this device will go without the slightest hitch (including the most recent three-dimensional toys). </p>

    <h2>  Gadget Graphic Accelerator </h2><p>  Smartphone Highscreen Hercules <strong> </strong>  equipped with a graphic accelerator "Mali-450MP".  This chip has four graphic cores, each clock frequency of which can reach 700 MHz.  All this allows you to process images in FULL HD format without any problems.  Also, the presence of such a productive graphics solution allows you to completely free from the processing of images displayed on the screen of the central processing unit.  Also, this chip can easily cope with any currently existing software for the Android platform. </p><h2>  Display and its parameters </h2><p>  Of course, the strong point of this mobile solution is the touch screen.  Its diagonal is 5 inches, and the resolution is 1080 pixels (in width) and 1920 pixels (in height).  That is, in this case, the image in FULL HD format is displayed on the screen.  The display matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmanufactured using the most common IPS technology to date.  The same nuance provides high quality color reproduction and large viewing angles. </p>

    <h2>  Device memory subsystem </h2><p>  The amount of RAM in this device is 2 GB.  After the system software download is complete, about half of it will be used by system threads and applications.  And the second half is designed to run the software of the device owner.  This is quite enough for any program.  Moreover, if you use simple applications, you can immediately start 2-3.  This will not affect the work of the gadget. </p><p>  The sufficiently large capacity of the built-in drive in Highscreen Hercules is 16 GB. <strong> </strong>  About 4 GB is initially filled with preinstalled system software.  The user can use the remaining 12 GB to store personal data and install application software.  In most cases, this is enough for comfortable work.  But, when 12 GB of integrated disk space is not enough for any reason, you can use an external flash card.  Its capacity can be equal to a maximum of 32 GB.  In the event of a breakdown or loss of a smart phone, it is recommended to make copies of the most valuable information once every 2 weeks to some cloud service.  In this regard, it is most advantageous to use domestic Mail.Ru.Oblako or Yandex.Disk.  Such a solution will probably avoid data loss. </p><h2>  Autonomy and battery </h2><p>  High-performance Hercules boasts average autonomy.  Overview <strong> </strong>  The technical specifications of this device indicate the presence of a 2200 mAh battery.  At the same time, the case of this ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone is non-separable, and you won‚Äôt be able to install another battery yourself. </p><p>  Now consider that the CPU in this case is 8-core, and the screen combines FULL HD resolution and a 5-inch diagonal.  Therefore, even in the most economical mode of using the device, the owners of this device can count on 2 days of battery life.  On average, this value is exactly reduced to 1 day.  Well, when you start some demanding toy, you can count on 4-6 hours of work.  To improve the autonomy of this gadget, it is recommended to additionally purchase an external battery with increased capacity.  Of course, this is not a very economical solution, but the presence of such an accessory will allow you not to worry about the fact that the smartphone will stop working at the most inopportune moment for this. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Smartphone Highscreen Hercules is equipped with a very high-quality main camera.  She has a 13 megapixel sensor.  There is a LED backlight and an auto focus system.  At a normal level of illumination, photos obtained with its help do not cause complaints.  But with a lack of luminous flux, the quality of images is significantly reduced.  But the same minus is inherent in the majority of similar devices, and this domestic cell phone in this regard does not stand out with anything unusual.  Video in this case can be recorded as FULL HD (30 frames per second).  At the front camera, the sensor is more modest - only 5MP.  But its capabilities are quite enough for video calls and selfies. </p><h2>  Software component </h2><p>  The most popular and most common software platform is at the heart of Highscreen Hercules.  Overview <strong> </strong>  system software indicates the presence of "Android".  Only here its version in this case is slightly outdated - 4.4.  But, on the other hand, the presence of this operating system is quite enough to run any existing software on this device for this platform.  Updates, apparently, can not be expected.  Since the advent of version 5.0, a lot of time has passed, and the manufacturer has not yet released a new firmware. </p>

    <h2>  Feedback from direct users, reviews </h2><p>  There are certain disadvantages to Highscreen Hercules.  Reviews primarily distinguish these from them: </p><ul><li><p>  Low battery capacity and, as a result, short battery life.  As stated earlier, the only solution to this problem is to purchase an additional external battery with increased capacity. </p></li><li><p>  The second important minus is the outdated version of system software.  For most users, this is not so important: any software of this software platform will run without problems on this smartphone.  So there should be no problems with this. </p></li></ul><p>  But the relatively low price and optimal technical specifications make Highscreen Hercules Black an absolute bestseller in the mid-range segment.  But this cannot be said about devices in a white version.  This color is not so practical in everyday life.  Especially for a smartphone that can be taken out of the case many times a day and actively used to solve various problems. </p><h2>  <strong>The cost of the device today</strong> </h2><p>  Initially, Highscreen Hercules was estimated at 19,000 rubles.  The price made it the most affordable offer in the flagship device segment at the beginning of 2015.  Now its cost has decreased, and you can already become the proud owner of such a gadget for less than 10,000 rubles.  In this case, the software and hardware capabilities of the device will be quite enough to solve any problem in the next 2 years. </p>
