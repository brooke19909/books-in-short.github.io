    <h2>  Ostafyevo Manor - historical information </h2><p>  Collegiate assessor K. Matveev in 1751 bought the village of Ostafyevo and the small village of Klimovo from the cornet of Alexander Golitsyn.  He immediately united these two settlements and built a house.  In 1758, the new owner of the estate opened cloth and colorful factories in Ostafyevo.  This was the beginning of the development of weaving and spinning in the district.  Later, his wife built the church of the Holy Trinity and the Great Martyr George, which has survived to this day. </p><h2>  Ostafyevo - the estate of the princes Vyazemsky </h2><p>  For almost a hundred years this estate belonged to the Vyazemsky family.  With this noble surname is the heyday of the estate.  In those days, it took on its historical form, which we can see today. </p><p>  Andrei Ivanovich Vyazemsky, who at forty-four became secret adviser, was one of the youngest dignitaries of the state.  A man with a sharp mind, well-educated and educated, he had an independent character.  Always acted as he considered necessary, in spite of any advice and traditions.  For example, his marriage, which has long been whispered in high society. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="estate ostafievo russian parnas" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/542438.jpg" width="550"></div>

On one of his trips, he met a beautiful, married woman, Irish Jenny Queen.  He passionately fell in love with her, took her away from her husband and married in 1786.  His wife received the name of Evgenia Ivanovna Vyazemskaya. </p><p>  At that time, the situation was scandalous - a descendant of the Grand Dukes, Rurikovich was married to a Catholic, a foreigner, who was also already married.  Andrei's parents did not survive this and both died in the year of the marriage of the prince. </p><p>  The prince sold the Oudinot estate, with which there were too many memories and sad events, the culprit of which, albeit involuntary, he became.  In 1792, the prince buys Ostafyevo.  The estate is rather modest and it is not clear why it attracted the Vyazemskys.  At that time on its territory there was only a small house built of stone, two wooden wings and several outbuildings, which were located in the back of the yard.  A park with a <span>linden alley</span> adjoined the house <span>.</span>  The prince got rid of all the old buildings except the barn.  In the summer of 1798, work began on the repair and restoration of the dam, the installation of lamps and forged gratings on the bridge. </p><p>  In parallel with the repair work, a park was created.  In 1800, the prince resigned and devoted himself entirely to the construction and improvement of the family nest.  However, to realize his plans, he was not destined.  In 1807 he died.  He left his son Peter under the care of his closest friend, the historian Karamzin, who shortly before this sad event married his daughter Vyazemsky Catherine.  He settled in Ostafyevo, where for 12 years he wrote "History of the Russian State." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ostafievo manor how to get" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/542437.jpg" width="550"></div>

The estate turned for him into a place of detention, where he lived under the strict supervision of the police. </p><p>  At this time, the best representatives of the creative intelligentsia of that time visited here: V. A. Zhukovsky, K. N. Bvtyushkov, V. P. Pushkin (uncle of the poet), A. I. Musin-Pushkin, I. I. Dmitriev.  Here were the future Decembrists M.S. Lunin, V.K. Kyukhelbeker.  Stopped in the estate N.V. Gogol, A.S. Griboedov, Adam Mitskevich and A.S. Pushkin himself. </p><p>  Subsequently burdened with debts, Pyotr Andreyevich returned to Petersburg and made a brilliant court career.  From that moment on, the Vyazemskys practically did not come to Ostafyevo.  The estate has fallen into disrepair.  Perhaps she could have collapsed in those days if she had not had a new owner - Prince P.P. Vyazemsky - a passionate collector, author of many famous works on the history of Russian culture.  He collected icons, sculpture, painting, bronze, porcelain, books, weapons.  All this wealth went to Ostafyevo.  The estate and the park have been restored. </p><p>  Then the son of Prince Peter, who lived in St. Petersburg and came to Ostafyevo very rarely, became the owner of the estate.  The estate did not generate income, and it was decided to sell it to the historian Count S. D. Sheremetyev.  An honorary member of the Academy of Sciences, owner of Kuskovo and Ostankino, Sergei Dmitrievich understood the value and historical significance of Ostafyevo. </p><p>  He completely put the estate in order, restored the main building and erected monuments to Vyazemsky, Karamzin and Pushkin - people whose life was connected with Ostafyevo.  The estate was actually the first museum in Russia associated with the name of Pushkin.  Since 1903, Ostafyevo and nearby Nikolskoye received a reserve status by a government decree. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ostafyevo estate of the princes of Vyazemsky" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/542436.jpg" width="550"></div>

Pushkin.  One of them is the Ostafyevo estate.  The great poet came here to his close friend, the most famous owner of this estate - Prince P. A. Vyazemsky. </p><p>  Alexander Sergeevich came to Ostafyevo three times.  He was always a welcome guest for the Vyazemsky.  The poet has read a lot here from the Boldin autumn that he created in a momentous for his work. </p><p>  Since 1982, the Pushkin holidays in Ostafyevo have been held annually on the first Sunday of June.  The estate, whose address is: 142001, Moscow Region, Podolsky District, is met by thousands of poetry lovers every year.  Everyone who cherishes the name of the great poet can come to his monument and read his ingenious poems and lay flowers. </p><h2>  Ostafyevo after the revolution </h2><p>  The post-revolutionary fate of Ostafyevo is perfectly understandable.  The museum-estate in 1918 was nationalized.  From that moment on, it became the property of the state.  Property took control of the new government. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ostafievo manor how to get there" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/542435.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The Sheremetyevs did not abandon their brainchild, did not emigrate abroad.  They considered it a matter of honor to stay and save Ostafyevo, Ostankino, Kuskovo.  They obtained a <span>letter of protection</span> from the new authorities for the estate.  For their own safety, they had a letter of recommendation signed by Lunacharsky.  In 1918, S. D. Sheremetev died, and his son Paul was appointed the first director of the museum and the keeper of the estate.  In 1928, he was dismissed without explanation, and his whole family was evicted from the estate.  The fate of the estate was a foregone conclusion. </p><p>  In the spring of 1930, the museum in Ostafyevo was abolished, valuable exhibits were removed from it.  Some of them, such as a collection of icons of the 15th-17th centuries from Old Believer monasteries that Vyazemsky received as a gift from the Synod, were burned right on the estate's territory. </p><h2>  Museum revival </h2><p>  Today, thousands of tourists come to the Podolsky district, located near Moscow, to see the most interesting monument of Russian history and culture.  Of course, <span>this is the Museum-Estate of</span> Ostafyevo "Russian Parnas". </p><h2>  Walk in the park </h2><p>  Nowadays, Ostafyevo is a manor (you can see the photo in our article), consisting of a large house with two wings and a magnificent park.  It is not very big, but quiet and comfortable.  According to many tourists, the main advantage of this park is that even on weekends there are few people in the alleys, the area is very clean. </p><p>  There is a large well-kept pond in the park, and on the Lipova Alley, which A. S. Pushkin called ‚ÄúRussian Parnas‚Äù, you can see monuments to P. A. Vyazemsky, Karamzin, Pushkin. </p><h2>  Manor tours </h2><p>  Almost at the entrance to the estate is the Trinity Church, which is part of the palace and park ensemble.  It was created by an unknown architect in the style of early classicism.  The church was consecrated in 1782.  In Soviet times, it was closed, and only in 1991 its reconstruction began.  Today it is an active temple, which runs a Sunday school. </p><h2>  Main Manor House </h2><p>  The central place in the estate is occupied by a two-story building.  The house was built in the style of Russian classicism.  There were once ceremonial rooms on the ground floor, and living quarters on the second floor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ostafievo estate address" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/542434.jpg" width="600"></div>
