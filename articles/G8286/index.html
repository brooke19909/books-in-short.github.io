This is the oldest settlement in the country, leading its history from the beginning of the XII century.  What interesting tourist can see here?  What ancient monuments are preserved in the city to this day?  Our article will tell about the main sights of Borisov. </p><h2>  History, geographical location, interesting facts </h2><p>  Borisov is one of the oldest Belarusian cities.  It was founded in 1102 by the Polotsk Prince Boris (Rogvolod) Vseslavich.  Actually, his name bears the city to this day.  In the annals of Borisov, it is mentioned as a patrol fortress of the Principality of Polotsk (this historical fact is reflected in its current coat of arms). </p><p>  Due to its favorable transport position, the city grew and developed as an important shopping center.  In the middle of the XVI century Borisov received Magdeburg Law and became a stumbling block in numerous conflicts between the specific princes.  This city played an important role in two global wars: the Patriotic War of 1812 and the Great Patriotic War (1941-1945). </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="54.23249527058923" data-lng="28.511182482031245" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/7/2/5/3725.png"></div><p>  The modern city of Borisov is the most important industrial center of Belarus.  It is located within the Minsk region, northeast of the state capital.  With a relatively small population (approximately 150 thousand people), about 40 different enterprises work here.  The most famous products of the city are represented by starters, generators and turbochargers.  In addition, matches are produced in Borisov, medical containers, as well as crystal products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is curious that in the list of Borisov‚Äôs twin cities 15 settlements are located that are located throughout the post-Soviet space.  Among them are Estonian Narva, Ukrainian Kremenchug, Moldavian Drochia and Russian Mytishchi. </p><h2>  Borisov: reviews and impressions of tourists </h2><p>  More recently, few people knew about this city outside of Belarus.  But when the BATE football club sensationally made it into the Champions League group stage, many Europeans began to wonder: what kind of club is this, and where is this Borisov?  The interest of Russian tourists in this small Belarusian city was also revived. </p><p>  Nevertheless, travelers from other countries still rarely come here, giving preference to the capital - Minsk.  But those tourists who visited here call Borisov a completely modern, progressive city with a sufficient number of ancient buildings and military monuments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gabisworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Borisov" class="if uuid-2507022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2507022.jpg"></div><p>  The city is divided into two parts <span>by the Berezina river</span> .  The left bank is built up with old brick houses of the XIX-early XX centuries.  The right-bank part is represented by new buildings and panel blocks of the second half of the last century.  But here you can see quite interesting examples of Soviet architecture made of white silicate brick. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the beauty and appearance of the old buildings, some tourists compare Borisov with another Belarusian city - Bobruisk.  The colors of the facades are dominated by yellow and pink.  Of all the sights of Borisov, travelers are advised to definitely visit the Resurrection Cathedral with a bell tower, the Church of the Nativity, the complex of military fortifications ‚ÄúBatteries‚Äù.  It will be useful to go to the local museum of local lore in order to get to know the ‚Äúbiography‚Äù of the glorious city. </p><h2>  The main sights of Borisov: a list </h2><p>  Along with Abkhazia and Transnistria, Belarus is considered the Mecca of the so-called Soviet tourism.  And in Borisov you can feel the atmosphere of a bygone era one hundred percent.  Where else will you see people with shopping bags, monuments to Soviet partisans on granite pedestals and signs with the names of the streets "Revolution Avenue", "10 years of the BSSR", etc. This is especially impressive for a tourist from Western Europe. </p><p>  In addition, a huge number of cultural, historical and architectural monuments have been preserved in Borisov.  And just a walk along the provincial charming streets of the old city will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><p>  We tried to make a list of the main attractions of Borisov.  It included ten of the most interesting and worthy of attention objects.  It: </p><ol><li>  Resurrection Cathedral. </li><li>  Church of the Nativity. </li><li>  Monument to Prince Boris Vseslavich. </li><li>  Complex "Batteries of 1812". </li><li>  Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary. </li><li>  The memorial on the Brilevsky field. </li><li>  Shukhov Tower. </li><li>  Museum of Local Lore. </li><li>  Borisov-Arena. </li><li>  The building of the railway station. </li></ol><h2>  Resurrection Cathedral </h2><p>  One of the most beautiful buildings in Borisov is the Holy Resurrection Cathedral.  It was erected in 1874 in the so-called pseudo-Russian style on the site of a previously burnt wooden church.  The square in terms of the three-apse temple has nine domes.  The height of the central part reaches 12 meters.  The walls of the cathedral are generously decorated with numerous decorative elements of white color - kokoshniks, rustic pilasters, panels with profiled cornices.  They contrast excellently with the red facade of the building. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="nl.wikipedia.org" data-author=": Lusssiya, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holy Resurrection Cathedral" class="if uuid-2507021" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2507021.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of the Nativity </h2><p>  The brick church of the Nativity in Borisov was built relatively recently - in 1994.  But in appearance it seems that his age is much more solid.  The highlight is that the initiator of the construction was an ordinary pensioner and disabled person Mikhail Volosach.  However, the personal funds of the local resident were only enough to lay the foundation.  The situation was saved by sponsors, and two years later the main dome was already installed over the temple.  The church is two-story.  Inside the temple is decorated with a magnificent carved iconostasis. </p><h2>  Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary </h2><p>  Another religious building of Borisov and one of the oldest buildings in this city.  The stone church was erected at the beginning of the XIX century for local Catholics.  From different parts of the city the tip of its massive five-tier bell tower is visible.  The style of construction is late classicism.  In 1937, the church in Borisov was closed by the Soviet government.  The belfry tower, partially dismantled after the war, was completely restored only in the 90s. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pl.wikipedia.org" data-author=": Liashko, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary Borisov" class="if uuid-2507026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2507026.jpg"></div><h2>  Monument to the founder of the city - Prince Boris </h2><p>  At the Resurrection Cathedral is the main city monument dedicated to Prince Boris Vseslavich.  It was installed in 2002 in honor of the celebration of the 900th anniversary of Borisov.  The monument to the founder of the city stands next to the place where the Borisov Fortress once existed.  The exterior of the monument was designed by sculptor A. Artimovich.  Behind the prince's back you can see a sculpture of a guardian angel.  And this is no coincidence, because Boris Vseslavich actively spread the Christian faith in the Belarusian lands. </p><h2>  1812 batteries </h2><p>  In Borisov, the remnants of the system of earthen fortifications created at the beginning of the 19th century on the right bank of the Berezina to contain the army of Napoleon Bonaparte were preserved.  These batteries are a historical monument of national importance.  In 2002, their territory was ennobled, miniature cast-iron guns were installed.  Until our time, only the northern part of the fortifications survived.  The southern half of the batteries was destroyed during the construction of the <span>district hospital.</span> </p><h2>  In memory of the distant days </h2><p>  One of the most important battles of the Patriotic War of 1812 occurred precisely in the vicinity of the city of Borisov, near the village of Studenki.  Here, during the crossing of the Berezina River, Napoleon‚Äôs army lost up to 50 thousand of its soldiers.  In memory of those long-standing events, a memorial complex was built on Brilevsky Field (7 km north-west of Borisov). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Brilevskoe field" class="if uuid-2507025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2507025.jpg"></div><p>  Every year, at the end of November, a historical reconstruction of the crossing takes place in this place.  Teams from Russia, France, Poland and other countries take part in it.  Nearby, one of the outbuildings of the estate was preserved, in which, according to the assumptions, Napoleon Bonaparte himself stayed in 1812. </p><h2>  Museum of Local Lore </h2><p>  The Borisov Museum of Local Lore is located at: Revolution Avenue, 67. It has been operating since 2005 and acquaints visitors with its history.  In particular, he talks about the events of World War II.  The building itself is an architectural monument.  It is covered with a red tiled roof, on both sides two wings adjoin it.  The museum has a fairly rich collection of ancient objects and documents that will interest all history buffs. </p><h2>  Shukhov Tower </h2><p>  Vladimir G. Shukhov - an outstanding Russian engineer and architect.  It was he who invented the mesh shell - a unique hyperboloid steel structure, widely used around the world for the construction of various towers and buildings.  In total, 11 Shukhov towers remained in the CIS.  And one of them is in Borisov. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trip-points.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shukhov Tower in Borisov" class="if uuid-2507027" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2507027.jpg"></div><p>  The water tower of V. G. Shukhov was built here in 1927.  A true decoration of the design is an old spiral staircase.  Unfortunately, the tower is far from being in the best condition and requires immediate restoration. </p><h2>  Borisov-Arena </h2><p>  Sports fans will definitely be interested in visiting the local football arena.  The modern stadium was built by 2014, for which $ 58 million was spent.  It meets all UEFA requirements and accommodates over 13,000 fans.  Borisov-Arena has an unusual appearance.  The stadium ‚ÄúLudski vrt‚Äù in Slovenian Maribor was taken as a model during construction.  Borisov-Arena is the home venue for performances by the BATE football club, the 14-time champion of Belarus and a multiple participant in the UEFA Champions League and Europa League. </p><div class="photo" data-original="essma.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Borisov Arena" class="if uuid-2507023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2507023.jpg"></div><h2>  Train Station </h2><p>  Very often, a tourist‚Äôs acquaintance with a city begins at its railway station.  We will complete our story about Borisov with this particular attraction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trip-points.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Borisov station" class="if uuid-2507024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2507024.jpg"></div><p>  The current two-story building of the station in the city was built in 1914.  On the first floor there were all office and technical rooms, and on the second floor the station workers lived.  A wooden restaurant was added to the side of the building (not preserved).  The city station is pretty enough.  Two decorative attics, stylized as palace towers, give it a special charm. </p>
