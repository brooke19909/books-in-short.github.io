Description of the hotel Thalassa Sousse 4 *</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Do you like white sand beaches under exotic palm trees?  Do you like to swim in the warm clear sea with clear water?  Do you like to have fun in water parks and dream of spending a lot of time there?  Then a modern and at the same time traditionally Arabic, but without exaggeration, chic hotel in Tunisia, whose full name is Thalassa Sousse Resort Aquapark 4 *, was created especially for you.  This is a paradise under the generous African sun, where you do not notice how time rushes.  It seems that he just settled in, only settled in a distant, unfamiliar, but so friendly country, and it is time to pack his bags.  African holidays flew by like one bright, cheerful, carefree holiday, which I would definitely like to repeat. </p><p>  That is how most tourists write in their reviews of the Thalassa Sousse hotel.  But this fabulous place has its own problems that affect the quality of rest of the guests.  To decide how serious they are and whether to take a tour here, we offer detailed information about all the nuances of staying at this hotel. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Tourism in Africa, in the view of most of us, is primarily trips to the Egyptian pyramids or diving in the Red Sea.  But there is another small African country where it is very cool to relax, and at any time of the year.  This is Tunisia.  From the northern shores, it is washed by the gentle Mediterranean Sea.  The coastline here has large and small ledges, one of which is the Al-Chib Peninsula (formerly Bon).  In its southeastern side, it forms a large Hammamet Bay.  It is here that the wonderful city and resort of Sousse is located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Hotel Thalassa Sousse 4 * is located about two kilometers north of its center, on the sea coast, surrounded by palm trees and orange trees, at the very beginning of the popular tourist street.  You can go along the main road along it and take a leisurely walk on foot to the center of Sousse.  But you can get to the center by bus.  It will take about 5 minutes and 3 dinars.  Approximately the same distance and the same fare from the hotel to the port of El Kantaoui, where there is a marina and a large amusement park. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  It is very easy and simple to get into the Thalassa Sousse 4 *.  Almost all Russian travel agencies offer tours here with a flight to the Tunisian city of Monastir.  There is a huge international airport built to modern standards.  He bears the name of Habib Bourguiba.  When buying a tour, you need to make sure that your plane will fly there.  Before entering the hotel from this airport is only 27 km, which the transfer provided by the travel agency overcomes in just 20 minutes.  This is the most reasonable and optimal option for tourists traveling to the resort of Sousse.  From the other airport closest to the Thalassa Sousse, called Enfida, it is also relatively close - only 40 km or about an hour by bus.  But if you want to arrive at the hotel as quickly as possible, buying travel packages at a travel agency, arrange for tickets for a plane arriving only at <span>Monastir Airport.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you booked a hotel room bypassing the travel agency and flew to Monastir yourself, you can either get to the destination by taxi (it will cost from 30 dinars, and yellow taxis are about 3 times cheaper than white ones) or by regular buses heading towards the city of Tunisia, or by electric trains going to Sousse directly from the airport every quarter of an hour. </p><h2>  Description of the hotel Thalassa Sousse 4 * </h2><p>  Under a cloudless blue sky on an area of ‚Äã‚Äãone and a half hectares in 1975, a wonderful garden was set up, planting on its territory not only unpretentious palm trees and cacti, but also rhododendrons, bougainvilleas, and Chinese roses more sensitive to heat.  Among this beauty, two three-story buildings in the Arabic style were erected, but according to the modern design, 223 small bungalows, restaurants and bars, equipped sports and playgrounds, built three huge pools. </p><p>  To surprise and attract more customers, they took away a sufficient piece of territory here, on which the largest water park in Tunisia was built.  Thus was born the hotel "Thalassa Sousse".  Now he is nearly half a century old, but he still impresses with the design of the territory, which has become even more green, beautiful and equipped.  The last repair was carried out here in 2013, so absolutely all buildings and structures are in excellent condition. </p>

    <h2>  Tunisia, Thalassa Sousse, water park </h2><p>  The highlight of this hotel and its main advantage is its own water park.  It is built spacious so that everyone has enough space;  beautifully decorated with exotic cacti and palm trees, so that visitors do not leave the feeling that this is still Africa;  and absolutely safe.  For convenience, it is divided into zones with extreme slides, more or less calm and just with huge pools.  In total there are 17 slides for older visitors here.  For kids there is a marvelous area with four peas, a periodically overturning bucket, all kinds of ladders and small waterfalls. </p><p>  Entrance to the water park for hotel guests is unlimited in time and absolutely free.  But everyone can come here to entertain, including not only tourists from neighboring hotels, but also local residents.  For them, entry is paid, which at least somehow regulates their numbers.  But all the same, there are always a lot of people in the water park, and therefore there are queues on all slides, as well as in food outlets. </p>

    <h2>  Beach, weather </h2><p>  We can say that right on the seashore is located ‚ÄúThalassa Sousse‚Äù (Tunisia).  Guest reviews about the beach are the most favorable.  He has his own at the hotel, always clean, except when tourists themselves throw garbage past the bins, and employees do not have time to clean it.  Umbrellas and sunbeds are free of charge for hotel guests, a towel of 20 dinars is charged for towels.  To approach the edge of the water on the sand laid wooden flooring.  This beach is very suitable for parents and children, since entering the sea without stones is only fine white sand, and the depth begins gradually, that is, there is a strip of shallow water. </p><p>  In general, you can swim in the sea in Tunisia already in June, because this month the water manages to warm up to +22 ¬∞ C, in the summer it becomes ‚Äúfresh milk‚Äù with temperatures of +26 ... + 28 ¬∞ C and keeps reasonably warm (about +21 ¬∞ C) until mid-November. </p><p>  On the beach, animators constantly arrange active games, conduct aerobics, have fun.  Vacationers can have fun on water rides. </p><p>  A great convenience is the <span>beach bar,</span> for visiting which you need to take special cards at the reception.  Here, unlike the main restaurant, there are almost no queues, a wide selection of dishes that are always very tasty prepared. </p><p>  The small disadvantages of the beach include the presence of jellyfish in the water and frequent winds from the sea. </p><h2>  Entertainment outside the hotel, shopping </h2><p>  The Thalassa Sousse Hotel is ideally located: the airport is not far, the sea is close, to the city center, where you can go on excursions from other hotels.  In Sousse are the famous medina with an old citadel and ribat, a mosque built in the 9th century, and an archaeological museum.  50 km from the city there is an interesting zoo where you can buy a tour or come on your own by train.  Here, animals are kept in enclosures that mimic their home.  For a couple of dollars at the zoo you can feed an elephant, stroke a giraffe or an ostrich, ride a camel. </p><p>  Popular with active tourists enjoy trips to the Sahara.  They are carried out only with a guide. </p><p>  Royal Thalasso Monastir is located near the airport.  There is a huge thalassocomplex, where dozens of types of wellness procedures are performed.  The Thalassa Sousse Hotel provides a free shuttle service to this center. </p><p>  You can not ignore shopping in Sousse.  The trading center, where there is everything, almost like in Greece, there is, of course, the medina, which is a tourist attraction from the outside and a smart market inside.  Nearby is a shopping center, where the goods are about the same, but twice as expensive.  But in the shopping center you can pay with credit cards and safely exchange available at.  e. to local dinars.  In addition to the medina, the city has two more large markets and many various shops, boutiques, and simply retail outlets.  The most popular purchases here are souvenirs, ceramics, carpets (at customs you need to have a receipt for their purchase), leather items, hookahs, spices. </p>
