The nature here is surprisingly contrasting: the southern part is occupied by the Sahara desert, the northern territory is subtropics, and the eastern part is the spurs of the mountains.  This country is famous all over the world for its therapeutic thalassotherapy.  And the local culture carries the flavor of an oriental tale: mysterious palaces, <span>beautiful gardens,</span> colorful bazaars, high minarets.  The local beaches are gently sloping sand spits that make it possible for even the smallest vacationers to swim.  Tunisia hotels for families with children are located in almost every resort city in the country.  Which one to stay in? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia hotels for families with children" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/263643.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <p>  Choosing the best hotels in Tunisia for families with children, you should pay attention to many details.  Firstly, what rooms the hotel provides for its guests (family, studio, apartments), since not all will be comfortable for the child.  In addition, it is very important that the room has air conditioning, a refrigerator and a TV.  The first is necessary to maintain the appropriate temperature, and the last - so that the child does not get bored.  An important factor is the distance to the sea.  After all, if it is quite large, then the path to it for a small tourist will be too tiring.  It is necessary to take into account the location of the hotel (central part of the city, park area, proximity to shops). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tunisia families with children hotels" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/263642.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tunisia hotels for families with children must have a developed infrastructure.  You need to know if there are playgrounds and pools for babies in the hotel complex, whether there are babysitting services, whether a cot is provided in the room, whether there are chairs for little vacationers.  When choosing a hotel, it is recommended to take an interest in landscaping.  This is necessary in order to always have the opportunity to hide with the child in the shade.  It is very important to know some nuances about the hotel's beach: whether it is urban or private, pebble or sand, whether there are umbrellas and sunbeds on it.  Do not forget to consider the <span>type of food:</span> is there a children's menu, what dishes are offered <span>for the child.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia hotels for children" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/263644.jpg" width="600"></div>
