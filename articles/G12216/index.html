Deciding on a country for vacation is easy, it is more difficult to choose a province. </p><p>  When you read the reviews of tourists about the Krabi Islands, it immediately becomes clear where it is best to go.  Let's get to know more about this resort. </p><p>  Where are the islands of Krabi?  One of the 77 provinces of the Kingdom of Thailand is Krabi, located in the south of the state.  In addition to the mainland, about 200 islands are scattered here.  The population is small - about 440,000 people.  The capital is the city of Krabi Town.  The famous neighbor is the popular resort of Phuket, which is 170 km west of Krabi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecrazytourist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Krabi Town" class="if uuid-2413401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2413401.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  In this territory, life appeared more than 35,000 years ago.  In karst caves of Krabi province, archaeologists have found a unique cave painting, which was recognized as the oldest in Southeast Asia.  The remains of the first settlements of Krabi date back to the 7th century BC. </p><p>  The name of the province is translated from Thai as "sword."  According to legend, in these territories residents found two ancient artifacts and handed over the find to the governor.  The authorities considered this a sign and called the province "Krabi", and swords adorn its coat of arms to this day.  The province of Krabi became an independent territorial unit only in 1875. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Modern Krabi </h2><p>  The economy of the province is built only through tourism.  Every year, thousands of tourists come here to enjoy a wonderful vacation and attractions of the Krabi Islands.  Phuket is only 50 km away from Krabi, but the contrast in the lifestyle and variety of recreation is impressive. </p><p>  Tourists who choose Phuket to relax rarely travel outside the island, and vacationers in Krabi can not go on an excursion outside the province at least once, because there are countless sights of Krabi on land and at sea.  There are a huge number of leisure options.  Go to Phuket for a lazy vacation on the beaches.  Krabi is suitable for more active tourists. </p><p>  Let's find out more about the Krabi Islands and their attractions. </p><h2>  Peninsula Railay </h2><p>  This is a very famous place most loved by tourists.  The peninsula is fenced off from the rest of the world by huge rocks up to 200 meters high.  It is here that the most beautiful beaches of the Krabi Islands are located.  There are four of them: Ton Sai, Phra Nang, Railay East and Railay West.  Everyone, of course, has their own opinion about the best beach of the peninsula, but most tourists prefer Phra Nang.  The second place is given to Railay West beach. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecrazytourist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Railay Beach" class="if uuid-2413392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2413392.jpg"></div><p>  Comparing them, we can say that Railay West is much wider and longer.  There are many bars, hotels and restaurants, unlike the modest but expensive Phra Nang. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, the name "Railay" are both the peninsula and Railay West beach.  And the beach is really worth a visit: a beautiful seascape, fine white sand and emerald-blue water.  This beach truly deserves to be called the best beach in the world, and even more so on the islands of Krabi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecrazytourist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phra Nang Beach" class="if uuid-2413409" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2413409.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to Railay </h2><p>  There is no land road here, so you can get to the peninsula only through the sea.  Private long-tail boats and cruise boats go here. </p><p>  When going to the peninsula, you need to know that boats and boats go only in the daytime.  In addition, there is no pier, so tourists drop off right on the surf line. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecrazytourist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Krabi boats" class="if uuid-2413394" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2413394.jpg"></div><h2>  Exotic animals </h2><p>  As everyone knows, long-tailed macaques are found throughout Thailand.  On Railay, more exotic monkeys live - langurs.  They, unlike macaques, feed only on plants and live high on trees so that they are not reached by predators.  It is unlikely that you will be able to lure the langurs with a bunch of bananas, but to see them from afar will not be difficult. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Diamond cave cave </h2><p>  The unique attraction of the Krabi Islands is located in the cliffs near Railay West Beach and is about 185 m long and up to 25 m high.  The cave is well equipped for visits: there are signs on the road, inside there are railings and fences, electricity is provided.  It is safe to say that this cave is completely safe (unlike other caves in Thailand).  Here you will see the beautiful clusters of stalactites created by nature and eerie flocks of bats.  A visit to the Diamond cave is one of the best excursions to the Krabi Islands. </p><h2>  Holidays on the Railay Peninsula </h2><p>  You can relax on the beach.  There are many bars and restaurants on the island, where fire shows with live music are held. </p><p>  In the vicinity of Railay there are two beautiful islands - Ponda and Gai.  These are the most impressive <span>islands of the Andaman</span> Sea, they can not be visited when arriving at Railay.  Do you already know that the peninsula is surrounded by cliffs?  Why not conquer them?  There are several climbing schools where you can learn the basics of Climbing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecrazytourist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Climbing on the rocks of the Railay Peninsula" class="if uuid-2413410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2413410.jpg"></div><h2>  Ko Lanta </h2><p>  Another favorite destination for tourists is the Krabi Islands.  In fact, there are two islands with the name Lanta - Lanta Yai and Lanta Noi. </p><p>  Tourists prefer the island of Lanta Yai.  Come here to visit the ideal and spacious beaches.  Silence and a relaxing atmosphere - this is what you need for a lazy holiday in the province of Krabi.  The island, by the way, is located next to the islands of Rock, Ngai, Muk and Kradan.  They are rightfully considered the most beautiful places in the south of Thailand, and from the island of Ko Lanta it is quite easy to get there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecrazytourist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ko Lanta" class="if uuid-2413400" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2413400.jpg"></div><h2>  Diving </h2><p>  The best diving spots on the Andaman coast are in the vicinity of Ko Lanta.  Large marine life, such as manta rays and whale sharks, can be found in the rocks of Hin Muaeg and Hin Daeng.  But due to the great depth and strong current, only experienced drivers are advised to swim here.  The waters of the island of Haa will amaze with the transparency and diversity of the underwater world.  Tourists love to dive and explore the seabed of the islands of Bida Gai and Bida Nak. </p><h2>  Buddhist temples </h2><p>  In addition to the wonders of nature, there are man-made sights.  The most impressive and colorful temple here is considered Wat Tham Sua.  It is located near Krabi Town, on the spur of Khao Phanom Bencha Mountain. </p><p>  The history of the temple begins in 1975, founded by Ajahn Jamnian.  The name translates as ‚ÄúTemple of the Tiger Cave‚Äù, and it arose from the legend of the founder, who loved to meditate in a cave with a tiger. </p><p>  Now Wat Tham Sua is a temple complex with grottoes, monasteries, a pagoda and a sanctuary.  The sanctuary is the main attraction of the temple: it offers gorgeous views of the surroundings, statues and monuments.  The staircase to the sanctuary consists of 1237 steps. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecrazytourist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wat tham sua" class="if uuid-2413395" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2413395.jpg"></div><h2>  Tham pet </h2><p>  Another interesting cave in Krabi province is located in the Than Bok Khorani National Park.  Nearby is a small Buddhist temple.  By donating a small amount to him, you can rent a lantern.  The cave consists of two huge halls filled with natural stone influxes and large multi-colored stalactites.  In the cave, you will pass through a long section, similar to a dried riverbed.  It is quite humid here, so choose the right shoes for the tour. </p><h2>  Tham khlang </h2><p>  The longest in Krabi province is the Tham Khlang cave, in which there are many colorful stalactites of bizarre shape.  There are several entrances, but you can get there only one at a time, specially equipped for the convenience of tourists, a wooden platform.  The other entrance is flooded with water, and you can swim in a kayak through it.  Unlike other caves in the province, this one is ideally equipped for excursions.  Tourists can hire a guide for both hiking and kayaking. </p><h2>  Sra kaeo </h2><p>  It is considered the deepest in Thailand, the entrance to it is a lake.  It is completely flooded with water from both exits.  The history of cave research is very interesting.  Locals considered it just a pond where you can swim and relax after a hard day.  When tourists began to appear here, doubts arose that it was just a pond.  In 1993, Matt London conducted an expedition with scuba diving and discovered the connection of two exits at a depth of 84 meters.  The very depth of the investigated area was 120 meters.  In 2006, a bottom was found at a depth of 240 meters.  And this may not be the maximum depth of the cave, because it has not yet been fully explored. </p><h2>  Tham Lot and Tham Phi Hua To </h2><p>  These caves are located in Tham Bok Khorani Park, almost on the border of two provinces - Krabi and Phang Nga.  You can get here only by boat.  Sailing through the Tham Lot, you can enjoy the beauty of perennial stalactites. </p><p>  Tham Phi Hua To cave must be visited for the sake of cave art, which is about three thousand years old.  On the walls you can see something similar to aliens or pterodactyls.  Unleash your imagination!  What will you see? </p><p>  If you find a cave that is not equipped for visiting, it is better not to go there.  Most of them are very dangerous, and if something happens, no one will save you.  It is better to choose proven caves with experienced guides. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  From the reviews on the tourism forums, we can conclude that Krabi attracts vacationers with its low cost and an abundance of attractions.  There is no beach on the mainland of the province, which insanely upsets tourists vacationing in Krabi Town and other cities.  Some are hindered by the language barrier, because not all Thais know English.  Otherwise, tourists give rest in Krabi province good marks and are advised to visit. </p>
