This highway is the link for the main roads of the city: all the main radial <span>routes of Moscow</span> have an intersection with the ring road.  From the city center MKAD is located at a distance of 12-18 km in its various sections.  Historically, kilometers on the ring road are counted from the intersection with the Enthusiasts highway in a clockwise direction.

    <p>  <strong>History of Moscow Ring Road</strong> </p><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such a <span>ring road</span> arose in 1937, and its first section began to be built in 1939, but the war prevented the implementation of all plans.  I had to change the project and urgently build a simplified version of the road, adapted for the movement of military equipment and the redeployment of troops.  In this first embodiment, the Moscow Ring Road was about 30 kilometers long.  After the war, they returned to the original project, and in 1956 reconstruction of the road began.  The first section - from Yaroslavl to Simferopol highway - was opened in 1960.  This part of the <span>Moscow Ring Road</span> was 48 kilometers long.  And already in 1962, traffic along the entire ring road was discovered.  It had two lanes for traffic in both directions, each </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MKAD length" class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13013/253115.jpg" width="360"></div>  7 m wide. Very important for normal traffic on the ring road was the construction of 33 road junctions, while two-tier.  The first three-level interchange appeared only in 1983 at the intersection of the Moscow Ring Road and Simferopol Highway.  At the same time, simple concrete was the pavement on all sections of the ring highway.  In the 90s, it became apparent that the Moscow Ring Road was obsolete morally and physically.  The reconstruction began, which included two stages.  The first stage was the replacement of lighting and the installation of a barrier fence between oncoming streams.  The second stage included the expansion of the roadbed and, due to this, an increase in the number of lanes up to five.

    <p>  <strong>MKAD today</strong> </p><p>  Today, the Moscow Ring Road is a thoroughfare of a completely European level.  Width - 10 lanes, road surface - asphalt concrete. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="length of MKAD in km" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13013/253114.jpg" width="320"></div>  47 interchanges were built, of which the Leningradskaya and Gorkovskaya are three-level, and the Yaroslavl and Novorizhskaya are four-level.  Given the large length of the Moscow Ring Road, 49 above-ground <span>pedestrian crossings</span> and 4-underground.  76 overpasses and bridges were erected, 6 of them over the Moskva River and the Moscow Canal.  Currently, the Moscow Ring Road is no longer coping with the flow of cars.  Traffic jams have become common on the ring road.  But to increase its <span>throughput, it is</span> not enough just to increase the length of the Moscow Ring Road.  Moscow authorities have developed a new project - the fourth transport ring.  This will make it possible to redo the outdated traffic interchanges, to build many understudies of the ring road, flyovers and tunnels.  In total, after the creation of the fourth ring, the length of the Moscow Ring Road in km should almost double.
