How is the RSFSR deciphered?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The emblem and flag are invariable symbols of any modern state.  The rudiments of heraldry appeared in antiquity, in the Middle Ages it became the property of every noble house, and in modern times it was firmly entrenched as an obligatory paraphernalia of all countries of the world. </p><p>  In terms of having its own symbolism, the RSFSR was no exception - a state entity that existed from 1917 to 1991.  It was the forerunner of the modern Russian Federation.  But, before considering the attributes of this republic, let's figure out what it was.  How is the RSFSR deciphered? </p><h2>  RSFSR - Republic of the Soviet Union </h2><p>  The birth of the RSFSR can be attributed to 1917, when after the victory during the October Revolution in the country, the Bolsheviks came to power.  True, the original name of the new state was somewhat different - the Russian Soviet Republic (RSR) or the Russian Federal Republic (RFR).  The name of the RSFSR was officially fixed on July 19, 1918, after the entry into force of the Constitution.  Then a large number of other innovations were introduced.  For example, in the same 1918 the capital of the RSFSR changed.  She moved from Petrograd to Moscow. </p><p>  Since 1922, Russia, along with other republics, became <span>part of the USSR,</span> where it was until its collapse in 1991.  This ended the period of the RSFSR, the era of the Russian Federation began.  It lasts until today. </p><h2>  Decoding of the abbreviation RSFSR </h2><p>  But how is the RSFSR deciphered?  Since 1918, this abbreviation was read as the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.  In 1936, the word order was changed.  Since then, the name has been deciphered as the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  State flag </h2><p>  One of the main symbols of the state is the national flag.  It is with this attribute that any country is primarily associated.  The national flag of the RSFSR has undergone several significant modifications over the period of its existence. </p><h2>  Flag of the post-revolutionary time </h2><p>  Immediately after the Bolshevik revolution, the absolutely <span>red banner</span> without additional images and inscriptions claimed the role of the state flag.  True, this fact was not fixed by any official document. </p><p>  The Constitution, adopted in 1918, stated that the state flag of the country would be a red panel, in the upper left corner of which is the inscription "RSFSR" embroidered in golden letters.  There was no more accurate description of the alleged banner in the country's main law at that time. </p>

    <p>  In 1920, a decree of the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee gave a more detailed description.  Including it was indicated that the inscription "RSFSR" should be framed by a golden rectangle.  This form was valid until 1937. </p><h2>  Banner of the Stalin era </h2>

    <p>  The adoption of the new Constitution in 1937 brought some adjustments to the state flag of the RSFSR.  The development of a new version was carried out by the talented artist A. N. Milkin. In particular, the golden frame was removed, and the font of the letters was changed from stylized ancient Slavic to ordinary.  This form of flag was officially used for seventeen years, including during the years of World War II. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Flag (1954 - 1991) </h2>

    <p>  In 1954, the official banner of the RSFSR was radically redesigned.  For the implementation of the new project took the artist V.P. Viktorov.  Now the flag included the official symbols of the USSR - a sickle and a hammer, as well as a <span>five-pointed star,</span> which were located in the upper left edge.  In addition, the flagpole had a light blue stripe.  The main background of the flag remained invariably red.  All inscriptions from the banner disappeared. </p><p>  This official version of the banner lasted much longer than others (37 years) and was replaced only in 1991 by the <span>flag of the Russian</span> Federation. </p><h2>  National emblem </h2><p>  Along with the flag, the emblem is considered the most important national symbolism.  This attribute has been included in modern heraldry since the Middle Ages.  The RSFSR also had its own coat of arms, and during its existence, it underwent no less changes than the flag. </p><h2>  The first official stamp of the RSFSR </h2><p>  The coat of arms of the RSFSR began to be developed from the beginning of 1918 by a special commission.  Immediately a large number of proposals appeared.  The commission of the artist Alexander Leo was most satisfied with the commission.  In his performance, the coat of arms represented an image in the center of which were placed a crossed sickle, hammer and sword.  At the bottom there should have been an inscription: "Council of People's Commissars."  But V.I. Lenin suggested abandoning the sword, thereby wanting to emphasize the peaceful nature of the future communist society.  He also expressed a desire to replace the inscription with the motto: "Workers of all countries, unite." </p>

    <p>  In the final version, the emblem of the RSFSR of 1918 was a circle-shaped symbol depicting crossed sickle and hammer on a red shield in the rays of the rising sun and framed by bread ears. </p><h2>  Coat of arms (1925 - 1978) </h2><p>  Already in 1920, it was decided to improve the emblem of the RSFSR.  Immediately on this work began, headed by the artist N. A. Andreev.  First of all, the full inscription ‚ÄúRussian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic‚Äù was replaced by the abbreviation.  In addition, the coat of arms ceased to have an absolutely rounded shape, ears of corn framed it completely, and not just a red shield with a sickle and a hammer.  Several other smaller graphic changes were made. </p>

    <p>  Finally, this form was enshrined in the Constitution of 1925.  In this form, the coat of arms existed almost unchanged until the collapse of the <span>Soviet Union.</span>  The exception was one small but important detail, which will be discussed below. </p><h2>  Another change of coat of arms </h2><p>  In 1978, a new Constitution was introduced.  In connection with its adoption, it was decided to bring the emblem of the RSFSR to the all-Union standard.  This was expressed in the addition of only one detail, namely, a five-pointed star in the upper part of the shield, in the place where the ears of bread closed. </p>

    <p>  There were no more changes in symbolism until the collapse of the USSR.  But even after the creation of the independent <span>Russian Federation, the emblem of the</span> RSFSR served as the basis for its attributes until December 1993, when the <span>double-headed eagle</span> was adopted as the state symbol <span>.</span>  Until that time, the only difference between the emblem of the new state and the coat of arms of a union republic was only a change in the inscription with the name of the country in the upper part of the shield.  Nevertheless, in the heraldry of the modern Russian state, nothing was left of the Soviet era. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Over the years of the existence of the RSFSR as an integral part of the Soviet Union, the flag and coat of arms of this state formation have experienced significant external changes.  This was due to the desire to bring the symbolism of individual republics closer to the all-Union standards.  It should be emphasized the prevailing attributes of the communist movement in the elements of the coat of arms and flag of the RSFSR. </p>
