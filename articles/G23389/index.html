When planning their vacation, each married couple seeks to find a good place where you can spend time with kids.  The article talks about where it is better to relax with children in Spain. </p><h2>  Features of holidays in Spain </h2><p>  In anticipation of the summer, many tourists are considering where to go on vacation.  One of the most popular destinations is Spain.  Travelers are attracted not only by its stunning sea coast, but also by its rich cultural heritage and numerous entertainments.  The country is interesting not only because of the rest on the sea beach.  There are many attractions and outstanding places that every self-respecting person should see.  If you plan to spend a vacation with the whole family, the question always arises: where is it better to relax with children in Spain? </p><p>  Many experts recommend choosing resorts on the Mediterranean and Balearic seas for the first trip.  It can be anywhere from the Costa del Maresme to the Costa Blanca. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailymail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to relax in Spain with children" class="if uuid-2667513" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2667513.jpg"></div><p>  Many parents prefer all-inclusive hotels.  Holidays in Spain with children according to this concept is hardly possible.  This is not Cyprus or Turkey, which specialize in all inclusive.  Prices for tours to Spain are higher, and therefore the demand for them is slightly lower.  Most often, tourists are offered 3-4 star hotels and apartment hotels.  The latter option is most relevant for those travelers who plan to relax in Spain with children.  Where is it better to stay: in a hotel or apartment?  Experienced tourists recommend choosing apartments, if you are interested in the proper nutrition of your baby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The advantage of the apartments is that they consist of several rooms, a bathroom and a private kitchenette.  Therefore, you will have the opportunity to cook your own food.  The presence of a kitchen saves the parents of the youngest guests, as well as children who follow a diet. </p><p>  If you do not want to stand by the stove during your holidays, you can visit the restaurant.  But do not hope that when ordering dishes from the children's menu you will bring healthy dietary food.  Most likely, you will be served french fries and sausages.  Europeans have a peculiar understanding about the proper nutrition of children, which causes resentment among our compatriots.  Agree that not every mother wants to feed her baby with such harmful products.  Therefore, the kitchen in the room is the only option to feed your child. </p><h2>  Resort Selection </h2><p>  People who travel to uncharted regions for the first time find it difficult to understand where it is better to relax with children in Spain.  All local resorts hospitably invite guests to their open spaces.  <span>The Spanish coast</span> offers well-equipped beaches, sidewalks with slopes for prams, shops, and entertainment.  And yet not all resorts are equally good for families with children.  In Spain, the best tourist regions are suitable for babies.  The article presents a rating of the best resorts for families with children, based on guest reviews. </p><p>  Most tourists seek to visit the Costa Brava.  The famous resort is known far beyond the borders of the country.  Where to relax with children in Spain if you want to go to the Costa Brava?  Experienced travelers recommend paying attention to the Pine de Mar, Tossa de Mar and Blanes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="foodieflashpacker.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain vacation with children at sea" class="if uuid-2667556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2667556.jpg"></div><p>  The server coast of the resort area is suitable for families with babies.  For such kids, bathing and building castles is still irrelevant.  Sunset in the sea is almost everywhere sharp, and the sand on the coast is large, it‚Äôs nice to crawl along it, but sculpting the figures will not work. </p><p>  Categorical tourists do not recommend Lloret de Mar, noting that the resort is incredibly noisy and crowded with vacationers.  It‚Äôs uncomfortable with the kids. </p><h2>  Malgart de Mar </h2><p>  A good vacation with children on the sea in Spain offers Malart de Mar.  Quiet and calm resort town consists of two parts: historical and tourist.  The local coast is covered with small pebbles.  As you approach the nearby resort of Santa Susanna, there is more sand on the beaches.  A gentle entry makes the region convenient for families with children.  If you are tired of an idle holiday on the beach, you can stroll along the old part of the town and sit in a local cafe.  Tourists recommend visiting the famous Marineland water park.  This is the best place to relax with the whole family.  The territory of the water park has a zoo, swimming pools, water slides and a dolphinarium. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.catalonia-valencia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain beaches for families with children" class="if uuid-2667575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2667575.jpg"></div><p>  For families with children in Spain at the sea, it is better to choose hotels focused on family vacations.  In Malart de Mar, tourists recommend paying attention to the HTOP Palanmar hotel.  It is located just 50 meters from the beach.  The institution offers active children's animation.  The hotel rooms, although simple, are not without charm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Another hotel recommended by tourists is Ibersol Sorra D'Or.  This is one of the few institutions in Spain that works on the concept of "all inclusive."  The hotel is located 25 meters from the coast and offers an animation program for kids. </p><p>  Of no less interest is the Amaraigua Hotel, built on the coast itself.  It has direct sea access, which makes it possible not to waste time on walks.  The hotel has a good kids club. </p><h2>  Santa susanna </h2><p>  Where is a holiday in Spain with children comfortable and exciting?  Guests of the country can recommend the small town of Santa Susanna, located near Malgrat de Mar.  Resort hotels are newer, many of them have been built over the past ten years.  Therefore, the number of rooms pleases with fresh repair and comfortable conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.getaroom.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain holidays with children all inclusive" class="if uuid-2667582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2667582.jpg"></div><p>  Almost all resort hotels are equipped with children's clubs.  According to tourists, one of the best establishments is the HTOP Royal Sun, located on the first line.  No less attractive is Indalo Park.  It is 150 meters from the coast and has several pools, a kids club and great animation for the kids.  Not inferior to the children's service and Caprice.  Noteworthy is the institution <span>Aqua hotel Onabrava.</span>  <span>The hotel is a</span> bit far from the beach (300 meters), but it offers excellent infrastructure, swimming pools, a spa, two children's clubs.  Rest in it you will certainly enjoy. </p><h2>  Kalea </h2><p>  Kalea is one of the best holiday destinations in Spain with children.  Where is it better to stay during your vacation if you want to not only visit the beaches, but also to see Barcelona?  Ideally in this case, Kaleya is suitable.  The resort town is the closest to beautiful Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãso it‚Äôs convenient for a beach-cultural holiday.  In addition, it is aimed at families with children.  From Calais you can go not only to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãbut also to Mataro or an aqua park. </p><p>  In Calea, some of the best beaches in Spain for families with children.  More than three kilometers of sandy coasts are never crowded with holidaymakers.  Therefore, relaxing on the beaches is incredibly comfortable.  The only drawback of the town is that you can get to the coast only through the underpass.  Therefore, it is better to come to the resort with children who no longer use strollers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jet2holidays.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain vacation with children where" class="if uuid-2667593" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2667593.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists recommend the Aqua hotel Promenade, Kaktus Playa and HTOP Callela Palace for families with children.  Experienced travelers say that you can have a good time in almost any resort in the country.  When thinking about where to relax in Spain with children in summer, pay attention to the HTOP hotel chain.  By choosing one of the institutions in the chain, you will never lose.  The hotels of the network are focused on family vacations.  For children in hotels animation is always provided.  If you want to relax a bit without constantly entertaining the child, choose HTOP hotels. </p><h2>  Costa Dorada </h2><p>  What can offer tourists with children Spain in the summer?  Where can I relax in comfort?  Resorts recommend the Costa Dorada.  It is ideal for children over four years old.  The beaches of the resort are covered with fine sand and have a smooth approach.  The most convenient for relaxing La Pineda.  The convenience of the resort is that it is located near Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãwhich means you can appreciate its beauty and attractions.  Off the coast of La Pineda, the sea is shallow.  The local air is incredibly healing for kids, as it is filled with aromas of pine groves.  The city has a lot of entertainment, in the very center is the water park "Aquapolis".  The famous water park ‚ÄúPort Aventcourt‚Äù, located just 10-15 minutes from La Pineda, is very popular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.neckermann.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain vacation with children where is better" class="if uuid-2667586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2667586.jpg"></div><p>  For a good stay, tourists recommend choosing Estival Park Resort.  The complex can be described as a city in a city.  On its territory there is everything that you might need for a comfortable stay with children.  In the hotel you can rent not only a room, but also apartments or a cottage with a kitchen.  The spa and sports park will not let the most active guests get bored. </p><h2>  Salou </h2><p>  Among the resorts of Spain for families with children it is worth highlighting Salou.  The city is more suitable for school-age kids.  The large resort offers not only beach vacations, but also shopping.  On its territory many cafes, restaurants and other institutions were built.  All five <span>beaches of Salou</span> are the owners of the Blue Flag, which indicates their cleanliness and arrangement.  If you dream of a vacation on the coast, the city will not work.  From any hotel, the road to the coast runs through many picturesque streets.  There are no hotels built on the coast.  But Salou is more fun.  The city is dynamic.  If you are looking for peace, it is best to choose La Pineda.  Choosing a place in Spain, where it is comfortable and convenient to relax with children, it is worth focusing on your own preferences.  It is no secret that someone is looking for peace and quiet, while someone needs a more dynamic vacation. </p><p>  There are a lot of hotels in Salou, but Blaumar can be recommended for families with children.  The complex has a very good location, because it is located in the very center of the city.  The institution offers a variety of rooms, including those with a kitchen.  A huge advantage of the hotel is the presence of children's animation. </p><p>  But the hotel chain Best tourists do not recommend, because the hotel is represented by very small rooms.  They have large double beds.  There are no separate beds or cots for children (even with a great desire, there is no place to place an extra bed).  The hotel is good only for relaxing together. </p><h2>  Canary Islands </h2><p>  When wondering where to relax in the summer with children in Spain, you should pay attention to the Canary Islands.  Many parents think this is the perfect place for toddlers.  For example, Tenerife is always warm, but not hot.  Family-friendly hotels have playgrounds.  In children's clubs animators work.  The only drawback is that activists do not know Russian.  Kids can be taken to Loro Park, where you can see a stunning show with sea lions, killer whales, dolphins and parrots. </p><p>  Gran Canaria is no less attractive.  The island is the second largest on the Canary Archipelago, but at the same time no less beautiful than Tenerife.  Local hotels have animators and children's pools.  And the famous Aqualand water park will allow you to have fun. </p><h2>  Costa blanca </h2><p>  It is difficult to make a choice between the numerous resorts of Spain.  Where is it better to relax with children?  It is difficult to give a definite answer to the question.  It all depends on the age of the children and your preferences.  It is much more difficult to choose a place to stay with babies.  For school children, the choice is more extensive.  As a possible option, you can offer the Costa Blanca.  The disadvantage of the resort is the long journey with transfers.  Only teenagers can take such a road.  For younger children, it will be incredibly tiring. </p><p>  Recently, the town of Cullera is gaining popularity.  On its coast with clean and fine sand there are many shallow waters.  The most daring children can try surfing in one of the local schools.  The city also has attractions, historical sites and a water park. </p><p>  If you plan to spend your holidays with children, you can stay at Milenio Apartments.  They are located on the riverbank in a very picturesque place.  True, the sea will have to go at least 30 minutes.  A more suitable option would be Hotel Sicania, located on Raco Beach.  The shallow sea with a gentle approach is very convenient for swimming. </p><div class="photo" data-original="destinia.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain the best holiday with children" class="if uuid-2667599" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2667599.jpg"></div><p>  Cullera is another Costa Blanca resort located closer to Valencia.  The town will be appreciated by parents who dream to relax themselves and entertain their children.  In Cullero it is good to relax not only for children, but also for adults.  The city has a water park and other entertainment venues.  Knights tournaments are especially popular among tourists. </p><p>  The resort has a wide variety of different apartments for living.  Among them are not only modest rooms.  But also quite respectable numbers.  For those who want to stay on the coast, you can recommend choosing Voramar II Calpe and Albamar Ii.  The resort has one feature, the farther the hotel is from the coast and the city center, the better.  Among the best establishments, it is worth highlighting the AR Imperial Park Spa Resort and Villa Marisol.  Choosing Cullera, it is worthwhile to understand that good rooms and proximity to the sea in the resort are incompatible concepts. </p><h2>  The best time to relax </h2><p>  If we sorted out the question of where to go on vacation with children in Spain, it remains to find out what time to choose for a vacation.  Tourists note that the sea warms faster off the coast of Mallorca and in the Costa Blanca.  A little later - in the Costa Dorada.  But in the Costa del Sol, water can be cold even in the middle of summer.  This feature of the resort is caused by cold undercurrents.  The best time to relax with children is the period from late June to early October.  In August, the Spanish resorts are very hot.  In addition, this is the most expensive period for rest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to go for a vacation in Spain with children" class="if uuid-2667604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2667604.jpg"></div><p>  But in the Canary Islands you can relax throughout the year.  True, in winter the water in the sea is cool (+17 degrees).  At this time, children prefer to splash around in the pool.  But in the spring and autumn in the Canaries, the weather is ideal for relaxation. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Among the many resorts in Spain, you can choose from many wonderful places for families with children.  Tenerife, Mallorca and the Costa Dorada enjoy constant success among tourists.  All resort regions are good in their own way and will find their admirers.  Choosing a place of rest is based on your own preferences and wishes. </p>
