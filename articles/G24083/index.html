Excursion to the botanical garden of Krasnodar - what you need!  Here you will meet peacocks and guinea fowls, amazing plants brought here from different places on the planet.  By the way, squirrels often come to the guests of this place. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden in Krasnodar: photo, history, address </h2><p>  The story of the amazing arboretum began in 1959.  Then there was an experimental farm of the Agrarian University, which was founded by Professor Ivan Sergeyevich Kosenko.  By the way, it was his name that was given to the garden on the 100th anniversary of the outstanding scientist. </p><div class="photo" data-original="koveles.livejournal.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden I.S. Kosenko in Krasnodar" class="if uuid-2244564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2244564.jpg"></div><p>  The first plants that appeared in the Botanical Garden of Krasnodar arrived here by exchange from different parts of not only the USSR, but also from all over the world!  Then about forty thousand bushes and trees found their place here!  The garden was divided into several sectors, for each representatives of 2-3 families were selected.  After only ten years, the fund of this arboretum totaled more than 70 families, 180 genera, about 800 species and 100 species of shrubs and trees.  Greenhouses, laboratories, a rose garden, and an iridary appeared on the territory of the Krasnodar Botanical Garden.  Unique herbaceous perennials were planted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="45.0541482" data-lng="38.929333799999995" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/8/1/481.png"></div><h2>  Arboretum today </h2><p>  Today Botanical Garden named after I.S.  Kosenko is the largest scientific center located in the Southern Federal District.  Plants from different places are acclimatized here: during a walk you can see representatives of Central Asia, Siberia, Europe, Japan, the Caucasus, China. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotels-in-krasnodar.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden I.S. Kosenko" class="if uuid-2244580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2244580.jpg"></div><p>  About three hundred species of various crops ‚Äî tropical and subtropical ‚Äî have been collected in the greenhouses of the garden, and the number of trees, shrubs, flowers, and grasses exceeds 1200!  By the way, 70 plants are listed in the Red Book of Russia.  A metasequoia glipostrobes is found not only in this arboretum, but also in the International Red Book.  You can call the garden an open-air laboratory, "a living teaching aid."  The size of the territory is amazing - it is about 40 hectares! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The inhabitants </h2><p>  In the botanical garden of Krasnodar, you can get acquainted not only with representatives of the flora.  Various birds and even reptiles live here!  In the very center of the arboretum there is a large aviary, which contains representatives of the avifauna - peacocks, guinea fowl and pheasants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kasx.msk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inhabitants of the Krasnodar Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-2244583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2244583.jpg"></div><p>  The squirrels that live here are tame, they are not afraid of people and gladly accept treats from the hands of visitors to the garden.  It is worth saying that owls live in pines! </p><h2>  Garden of KubSU </h2><p>  You should not confuse the Kosenko Garden with another Krasnodar arboretum - the educational botanical garden of KubSU.  The latter appeared in the city in the early seventies of the last century on the basis of the former pedagogical institute.  Its area is much smaller than the botanical garden - only 16 hectares, and the main purpose is to show and study a variety of plants.  Special attention should be paid to the pear, which in the XIXth century a student of Michurin landed here.  This is the oldest arboretum tree that bears fruit today! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livekuban.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lotus in the Botanical Garden of KubSU" class="if uuid-2244553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2244553.jpg"></div><p>  By the way, in 1988 this botanical garden of Krasnodar was recognized as a natural monument of the Kuban.  The most amazing and beautiful corner of the garden is considered to be an artificial pond with lotuses.  Their green leaves and huge pink petals sometimes just scatter along the surface of the water, and sometimes fly up.  In the mornings, dew drops accumulate in the very center of the funnel leaves. </p>
