Tourists are literally attracted by the purest beaches, beautiful landscapes and the mild climate of the area.  Here, absolutely all conditions have been created for receiving vacationers, but this does not mean that Hainan can offer relaxation only on the beach.  In addition to the sandy coast and the gentle sun, there are a huge number of cultural and historical values ‚Äã‚Äãof ancient centuries.  Sanya is the southernmost point of Hainan. </p>

You can‚Äôt watch Russian channels on TV, they simply are not there.  All equipment in the room works fine, cleaning every day, the staff are polite, if they do not understand Russian, they silently smile and call for help.  There is a work kettle, daily tea bags and hot water are brought to the room.  Very convenient is what you can ask for at the reception a fridge for food.  Towels are changed daily if they are placed in a container for dirty laundry or directly on the floor.  Breakfasts to choose from: you can order chicken leg with mayonnaise, you can order a bun with cheese and milk.  They also offer barbecue, chicken roll and small rolls with chicken.  The myth that the Chinese accept the gift of chocolate as a bribe is completely unjustified.  On the contrary, when they see such a gift, they run away scared.  By the way, their local chocolate is not at all sweet, as in Russia.

    <p>  There are some negative moments of <span>relaxation in China.</span>  But we can‚Äôt say that they relate specifically to staying at the City Link Hotel Sanya 3 * (Hainan).  Reviews from tourists suggest that China is still a very specific country. </p><h2>  Local flavor </h2><p>  Residents of China, unlike the Russians, are not at all worried about the cleanliness of the premises.  This is noticeable in the hotel.  The windows are always covered with dust, and there are no ashtrays on the tables in the cafe.  The Chinese, even in restaurants, do not clean and do not wash the floors, all the garbage falls down, which repels a little.  The Chinese relate to people of European and Slavic appearance as something very unusual and constantly make attempts to take a photo or ask for an autograph. </p><p>  The language barrier is quite difficult to overcome, since the hotel population is mainly foreigners.  The staff speak mostly Chinese, so it‚Äôs better to contact the hotel guides who explain everything in detail. <br>  From the public at the hotel, mainly Chinese people rest, there are few Russians, especially people from European countries.  Russian and English languages ‚Äã‚Äãare known at the most basic level, and then only in order to quickly get rid of the goods. </p><p>  Despite all these difficulties, tourists still seek to visit Hainan.  City Link Hotel Sanya 3 * is a good choice as a place to stay. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  There are 2 shopping centers on the right side of the hotel.  "Winter" - the center is slightly lower than the level, respectively, and prices.  ‚ÄúSummer‚Äù is a more beautiful center, although it costs more and more there.  For example, men's swimming trunks-boxers with Russian money cost as much as 8,000 rubles! </p><p>  There are centers that are adapted for the price of a Russian tourist, but most often they sell smuggled goods; it‚Äôs very difficult to find quality goods, but it‚Äôs real.  Fans of marine delicacies will fail, as seafood prices in China are too high. </p><p>  Shops and clubs at the resort close at 11 pm, so partygoers will not be happy with such a vacation either.  From alcoholic drinks you can buy sambuca, liquor and a local drink similar to vodka, which costs about 15 yuan. </p><p>  Speaking of beaches, it is worth noting that they are very safe and clean, there are buoys everywhere for a quiet swim.  The depth level can be compared with the indicators of the Krasnodar Territory and Anapa.  On the beach, lifeguards on towers are on duty, ready to always pull a person out of the water, if necessary.  In the sea you can meet different small animals. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Sightseeing trips are not worth attention, since a huge amount of time is spent on it, and they don‚Äôt really give you anything to consider.  It takes a lot of money for these excursions, because the Chinese are constantly trying to sell unnecessary goods: shark fat, silk, seaweed and more.  For such an excursion, which was first called free, they obligate you to pay $ 18.  The surcharge is also due to the fact that during the tour vacationers are fed local dishes. </p><p>  As for shops and purchases, there are many such people who will buy everything in a row.  It‚Äôs better to go to the Stone Park and other sights for excursions on your own, as for guides the same service will fly, frankly, ‚Äúa pretty penny‚Äù.  The bus journey will take a little more than 40 minutes, and the stop is literally across the road.  The prices there are reasonable, an entrance for 2 people costs about 180 yuan, you can rent a golf car and go around the entire park, without rushing anywhere and not being distracted by anything.  There is a golf course where you can warm up.  Nearby is the center of Buddhism with all kinds of Buddha statues and stories about his life path.  From the city of Sanya, the center of Buddhism is 40 kilometers away.  Transfer with escort to the place costs 120 yuan. </p><p>  Instead of a clean beach, having arrived at the place, you can get a raging sea with high waves and an uncomfortable pebble surface of the coast.  To take a picture near Guanin, you need to go in one direction for about 15 minutes, which is extremely inconvenient. <br>  There are those people who offer private excursions, which is a little more convenient.  Near the shopping center "Winter" such a person is constantly on duty.  This Chinese is not the only one there, very many offer to conduct a tour.  Such a trip costs about 30 yuan, and another 4 have to pay a fare.  In a golf cart, the calculation takes place on special sheets with hieroglyphs. </p><p>  The park has a very beautiful landscape, with a gorgeous view of the sea and the whole of Hainan.  <span>The wish tree is</span> completely hung with ribbons that people buy in the same park at the box office. </p><p>  In general, rest in Hainan is very unusual and full of contrasting emotions.  You definitely won‚Äôt be bored here. </p>
