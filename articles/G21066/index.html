Las Lenas </h2><p>  At the end of the list of ski centers in the United States, I would like to travel to another continent and note the best ski resort in South America - Las Lenas, located in Argentina.  It has an area equal to sixteen thousand hectares.  For comparison, the largest resort in North America reaches only three and a half thousand hectares.  The only problem is the cost of time and effort to get to the center, however many skiers and snowboarders note that Las Lenas is worth such funds. </p>
