In many respects it depends on what experience will be gained.  The article will discuss what you can count on for 40 years of work experience, what benefits are available and whether the pension will be recalculated. </p><h2>  The legislative framework </h2><p>  The main laws, the provisions of which are considered under the article, include: </p><ol><li>  The law ‚ÄúOn labor pensions‚Äù No. 400-. </li><li>  Law "On Veterans" No. 5-FZ. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="arden.ac.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The legal framework for 40 years of experience" class="if uuid-3054302" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3054302.jpg"></div><h2>  Is there an increase for long work experience </h2><p>  Many elderly people have recently become interested: if they have 40 years of experience, what benefits are given to them.  This was preceded by the dissemination of information (which also appeared on some thematic sites) that in this case, the law provides for a pension increase, namely: </p><ul><li>  With an employment record of more than 30 years for women and 35 for men, one pension point. </li><li>  With work experience of over 40 years for women and 45 for men - by five points. </li></ul><p>  However, this information is nothing more than rumors.  It has no confirmation at the legislative level.  On the website of the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation, they were even forced to officially refute these rumors, saying that 40 years of experience did not give additional privileges.  What benefits are provided for a long period of work?  You can find out about this, for example, in a social protection authority. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the addition to the pension payment, then with a long experience it will really take place.  However, this depends on the labor activity as a whole, and not on the specific length of service.  If there is official work for a pensioner, recalculation is carried out annually in August.  Pension is growing due to the addition of <span>pension points.</span>  Additional treatment for this procedure is not required. </p><p>  Perhaps in the future the size of the pension will depend on the fact that the length of service is 40 years.  What benefits will apply to such individuals?  Maybe their list will increase significantly.  However, this topic is currently not relevant. </p><h2>  What is included in the length of service </h2><p>  To more fully understand how much you can count on in old age, you need to figure out what they get extra points for.  At the same time, we are not talking about the fact that the experience is more than 40 years.  What benefits are relied on for this and other points, too, let us leave without attention.  There are unearned periods for which seniority is accrued.  These include the following: </p><ol><li>  Caring for a small child before reaching 1.5 years.  But in this case, the restriction applies.  A woman can count on a maximum of 5 years, during which pension points will be awarded. </li><li>  Study does not apply to this period.  Therefore, students cannot rely on the fact that during their studies they will increase the number of retirement points.  But young people who have been drafted into the army or contract employees will receive retirement points.  The calculation is based on the length of service.  As a result, the contractor has the opportunity to additionally receive up to 40% of the salary for a future pension. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.agilitics.sg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What is included in the length of service" class="if uuid-3054303" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3054303.jpg"></div><h2>  Persons entitled to long service benefits </h2><p>  Despite the fact that special benefits for long service are not provided, benefits will still be provided, provided that the citizen has an appropriate status.  It's about the Veteran of Labor.  But there are some restrictions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  First, the general condition is 35 years of work experience for women, and for men 40 years of work experience (what benefits are provided for in this case can be found in federal law, as they are established at the state level).  Secondly, we are talking about people who started working during the Second World War before reaching adulthood.  Also, the status can be assigned to those who have awards of state or departmental significance with a work experience of at least 15 years, and in general - 20 years for women, 25 years for men. </p><p>  This is described in detail in the Law on Veterans No. 5-FZ.  At the same time, at the regional level, additional benefits and individual cash payments may be provided. </p><h2>  veteran of labour </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the conditions for conferring status are specified in federal law, the status itself has gained regional significance since 2005.  Therefore, individual constituent entities of the Russian Federation may provide for their conditions for its appropriation, including for 40 years of service.  What benefits will be provided in this case?  This also needs to be learned from regional laws. </p><p>  In most constituent entities of the Russian Federation, the conditions specified in federal law have been adopted.  But some of them put forward their own conditions.  These include the following regions: </p><ul><li>  In the Sverdlovsk region, the main condition is the presence of an award or an assigned rank.  At the same time, men should have work experience from 35 to 40 years, and for women - from 30 years.  But if a woman is a mother with many children, and has the Order of ‚ÄúMaternal Valor‚Äù, then he can be from 10 to 20 years old. </li><li>  In the Kostroma region, status is assigned with 40 years of experience for men and 35 years for women.  At least 25 years old men and 23 years old women must work in a specific professional field.  But the presence of an award or diploma for the assignment of status is not required. </li><li>  Separate conditions are provided in Yakutia.  According to regional legislation, men with experience of 25 years and women with 20 years of age can become labor veterans if there are awards of national significance, and work was carried out in the territory of this region.  The second reason includes working in a certain professional field for 15 years, and in Yakutia as a whole - 20 years and 25 years with experience of 35 and 40 years. </li></ul><p>  What benefits are provided for labor veterans?  You can find out about this by contacting the territorial branch of the social protection authorities at the place of residence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.burohappold.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Veteran of labor at the regional level" class="if uuid-3054304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3054304.jpg"></div><h2>  EDV </h2><p>  About what the surcharge for 40 years of experience, and what benefits are provided, we can conclude by considering EDV - a monthly cash payment.  The amount of this payment is established at the local level and is paid as an addition to the pension.  Depending on the region of residence, labor veterans may receive the following amount of EDV: </p><ul><li>  Moscow - 500 rubles. </li><li>  St. Petersburg - 828 rubles. </li><li>  Tatarstan - 448 rubles </li><li>  Nizhny Novgorod region - 508 rubles. </li><li>  Bashkortostan - 376 rubles. </li><li>  Krasnoyarsk Territory - 421 rubles. </li><li>  Krasnodar Territory - 487 rubles. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, labor veterans are allocated a small amount of pension increases.  True, the size increases annually after the indexation procedure.  However, significant growth as a result of this operation does not occur.  This is due to the fact that extended benefits are provided to pensioners with 40 years of experience with the status of ‚ÄúVeteran of Labor‚Äù.  Therefore, the legislator believes that this will be enough for an elderly citizen to provide decent living conditions in old age. </p><h2>  Privileges </h2><p>  As in the case of EDV, the legislator authorizes the establishment of regional authorities a list of benefits.  Moreover, the main species are fixed at the federal level.  These include the following: </p><ul><li>  Compensation for utility bills. </li><li>  Directions in public transport. </li><li>  Vacation at a convenient time. </li><li>  Medical service. </li></ul><p>  The following privileges are provided in the regions: </p><ul><li>  Compensation for half the cost of housing services. </li><li>  Compensation for half the cost of housing. </li><li>  Compensation for half the cost of solid fuel when living in a house with stove heating. </li><li>  Traveling by public transport without paying a fee. </li><li>  Installation of a landline telephone on preferential terms. </li></ul><p>  This is the main list that is provided in the regions to veterans for 40 years of work experience.  What benefits can still be provided?  These may include: </p><ul><li>  Exemption from property tax. </li><li>  Exemption from income tax on social payments, material support from a former employer, trips to sanatorium-type health facilities. </li><li>  Establishment of other tax benefits. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="cvpost.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Benefits for pensioners for long work experience" class="if uuid-3054333" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3054333.jpg"></div><h2>  Benefits in Moscow </h2><p>  Moscow pensioners can count on the following types of support: </p><ul><li>  EDV. </li><li>  Targeted assistance. </li><li>  Vehicle tax exemption. </li><li>  Discount for land tax. </li><li>  Exemption from payment for using a landline telephone. </li><li>  Home health care (free). </li><li>  Dental care in a social program. </li><li>  A ticket to the sanatorium for medical reasons, including travel on both sides. </li><li>  An increase to the pension if its size is less than the subsistence minimum applicable in Moscow. </li><li>  Free drugs or significant discounts on their purchase. </li></ul><h2>  Benefits in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  You can find out over 40 years of experience what benefits are provided in St. Petersburg from the regulatory framework of the region.  The main ones include the following: </p><ul><li>  EDV. </li><li>  Compensation for accommodation in the amount of 50%. </li><li>  Compensation for utilities in the amount of half the cost. </li><li>  A personalized ticket that allows you to use public transport. </li><li>  The right to travel on railway transport of suburban communication on preferential terms. </li><li>  Tax exemptions. </li><li>  An additional measure is support for gas stoves (once every 20 years), for gas water heaters (once every 10 years), for electric stoves (once every 15 years). </li></ul><h2>  Pension calculation </h2><p>  After the pension reform in 2015, pension points were introduced.  Therefore, the formula for calculating a pension has become different.  Under the new law, the pension began to consist of the following parts: </p><ul><li>  Base or fixed parts. </li><li>  Pension insurance. </li><li>  Cumulative pension (it was issued at the request of employees and stood out from the insurance part). </li></ul><p>  In the general case, the formula now has the following form: pension payment = (pension point * value of the pension point) + fixed part.  Additional variables for 40 years of experience in this formula do not apply.  However, indirectly, the length of the work period affects the size of the pension payment.  The more years a citizen works, the more pension points he will accumulate and, as a result, he will have a larger pension.  However, the law does not provide a specific date for increasing the payment for 40 years of work experience (which benefits are also provided does not depend on this parameter). </p><p>  Another pension reform is aimed at increasing the minimum insurance period.  If before the introduction of the reform it was only 5 years, then after its adoption it will be equal to 15 years.  This position is introduced gradually.  For example, in 2018, a citizen must work at least 9 years to obtain the right to a pension.  But in this case, nothing is said about the experience of more than 40 years. </p><p>  Benefits do not depend on the results of calculating a pension.  They are social in nature, therefore they are provided by the social service.  But some of them are drawn up in other government agencies (for example, tax benefits - in the tax office). </p><div class="photo" data-original="iwchamilton.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pension calculation" class="if uuid-3054321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3054321.jpg"></div><h2>  When can a pension be increased </h2><p>  You can count on an increase in retirement when a person reaches 80 years of age, regardless of whether the period of work of a pensioner is 20, 30 years or work experience of more than 40 years.  What benefits are provided in this case? </p><p>  Surcharge for pensions of citizens of this age consists of a double size of a fixed part.  Both the retirement score and the basic part of the payment are changed every year taking into account inflation.  This year, the basic part of the payment is 4,982.90 rubles.  If the pension of an elderly person was equal to 13,982.90 rubles, then after 80 years in 2018 it will amount to 18,965.80 rubles.  (9,000 + 4,982.90 * 2). </p><p>  Such recalculation is not carried out in relation to disabled people of group 1.  This is explained by the fact that for them the pension is initially paid from a double indicator of the base part.  In this case, there will be no reason for raising the pension for the loss of a breadwinner.  But older people can apply for an old-age insurance pension.  Perhaps its size will be higher than the payout for the loss of a breadwinner. </p><h2>  How can a pension be increased? </h2><p>  The new rules encourage Russian citizens to retire and draw up relevant documents later than the deadline in the general manner.  The law says: if a citizen applies to the Pension Fund later than the deadline (but no later than 5 years from the moment of retirement age), then a raising coefficient is applied to the general calculation formula.  Its maximum value is 1.36.  The initial pension calculated by the Pension Fund is multiplied by this indicator. </p><p>  In addition, payment to senior citizens is subject to annual indexation.  This allows her to remain at a level sufficient to satisfy the basic needs of an elderly person.  However, at present, indexation is not carried out in relation to payments to persons of retirement age who continue to work.  Their payment increases due to the receipt of new retirement points at work.  If indexation of pension payments is carried out at the beginning of the year (in January - February), then the recalculation of pension points in the middle (in August).  But the maximum number of points that can be awarded to pensioners in one year is 3. </p><p>  If benefits will be introduced over 40 years of experience that will save money, then they can also be considered a parameter due to which pensioners' incomes will grow.  But today there is no such situation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="themortgagereports.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How can a pension be increased?" class="if uuid-3054322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3054322.jpg"></div><h2>  Expert Advice </h2><p>  Since the conditions and the connection of the provision of benefits to the length of service largely depend on the region of residence, experts recommend contacting local government agencies.  These are social protection bodies, tax inspectorate, local administration and so on.  If possible, it is advisable to obtain legal advice.  But one way or another, it must be borne in mind that every year the situation may change.  Therefore, in order to take advantage of all the privileges that older people with long work experience have the right to, you need to be aware of new regulatory acts of regional and local significance. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.independent.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tips for retirees" class="if uuid-3054352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3054352.jpg"></div><p>  The current legislation of the Russian Federation does not establish special conditions for work experience of 40 years.  Therefore, on this basis no recalculation is carried out.  But a labor veteran can count on a small supplement for 30, 35 or 40 years of experience.  And what privileges are provided in this case, and how this status is assigned - all these issues are addressed by the regional authorities.  The calculation of the pension is carried out according to a single scheme, regardless of whether the pensioner is a labor veteran or not. </p>
