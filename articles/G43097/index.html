Commonwealth of Dominica</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Dominica is associated with a kind of geographical confusion.  Many take it for the Caribbean republic of the same name.  Our article is intended to clarify this issue.  All three political and geographical sites are located in the <span>Caribbean.</span>  But the similarity ends there.  <span>The Dominican Republic</span> occupies the eastern part of the rather large island of Haiti.  It is located in the Greater Antilles archipelago.  But the Commonwealth of Dominica occupies a whole, albeit small, island.  This is a completely different state, with its own government, currency and history.  Geographically, Dominica belongs to the group of the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean.  In terms of population and modest territory, the country is considered a dwarf state.  The tourism sector of the economy in it is only gaining momentum and is still significantly behind the promoted Dominican Republic.  But the Commonwealth has a great future.  The country is often called the "Island of the Caribbean Nature", hinting at the pristine pristine scenery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominica Island" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/966001.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Geography </h2><p>  Dominica Island on the world map is barely visible.  Its area is only 754 square kilometers.  Let's try to find him on the map.  The Small Antilles (also called the Windward) Islands stretched in a narrow strip from north to south, outlining the eastern borders of the Caribbean Sea in an arc.  This archipelago includes many dwarf states, such as, for example, Saint-Martin (Saint-Martin), <span>Antigua and Barbuda,</span> Grenada.  Dominica is located approximately in the center of this cluster of islands.  From the north-west it borders with Guadeloupe, and in the southeast - with Martinique.  The Lesser Antilles are formed by volcanic activity.  Of these, Dominica is the youngest.  But there are no active volcanoes on the island.  Only hot springs and geysers indicate that the bowels have not calmed down yet.  The highest point is the extinct Dyabloten volcano (1447 meters above sea level).  On this mountainous island is the second largest lake in the world with ever boiling water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominica island on the map" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/966011.jpg" width="422"></div>

Therefore, the climate there is humid, tropical.  The air temperature here fluctuates throughout the year in the range +25 ... + 27 degrees.  In the west of the island, near the sea, there are relatively arid areas.  But for the most part, it often rains in Dominica.  There are two distinct seasons.  From November to March, excellent weather is set.  Showers if they go, they are short-lived, and rainfall at night.  Then the island has a tourist season.  But from July to September, it is better to refrain from a trip to Dominica.  The island at this time is in the zone of action of hurricanes.  As recently as in August 2015, the terrible typhoon "Erica" ‚Äã‚Äãhit Dominica, throwing the country twenty years ago in its development.  The nature of the island is amazingly beautiful.  The mountainous terrain is covered with lush jungle.  Near the sea are beaches with golden or black volcanic sand.  Rainforests are home to many species of plants and animals that are no longer found anywhere in the world.  The water area off the coast of Dominica is teeming with wildlife.  Therefore, the island is attractive for its sea fishing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominance story" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/966010.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, the great navigator named the land on the day of the week (from the Latin word Dominicus).  After that, the island of Dominica was forgotten by Europeans for more than a hundred years.  In 1635, France claimed its rights to this territory.  But after twenty-five years the island was left at the disposal of the Caribbean Indians.  But French influence remained.  According to the <span>Paris Peace</span> Treaty <span>,</span> signed in 1763, the island went to Britain.  The population sympathized with the French, and in 1778 they tried to bring this colony back.  But in 1805, Dominica officially became part of the British Heritage.  Slavery in all colonies of the United Kingdom was abolished in 1834.  Since the island was forcibly settled by immigrants from Africa, Dominica became the first territory where a Negroid majority was represented in the government.  In 1958-1962, the island was part of the Federation of the West Indies.  As an independent state, Dominica appeared on the political map of the world on November 3, 1978.  This day is celebrated as a national holiday. </p>

    <h2>  Modern political structure and state symbols </h2><p>  In form of government, this is the Parliamentary Republic.  Dominica is governed by the President, who is elected by Parliament, and the Prime Minister.  At this time, these are Charles Savarin and Roosevelt Skerrit.  The anthem of Dominica begins with the words "Island of Beauty and Splendor."  The motto of the state is the phrase on the patois: "After God, we love the Earth."  The Commonwealth of Dominica has a very beautiful flag.  On a green field (the color of the jungle) is depicted a parrot sisser.  This bird, also called the imperial Amazon, lives only on the island of Dominica and nowhere else.  This endemic adorns the coat of arms of a parliamentary republic called Dominica.  The country's currency is the East Caribbean Dollar.  He is quoted in relation to the American approximately one in two and a half.  The country is administratively divided into parishes.  They all bear the names of saints (which reflects the great authority of the Roman Catholic Church on the island).  There are ten in total: David, Andrew, George, John, Joseph, Mark, Luke, Paul, Patrick and Peter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="caribbean island of dominica" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/966706.jpg" width="400"></div>

Aborigines - Caribbean Indians - make up less than three percent of the total population.  White Europeans and even less - 0.8%.  The state of Dominica is urban.  About seventy percent of the population lives in cities.  Although the country's well-being is largely dependent on the success of agriculture.  The capital of the country is Roseau.  This is not a metropolis at all, although the island‚Äôs largest city.  Its population is only eighteen thousand people.  People on the island mostly live long: 80 years - women, 74 years - men.  The population density is 94 people per square kilometer.  English is recognized as the official state language.  In the countryside, people talk on the patois.  This is a local dialect based on the French language. </p>

    <h2>  Culture </h2><p>  The Caribbean island of Dominica is an ethnic cauldron in which representatives of various ethnic groups coexist.  Although, when the Europeans arrived on these shores, only two tribes lived there - Kalinago and Arawak.  Now the population is very motley, and this affects the local culture.  Dance and music - not a single significant event in the country can do without them.  That is why Dominica has become the stage for many festivals.  So, since 1997, a week of Creole music has been held here annually.  Also, a tourist who has visited this island simply needs to try the dishes of the local cuisine.  This is mainly meat (usually poultry, but maybe lamb or beef) in a very spicy sauce.  For dessert, mixes made from fruits are served. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caribbean island of Dominica" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/966012.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tourism </h2><p>  The backbone of the Dominican Commonwealth economy is the cultivation of bananas, cocoa, coconut palms, tobacco, citrus fruits and mangoes.  Tourism is the second important industry.  It is gaining momentum every year.  Not far from the capital of Roseau, Melville Hall International Airport operates.  But bank cards are still accepted only in the capital and resorts of the west coast.  Tourists visit the island mainly in the winter.  Mostly people are attracted to beautiful beaches with fine <span>black sand</span> and the azure Caribbean Sea.  On the east side, the island of Dominica is washed by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean.  Therefore, safes also come here.  The nature here is fabulously beautiful.  There are many exotic birds in the forests, waterfalls and crystal streams fall from the mountains.  The heat is mitigated by the constantly blowing northeastern trade winds.  For citizens of the Russian Federation visiting the island for the purpose of tourism, a visa is not needed.  However, the period of stay in the Commonwealth shall not exceed twenty one days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Islands in the caribbean" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/966013.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Relax on the black sand washed by the azure waters - is not this a fairy tale?  If you're an insecure swimmer, choose the west coast of the island.  But in the east there are areas where the high waves of the Atlantic Ocean do not make their way over the reef.  These are sandy beaches south of Kalibishi.  In general, the Republic of Dominica provides tourists with a wide selection of beautiful places for swimming.  In the south of the island is located "Champagne Beach".  It is pebble, but not the point.  Hot springs overlook shallow water.  Bubbles of air also gave the name to the recreation area.  For snorkeling, this is a great place, because nearby is a coral reef.  And for lovers of noisy fun water recreation, the Purple Turtle beach on the north coast is suitable.  Coconut Beach, Mero and Napiers are equally popular. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Dominica Island has everything to surprise a tourist with.  The number one on the Must see list is Boyling Lake.  As the name implies, the water in it boils due to damping volcanic activity.  A UNESCO listed lake located in the Morn-Trois-Python National Park.  The masterpieces created by nature itself are the waterfalls of Pain, Brandy, Sari-Sari.  In the capital of the state, Roseau, you should see Fort Shirley and the Old Market, which once sold slaves.  Also in the list of attractions is L'Escallie Tete Chin. </p>

    <p>  During the eruption of the volcano, which occurred thousands of years ago, an extensive field of petrified lava was formed.  Locals consider this lunar landscape to be sacred and many legends associate with it.  It is worth staying on this Caribbean island for at least a couple of days to understand why Dominica is the fourth in the world among the happiest countries (according to the rating of the New Economic Foundation). </p>
