  <section class="page js-page"><h1>System camera: review of the best models, specifications, description, features, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The trend towards optimization of photographic equipment provides many advantages for users, but with them the disadvantages of such models will inevitably also appear.  These include limited functionality and very average shooting characteristics.  The reverse approach is demonstrated by the example of system cameras, which combine the advantages of compacts and SLRs.  But during operation, much will also depend on the specific model. </p><h2>  Features of system cameras </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.convexa.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="System Camera Matrix" class="if uuid-2746821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2746821.jpg"></div><p>  For lovers of photography today offers several directions of choice, the main of which can be called smartphones, digital compact cameras and DSLRs.  And if the first two groups do not suit sophisticated amateur enthusiasts due to the low quality of images, then mirror models are large in size and have complex functionality, which is also not suitable for every user.  The solution may be precisely a system camera, which is modest in size and provides a truly high-quality result, in some parameters even close to a professional level.  For example, Sony system cameras in some versions weigh only 300-400 g, fit in clothing pockets.  In terms of shooting opportunities, their modular design allows you to assemble a photographic tool for almost any task.  For example, basic equipment can be expanded with a lens, lens, microphone and flash.  And this is only part of the capabilities that distinguish system models of cameras.  Now it‚Äôs worthwhile to examine in more detail what specifically the advanced manufacturers of this equipment offer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sony mirrorless cameras </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.imaging-resource.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony System Camera" class="if uuid-2746833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2746833.jpg"></div><p>  In the system cameras of the Japanese company Sony, two types of matrices are used: </p><ul><li>  Amateur APS-C.  Relative to standard 4/3 format modules, it is 1.6 times larger, and 13 times larger than compact matrices 1 / 2.3. </li><li>  Premium 35mm full-frame shooting. </li></ul><p>  In other words, the Sony system cameras are equipped with two lens options to choose from, and in both cases the E mount is provided. As for additional features, almost all models of this standard receive wireless NFC and Wi-Fi modules that allow you to control the device remotely from a smartphone and Transfer photos and videos to other devices.  Amateur models with the APS-C matrix are also provided with optical image stabilization. </p><h2>  Sony Alpha A7 Kit </h2><p>  This modification is considered the world's first representative of a system mirrorless camera designed for the mass consumer.  The device is equipped with a 35 mm matrix, the resolution of which is 24.3 MP.  The device belongs to professional photographic equipment, which is confirmed not only by a high price level, but also by a wide dynamic spectrum, low noise level and natural colors - the advantages that characterize full-frame shooting.  Equipped with a Sony Alpha system camera of this version and fast combined autofocus.  For integration of the viewfinder, microphone and flash, a bracket with sync contact is provided.  In the basic kit there is a zoomed-in lens with a range of 28-70 mm.  The shooting speed is 2.5 frames / sec. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Alpha A7 Kit" class="if uuid-2748157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/2748157.jpg"></div><h2>  <span>Sony Alpha A7</span> II Body </h2><p>  The second generation of the Sony full-frame mirrorless camera, in which the previous base was preserved in the form of a processor, matrix and autofocus system.  But a new 5-axis stabilization was added.  This inclusion eliminated the effect of "shake" when shooting on weight in low light.  As users note, the quality of close-ups has improved, regardless of the type of lens.  Also, the system camera is distinguished by high-quality video shooting in FullHD formats at 60 frames / second and XAVC S. However, the advantages in performing this function still relate to the A7S modification, which also works confidently with 4K video. </p><h2>  Fujifilm System Cameras </h2><p>  Another Japanese giant on the photographic market, which in the mirrorless segment focuses on mechanical controls.  This gives the models a special image of retro-devices resembling classic film cameras.  In particular, the design has discs for switching shooting modes, and aperture rings are provided on lenses of the XF series.  Moreover, Fujifilm system cameras at the base do not have image stabilizers - this function fully applies to lenses.  In order to expand the possibilities for a modular layout, the developers endowed the devices with the ability to combine with Leica lenses, but only through an adapter to the M mount. Wi-Fi is provided for wireless communication with other devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Fujifilm X-A2 Camera </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.amateurphotographer.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fujifilm System Camera" class="if uuid-2746834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2746834.jpg"></div><p>  The lowest-level model in the Fujifilm mirrorless segment, the pluses of which include the modest size and ergonomics of control.  Despite the averaged technical characteristics, a sufficiently high quality material can be extracted from this apparatus.  This will be facilitated by a wide range of shooting modes (again with a manual switch), an optional flash connection and a complete lens with a range of 16-50 mm.  If we talk about the shortcomings, then the system camera of this modification is equipped with a sensor with a resolution of only 16 megapixels and does not have a viewfinder.  Accordingly, you should prepare for positioning frames through the LCD screen.  Although the design of the display with the ability to fold up to 75% makes the device convenient when shooting self-portraits. </p><h2>  Model Fujifilm F X-T10 16‚Äì50 </h2><p>  Also, a budget-level camera, provided with a 16-megapixel sensor, but with wider functional tools.  The company used innovative technology of hybrid automatic focusing, which ‚Äúguides‚Äù the subject even in conditions of active movement of the body.  The frame rate of the F X-T10 16-50 system camera is only 8 frames per second, so this choice is more suitable for a beginner amateur.  But the lack of performance is compensated by a fast viewfinder with a delay of 0.005 seconds, a folding LCD screen and a built-in flash.  And again, it is worth emphasizing the successfully implemented design in the style of devices of the last century, which distinguishes this line from more technological competitors. </p><h2>  Olympus System Cameras </h2><p>  Without fail, all cameras of this company are equipped with a stabilizer and a Wi-Fi module with the ability to control via a smartphone.  The premium versions also receive zoom lenses with a range of 14‚Äì42 mm for long-range shooting.  They support Olympus mirrorless and layout assistive devices like the same flash, viewfinder and lens, but this addition requires some configuration.  Connection problems are not uncommon, as a result of which a camera system error such as No camera head may occur.  This means that the camera head is not connected - most likely, the connection was made with inappropriate adapters. </p><p>  Olympus is also famous for joint developments with other manufacturers of photographic equipment.  The most notable model in this niche was Micro 4/3, which Panasonic experts also worked on.  The device received a 35 mm matrix with a resolution of 16 megapixels.  According to users, with a compact size, this mirrorless camera, in combination with correctly selected lenses, takes pictures of excellent quality. </p><h2>  Panasonic Models </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panasonic Lumix System Camera" class="if uuid-2746838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2746838.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, Panasonic has in its assortment and completely ‚Äúits own‚Äù development of system cameras.  This segment represents the DMC series with several versions.  The base is considered Lumix DMC-GF7K, designed for beginner amateur enthusiasts.  The device is equipped with a rotary display, accurate and quick autofocus of the Contrast AF system, built-in flash and Wi-Fi module.  That is, in terms of basic functionality, this is the best entry-level system camera, but there is also a more advanced modification - DMC-G7K.  This camera supports 4K video recording at a frequency of 25 frames per second with a matrix resolution of 8 megapixels.  But the creators pay special attention to the high-contrast autofocus DFD, which captures objects in 0.06 seconds, allowing you to perform 6 frames per second in continuous focus mode.  This system works only with genuine Panasonic lenses. </p><h2>  Nikon and Canon models </h2><p>  These manufacturers of photographic equipment occupy a leading position in the segment of SLR cameras, and the niche of system devices attracts them much less.  Nevertheless, they have interesting offers. </p><p>  Nikon has developed a compact model 1 J5 Kit for mirrorless lovers, whose inch matrix has a resolution of 20.8 megapixels.  Moreover, almost a pocket-sized camera is capable of shooting video in 4K format, and in autofocus mode takes up to 20 pictures per second.  In terms of functional equipment, a high level is also maintained - there are wireless NFC and Wi-Fi communication modules, a built-in flash and an LCD display with 180 degree rotation mechanics.  Only a wide-angle lens with a focus of 10‚Äì30 mm will upset experienced photographers. </p><p>  Canon cameras are also on the market for photographic equipment, the most notable of which is the EOS M3 Kit.  The model is equipped with a 24.2 megapixel APS-C sensor and a folding screen, and optionally you can connect an electronic viewfinder and an external flash.  Management is implemented both in manual mode and through built-in Wi-Fi and NFC modules. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.canonwatch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="System camera canon" class="if uuid-2746836" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2746836.jpg"></div><h2>  Samsung Galaxy NX Camera </h2><p>  The Korean manufacturer focused on the intellectual capabilities of the camera, providing the Galaxy NX Android OS model.  The design of the device also turned out to be unusual - the design is made in a large but flat form factor, which is praised for the convenience in physical handling.  The increase in size compared to previous versions of the NX is due to the use of a 4.77-inch LCD.  As for the shooting capabilities, the high quality of the images is provided by the 21.6 MP APS-C sensor, electronic viewfinder and autofocus.  Communication capabilities are implemented through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  For communication with video and audio equipment, HDMI and DLNA interfaces are provided. </p><p>  Thanks to the Android platform, the Galaxy NX system camera also got the ability to program photo settings through the iFunction option.  In particular, parameters such as photosensitivity, shutter speed and aperture, white balance, etc. lend themselves to quick auto-correction. What is still noteworthy, the device supports a GPS navigation system, and with a SIM card installed, it can work with SMS-kami.  In general, it turned out a high-tech smart device that significantly expanded the functional spectrum of system photographic equipment without lowering the basic quality of shooting in its class. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.engadget.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy NX System Camera" class="if uuid-2746837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2746837.jpg"></div><h2>  System Camera Reviews </h2><p>  Owners of mirrorless cameras still differently evaluate their performance.  The obvious advantages they include design capabilities, the benefits of physical ergonomics, as well as the inclusion of more advanced management and communication tools.  All this makes system models more attractive with respect to SLR devices.  But on the other hand, this technique is often criticized for problems with finding a suitable lens and in general accessories, since manufacturers mainly focus on their components with a few exceptions, as is the case with Fujifilm.  On the other hand, it is the competent selection of optics that in many respects ensures the proper level of shooting quality. </p><p>  Ambiguous reviews regarding the cost.  If budget models with 16 megapixel matrices can be purchased for 15-20 thousand rubles, then the best system camera from the Sony Alpha line will cost 80-90 thousand rubles.  Moreover, this version will also have to buy some components for full operation at least at the level of capabilities of the mirror device assembly at the same level.  Another thing is that the quality of images thanks to the APS-C matrix will be higher, which is also confirmed by users. </p>
