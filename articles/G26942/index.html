There are people who liked absolutely everything.  But there are those tourists who expressed a number of complaints.  For the most part, this concerns the work of staff (maids) who did not clean the rooms as expected.  This disadvantage can be attributed to the human factor.  On the floors where conscientious people worked, tourists had no comments on the service. </p><p>  The Coral building is high-rise, so four elevators work here.  Rooms for accommodation are provided in different categories: standard (I category), luxury, studios and apartments.  All of them are equipped with amenities including a toilet, washbasin, shower or bath.  The apartment has a bathtub and shower with a tray.  Each room has a balcony with a selection of plastic furniture. </p><p>  Standard rooms are designed for 2 people and are furnished with furniture, including beds (two single or one double), wardrobe, table, chairs, bedside tables, a large mirror.  From electrical appliances there is a TV, a <span>small refrigerator,</span> air conditioning, hair dryer, flashlight, telephone. </p><p>  The modern design and cozy appearance distinguishes the deluxe rooms available at the Coral Sanatorium (Adler).

They are brought by the waiter.  Undoubtedly, this is convenient, since there is no need to jostle in the queues, plus, every day you can choose something new.  The disadvantage is that the portions are somewhat small.  Those who choose the buffet will have to take food at the distribution.  Cons - large crowding of the people, the waiters do not always have time to clean the dishes from the tables.  Plus - you can put as much food on your plate as you want, so you won‚Äôt stay hungry.  The menu always contains dishes of meat, vegetables, a variety of side dishes, pastries, fruits.

On the territory of the complex and behind it there are a lot of <span>cafes, restaurants,</span> bars, many of which are located very close to the Coral Hotel (Adler).  Guest reviews mark the most popular.  These are ‚ÄúSail‚Äù, ‚ÄúOasis‚Äù, ‚ÄúParadise‚Äù, ‚Äú31st parallel‚Äù.  Tourists really liked the cafe ‚ÄúOlesya‚Äù, located outside the territory of ‚ÄúCoral‚Äù.

    <h2>  Beach, rest outside the sanatorium </h2><p>  Everyone who comes to the sea is primarily interested in the beach.  ‚ÄúCoral‚Äù (Adler) is just a stone's throw from the coast, which you have to go through the tunnels laid under the railway tracks.  Some vacationers also cross the railway, noting this as a lack of a sanatorium. </p><p>  The "Coral" has two beaches - with sand and pebbles.  It is always crowded here.  The second beach is freer, but the pebbles there are large, and entering the sea is more difficult.  Sun beds, umbrellas and other beach accessories are paid, but guests of the sanatorium are provided with free wooden trestle beds.  Nuance - behind them you need to climb multi-stage stairs.  The sea on this stretch of coast is excellent, clean and warm.  The water temperature in July-August reaches 28 degrees.  Adler's climate is somewhat peculiar, due to geographical features: on the one hand the sea, and on the other - mountains.  In winter, it is a couple of degrees warmer than in other areas of the coast, and in the summer it is somewhat cooler. </p><p>  Now, regarding the rest outside the territory of the sanatorium (except for the sea and numerous bars and restaurants): you can make independent trips to the attractions of the resort (Sochi-park with extreme attractions, the Olympic complex, the southern culture arboretum), as well as book excursions in Sochi and the surrounding area .  The tour desk is located in the building of the sanatorium "Coral". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adler Coral Resort" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/874655.jpg" width="440"></div>
