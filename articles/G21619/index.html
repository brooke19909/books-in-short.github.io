Therefore, the term "Bavarian Alps" is not strictly scientific.  After all, the ridge itself stretches not only along the German state of the same name, but also captures part of Austria, as well as a piece of another administrative unit of the Federal Republic of Germany - Baden-Wurttemberg.  Of course, these mountains are not the highest in the Alps.  The highest point in Bavaria (and at the same time throughout Germany) is the peak of the Zugspitze.  It reaches a height of less than three thousand meters, to be exact, 2962 m above sea level.  However, the Alps within Upper Bavaria are very picturesque and are an object of tourism almost all year round.  In winter, ski resorts operate here, and in summer lovers of trekking, mountaineering and hiking come here.  And bathing in thermal mineral springs and excursions to ancient towns and castles is a pleasure for all seasons.  Let us and we take a virtual journey through the Bavarian Alps.  It promises to be very interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bavarian Alps" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1766421.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A bit of geography </h2><p>  Let's first understand what the Bavarian Alps are and what part of the mountain system they occupy.  Bayerische Alpen lie in the southeast of Germany.  And if we consider the Alps as a mountainous country, then the Bavarian part occupies the extreme northeast.  This territory lies between the valleys of the Zalakh and Leh rivers.  And in a scientific language it is called the Northern Limestone Alps.  This part of the mountainous country is relatively low, but very rocky.  The borders of the Bavarian ranges are the West Reth, North Tyrolean limestone and Salzburg Alps.  But even within the borders of the federal land, the mountain system has its own division.  It consists of ranges: the Allg√§u Alps with the peak of Hochfr√∂ttspitze (2649 m), the Ammergauer (Kreuzspitze, 2340 m), the Chimgauer (Sonntagshorn, 1961 m), the Berchtesgaden (Watsmann, 2713 m), Karwendel (25 Ost).  The highest is Wetterstein with the Zugspitze mountain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gorbachev's Villa in the Bavarian Alps" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1766444.jpg" width="600"></div>

And therefore, no matter how warm the winter may be, the snow cover is guaranteed to you.  Attached is a developed infrastructure of entertainment, high-quality European service tracks of various difficulty levels, which can be tested on yourself at the height of more than thirty ski resorts.  And ride directly from the slopes of Zugspitze.  This mountain is famous for the fact that the slopes for skiers and snowboarders operate here all year round.  But this is not all the advantages of Zugspitze.  Climbing to this mountain will not be difficult, because a mountain train (it leaves the town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen) and a cable car will bring you to the top.  Zugspitze is a rather long mountain.  It consists of several individual peaks.  Lifts also lead to them.  The ski resorts have the entire imaginable leisure infrastructure.  The tracks are well equipped, many are lit in the evening.  You can dine in the many restaurants with panoramic views of the Bavarian Alps.  The resorts are carefully thought out apr√®s ski.  So skiers will definitely not be bored. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tegerndee Lake in the Bavarian Alps" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1766438.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Summer tourists: what is in store for them? </h2><p>  But not only the slopes and winter fun attracts this fabulous land.  The Bavarian Alps were mastered by travelers a long time ago.  The first tourist marked roads were laid in the 1850s by the king of the independent principality Maximilian II.  These paths were in every way adapted for ladies who, despite the uncomfortable women's outfits of that time, wanted to enjoy the amazing view.  Therefore, a trip to Maximilianweg will not be too tiring.  You can get to the beautiful Aybsee lake from Garmisch-Partenkirchen by mountain train and walk along a circular path through the nature reserve.  From the old town of Grainau, the Alpspitzbahn ski lift leads to the top of Osterfelderkopf (2050 meters above sea level).  The upper station also serves as a restaurant.  At the table with a glass of beer, it‚Äôs good to admire the view, but on the observation deck, hanging over the abyss, is even better.  The Kreuzek ski lift will take you to the second peak of the same name (1652 m).  Both upper stations are interconnected by a pedestrian marked trail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bavarian Alps of Attraction" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1766426.jpg" width="600"></div>

Photos of Neuschwanstein Castle ("New Swan Cliff") near the town of F√ºssen adorn every guide to Germany.  This, of course, is a remake, stylized as the Middle Ages, but it is very beautiful surrounded by mountains.  Another castle to visit is Linderhof near the village of Oberammergau.  Each settlement in the Bavarian Alps surprises with its unusual architecture.  The town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen is especially interesting.  In its vicinity there is a castle of the 1st century and a magnificent church with a frescoed dome.  It is worth stopping by in Tegernsee.  Not far from this town, in the commune of Rottach-Egern, is the well-known villa of Gorbachev in the Bavarian Alps.  True, the last leader of the USSR this year announced the sale of his possessions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bavarian Alps tours" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1766433.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Land of lakes </h2><p>  During the last ice age, masses of snow pushed hollows, which were then filled with water.  By the number of <span>lakes, Upper</span> Bavaria is almost not inferior to Karelia.  But swimming in these mountain ponds is not recommended, because the lakes are very cold.  And the edges are reserved.  The only mountain pond that is fully open to the public is Lake Tegernsee in the Bavarian Alps.  It is located just 50 kilometers from Munich, and residents of the federal capital love to come here for the weekend.  Here you can go sailing, surfing, water skiing, and in winter - ice skating.  Chiemsee and K√∂nigssee are also interesting. </p><h2>  Bavarian Alps Tours </h2><p>  This region does not know what the "non-season" is.  As soon as the snow falls off the ski slopes, as lovers of trekking, mountaineering and just hiking rush to climb the peaks.  From Moscow, tours go to the Bavarian Alps all year round.  It is planned to stay in Munich and resort mountain towns such as Ettal, Berchtesgaden, with trips to local castles and other attractions.  There are wellness tours.  It is planned to visit therapeutic terms on Lake Tegernsee (where Gorbachev‚Äôs villa is located in the Bavarian Alps).  As we already wrote, this year this manor with the romantic name "Ubert Castle" was put up for sale.  And if you have seven million euros, you can become the proud owner of an alpine chalet with a turret, built in 1908. </p>
