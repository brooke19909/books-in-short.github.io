    <h2>  Passion for politics </h2><p>  The biography of Giuseppe Mazzini indicates that he could become a successful writer or artist, if not for his passion for national ideas and ideas of freedom.  At that time, Italy suffered from fragmentation and political problems, which worried Giuseppe Mazzini very much.  Interesting facts of his biography indicate that at the age of 20 he became a member of the secret organization of carbonarians, but eventually became disillusioned with this, since there were elements of materialistic philosophy in the ideology of the brotherhood, which he rejected. </p><p>  Due to his activities, he was arrested, after which he was sent into exile, where he spent most of his life: first in France, and then in Switzerland and England.  Despite this, he did not abandon his ideas and continued to believe in the freedom and independence of his country. </p><h2>  Ideas and beliefs </h2><p>  Giuseppe Mazzini was convinced that changing the political situation in Italy was possible only through revolution.  He believed that national liberation was needed not only in Italy, but throughout Europe.  He claimed that he loves his country only because he loves all countries, and they should all be free. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to his convictions, all European nations should be equal and be on friendly terms, since this is exactly what God would like.  He was convinced that freedom and independence should be achieved through diplomacy or be a gift from the rulers.  He also argued that at the beginning of the 20th century, the ideas of freedom should go beyond Europe and go further.  This at one time became the basis for many revolutionary ideas in Asia and Africa.  Freedom, faith in a better future, and democracy are all that have always been important to Giuseppe Mazzini.  Photos indicate this as well as possible. </p>

    <h2>  "Young Italy" </h2><p>  In 1831, Giuseppe Mazzini founded the secret organization Young Italy, the purpose of which was to make Italy a single, free and independent camp with a republican form of government.  After that, similar organizations began to appear in other countries, for example, “Young Germany”, “Young Switzerland”, etc. </p><p>  In 1833, Mazzini was a participant and the main organizer of the invasion of Piedmont.  This expedition was unsuccessful and Mazzini was expelled from France, and the Young Italy organization was destroyed.  A year later, thanks to Mazzini, another organization appeared - Young Europe, which pursued the same goals.  However, this experience was unsuccessful.  While in Switzerland, Mazzini opens the magazine “La jeune Suisse”, but local authorities arrested the publishing house, and all its members, including Mazzini, were again expelled from the country.  Hiding from the police, Mazzini goes to London, where he establishes another organization, the Union of Italian Workers, which had branches in many European countries. </p><h2>  Revolution </h2><p>  When the revolution begins in Italy in 1848, Mazzini returns from exile and establishes the newspaper L'Italia del popolo, as well as another organization, Associazione nationale, which promoted national ideas to the masses.  During the revolution, in particular during the fall of Milan, Mazzini was a member of the Garibaldi detachment, and then was elected a member and head of the triumvirate.  When it became apparent that the revolutionaries had no chance and needed to negotiate with France and surrender Rome, Mazzini resigned and left for London. </p>

    <h2>  Life after the revolution </h2><p>  In 1870, a revolutionary movement also began in Sicily.  Mazzini had little faith in the success of this venture, but still went to the island.  During a trip to Sicily right on the high seas, he was arrested and sent to Gaetu.  After two months of imprisonment, he was released, but only on condition that he leaves Italy.  He agrees and moves to live in Switzerland, where he is still continuing his revolutionary work, and also opens another newspaper, La Roma del Popolo. </p><p>  Two years later, Giuseppe returns to Italy again, but during a trip through the Alps he caught a cold and suddenly died in Pisa in the house of one of his friends.  Giuseppe was buried in his hometown of Genoa.  Over 50 thousand people attended his funeral, and subsequently the funeral procession itself grew into a demonstration against the state. </p>
