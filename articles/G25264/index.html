Therefore, tourists go to <span>ski resorts,</span> choosing one of them, where you can actually carry out this flight.  And many choose the direction that has become popular - to the south of Khakassia at the Gladenkaya ski resort. <strong> </strong></p><h2>  About the resort and how to get there </h2><p>  It received its name from the mountain on which it is located.  By the way, Gladnaya is surrounded on all sides by mountain ranges, which affects weather conditions.  The climate in this area is sharply continental, that is, cold winters and hot summers.

The nature of Gladnaya made so unique that the tracks were laid from all sides. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khakassia ski resort smooth" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1844186.jpg" width="600"></div>  On the northern slope with a length of 3,500 meters, skiers can demonstrate a high class of skiing, because the height differences are 830 meters.

    <p>  The soft virgin snow of the southern slope beckons freeriders, fans of uncracked, with landscape and wooded obstacles, descents.  This, of course, is not for lovers, but athletes with good physical fitness, although in recent years, <span>skiing has</span> become safer.  Freeriders will appreciate the northwestern slope of the mountain with a 4,200 meter long track and a height difference of 920 meters.  For lovers of flat skis have their own tracks, as well as for tubers.  And, as at all <strong> </strong>  in the ski resorts on Gladenkaya there are trails for beginners, great for training. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Track maintenance </h2><p>  Gladenkaya slopes are served by 3 chairlifts and one ski lift.

    <p>  Despite the fact that weather conditions, that is, the presence of snow cover, allows you to have a long period of skiing, the ski resort "Gladenkaya" has a system of artificial snow formation.  It is considered the most difficult, with a snow zone of 2800 meters.  Snow compaction equipment - retracks regularly works on the slopes. </p><h2>  Rental points </h2><p>  The resort infrastructure has equipped locker rooms and left-luggage offices.  To ride on the slopes of the mountains, it is not necessary to take your own uniform with you to the resort, there is a rental of ski equipment and equipment, which is carried out at rental points.  There are several of them in the ski resort.  Sets of ski and snowboard equipment are presented by Fischer, Atomic and Rossingnol.  At the ski resort, an air cushion is provided, which is necessary for insurance, with stunts and extreme jumps of skiers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mountain equipment rental" class="if" height="438" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1844329.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The resort has instructors to teach beginners.  The ski-pass card is valid on the base.  Card modes: monthly, daily, for a certain number of lifts. </p><h2>  Accommodation and reviews </h2><p>  Accommodation for tourists is provided in the Gorny shelter, in the Gladenkaya hotel and in the Zharki sports complex.  "Mountain" - these are small houses on the mountain "Gladnaya".  These houses are located on the "shelf", where the lower lift lifts the skiers.  There is a small cafe.  The hotel offers rooms that will satisfy both the discerning public and students with limited financial resources.  In general, the cost of rest in a ski resort depends on the category of hotel rooms. </p><p>  ‚ÄúOnly mountains can be better than mountains‚Äù is the indisputable truth not only of climbers, but also of skiers.  That is why they go to Smooth.  Tourists like to relax here not only in winter.  The summer period is also interesting.  Family vacations at the Gladenkaya ski resort became popular.  According to vacationers' reviews, they are satisfied with the way to combine leisure and sports, visiting excursions organized by the resort administration.  I like the goodwill of employees of cafes, rental and hotels.  I like helicopter tours very much.  Yes, these tours are expensive, but there are a lot of impressions of flying over the mountains! </p>
