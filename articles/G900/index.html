    <p>  Public consciousness is a very important characteristic of society, which expresses primarily its spiritual life.  Such a consciousness reflects the mood, ideas, theories and views of social existence and is considered as an independent system. </p><p>  Social consciousness and its importance in the development of a nation </p><p>  No matter how strong or integrated a nation (or part of the population) may be, social consciousness is more or less characteristic of it.  The subject here is not a single person, but society.  Public consciousness has been forming over the centuries and to some extent depends on the historical development of events.  The mentality of the people can be called a demonstration of such a <span>mass consciousness.</span> </p><p>  Of course, this form of consciousness has a huge impact on the <span>development of society.</span>  The structure of public consciousness is as follows: </p><ul><li>  Social psychology expresses the motives, mood and feelings of society and in many respects depends on some characteristic customs and traditions.  This part of consciousness is a sensual and emotional way of knowing and reacting to life. </li><li>  Ideology is a theoretical reflection of the world, which demonstrates the degree of knowledge and understanding of the world by society or any part of it. </li></ul><p>  Of course, public consciousness is possible only with the interaction of ideology and social psychology. </p><p>  Social consciousness and its forms </p><p>  With the growth and development of mankind, people more and more improved their <span>cognitive abilities,</span> expanded their understanding and perception of the world.  It was in this way that the following <span>forms of social consciousness</span> arose: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Morality is one of the most important characteristics of collective consciousness.  After all, it is she who demonstrates the views and ideas of society, their system of norms and evaluation of the actions of both an individual person and a group of people or society. </li><li>  Political consciousness - demonstrates a combination of moods, ideas, traditions and views of different population groups.  At the same time, political consciousness fully reflects the requirements and interests of different social strata, as well as their relationship with each other. </li><li>  Law is another form of consciousness, which is characterized by the presence of a system of social norms.  This is how society evaluates rights, creates a legal ideology, which is then protected by the state.  It is worthwhile to understand that one person can create an idea, but it becomes part of public consciousness only after society has penetrated it. </li><li>  Religion is one of the oldest forms of social consciousness that arose many centuries before our era.  It includes faith, ideas about the divine and supernatural, as well as religious feelings and actions of society. </li><li>  Aesthetic consciousness - characterizes the perception by society of sensual, artistic images. </li><li>  Scientific consciousness is another part of the life and perception of society, which seeks to systematize the world into categories.  Here, only those facts that have found factual, material evidence are taken into account.  This part of consciousness reflects only rational facts. </li><li>  Philosophical consciousness is a theoretical perception of the world that studies some general laws and characteristics of both an individual society and the entire <span>population of the planet.</span>  This part allows you to create new methods of understanding the world.  By the way, each historical era is characterized by its own unique system of philosophical consciousness. </li></ul><p>  Public consciousness is of great importance for the development of a nation and its culture.  Indeed, it is culture that is considered the most striking reflector of collective consciousness, which demonstrates certain traditions, ideals, moral values, lifestyle and thinking not only of society as a whole, but also of each individual member. </p>
