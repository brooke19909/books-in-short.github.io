Of course, this issue will always be relevant, since for a person owning his own living space is an essential condition for a happy family life. </p><p>  The question of whether it is worth buying an apartment now is of fundamental importance for those who consider real estate as a profitable investment.  One way or another, but it is impossible to answer unequivocally, since today there are both pluses and minuses of such a deal. </p><h2>  The pace of construction is reduced, and demand is increasing </h2><p>  It must be emphasized that in general, apartments in our country over the past year fell in price.  And it is precisely at this time that housing should be purchased, which, according to experts, will surely increase in value over time.  In other words, to the question: ‚ÄúIs it worth buying a house now?‚Äù, A positive answer should be given.  Why? </p>

    <p>  The thing is that over the past 12 months the volume of planned construction decreased by a third, which will contribute to an increase in demand for square meters. </p><h2>  The devaluation of the national currency - a positive factor for the acquisition of housing </h2><p>  It is no secret that those who accumulated their savings in American currency were in a favorable position.  For them, the question of whether to buy housing now is clear as ‚ÄúGod's day‚Äù.  Everyone knows that housing prices are tied to the ruble, and the national currency is regularly cheaper in relation to the dollar.  Naturally, if a couple of years ago on the accumulated "green" purchase of an apartment was a rather difficult task, today it has been greatly simplified.  Moreover, experts say that in the future the dollar is not going to get cheaper. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Does it make sense to buy real estate in large cities </h2><p>  It should be noted that at present it is profitable to purchase housing in the metropolitan metropolis or near Moscow suburbs. </p>

    <p>  In particular, the territory of ‚Äúnew Moscow‚Äù is expanding rapidly, population growth is increasing, which means that demand for apartments in these areas is not far off.  Having bought one-, <span>two-room apartments</span> in new buildings near Moscow, you can sell them in a few years to your advantage. </p><h2>  Real estate investment </h2><p>  The acquisition of housing should now be considered by those who have free capital and who do not know where it can be invested.  Ruble deposits today will not bring significant profit, but the <span>money invested in real estate is</span> unlikely to depreciate.  Residential apartments with developed infrastructure can always be quickly sold, well, or rented out - which will also bring a good profit. </p><h2>  Is mortgage lending profitable today? </h2><p>  Of course, many are concerned about the question of whether to buy an apartment on a mortgage right now. </p>

    <p>  In fairness, it should be noted that a significant part of banking institutions have now begun to ‚Äúcurtail‚Äù mortgage lending programs.  Moreover, earlier <span>interest rates</span> on them increased, as the Russian Central Bank raised the discount rate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In particular, Sberbank for a certain time stopped issuing mortgages secured by an apartment and a car. </p><p>  Considering the question of what will happen with loans for apartments, one should focus on the following: ‚ÄúWhat will be the demand for them?‚Äù  Some experts believe that, given the current situation, interest rates in rubles may reach 20%.  Naturally, in such a situation there are few people who want to get a long-term loan.  Such enslaving conditions can go to those who urgently need to <span>improve housing conditions.</span>  However, they will try to take loans as soon as possible.  All this will lead to a decrease in demand for housing.  What will this mean?  Just that the apartments will become cheaper. </p><p>  At the same time, another part of analysts says that the ruble exchange rate will fall in parallel with the cheapening of oil, which will ultimately provoke a ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù in the housing construction market.  Thus, there will be fewer offers, but prices in rubles will stay. </p>

    <p>  To take a mortgage or not to take?  If housing prices fall, then you can still take a chance.  However, if they remain fixed for some time, the mortgage market will not develop.  One way or another, but experts do not recommend this year conclude a loan agreement for the purchase of housing, due to the existence of serious financial risks.  In any case, there is a high probability of tightening the conditions for obtaining a loan for the purchase of real estate by the bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Do you need investments in new buildings </h2><p>  Quite relevant is the question of whether it is worth buying an apartment in a new building now?  According to most analysts, prices for new buildings in rubles will rise in price.  This is partly due to the fact that many developers and sellers are used to setting the value of real estate in American and European currencies.  In addition, the price increase was provoked by the imitation of building materials and other services provided by developers.  In other words, the cost of goods increases, and construction companies in this regard do not want to incur losses.  Thus, the cost of new buildings put into operation today is comparable with the prices at which objects belonging to the category of secondary housing are sold. </p>

    <p>  The increase in prices for apartments in the new house also provoked an increase in the discount rate on the mortgage, which was set by the Central Bank. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the demand for new buildings decreased insignificantly.  Many people buy a ‚Äúprimary‚Äù because it is still cheaper than a second-hand housing.  Making a deal for a new building is more simplified than for a <span>secondary</span> real estate <span>market</span> object.  In addition, tenants can independently choose the layout of apartments, which is also an advantage of buying an object of the category of "primary" real estate market. </p><p>  So, is it worth buying an apartment in a new building in 2015 now?  If you have free funds that you want to profitably invest, then, of course, yes.  However, an important reservation should be made here: you need to deal only with a reliable developer or a construction company that can provide serious bank guarantees. </p><h2>  Does it make sense today to invest in a pit </h2><p>  In this regard, I would like to caution those who are interested in the question: "Is it worth it now to buy an apartment in a house under construction"?  There are huge risks that the financial potential of a construction company will not allow to complete the construction of a residential facility.  In any case, you must take certain precautions: check the contract with the developer for compliance with the law governing <span>shared construction.</span>  Also, do not forget that this document must go through the registration procedure with government agencies.  In addition, make sure that the reputation of the developer inspires confidence. </p>

    <p>  You can do this with the help of various <span>information resources by</span> looking at and analyzing the reviews of those people who used the services of a developer.

It would seem that after the peninsula became "Russian", the prospects for acquiring housing are most bright.  The resort area after all.  However, do not forget that today the government needs serious investments in the Crimean real estate market.  First of all, it is necessary to qualitatively update the infrastructure of the region, which will make it possible to make cheaper the supply of building materials - only in this case the prices for residential apartments in Crimea will be acceptable.  Currently, an increase in demand for housing in the secondary market category is recorded on the peninsula.  Of particular interest to him are Russian businessmen planning to open a hotel business.  Representatives of medium business are also eyeing Crimean apartments. </p><h2>  The situation in Ukraine </h2><p>  Of course, there are not many Russians who today would be bothered by the question of whether to buy an apartment in Ukraine now.  But there are some.  So... </p>

    <p>  This is not the first month that I have to admit that the real estate market in this country is going through hard times.  Sales volumes fell to a minimum, the tense situation and the crisis in the economy negatively affect its development. </p><p>  It should be noted that experts caution to purchase housing in Ukrainian new buildings, since local developers are engaged in their construction, as they say, of the last forces.  As for the objects of the category of the secondary housing market, today many Kievans seek to sell apartments at low prices, since the "lull" in the market will prevail for a long time.  The leading positions in terms of sales today are occupied by the Kiev, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkov, Odessa regions. </p><p>  Some are interested in the question: "Is it worth it now to buy an apartment in Kharkov?"  It should be noted that the demand for apartments in this Ukrainian city has decreased almost three times.  Currently, up to three hundred objects are sold and acquired per month.  According to analysts, apartments are bought primarily by those who have savings in foreign currency.  Thus, they provide themselves with the opportunity to earn on the rental of housing. </p>
