Until 1775 it was called - Yaitsky town.  It is located on the right bank of the Urals and on the left bank of the Chagan River, in the Caspian lowland.  A little over 300 thousand people live here.  The climate in this area is sharply continental, that is, it is hot and dry in summer, and cold enough in winter, with strong winds present.  The average annual temperature is +6.2 degrees. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.227821" data-lng="51.386543099999926" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/3/9/4/4394.png"></div><h2>  Brief historical background </h2><p>  In the XIII century in this area was the first settlement of nomads.  For the first time, local Cossacks swore allegiance to the Russian Tsar in 1591, but later there were still unrest, which were brutally suppressed. </p><p>  The main occupation of local residents was fishing and cattle breeding, as well as melons and gourds. </p><p>  In 1846, the settlement grew to the size of a large trading city.  Until the beginning of the 20th century, the city was the center of the Ural region. </p><p>  During the Civil War, Uralsk found itself in a zone of fierce hostilities.  In World War II, the city was a front-line zone. </p><p>  There are many historical distinguished names associated with the village.  These are Pugachev, Pushkin, Suvorov, Krylov and a number of others. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The city of Uralsk boasts interesting places where tourists can go. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First of all, this is the house-museum of Emelyan Pugachev.  The name of this person is associated with democracy and freedom.  He was one of the very first in the territory of the Russian Empire to think about the fact that it is not necessary for the poor people to go with the flow, but rather to win a worthy niche with their own hands. </p><p>  In fact, Emelyan was born far from these places, but it was here that in the 18th century, posing as Tsar Peter III, he called on the Cossacks to assert their rights to freedom.  In historical documents, this rebellion is called the Peasant War. </p><p>  The uprising was completely suppressed, the associate was sentenced to death, and so that the people forgot everything, they even renamed the river, so the Urals appeared instead of Yaik and the city of Uralsk, instead of Yaitsky town. </p><div class="photo" data-original="el.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="house-museum of Emelyan Pugachev" class="if uuid-2544249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2544249.jpg"></div><h2>  Cathedral of Christ the Savior </h2><p>  This attraction of Uralsk appeared in the city in 1907, they began to build it in 1891.  The construction was erected in a pseudo-Russian style, and its construction was timed to coincide with a significant date - 300 years from the date of service of the Cossack troops of Uralsk Russia. </p><p>  In Soviet times, the Museum of Atheism was marked here, then a planetarium worked at this place.  And only in the 90s of the last century the temple was returned to believers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pokrovsky convent </h2><p>  Another attraction of Uralsk recommended for visiting.  It is located on the Chagan River, in 1881 it was founded as a community.  Only in 1890 a monastery was opened here. </p><p>  In the lower temple are the particles of the relics of the Matrona of Moscow.  On great holidays, there are spiritual concerts and charity events for the disabled and orphans. </p><h2>  Shalkar Lake </h2><p>  This attraction of Uralsk is not located in the city itself, but 75 kilometers in a southeast direction.  It is believed that this is the remainder of the Khvalyn Sea, which retreated into the Caspian Sea thousands of years ago.  The total occupied area is 24 thousand hectares.  The maximum depth is 18 meters. </p><p>  The lake is fed by the Malaya and Bolshaya Ankata rivers and flows into the Solyanka river.  The composition of the lake‚Äôs water resembles that of the sea, so both local and visiting tourists come here for recreation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="total.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shalkar Lake" class="if uuid-2544252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2544252.jpg"></div><h2>  Vanished Arc de Triomphe </h2><p>  Few people know that once the landmark of Uralsk in Kazakhstan was the triumphal arch.  It was built in 1891 in honor of the arrival of Tsarevich Nikolai Alexandrovich.  However, after the revolution in 1927, it was demolished, considering it a relic of tsarist times.  Until that moment, it was simply renamed the Red Gate.  In the future, it was planned to install the Energy monument on this site, but nothing appeared there. </p><h2>  St. Michael the Archangel Cathedral </h2><p>  Perhaps this is the oldest attraction in Uralsk.  His exaltation ended in 1751.  It was near this cathedral that the Yaits uprising began. </p><p>  In the second half of the XIX century, the temple was classified as one-believing, because most of the local Cossacks were Old Believers, therefore services in the cathedral were carried out with almost complete observance of all the old rites. </p><p>  In 1825 there was a strong fire in the city, as a result of which the wooden bell of the church was damaged. </p><p>  Pushkin A. S. and Zhukovsky V. A., having arrived in Uralsk, visited St. Michael the Archangel Cathedral, collecting information about Pugachev. </p><p>  Believers got their cathedral back only in 1989, before that the Pugachev Museum, a historical and regional study (Soviet period), was located here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ticketon.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Michael the Archangel Cathedral" class="if uuid-2544238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2544238.jpg"></div><h2>  Dogwood Mosque </h2><p>  Another attraction of Uralsk in Kazakhstan is the Kizil Mosque, which was built in 1871.  It has been preserved in its original form and recognized as a monument of architecture. </p><p>  According to Soviet tradition, the mosque was closed and the minaret was removed, and the premises were used for various purposes: from a vocational school to a hostel. </p><p>  In the 90s of the last century, the mosque was transferred to the balance of the regional administration, where they decide on its dismantling, which they do.  Later, in 2006, local residents restored it according to old surviving drawings.  Now there are ongoing services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.tripadvisor.ru/LocationPhotos-g1454025-Oral_West_Kazakhstan_Province.html#117120918"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dogwood Mosque" class="if uuid-2544227" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2544227.jpg"></div><h2>  Old fire tower </h2><p>  You should definitely visit this attraction of Uralsk.  The photos here are impressive.  It was built at the end of the 19th century, and now it does not work. </p><p>  This one-story building is wooden, painted red and green.  In the middle there is a brick tower 6 meters high, and at the end of the building there is a transfer tower. </p><h2>  Modern buildings </h2><p>  Interesting and beautiful photos of the sights of Uralsk in Kazakhstan are obtained near the Wedding Palace.  This building is unique in its kind, and there are not even analogues in the whole country.  It was built by a local oil and gas company. </p><p>  This is a grandiose building with two halls for special occasions and a restaurant with 300 seats.  The palace was built of granite and marble. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ibirzha.kz" data-author=": " data-source="http://ibirzha.kz/zagsy-stanut-rabotat-tolko-v-budnie-dni/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wedding Palace" class="if uuid-2544253" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2544253.jpg"></div><p>  In the Kirov Park you can see the Tornado fountain, while it is the only light-musical water structure in the whole republic.  The performance itself begins at dusk. </p><p>  The new mosque, built in 2005, crowned with a glass dome, looks magnificent.  Almost all rooms have French carpets.  And on the arch, at the entrance, the ornament is inlaid with silver and gold plating. </p>
