  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cash desk audit</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The audit of the cash desk includes checking the procedure for the proper conduct of all cash transactions, in general, the movement of financial flows and cash transactions with them, in particular. </p><p>  The audit of the cash desk is carried out by a qualified auditor in the direct presence of the person maintaining all the cash documentation.  Also, during the audit there is a chief accountant or his immediate deputy.  During the verification procedure, all cash transactions are suspended or completely terminated. </p><p>  According to the officially developed document "Regulation on the Audit Commission" it is necessary: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ compile a report on all cash transactions for the day on which the audit is conducted.  The report is compiled personally by the materially responsible person conducting all cash transactions; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ withdraw cash, according to the balance of the cash book on the day of the audit; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ write a receipt that all <span>cash documents</span> on income and expenses are fully included in the report.  There are no funds not paid at the cash desk and debited to the expense; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ check the existence of officially concluded written agreements on liability for <span>tangible assets</span> with persons directly conducting cash documents, with persons managing the issuance and accrual of wages, bonuses and allowances; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ make a full recalculation of all financial resources in cash; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ compare the actual availability of finances with the balances directly reflected in the cash book and the final <span>report of the cashier.</span> </p><p>  In the event that an excess or shortage of funds is revealed during the audit at the cash desk in the rights of the auditor, conduct a more thorough audit and establish the true reason for their occurrence.  If surpluses are found at the cash desk, a <span>receipt warrant</span> is drawn up for them <span>,</span> which is mandatory to be entered in the cash book, and the surpluses themselves go to the budget.  If a shortage of funds is detected during the audit, urgent measures are taken to recover and punish. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The rights of the auditor include drawing up an act based on the results of the audit in several copies.  One of them is presented to the direct head of the company or his chief accountant. </p><p>  Cash desk audit is carried out without fail in case of: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ suspicions of theft from the cash desk, </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ illegal use of entrusted material assets, </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ identified violations in paperwork (not according to the standard). </p><p>  If the cash desk audit is carried out according to the deadlines established by the management, then <span>this is a</span> planned <span>audit</span> .  And if there is a change of cashiers, the dismissal and hiring of a new employee, financially responsible person, then they conduct a sudden audit of the cashier and related documents. </p><p>  If at the enterprise <span>the cash book</span> is <span>maintained</span> automatically, then during the audit the correct operation of the installed software is checked.  The results of such checks are reflected in the inventories, the form of which is approved by the State Statistics Committee of Russia.  This is INV-15 and INV-16 from the decree of 08/18/1998, numbered 88. </p><p>  For the direct audit of the cash desk not by the auditor, but by the employees of the company itself, a special commission is appointed by order of the head.  Based on the results of the cash desk audit, <span>an act is drawn up,</span> in which all identified violations, surpluses and shortages are introduced, their monetary equivalent and detailed circumstances of the violations are indicated.  The compiled and completed audit certificate of the cash desk is signed by the chairman of the commission, the remaining members of the commission and, directly, the financially responsible person. </p><p>  It is impossible to conduct an audit with an incomplete composition of the inspection commission.  Blots and erasures should not be allowed in the final documents.  If corrections are necessary, they are jointly negotiated and certified by personal signatures of all members of the inspection commission. </p>
