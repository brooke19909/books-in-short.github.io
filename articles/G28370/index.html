    <p>  At the front of the unit is a button with which you can adjust the <span>white balance</span> in accordance with the reference mode.  To the right of the lens is its unlock button.  Directly above it is a slot for synchronizing the connected flash (it is worth noting that the device has no built-in).  The screen of the device is movable, it can be moved up and down. </p><h2>  Features of camera control </h2><p>  There are a number of nuances that characterize the management of the device.  First of all, it is worth noting that the buttons that are used to activate certain functions of the device are programmed.  And if, for example, a person is used to their specific location when using a different brand of camera, their location on the Olympus OM-D E-M1 can be reproduced. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main controls of the device are 2 wheels.  It is supposed to use them with the thumb, as well as the index.  It can be noted that in the upper part of the device there is a special button with which you can lock the mode dial. </p><p>  There are a number of features for using lenses on the Olympus OM D EM1.  The fact is that the camera in question is, in principle, compatible with the corresponding optical elements in the Four Thirds format.  However, to use them in practice, you will need a special adapter.  Note that when using lenses of the appropriate type, you cannot activate contrast autofocus - only phase detection. </p><h2>  Picture quality </h2><p>  The Olympus OM-D E-M1 camera (professional reviews confirm this) in terms of the quality of the photos being created is more than competitive in comparison with multimedia content obtained by using similar solutions.  Despite the relatively low matrix area, if you compare it with what is available on devices such as, for example, <span>Fujifilm X-T1, the</span> pictures are excellent.  At least, if we talk about shooting within the ISO 6400 level. If it is higher, the quality of pictures may have some drawbacks. </p><p>  The optimal ISO mode, which achieves the best detail of images created with the Olympus OM-D E-M1 camera, is from 1600 to 3200. In the appropriate range, the device provides photo quality comparable to that achieved with more technologically advanced devices exceeding the apparatus in question, in particular, by the size of the sensor.  It can be noted that in practice, even professional photographers rarely use ISO modes higher than the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat we cited. </p><p>  The autofocus function on the device works fine, the color rendering is at the level, the noise indicators in the picture are also within the normal range.  Some features have shooting when the frame is enlarged - in this case, the subject may briefly fall out of autofocus.  If the ambient light level is high, then a new focus is induced in less than a second, if low - in about 2. Better focusing can be done using the touch screen.  On it, you can use your finger to indicate to the device which object you want to focus on. </p><h2>  Stabilizer </h2><p>  Considering the possibilities that the Olympus OM-D E-M1 camera provides to the user, the technical characteristics of the device, it is worth paying special attention to the operation of the stabilizer that is installed on it.  The corresponding Olympus camera hardware component has 5 axes.  It is capable of damping the vibrations generated by the matrix along 3 axes at once, and also stabilizing its rotation in 2 planes. </p>

    <p>  It is noteworthy that these characteristics sound spectacularly not only theoretically, but also during the practical operation of the device.  The total stabilization effect when using the camera in question is 4-5 steps EV. </p><h2>  Lens specifications </h2><p>  It will be useful to consider the features of the camera lenses.  They can be presented in a variety of modifications. </p><p>  Among the most popular are optical elements under the Zuiko brand.  Many photographers are impressed by the product M.Zuiko Digital 45 mm f / 1.8.  It refers to lenses with a constant focus of 45 mm.  What does this Olympus OM-D E-M1 optical element look like?  Examples (photo) of the lens are below. </p>

    <p>  In addition, experts note that the lens is characterized by a decent resolution in fast areas - in the interval between f / 1.8 and f / 16.0, its level does not fall below 0.6 lines in a pixel.  Resolution in the central part of the frame is higher than at the edges, but not by much.  If we talk about the interval between f / 3.5 and f / 11.0, then the corresponding indicator even increases to 0.75 lines per pixel.  As for the work within the aperture equal to f / 22.0, the resolution, of course, decreases - to 0.45.  But in general, taking into account the reasonable price for the lens, the totality of the noted characteristics makes the optical element in question more than competitive. </p><p>  Another popular Zuiko lens for the Olympus OM-D E-M1 is the 12-40 f / 2.8.  It is able to work within the focal range from 24 to 80 mm.  It is characterized by a high level of aperture and outstanding sharpness.  This model is sufficiently universal: thanks to the short focusing distance, you can shoot very small objects with the help of a lens.  The level of aperture installed on the Olympus OM-D E-M1 12-40 f / 2.8 allows the photographer to take high-quality pictures at a low ISO - in the evening, at dusk, and also use the camera for portrait shooting.  One of the insignificant, according to experts, shortcomings of the lens in question can be considered its susceptibility to glare in some modes - in particular, if the light is directed from behind the object directly to the camera.  But in general, the corresponding optical element is one of the most technologically advanced in the segment.  It is successfully involved in their work by professionals. </p><p>  Another popular lens of this camera is M.Zuiko 12-50 mm f / 3.5-6.3 ED EZ.  It has an unstable focus in the range of 12-50 mm.  Its resolution indicators are reasonably competitive.  If we consider a short focus, the resolution at the edges of the frame is slightly lower than in the center, and in the interval f / 3.5 - f / 16 is of the order of 0.5 lines in a pixel and higher.  In turn, in the central part of the image, the corresponding indicator is 0.6 and higher.  If you take the average focus - the resolution in the interval between f / 5.2 and f / 13 is 0.6 lines and above.  In the corresponding range, the difference in resolution in the center and at the edges of the frame remains, but in the interval between f / 13 and f / 22 they are aligned.  This lens is also among the optimal in terms of technological capabilities and price. </p><p>  Thus, the device is compatible with different lenses that differ in technology and cost.  Therefore, the photographer has the opportunity to choose the appropriate optical components for himself, based on his own needs and budget, which he has. </p><h2>  Work speed </h2><p>  Now, having studied the features of the camera lenses, we continue our description of the Olympus OM-D E-M1 and consider its features.  Among the most important characteristics of a device for a modern photographer is the speed of its work (in terms of autofocus response, as well as automatic shooting).  Experts and many users believe that the device in question has outstanding performance in both functions.  Photographers are especially impressed by the fact that after receiving frames in the required mode, you can almost immediately start viewing them.  This is very important in cases where for a short period of time, for example, in the process of reporting for a news publication, you need to shoot a large number of different types of frames and make sure that each of them is of the highest quality. </p><p>  True, the efficiency of the device‚Äôs autofocus largely depends on the level of illumination of the shooting location.  If it is insufficient, the speed and quality of the corresponding function of the camera are reduced.  But this pattern is characteristic not only for the device in question.  Comparison of Olympus OM-D E-M1 with analogs shows that even more technologically advanced solutions do not always allow for sufficient autofocus speed in low light conditions. </p><h2>  Video recording </h2><p>  The next aspect of using the camera, which is useful to consider, is video recording.  As we noted above, listing the characteristics of the Olympus OM-D E-M1, the device can record videos at a speed of 30 frames per second.  This is not the most outstanding indicator.  However, there are not many competing solutions on the market that could provide higher video recording speeds at the same resolution. </p><p>  Another nuance of using the device in the video recording mode is the lack of exposure settings during the shooting process.  However, those that are detected automatically provide very decent quality videos. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of the apparatus </h2><p>  Any electronic device, especially as technologically sophisticated as a professional camera, has <span>advantages and disadvantages.</span>  Consider them too - those that are determined by experts and users for the device in question. </p><p>  The device has more advantages than disadvantages.  The device has a great design, a comfortable arrangement of controls on an ergonomic body.  At the same time, the dimensions of the camera, its weight, and also the lens are not the largest. </p>

    <p>  The device provides excellent picture quality provided that it will be operated in ISO modes from 1600 to 3200. But, as we noted above, in practice the need to use ISO at higher values ‚Äã‚Äãdoes not appear so often. </p><p>  The device pleases specialists and users with a high speed of operation - this can be seen both in terms of the burst shooting function and in terms of autofocus.  Again - subject to sufficient lighting. </p><p>  The advantage of the camera can be called high-tech, providing excellent quality color reproduction of the touch screen, as well as the presence of a viewfinder. </p><p>  The device is equipped with a highly effective stabilizer.  In addition, the advantage of the device can be called compatibility with a wide range of lenses - both with those that belong to economical models and with premium optical devices. </p><p>  Among the disadvantages of the device is a relatively low resolution, not the most outstanding indicators of the recording speed of frames in video.  Also, some experts note that the camera during operation is a little more noisy than some competing solutions.  Thus, the advantages of the device are incommensurably greater than the disadvantages, which by and large can be considered very conditional. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  This is our, albeit perhaps not the most complete review of the Olympus OM-D E-M1 camera, but reflecting the key features of the device, its strengths and weaknesses.  What conclusions can we draw by considering the capabilities of the device? </p><p>  The description of the Olympus OM-D E-M1 Kit camera, given in the official catalogs and on popular portals, gives reason to make assumptions about the highest performance of the device, its availability of a wide range of functions, and the ability to receive excellent multimedia content when used.  But all these assumptions are theoretical.  How are things with the practice of using the device? </p><p>  Based on the opinions of experts, we can conclude that, in key aspects, the claimed characteristics of the device have a real correspondence to its effectiveness.  For example, in terms of image stabilization, automatic shooting speed. </p>

    <p>  We examined the main Olympus OM-D E-M1 lenses, the characteristics from the photo data of the optical components, and came to the conclusion that the user has at their disposal several models at once, among which you can find the ones that optimally combine functionality and price. </p><p>  Thus, the camera under consideration from the Olympus brand is a modern, stylish, high-tech device capable of working with lenses of different types and price ranges. </p>
