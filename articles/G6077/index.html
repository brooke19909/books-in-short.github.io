  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Principality of Nizhny Novgorod: Foundation History, Political and Economic Relations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Nizhny Novgorod principality was formed as a result of complex relations between the Russian principalities and the Horde khans, which unceremoniously interfered in the affairs of the princes.  It did not exist for long, a little more than 50 years, and left a bright mark in the history of not only the Middle Volga region, but also the entire state, becoming one of the main participants in historical events to overthrow the long-standing Tatar-Mongol yoke. </p><h2>  Events of the beginning of the XIV century </h2><p>  Two great principalities, Moscow and Tver, began the struggle for primacy in the Russian lands.  Prince of Moscow Ivan Kalita, during his reign, achieved an advantage over Tver.  In 1327, the Tver and Vladimir prince Alexander Mikhailovich rebelled against the Horde ambassador, and to subdue the rebellion, Khan Uzbek sent the combined Tatar and Russian troops, led by Ivan Kalita and Prince Suzdal Alexander Vasilievich.  The Tver prince had to flee, leaving the princely throne. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.e-reading.mobi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Battle of the princes" class="if uuid-3124875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3124875.jpg"></div><p>  The Uzbek, who decided to reward the princes obedient to him, divided the liberated lands between them.  Ivan Kalita received Veliky Novgorod and Kostroma, and Alexander Suzdalsky received Vladimir, Nizhny Novgorod and Gorodets.  After the imminent death of Prince Alexander, his lands also passed into the power of Kalita.  So Nizhny Novgorod began to be ruled by the Prince of Moscow and Vladimir, in which his sons helped him.  The eldest son of Kalita, Simeon the Proud, sat in the Lower and ruled there until the death of his father in 1340. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Here again the question arose about the fate of the lands given by Kalita Khan.  Russian princes rushed to the Horde to resolve the issue, as both of them had equal rights to possess the Nizhny Novgorod throne.  Khan Uzbek handed over to Vladimir Simeon the Proud, making him the eldest of the princes.  But the plans of the cunning khan did not include excessive strengthening of Moscow power, so he immediately took Nizhny Novgorod and Gorodets from Simeon, transferring them to the ownership of Prince Suzdal Konstantin Vasilyevich.  He achieved his goal by settling for a long time the discord between the Moscow and Suzdal princes.  It was in 1341. </p><h2>  Education and prosperity of the Suzdal-Nizhny Novgorod principality </h2><p>  The specified year is considered the year of formation of the new principality in the Volga region.  Simeon the Proud could not abandon thoughts of returning such a rich city to his power.  He repeatedly made this request to the Golden Horde, but to no avail.  Prince Constantine, fearing that the city would be taken away from him by force, left Suzdal and moved to Nizhny Novgorod. </p><div class="photo" data-original="poselok1928.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Principality of Nizhny Novgorod" class="if uuid-3124850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3124850.jpg"></div><p>  The city, located at the confluence of the Volga and Oka, developed rapidly.  Various crops were grown on the surrounding lands.  Rye was the main cereal plant well born in these parts.  Oats, wheat, and buckwheat were also widely sown.  Industrial crops were also grown: hemp and flax.  In the Nizhny Novgorod principality, fishing and hunting were of great importance.  Local residents were also engaged in storing and salting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Centers of crafts were such large cities as Nizhny and Gorodets.  They were engaged in metal and woodworking, jewelry, weaving, ceramics and bone carving.  On the territory of the principality, in addition to their own money, there were coins of other principalities and states, which testifies to the wide geography of trading activity. </p><p>  Over the fifteen years of the reign, Konstantin Vasilyevich significantly expanded his possessions, conquering the neighboring pagan tribes and adding their land possessions to his principality. </p><h2>  Nizhny Novgorod - the capital of the great Nizhny Novgorod principality </h2><p>  The city in these years developed rapidly and comprehensively.  This was primarily due to its geographical location.  Trade along the Volga gave great opportunities for development, not only Russian merchants came to visit, but also representatives of other states: Egypt, India, Persia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.service4guests.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin" class="if uuid-3124839" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3124839.jpg"></div><p>  Cultural development was accompanied by an upsurge in painting, literature and architecture.  It was in the middle of the XIV century that the Lavrentievsky Chronicle was written here.  High literacy of a certain layer of the population allowed foreign cultures to penetrate Russian soil. </p><h2>  Grand Nizhny Novgorod Prince Konstantin Vasilyevich </h2><p>  Prince Konstantin, who occupied the throne for 15 years, did a lot for the flourishing of the Volga lands.  He took another step to strengthen his power: to move away from the Moscow regiments, the princely throne was transferred to the inaccessible Dyatlovy Gory. </p><p>  This happened in 1350.  And after this event, several profitable marriages of the children of Konstantin with the sons and daughters of powerful and strong princes were concluded.  Thus, the international ties of the great Nizhny Novgorod-Suzdal principality were strengthened. </p><h2>  Reign of Prince Andrew </h2><p>  In 1355, Prince Constantine died, power passed into the hands of his eldest son Andrei.  Five years after the accession to the throne, he was offered by Khan Naurus a label on the reign of Vladimir, which the Grand Duke refused, so as not to incite hostility with the direct heir to the throne.  He was not afraid of the Khan‚Äôs troops, sent to pacify the naughty. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.e-reading.mobi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prince's court" class="if uuid-3124873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3124873.jpg"></div><p>  During the years of his reign, the development of the region reached its maximum.  But the calamities in the form of drought and famine, diseases and numerous deaths among the population undermined the strength of Andrei Konstantinovich, and in 1365 he died, leaving no direct heirs. </p><h2>  Brothers Boris and Dmitry </h2><p>  The subsequent history of the Principality of Nizhny Novgorod is characterized by a fierce struggle for the vacated throne by princes Dmitry and Boris.  The brothers did not succumb to the entreaties of intermediaries, including Dmitry Ivanovich Donskoy and Rev. Father Sergius.  Then Moscow regiments stood up for Prince Dmitry, and Boris retreated from Nizhny Novgorod. </p><p>  Later, both brothers fought more than once with the enemies side by side, defending the independence of Novgorod land.  After the death of Dmitry in 1383, Boris did not immediately manage to sit on the Nizhny Novgorod throne, for there were many who wanted to.  But in 1390, he finally received the long-awaited label from the Khan.  But he owned Nizhny Novgorod for only two years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="olgashemyakina.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Horde" class="if uuid-3124859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3124859.jpg"></div><p>  The time of the reign of the brothers is the time of the struggle against the Tatar-Mongol yoke.  It was headed by Vasily Dmitrievich, the Prince of Moscow.  The princes of Novgorod held different positions, now participating in the liberation struggle, now supporting the Golden Horde. </p><h2>  The decline and accession of the Principality of Nizhny Novgorod </h2><p>  The subsequent weakening of the principality was facilitated by objective and subjective reasons.  The first include the drought, famine, pestilence, fires that happened under Constantine.  But the long struggle for the throne between the brothers Boris and Dmitry - the subjective reason - economically exhausted the whole region.  At the same time, the Principality of Moscow is gaining strength and power, which unites small destinies around itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Land collector" class="if uuid-3124862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3124862.jpg"></div><p>  The raids of the Tatars and nomads on the weakening principality became more frequent, the city was ravaged, the inhabitants were killed.  Trading people began to move to Moscow, under the protection of a strong prince.  Following the economic decline, a political one came.  It became apparent that the principality was unable to defend itself on its own. </p><p>  In 1392, Moscow Prince Vasily Dmitrievich received from the Khan a label for several destinies, including Nizhny Novgorod.  So the unification of the Principality of Nizhny Novgorod with the Moscow lands took place, which was an important step in collecting inheritance into a single state. </p>
