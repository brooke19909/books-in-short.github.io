China, saturated with legends, fascinates with its secrets, and its unusually picturesque landscapes captivate at first sight. </p><p>  It becomes clear why the famous director <span>D. Cameron</span> filmed his film bestseller Avatar about a magical land here.  Admired by the fabulous scenery of Hunan Province (China), he borrowed panoramic scenes from here. </p><h2>  Natural wonders of China </h2><p>  The unusual place, whose age is about three millennia, is most often visited by the Chinese themselves, however, Russians who have heard about natural wonders set off on a long journey to see the sights with their own eyes. </p><p>  Now many agencies offer sightseeing <span>tours to China,</span> which will allow you to immerse yourself in Asian exoticism and at the same time have a great rest.  Spending a vacation in the Middle Kingdom is a good opportunity to replenish the treasury of your knowledge in the field of history and culture of a mysterious country.  And her natural treasures will delight even the most demanding tourist. </p><h2>  Discover the unique mountain </h2><p>  Acquaintance with the province begins with a mountain rising almost eight kilometers above sea level, which was called the "Gate of Heaven".  China, famous for its miraculous natural masterpieces, provides the opportunity to make the most <span>unusual journey</span> of your life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sightseeing tours to china" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1392165.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To get to the mountain, which will present many surprises for its guests, tourists overcome the difficult, but insanely exciting way.  According to the Chinese themselves, Tianmen Mountain itself and the road to it are equivalent attractions.  There are stories that during the reign of <span>the Ming Dynasty, the</span> instigators of the peasant uprising hid innumerable riches in the rock, and treasure seekers have come here for several centuries to try their luck, which so far has not smiled at anyone. </p><h2>  Which route to choose? </h2><p>  You can get to the top in several ways.  The choice depends on the physical stamina of the guests of China and their love of extreme sports.  Those who want to test themselves walk up a long staircase with 999 steps.  The guides assure that whoever finds himself at the top, having overcome this difficult test, will find eternal joy. </p><p>  Those who like to tickle their nerves go on an excursion by car, and this winding road, only eleven kilometers long, will be remembered by everyone.  On the "heavenly highway" 99 turns, and the distance between them can be less than 200 meters.  A ride on an impressive mountain serpentine with sharp turns will make your heart go on heels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tianmen mountain" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1392171.jpg" width="600"></div>

The cable car offers incredible views of the beautiful mountains, and it seems that the peaks are within reach.  In some places, the road rises sharply, and at these moments, when the cabin is lost in the clouds, the soul freezes with fear and delight.  However, whatever path you choose, it will be a real fascinating journey. </p><h2>  Glass gallery over the abyss </h2><p>  On the top of Tianmen Mountain, tourists are waiting for unusual walking paths: anyone will be breathtaking from the sight of the abyss in the transparent floor.  The 60-meter-high glass path is safe, but tourists admit that the feeling of emptiness underfoot causes a glow of emotions.  Nevertheless, visitors who are afraid of great heights prefer not to refuse to walk along the so-called "heavenly path". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="heaven gate china" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1392167.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mystic </h2><p>  Local residents firmly believe that Tianmen (Yunnan-Guizhou Highlands) has supernatural powers.  This fact was confirmed by phenomena unexplained from a scientific point of view, when water flows completely unexpectedly fell several times from a height and disappeared without a trace after 15 minutes.  Each time, such a phenomenon warned of troubles awaiting the country in the near future. </p><p>  Therefore, from ancient times it is believed that the mountain, on which there is a through hole in the rock shrouded in clouds, is called “Heaven's Gate”, which is most closely connected with the sky.  China prides itself on being the world's highest natural karst cave. </p><h2>  About the value of a unique arch </h2><p>  The state’s historical documents record the fact that in 263, after a soil erosion, a huge piece of the mountain collapsed and a gigantic cavity with a height of 131 meters appeared.  Majestically looking “Heaven's Gate” (China) evokes thoughts that passing through them, you can get into the other world, and it is not for nothing that the arch is considered an unofficial border between the earthly and the divine.  Chinese people rush here daily, dreaming of spiritual enlightenment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yunnan Guizhou Highlands" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1392174.jpg" width="600"></div>
