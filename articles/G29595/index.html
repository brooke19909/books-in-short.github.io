However, today there are those who are only trying to learn how to weave a bracelet of rubber bands on the machine.  The workshop below will be useful to them. </p><h2>  Preparation for weaving a fishtail bracelet </h2><p>  ‚ÄúFishtail‚Äù is the most suitable way to create a gum jewelry for those who first wondered how to <span>weave a gum bracelet</span> on a machine.  For beginners, a slingshot is also suitable.  However, if you do not intend to dwell on the simplest technique for creating jewelry from Rainbow loom, then you should immediately purchase a special machine.  You will also need the required number of colored <span>rubber bands, a hook</span> and a plastic clasp.  The machine should be located so that the recesses looked at the needlewoman, and the columns of two adjacent rows were at the same level. </p>

    <h2>  Fishtail weave </h2><p>  The gum must be crossed by the figure of eight and put on two adjacent extreme pins with different loops, and on top throw two more gum, but not crossed.  Next, the lower Rainbow loom on the right peg should be hooked and removed through the two upper elements, and then do the same with the loop on the left column.  After this, it is necessary to put on another peg on two pegs and remove the element that is at the very bottom.  This weaving should be continued until the required length of the bracelet is reached.  It should be noted that the ‚Äúfish tail‚Äù looks more original if Rainbow loom of different colors is used for its manufacture.  At the final stage, 4 loops of one end and 2 of the other should be secured with a plastic fastener.  Now you know how to weave a bracelet made of elastic bands on a fishtail machine, and you can even teach your friends this skill. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Rubber bracelet: weaving stars </h2><p>  Now you can proceed to the creation of stars, each of which is better to make different colors.  To do this, gum should be thrown onto the second middle row and the far right rods.  Then, clockwise, you need to continue to throw Rainbow loom, connecting the center of the sprocket with the columns located around.  When all 6 gum will be in place, you need to move on to creating the next star, the center of which will be the 4th column of the middle row.  Weaving should be continued until all pins are used.  For a better understanding of how to weave a bracelet of rubber bands on the machine, look carefully at the photo below. </p>

    <p>  For the convenience of work and the original appearance of the finished jewelry, it is better to use elastic bands of different colors to create each star.  It is worth noting that the last extreme rods will remain unused.  Next, on each column of the middle row, which acts as the center of the sprocket, you should throw an elastic band folded in eight by half. </p><h2>  Removing the loops and completing the weaving of the star bracelet </h2><p>  The machine must be turned in such a way that the recesses of the pins look to the right, and do the following: using a hook, remove the lower loop from the last core of the middle row and throw it on the forward column.  Continue weaving according to a similar pattern until all the loops of the middle row are thrown to adjacent columns.  Further, the middle elastic bands of each ray of the sprocket are alternately transferred to the pins that they connect. </p><p>  When all the internal elements of the bracelet are ready, all that remains is to weave the edging, for which the rubber bands were thrown at the beginning of the work.  So, it is necessary to throw each lower loop of one column onto the leading pin in front.  You should start work with a protruding middle row pin and move to the bottom, and then weave the top from the same point.  If it is difficult for you to understand how to weave a bracelet of rubber bands on the machine, the photo below will help in this. </p>

    <p>  At the final stage, with the help of the hook, you must thread the elastic band through all the protruding loops, and, having fixed both ends of the elastic on the hook, carefully remove the finished bracelet from the machine.  After that, the product must be straightened.  Attach a fastener to its extreme loops. </p>
