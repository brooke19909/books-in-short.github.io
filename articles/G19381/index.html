It is enough to be hardworking, purposeful and at least a little favorite of Fortune.  The legendary founder of Apple was able to achieve not just success, but truly turn the world in the direction he wanted. </p><p>  <strong>How it all began</strong> </p><p>  It all started not as optimistic as many people think.  The illegitimate son of a student and a young Syrian teacher, born on February 24, 1955, was not needed by his parents.  The boy was adopted by a poor couple from the outskirts of San Francisco - a place that later became known as Silicon Valley. </p><p>  This was one of the important circumstances that stretched in a chain through the life path of Stephen Paul Jobs and eventually led to the very top. </p>

    <p>  The second coincidence was the acquaintance (in 1969) with Steve Wozniak, a colleague in the hippie movement, whose five-year <span>age difference</span> did not interfere with their friendship.  If the future founder of Apple during his years at school could well be considered a bored loafer, then Wozniak was truly a child prodigy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Stevens united the love of electronics, which resulted in a common business.  Wozniak created, no less, the first personal computer, Jobs found buyers and regularly threw ideas for improvement. </p><p>  The name of the company is ‚ÄúApple‚Äù and its symbol, which was invented by the 21-year-old Steve Jobs - this is not just a tribute to the love of fruit, but a reminder of how the <span>law of universal gravitation</span> was discovered <span>.</span>  Apple founder explains the appearance of a bitten bite on the logo <strong> </strong>  very prosaic: "In order not to be confused with a tomato." </p><p>  Over the next four years, the Apple-2 PC model stormed America by storm, Apple became the industry leader, and its young founders became millionaires.  Soon, Wozniak, however, retired, and Jobs, by contrast, raised the bar of his ambitions to enormous heights. <strong></strong></p>

    <p>  <strong>What happened next</strong> </p><p>  And then there was the creation of the most advanced Macintosh computer, the release of which began in January 1984.  A very convenient and very expensive Macintosh was equipped with such a revolutionary novelty as a computer mouse. </p><p>  Macintosh was the main triumph that the founder of Apple survived, and the cause of the deep crisis, which eventually overtook the company and Jobs himself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Everything happened catastrophically quickly.  Worked for some time at Apple and an unknown programmer, Bill Gates introduced the world to the Windows operating system, which was based on Macintosh technology.  Sales of the latter not only fell, but collapsed.  <span>Steve Jobs</span> was fired from the company. </p><p>  After several months of deep depression, he created Next, and a year later acquired Pixar.  Soon the famous and truly revolutionary cartoon ‚ÄúToy Story‚Äù was born, which marked the beginning of a new era in the history of animation. </p><p>  Apple founder Steve Jobs continued to improve the world. </p><p>  <strong>The rebirth of Apple</strong> </p><p>  In 1997, Steve Jobs returned to Apple at a time when the company was on the verge of disaster.  Jobs's goal was not just a revival of lost ground, but a real triumph. </p><p>  To achieve this, he stopped litigation with Gates and signed a contract with him for the provision of software, as well as a solid financial injection.  As a result of this transaction, iMac appeared - a computer consisting of a single monitor, incomparably more democratic and vibrant than all its predecessors. </p><p>  And the next innovative step of Apple (in 2001) was the iPod - the original portable device for listening to music.  His appearance finally approved the company in a leading position.  But the real explosion occurred in 2007, when the world saw the <span>first iPhone.</span>  Three years later, Steve Jobs presented another of his brilliant creations - iPad. </p>

    <p>  He tried to catch everything and a little more.  The surrounding people were struck by energy and some kind of childish, feverish delight with which Jobs published his offspring one after another.  He was driven by a serious illness, a battle with which six years long, Steve Jobs still lost.  He died in October 2011. </p><p>  Probably, there is no person in the modern civilized world who would not know about the unique technologies released under the emblem of the ‚Äúbitten apple‚Äù.  And absolutely everyone knows who is the founder of Apple.  For Steven Jobs still managed to truly surprise the whole world! </p>
