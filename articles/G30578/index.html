Only 1,530 residents live here, but the influx of tourists on the weekend, especially during the competition, is simply huge.  Places in local hotels, of course, are not enough.  Sports enthusiasts stop in the towns adjacent to the town. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gotravelaz.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://gotravelaz.com/oberhof/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oberhof Germany. Location" class="if uuid-2252034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2252034.jpg"></div><h2>  What you can see in the vicinity of the city </h2><ul><li>  The main attraction in Oberhof (Germany), of course, is the amazing nature, which resembles a fairy tale.

You can come here by bus or by rail.  But there is no airport.  To get to the city from Russia, you must first come (fly) to one of the cities of Germany, the city of Erfurt is closest to Oberhof.  The distance to it is 40 km.  Hof Airport is 112 kilometers away, Kassel lies 147 kilometers away, where there is also an airport. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Airplanes from Russia fly to the cities of Leipzig and Nuremberg located near Oberhof.  In extreme cases, you can fly to Berlin, Dresden or Frankfurt.  From the airport of any city, you can continue by bus or train.  For example, buses run from Erfurt from the central station to Oberhof. </p><div class="photo" data-original="supercoolpics.com" data-author=": Jens Meyer, " data-source="http://supercoolpics.com/23-ie-mezhdunarodnye-gonki-na-sobachih-up/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oberhof Germany 2" class="if uuid-2252205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2252205.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of a trip by rail </h2><p>  Given that Germany is a small country, all trains here are without berths.  They are divided into three classes: </p><ul><li>  ICE - high-speed trains.  Usually they ply between large cities, with a considerable distance. </li><li>  RE - regional trains that do not go to remote cities, something like our trains. </li><li>  STB - local small trains, often consisting of one or two wagons.  They are more like small trams. </li></ul><p>  Tickets can be bought online or at ticket offices at train stations.  There is a significant price difference.  Given that train tickets are very expensive, it is best to purchase them online in advance, in this case there are big discounts.  Getting from the remote cities of Germany to Oberhof, you will have to make transfers and ride on trains of all classes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gettyimages.com" data-author=": ullstein bild, " data-source="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/oberhof-castle-on-lake-thun-in-switzerland-um-1964-news-photo/549343055#oberhof-castle-on-lake-thun-in-switzerland-um-1964-picture-id549343055"><img itemprop="image" alt="oberhof germany location 1" class="if uuid-2252044" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2252044.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  If you decide to visit Oberhof, then you need to remember that this is a small city, and there are a lot of tourists, especially during the competition, so you should not rely on luck, but you need to take care of the trip in advance and book accommodation.  The Germans book accommodation for the year.  Prices in hotels, of course, are not cheap.  If it was not possible to find accommodation, then you should look for a place to sleep in the neighboring cities of Thuringia, getting to Oberhof by train. </p><p>  Trips can fly a pretty penny.  Therefore, it is necessary to consider as an option the purchase of a regional Thuringian ticket, which is valid throughout the day.  The cost of a trip for one person is 20 euros, the cost of a ticket for a company of 5 people will be 28 euros.  It is beneficial when the settlement where you are staying is far removed.  If you live near Oberhof, it will be more profitable to buy a one-time ticket. </p><p>  To use a Thuringian ticket, you need to look at the Internet for train schedules and transfer stations.  You can use the machine at the station.  Enter the starting and ending points, and it will give an accurate description of the route with all the transfers. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  You can‚Äôt count on cheap food in the midst of the winter season.  In cafes and restaurants, prices for Russian tourists are rather high.  But you can find a cafe with an acceptable cost of lunch, since they are here at almost every step.  There is a supermarket in Oberhof, it is located in the city center. </p><p>  A trip to Oberhof will be interesting.  There is something to see here.  The forests of Thuringia, despite the fact that more than seven thousand kilometers of mountain hiking trails have been laid along them, have preserved many protected places. </p>
