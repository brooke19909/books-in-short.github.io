    <p>  As a rule, the village is considered as a single resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKemer.  However, couples and those who prefer a more relaxing vacation will enjoy Beldibi more.  Young people usually prefer the bustling Kemer with its many discos and clubs.  In addition, Beldibi is interesting for lovers of active tourism and mountaineering, as well as rafting.  On the slopes of the Taurus Mountains, you can make an amazing photo shoot. </p><p>  The heyday of a small village began not so long ago, in the 1980s, and, moreover, completely unexpectedly.  Local residents involved in the cultivation of citrus fruits and sheep breeding could not even think that Beldibi would quickly turn into a popular resort in a matter of years.  The Germans were the first to notice a wonderful place.  They built the first hotels here.  Now the resort has more than 60 tourist complexes, among which there are institutions of various levels. </p><p>  The main attraction of the village is its stunningly beautiful nature.  The village is adjacent to the Taurus Mountains and the alluring Mediterranean Sea.  Such a unique location makes the resort's climate special.  Beldibi is characterized by hot summers and warm, but wet winters.  The holiday season lasts from May to mid-October. </p><p>  Arriving in Turkey, all tourists flock to the sea coast, because it is for the sake of a beach holiday that they come here.  Local beaches, of course, cannot be called ideal, but they compensate for the shortcomings with picturesque views.  The coast of Beldibi is characterized by rocky sunsets and pebble beaches.  In some places, sand is also found.  In order to avoid injuries due to pebbles, holidaymakers buy special swimming shoes.  The most fashionable hotels sand their own beaches, so when you buy a tour, take a look at the coast if this issue is important for you. </p>

    <p>  The number of rooms of the hotel is the moment that causes a lot of complaints from the side of the spa.  The apartments are far from new, and therefore need updating, as well as replacing shabby furniture.  Although the rooms are not without cosiness and charm.  Many tourists in reviews complain about the quality of cleaning or its absence, while others, on the contrary, remain satisfied with it.  From which we can conclude that not all maids are responsible for their duties. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews on the Catamaran Resort Hotel 5 * (Beldibi), the hotel does not have some standard services specific to a five-star establishment.  So, for example, the bar in the rooms is replenished only once, only during check-in.  Further maids do not bring drinks.  In addition, the bathrooms lack bathrobes, slippers and detergents.  The rest of the rooms are quite comfortable, especially stunning landscapes from the windows: on the sea coast and magnificent mountains. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Food in Catamaran Resort Hotel 5 * (Kemer, Beldibi, Goynuk) is organized at a decent level.  The main restaurant is always a good choice of dishes, there are fish and meat.  Sometimes during the high season there are lines for food.  The staff of the establishment, although it works nimbly, does not cope with the influx of tourists, which is why the queues are observed.  According to tourists, the food is quite acceptable, so no one will remain hungry, but we are not talking about any delights.  Every day the cook prepares the same dishes. </p>

    <p>  The bars offer good local alcohol.  But there are simply no restaurants √† la carte, which are mentioned in the brochures of tour operators and on hotel websites.  Perhaps they were once, but at the moment they do not work.  Therefore, tourists can rely only on the main restaurant in the Catamaran Resort Hotel 5 * (Turkey, Kemer, Beldibi). </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel ... </h2><p>  In general, the hotel makes a very good impression, despite the pros and cons.  A picturesque place and beautiful territory are the main advantages of the institution.  The hotel is located near the coast, but the pebble beach is far from ideal.  Sunset at sea is covered with sharp pebbles, and then in the water there are larger stones.  However, tourists get out of the situation by purchasing special shoes.  But the sea pleases tourists with warm and clean water.  For convenience, a pontoon was built on the coast, where you can relax, as well as go down into the water, bypassing stones. </p><p>  The hotel has a wonderful friendly staff and good animators.  In the evenings, guests can enjoy the entertainment activities of the activity program.  In the daytime, tourists can attend water aerobics classes.  According to vacationers, the range of animation events could be expanded, since there are not so many entertainments. </p><p>  As for the children's club, it does not have a separate room.  Children are entertained in the open air playground.  In addition, the staff of the mini-club speaks only Turkish, which the children do not understand.  Although, most of the guests of the institution are representatives of the post-Soviet space.  It is simply impossible to meet Europeans here, as evidenced by reviews of the Catamaran Resort Hotel 5 * (Beldibi, Kemer). </p><p>  According to guests, the complex is suitable for relaxing unpretentious tourists.  But if you want to get a real five-star service and the corresponding rooms, then you should think about the choice so that you do not suffer disappointment during your vacation.  Beldibi can be a great place to relax if there is a desire to find solitude and find harmony in the lap of nature.  There are all conditions for this.  But for the noisy youth it is worth looking for a hotel in Kemer itself. </p>
