    <h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  If a person plans to stay at The Iberotel Miramar Al Aqah Beach Resort, then he will have a lot of options.  The hotel offers more than ten different types of apartments.  It is worth listing them all.  So, there are Al Dana suites - overlooking the pool, ocean or desert.  Family apartments are also available in the hotel - for 2-4 people, Promo category.  Connecting rooms (2 connected into one) for 4-6 guests are also offered.  There are also Al Bawadi suites with pool or ocean views.  Standard 2-bed apartments are also available.  Standard family rooms are also available.  You can choose apartments with pool, ocean or mountain views. </p><p>  There are standard rooms with special offers, and Al Qasr, Al Rawda and Al Dou suites.  All these apartments differ not only in name, but also in terms, area, prices.  And the most important thing in any trip is to stay in a comfortable room.  Well, it is worth paying more attention to this topic and telling about the conditions offered by the hotel, and about the opinion that people who have already visited here have developed about the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to save? </h2><p>  The question is interesting and relevant for many.  And it consists in one completely elementary feature.  Guests at The Iberotel Miramar Al Aqah Beach Resort are advised to book rooms with mountain or desert views.  Why?  It's simple: because they are cheaper than those from where the ocean is visible, by 15-20 thousand rubles.  Of course, this difference is unlikely to confuse people who went to the Emirates, but still it is worth bearing in mind.  The beach here is literally a couple of tens of meters, because the ocean surface can be seen every day, at least several times. </p>

    <h2>  Standard 2-bed rooms </h2><p>  This is the first category of the most popular at The Iberotel Miramar Al Aqah Beach Resort, which will be discussed.  The cost of such apartments for 2-3 people for 14 full nights is from 200 to 270 thousand rubles.  Why could there be such a difference?  Because often the hotel arranges promotions and days of super-offers.  And if you manage to get at this moment, you will be able to reserve apartments with a good discount.  But if you want breakfast to be included in the price, you will have to overpay.  Then the cost will be 280-350 thousand rubles. </p><p>  And what about the conditions?

    <h2>  Al Dana Suite </h2><p>  This is one of the most expensive booking options at Iberotel Miramar Al Aqah Beach Resort.  Reviews about him are relevant.  But first about the cost.  400-570 thousand rubles - that‚Äôs how much you will have to pay for 2 weeks of rest in such apartments with breakfast in the conditions.  In this case, 2-3 people can live in the room.  Additionally, you will have to pay 20% of the amount - city tax and service charge.  On top - another 114 thousand (if you take the maximum cost).  What conditions are offered for such astronomical sums? </p><p>  So, guests are provided with individual check-in and VIP-service throughout the stay.  Every day in the room staff will clean, change linen and replenish the fruit basket.  The apartments have free Wi-Fi.  And another nice bonus is a 10 percent discount on all services provided by the spa, romantic dinners, archery and water sports.  And, of course, free late check out. </p><p>  The room itself is the same as in the apartments of other categories, but there is also a seating area.  Tourists who were not here, or stayed a couple of days, are judged objectively - this is too high a price.  Many say that you can pay five times less and relax somewhere in Thailand or in Greece in a hotel complex with even better conditions.  However, it is worth remembering that these are the Emirates.  And those guests who visited the Iberotel Miramar Al Aqah Beach Resort and stayed for a longer period do not pay attention to prices, and claim that it was worth it. </p>

    <h2>  Most expensive number </h2><p>  I would also like to say a few words about him.  So, 14 nights for two in the Al Bawadi Suite, an area of ‚Äã‚Äã84 square meters, overlooking the ocean and with breakfast will cost ... 1 306 000 rubles!  This is already with taxes.  Thus, one night in such apartments for two will cost about 94 thousand rubles.  Interestingly, this cost is equal to the price of some last-minute trips for two to some attractive country.  But now this is not about that. </p><p>  Spacious room with an incredibly huge bed did not leave anyone indifferent who was relaxing here.  After all, this is a suite with a terrace, whose area is 27 square meters!  VIP service, various discounts, a huge hot tub, delicious breakfasts ... People who stayed here say that if you want to feel like a master of life, you should book this room.  Since if there is a desire and means to stay in some expensive and luxurious hotel, then, perhaps, in the UAE Iberotel Miramar Al Aqah Beach Resort will be the most elite. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Now a few words about the level of food in this 5-star hotel.  Well, the establishments of the hotel complex The Iberotel Miramar Al Aqah Beach Resort get decent reviews.  And this is not surprising.  The large, stylishly decorated restaurant welcomes guests with a pleasant atmosphere and a spacious terrace.  The menu is varied, which definitely will appeal to lovers to please themselves with delights.  The restaurant serves fresh and delicious dishes of national and European cuisine. </p><p>  Also, guests are strongly recommended to visit another institution.  Namely - an Italian restaurant, which is located by the pool.  There really is excellent cuisine and fine wines. </p><p>  And in the lobby of the hotel there is a cozy stylish bar.  It is very pleasant to sit down in an easy chair in the evening and, having chosen alcoholic drinks and light snacks, relax in good company. </p>
