No wonder it is called the pearl crowning the crown of our country.  In Europe, this area is called "Siberian Switzerland" because it resembles the Alps.  However, Russian mountains are preferred more than the Alps, as this is Altai, which has not yet been spoiled by tourism infrastructure.  You will find a list <span>of recreation centers in the Altai Mountains that are</span> considered the best of their kind in the article below. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="50.6181924" data-lng="86.21993079999993" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="6"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/1/5/1/3151.png"></div><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Often people who seek help from travel agencies do not believe the colorful photographs taken in the Altai Mountains, because they believe that this is Photoshop.  However, this place is perhaps the only one on the planet whose beauty cannot be conveyed even through the most professional photo montage.  Moreover, it is believed that here is the entrance to the amazing country of Shambhala, full of magic and enchantment. </p><p>  In Altai, you can see the features of several natural and climatic zones, some of which are unique.  So, at the foot of the mountains majestic coniferous forests grow and calm rivers flow.  The higher you go up, the more landscape changes: coniferous species replace alpine meadows, and smooth rivers flow into turbulent mountain streams and waterfalls.  The rocky steppes and intermountain basins also create a charming contrast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="russiatrek.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation centers of the Altai Mountains" class="if uuid-2462602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2462602.jpg"></div><p>  <span>The Altai climate,</span> however, is unpredictable, so you should not trust the forecasts of the meteorological center, going to the recreation centers of the Altai Mountains.  Clouds form literally on your gas, floating out from behind the mountains.  The climate of this place is usually referred to as sharply continental, since the region is located in the center of the continent.  For the most part, climatic conditions depend on prevailing winds and elevation.  It is believed that it is in Altai that both the warmest and the coldest place in all of Western Siberia is located.  By the way, the highest point of Siberia is in this region.  The height of the mountain called Belukha is 4506 m. The deepest cave in Russia and one of the deepest lakes, namely Teletskoye, are also located here. </p><h2>  Tursib </h2><p>  "Tursib" - a recreation center in the Altai Mountains, providing an excellent opportunity to admire the picturesque nature of the region.  It is very popular due to the high level of service.  Rest at this base will give you wonderful memories and unforgettable impressions.  Guests are accommodated in apartments, town houses, as well as standard, deluxe and deluxe plus rooms.  The peculiarity of all these numbers is that you can drink tap water in them, since it is filtered. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.altaitursib.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tursib recreation center Gorny Altai" class="if uuid-2462632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2462632.jpg"></div><p>  The apartments occupy two floors of a separate house.  In the living room there is a fireplace, there is also a dining area and two bedrooms, a shower and a toilet.  In addition, a terrace and all necessary appliances are equipped.  Townhouses are located in 6-apartment buildings.  They are rented, as a rule, for a long period.  Deluxe Plus rooms consist of one superior room.  They have access to the veranda.  The suites are more poorly furnished: they do not have a veranda.  The most affordable - standard class rooms.  They are rented for living in the summer. </p><p>  In summer, <span>the recreation facilities</span> of the Altai Mountains provide the opportunity to visit a tennis court, play volleyball, swim in the outdoor pool with a beach, gazebos and barbecue, as well as rent sports equipment.  In winter, you can rent cross-country skiing, ice skating, ice-lovers loved by many and visit the ice rink.  A year-round indoor pool, playgrounds for children and a cinema are open.

This recreation center is ideal for families and couples in love.  Altan is a place in which modern comfort and natural wealth are successfully combined.  Tourists live in cedar houses.  Forests around, fresh air and the sun will benefit your health. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="faqukrsx.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation facilities in the Altai Mountains with a pool" class="if uuid-2462634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2462634.jpg"></div><p>  You can choose different in price and comfort level at home.  Luxury, junior suites and economy rooms with outdoor amenities are available.  You can eat in the cafe bar or in the fast food cafe.  Moreover, nearby is the Chadyr Cafe, which serves Uyghur cuisine. </p><p>  "Altan", like other recreation centers in the Altai Mountains with a pool, provides tourists with the opportunity to swim in the open.  Everyone can play volleyball or basketball, visit a tennis court or a billiard room, as well as purchase basic necessities in the local pavilion.  Sports available throughout the year include horse riding and skiing.  According to travelers' reviews, letters of appreciation and letters of thanks, Altan is one of the best recreation centers in the Altai Mountains, and I want to come back here again and again. </p><h2>  "Turquoise" </h2><p>  Another comfortable hotel is located on the banks of the Katun River, in the Chemal district.  Turquoise is a recreation center in Gorny Altai, known as a balneological resort, as it is located in a zone of mild climate, it has sunny and moderately hot summers.  Since the hotel is built in a pine forest, the air in its territory is clean and invigorating.  You can stay in single, double or triple rooms.  The hotel can accommodate 55 guests at a time.  In their reviews, tourists note that within walking distance there is a sauna, a pool, as well as a Russian bath. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sibalt.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Turquoise recreation center Gorny Altai" class="if uuid-2462641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2462641.jpg"></div><h2>  "Altika" </h2><p>  Above were listed the three most popular recreation centers.  According to the ratings, they are the most comfortable.  However, if you wish, you can find other recreation centers of the Altai Mountains, which are not inferior to them in service and attitude towards guests.  For example, adherents of eco-style would like a hotel called Altika in the village of Ust-Muny.  The comfort needed by a 21st century person is combined with the unique nature of Altai.  According to the reviews that guests leave about Altika, the hotel is very good: the rooms offer panoramic views of Katun, the area around is ennobled, the local spa service is at a decent level, and the deep outdoor pool is ideal for swimming on a hot day. </p><h2>  "Edelweiss" </h2><p>  On the territory of the village of Artybash is the recreation center of the Altai Mountains "Edelweiss".  It is intended for lovers of a relaxing holiday surrounded by nature.  The hotel complex has everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Tourists are accommodated in comfortable rooms at budget prices. </p><p>  To standard amenities such as an outdoor pool and barbecue facilities, a zoo is added.  It is within walking distance of the hotel.  The path to the zoo does not take much time, which tourists note in their reviews. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation centers of Altai Mountains" class="if uuid-2462667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2462667.jpg"></div><h2>  Altai Resort </h2><p>  This atmospheric place on the territory of Urlu Aspaka cannot be called a cheap recreation center.  Spacious cottages are quietly hidden from prying eyes in the thick of cedar trees, away from the main road.  Citizens, tired of the crazy pace of life, can spend their holidays surrounded by picturesque Altai nature. </p><p>  A feature of the recreation center is the fact that tourists are lodged in separate cottages.  They are spacious and comfortable.  Moreover, they have terraces.  If desired, you can swim in the large indoor pool at any time of the year.  According to guest reviews, in the winter recreation centers in the Altai Mountains provide the opportunity to enjoy panoramic mountain views, as well as take a dip in the warm pool.  In summer, there is the opportunity to get a couple of riding lessons, rent bicycles, go fishing on the lake and play paintball. </p><h2>  "Kruglov's estate" </h2><p>  In the village of Cheposh, on the river bank, there is a recreation center called the Kruglovy Manor.  It is perfect for car lovers.  Travelers are accommodated in houses made of timber, as they say, "made for centuries."  Rest here is inexpensive, but tourists get the opportunity to take a steam bath in a Russian bathhouse and fry kebabs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="proaltay.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountain Altai summer recreation" class="if uuid-2462677" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2462677.jpg"></div><p>  On the territory of the base there is parking, which is very convenient if you believe the reviews of tourists.  By car, you can get to Lake Aya and to the water park called Transib. </p><p>  However, there are several drawbacks that vacationers note: in some rooms there are no showers or toilets.  In the summer, you can go rafting, take a horse ride or go to the mountains with other tourists. </p><h2>  Solnechnaya Polyana </h2><p>  In the village of Manzherok there is a guest house, the rest of which is not affordable.  Lovers of fresh air and picturesque nature will be delighted with this friendly place.  It has private parking, as well as a shared kitchen.  According to the reviews of tourists, in Solnechnaya Polyana the best price is combined with high quality service.  In summer, you can go to the mountains or visit the beach by the lake, and in winter ski rental is available. </p><h2>  "Zimin Manor" </h2><p>  In the village of Chemal, there is a recreation center "Zimin Manor".  In their reviews, tourists recommend it to lovers of a relaxing pastime surrounded by nature.  The tourist base is located on the banks of the Katun.  The rooms offer breathtaking views of the neighboring mountains.  If desired, you can visit the Temple on the island of Patmos.  It is believed that the wishes made here are sure to be fulfilled. </p><div class="photo" data-original="welcometoaltai.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation facilities in the Altai Mountains in winter" class="if uuid-2462680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2462680.jpg"></div><h2>  "Crown of Altai" </h2><p>  Right in the middle <span>of the Katun River</span> there is an amazing sanatorium called the ‚ÄúCrown of Altai‚Äù.  It features a pool, spa, bar and free parking.  The resort is ideal for a comfortable family vacation.  Tourists note that rooms have free Wi-Fi.
