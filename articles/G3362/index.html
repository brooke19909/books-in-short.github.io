But submitting an idea and justifying it theoretically does not mean inventing something new.  It is those people who were able to practically confirm what hundreds fought over, and can proudly carry the title of "inventor".  It was such a practitioner that Rudolf Diesel was, who brought to the world an internal combustion engine ignited by air compression. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rudolph Diesel" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10576/56168.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Biography of the great inventor </p><p>  Rudolph Diesel was born in 1858 in Paris.  My father worked as a bookbinder, the family had enough money for life.  Nevertheless, moving to England was inevitable, since the Franco-Prussian war brought about its own corrections.  And the Diesel family, as you know, by nationality belonged to the Germans, and in order to avoid chauvinist reaction, was forced to decide to move. </p><p>  Soon, the 12-year-old Rudolph was sent to his native Germany to study with his mother's brother, Professor Barnickel.  The family received it very warmly, and many books, training at a real school, and then at the Augsburg Polytechnic School, conversations with a smart uncle benefited the future world-famous inventor.  Since 1875, an outstanding student, Rudolf Diesel, continues his studies at the Munich Higher Technical School, where he was ignited by the idea to invent an internal combustion engine.  In a conversation with Professor Bauerfeind, he told the student about the greatest interest of the modern world in such a technical field as mechanical engineering. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="First diesel engine" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10576/56180.jpg"></div>  Only then did he learn that the boy had been dreaming for a long time and was working on replacing the steam engine - an internal combustion engine.  After studying, a professor at the Munich school, Karl Linde, invited Diesel to work at a refrigeration plant, where the young man served as director for 12 years.  Despite the main employment, Rudolf Diesel did not leave work on the main goal of life - an invention, which would later be called by his name.  Only now we, modern people, knowing about the diesel engine, have already forgotten the name of its inventor.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first <span>diesel</span> internal combustion engine </p><p>  For many years of hard work, Rudolph Diesel put in order to fulfill his dream.  With the help of Karl Linde, the Association of Augsburg Machine-Building Plants saw theoretical calculations, which became interested in his work and provided room for experiments.  For two long years, Rudolph improved his invention, and during one of the experiments there was an explosion, the scientist himself was almost injured. </p><p>  Soon justice prevailed and hard work was rewarded - the first diesel <span>internal combustion engine</span> turned the <span>world of engineering</span> upside down <span>.</span>  The diesel engine decided to try to ignite using <span>compressed air,</span> and then inject fuel there, as a result of which a flame flared up.  Despite the recognition of the scientist's work around the world, an invitation to Russia and America, his native Germany remained adamant about his invention, saying that such an engine had existed for a long time.  Perhaps other German inventions existed in development, but the world does not stand still, is developing, and the winner is the one who came to the finish line first. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="German inventions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10576/56216.jpg"></div>  Rudolf Diesel could not put up with such a reaction from Germany, and on September 29, 1913, when he set off on a ship to London, he did not arrive at his destination.  At night only the scientist remained in the wardroom, and in the morning she was empty, and the night suit was not touched.  Whether this was suicide due to Germany's non-recognition or a tragic accident is unknown.  After some time, the fishermen caught the corpse of a well-dressed man, but a raging thunderstorm forced them to throw the body back into the sea.  Superstitious fishermen considered that the <span>human soul</span> asks to remain in the water element.  Cold water and a sandy bottom became the last home of the ingenious inventor, the memory of which still lives in his diesel engine.
