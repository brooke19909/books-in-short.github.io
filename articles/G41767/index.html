But not everyone, after all, knows about his difficult fate, his exploits. </p><h2>  Who are Russian heroes </h2><p>  The very word "hero" was first mentioned in the annals of Russia in the 7th century and replaced the previously used word "horobr", which means "good man".  This word has its roots in the ancient Turkic language, and came from the root "batyr" (brave, strong). </p><p>  At that time, Russian brave warriors constantly fought with nomads on the eastern border of Kievan Rus, it was their people who began to be called heroes. </p><p>  The main differences between bogatyrs and ordinary warriors are: disproportionate love for the motherland, fidelity to duty, exorbitant strength and willingness to rush into battle every second in the name of the fatherland, weak, offended people and their honor. </p><p>  In the picture below, the magnificent Russian <span>artist Vasnetsov</span> depicts the three most famous heroes in the history of Russia.  From left to right: Dobrynya Nikitich, Ilya Muromets, Alyosha Popovich. </p>

    <h2>  Who is Ilya Muromets </h2><p>  But the most famous and most revered hero in Russia was Ilya Muromets.  They remember him not by words, but by brave deeds.  The exploits of Ilya Muromets are described in a rather fabulous form.  However, it is worth noting that every magical opponent of him (Nightingale the Robber, Idolische Poganoe) personified a specific nomadic people (Pechenegs, Polovtsy), with whom Kievan Rus waged war at the time of writing.  In those days, these epics were absolutely ‚Äúchronicles of war‚Äù for people of that time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The description of Ilya Muromets in epics pays more attention to his character, hardened in many difficult battles and formed due to a difficult fate, however, little is said about his appearance. </p><p>  The relics of the great Russian hero, who is also a saint, rest in the Kiev Pechersk Lavra.  Judging by the studies, Ilya was approximately 180 cm tall.  For those times, he was just a huge man, besides, he had a powerful physique. </p><p>  The photo below shows a cancer with the relics of the Monk Ilya of Muromets (Pechersky). </p>

    <h2>  The hard life of Ilya Muromets </h2><p>  Ilya was born in the village of Karacharovo near the city of Murom, in the Vladimir region, which is why he is called the Murom.  His father and mother were simple peasants, worked in the field tirelessly.  However, their son was born with physical disabilities and was completely unable to move his arms and legs, but could only sit on the stove. </p><p>  Until the age of 33, the hero was weak, however, his character became incredibly strong, firm and calm.  Often, an important role in the life of the main characters of the world epic is played by a miracle.  All the most significant moments in fate are wonderful, whether it be a magical birth, healing, gaining immortality or power.  Ilya Muromets is no exception.  Bylina about miraculous healing confirms this, now we‚Äôll talk about it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, it was at the age of 33 that Jesus Christ was crucified and then resurrected. </p><p>  Photo below: the hero Ilya Muromets on his horse, whose name was Burushka-Kosmatushka, performed by the artist Vasnetsov. </p>

    <h2>  Miraculous healing </h2><p>  The healing of Ilya Muromets is truly fabulous.  Once, when the parents worked in the field, the Kaliki elders came to Ilya‚Äôs house.  The publications of the Soviet era do not say exactly who they were.  However, in the copies of the epic that were published before the revolution, it is said that Jesus Christ and his two apostles were the calico. </p><p>  So, the Kaliki came to the house of Ilya.  They immediately ask him to bring them water.  To this, Muromets answers that he is weak, cannot move his legs and arms.  After all, the main occupation of Ilya Muromets over the past 30 years is to lie in bed. </p><p>  The painting by Andrei Klimenko shows Ilya Muromets in weakness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Healing of ilya muromets" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23792/544402.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Then the elders, in spite of his words, again ask to bring water for them.  Ilya is not one of weak people, for many years of illness his character was truly amazing, he sincerely desired to bring water to the potions, put his feet on the floor and immediately felt that they were holding him! </p><p>  Incredible power came to the poor and infirm cripple, Ilya Muromets became healthy!  The epic continues, the hero gets up, goes to a container of water, fills a full glass and brings it to the elders.  However, they ask him to drink the water himself.  The water is holy, healing, and Ilya is completely cured.  When he drinks the same water for the second time, Muromets feels a completely unimaginable power, and he even has to drink one more time to reduce such a huge force. </p><p>  Since the healing of Ilya Muromets is truly a miraculous event, the hero must thank the elders for the gift.  Kaliki send him to the service of Prince Vladimir and predict that Ilya will be the greatest hero, and will not die in battle from an enemy bullet or spear.  And from now on, the main occupation of Ilya Muromets is <span>the military</span> business and the defense of the homeland.  They say that with many heroes he will have to fight, but only he should not fight with Svyatogor, since Svyatogor is too strong. </p><h2>  How Ilya Muromets gained armor and a horse </h2><p>  Then the elders tell Ilya that on the way to Kiev he will meet a heavy stone with an inscription.  Muromets listens attentively.  And then he gathers, says goodbye to his happy parents and walks on foot to the "hail to Kiev."  Along the way, he really stumbles upon a huge stone that says: </p><p>  "Elijah, Elijah, a stone of sopri from a place of motionless, <br>  There is a horse of good strength to you, <br>  With all the armor and the heroic ones. <br>  There is a sable fur coat, <br>  There is a little silk, <br>  There‚Äôs a damask club " </p><p>  With the help of a newfound silushka, he shifts it from its place, and under the stone it detects equipment, and then the horse runs up to it.  Ilya asked him to serve as a hero by faith-and-truth.  In response to this, the horse offers Ilya a kind of test, but as soon as Muromets saddles the horse, the need for testing disappears, the horse fully recognizes the Russian hero as his eternal master. </p><p>  However, there is another version.  It says that the elders gave him advice on how to raise his stallion, which is ideal for a hero.  To do this, you had to go to the market without choosing, buy the first one you came to, look after him for three months, and then walk for three nights on fresh dew. </p><h2>  How Ilya Muromets defeated the Nightingale the Robber </h2><p>  After Ilya last visited a church in his hometown of Murom, he sets off on his journey to Kiev itself.  On the way, he accomplishes his first feat: rescues captured Chernigov from nomads.  The townspeople offer him to become a governor, but he refuses, because he needs to get to Kiev.  He asks the locals for directions. </p><p>  The townspeople tell him a terrible story that for many years no one has been driving along the road, that he lives next to the <span>Smorodina river</span> in the raw oak, the Nightingale the Robber.  And he screams and whistles in such a way that he simply kills everyone who gets in his way.  But the hero Ilya of Muromets is not afraid of the Nightingale and goes to that very river. </p><p>  The Nightingale, the robber of a bold hero, saw, cried out: ‚ÄúWhat kind of ignoramus is driving past my reserved oaks here?‚Äù, And he whistled, growled like an animal.  Already the horse of Elijah stumbled in place from the whirlwind that the Nightingale created. </p><p>  But Ilya resisted, pulled out his heroic bow and fired a red-hot arrow at the wicked adversary, saying: </p><p>  "You whistle, my arrow is red-hot, <br>  Hit the Nightingale the Robber! " </p><p>  And really hits!  The Nightingale rolls from the oak, and Ilya grabs it, binds it to his saddle and takes the captured villain to Kiev, Prince Vladimir. </p><p>  But Vladimir does not believe that someone finally killed the Nightingale the robber, and when he brings the wounded villain Ilya to the prince, he asks him to whistle at half strength.  And the Nightingale is whistling!  From his piercing screams, many people died immediately.  Then Ilya decides to take him to the field and chop off the Nightingale's head so that he does not bring more troubles. </p><p>  By the way, the description of Ilya Muromets, his actions during this battle and the course of the battle itself is still not specified, since there are more than 100 options for describing what was happening. </p><p>  Below we see Chistyakov's illustration on the theme of this epic: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Feats of ilya muromets" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23792/544451.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How Ilya met Svyatogor </h2><p>  Interestingly, all the exploits of Ilya Muromets and the events in his life cannot be arranged in chronological sequence.  The epic about how Muromets Svyatogor met, begins as follows: "How not farther, farther in pure in poly, <br>  Tuta smoking yes rose. "Neither date nor place of exact we can not determine. </p><p>  Once Ilya left for the Holy Mountains, just in the possessions of Svyatogor.  And he sees a wonderful picture: the mighty hero is sleeping right on the move, sitting on a horse, and this is Svyatogor himself!  Does not lose the chance to inflict a mortal blow and defeat our hero Ilya Muromets.  Bylina reports, however, that Svyatogor continued to sleep peacefully on his horse.  Ilya got angry, hit the second time, and then the third.  And only then did the powerful hero wake up.  He grabbed Muromets with one of his hands, put it in his pocket and began to carry it through the forest for two days. </p><p>  Only now the Svyatogor‚Äôs horse tells him that it‚Äôs hard for him to carry as many as two heroes, the horse stumbles.  The mighty hero decides to go home with his burden.  There are two heroes talking about life.  The good qualities of Ilya Muromets and his honesty inspire confidence in Svyator.  Two heroes decided to fraternize.  They exchanged their crosses and are now cross brothers. </p><p>  Below is an illustration of Kotukhina, Ilya Muromets on the left, Svyatogor on the right. </p>

Guessing the knights, for whom is this wonderful coffin made.  And then Ilya Muromets decides to lie in it and check whether the coffin is suitable for him.  He is too big for him.  Then Svyatogor lays in this coffin.  The lid closes.

    <p>  After a couple of minutes, asks the mighty hero of his cross brother to open the lid, but it does not lend itself.  Ilya draws his sword and begins to try to cut the lid of the coffin, but to no avail.  Then Svyatogor understands that it was his turn to die. </p><p>  When Svyatogor dies, part of his strength passes to Ilya Muromets, which makes him even more healthy and powerful. </p><h2>  How Ilya Muromets defeated the Idol </h2><p>  Somehow a huge Tatar army approached Kiev led by the Idol of Pogany!  Idolische appeared to the prince of Kiev himself, but Vladimir is frightened and invites the adversary to his feast.  The enemy takes advantage of the opportunity and superiority in power, imprisoned the Prince of Kiev and has fun in the princely palace. </p><p>  The main occupation of Ilya Muromets is the defense of Vladimir and Russia, so he immediately goes to Kiev.  On the way, he meets an old traveler and changes his clothes to his own.  Now the hero looks like a real pilgrim.  He comes to the palace, becomes a party to the feast, begins a conversation with Idolish. </p><p>  Idolische asks the dressed-up hero: "How many Russian heroes drink and eat?"  To which Ilya replies that the Tatar warriors eat and drink more.  Idolische taunts glorious Russian knights.  Then the disguised Muromets intervenes in the conversation and says that the Tatars are like cows that ate a lot and burst from greed. </p><p>  The idol is rushing at the ‚Äúold man‚Äù with a knife, but at that moment Ilya drops the mantle of the pilgrim, grabs the idol with just one hand right on the fly and cuts off the enemy‚Äôs head.  Then he goes into the courtyard and straightens out with the help of only sticks with all the Tatars and rescues Prince Vladimir from imprisonment. </p><h2>  Ilya Muromets and Kalin Tsar </h2><p>  Once Prince Vladimir became very angry and put Ilya Muromets for three years in the deepest cellar, chained him with chains.  However, the prince's daughter secretly makes fake keys and supplies the imprisoned hero with hearty food and warm clothes. </p><p>  At the same time, Kalin the Tsar was gathering with his huge army in Kiev.  He threatens to ruin the city, burn all the churches and cut out all the townspeople along with the princely family.  To prevent this from happening, the prince must clear all the streets of people, place barrels of hops everywhere, and let the Tatar army personally entertain itself into the city for entertainment.  Prince Vladimir asks Kalin the Tsar for exactly three years to fulfill the requirements. </p><p>  And here comes the deadline.  Kalin the tsar and his huge army right on the threshold of Kiev!  Vladimir is deeply saddened by the fact that he himself killed his defender Ilya Muromets, now there is no one to stand up for Kiev city!  However, the daughter who has provided Ilya with food all these years, says that her beloved warrior, Ilya Muromets, is alive.  Bylina does not end there. </p><p>  Ilya, encouraged by his release from prison, wears armor, mounts his horse, and rides alone to fight the Tatar army in the open field, he asked other Russian heroes to help him, but they all refused, saying that they did not see anything good in Prince Kievan and didn‚Äôt will help him. </p><p>  And, naturally, <span>one is not a warrior in the field!</span>  Ilya killed most of the Tatar army, but he alone could not cope.  And then he falls into the trap, not listening to his horse.  The horse told him that there were three undermines in the field, the horse would jump over the first two, but not the third.  Thanks to his own self-confidence, Ilya is captured by the Kalin Tsar. </p><p>  Kalin the Tsar offers the hero to serve with him, but Ilya refuses the proud and loyal motherland.  He leaves the king‚Äôs tent, but the Tatars try to detain him and again shackle him, then he grabs one of them by the legs and, waving the Tatar like a club, breaks through the whole army. </p><p>  On the whistle of Ilya, his horse Burushka-Kosmatushka runs to him, he calls on the highest mountain and shoots towards the father of Samson Samoilovich.  He wakes up from a light scratch, understands that this is news from Muromets, and immediately orders all the heroes to saddle their horses and go to the rescue of the hero Ilya. </p><p>  Together they disperse the army of the Tatars, take Kalina the Tsar captive, and force him to pay a large tribute to the Kiev prince. </p><h2>  Ilya Muromets and the Hero-Invader </h2><p>  Once, the hero Ilya Muromets decided to walk around Russia, check all the borders.  Ilya rode, rode, rode, and then he saw a far, far cloud dusty.  Ilya Muromets jumps there to check, and what a wonder and wonder is going on there!  And he sees that on the Russian land, the alien-hero is having fun. </p><p>  Two heroes met, they started a conversation about which heroes are healthier and stronger.  The alien hero began to praise himself, and offend our Murom.  Then the Russian hero became angry, took out his heroic sword and rushed at his offender! </p><p>  The alien hero was strong; for three days and three nights they fought on equal and tireless basis.  But on the third day the foreigner began to tire, and then Ilya grabbed him, lifted him with his two strong hands above the ground, and then simply smashed him to the ground! </p><p>  The picture below is painted by Shitikov. </p>

    <h2>  The memory of the great hero </h2><p>  Like all of us, the hero Ilya Muromets is mortal.  About 40 years old, he felt that he was becoming weak, went to the monastery, prayed for days and practically did not sleep.  And so he ended his military life, and at the age of about 45 years old he moved to another world, to the Kingdom of Heaven.  In 1643 he was counted among the saints, and since then on January 1, the Russian Church celebrates his memory. </p>

    <p>  The main occupation of Ilya Muromets throughout his life is a military affair, but Ilya, the only Russian athlete, was born into a peasant family.  It combines the image of a simple Russian peasant, the greatest warrior and protector, a mythological hero and even a saint! </p>
