    <p>  A hook is a unique tool that allows you to create magnificent lace (and not only) products.  With it, you can not only create new things, but also update old ones.  Choose new bright threads, choose the thickness of the hook and the pattern, take the old boring skirt.  I am sure that crocheting along the lowest edge will turn it into a new trendy thing.  Do not forget about blouses.  Master the technique of knitting <span>ribbon lace,</span> and you can completely transform your blouse, which has a simple cut.  With the help of this wonderful tool, you can decorate not only clothing elements, but also bags, and even interior elements. </p><p>  And what magnificent shawls can be <span>crocheted,</span> but they will all have an unfinished look if crochet is not completed.  In this case, you will not only lengthen the shawl, but also protect it from deformation during wear.  At the same time, the pattern itself, as such, does not have much significance: the necessary rigidity of the product edge in this case will be guaranteed.  The main thing is to properly process the finished product. </p><p>  In general, crochet looks good in case the product is knitted.  It is only necessary to choose the thickness of the thread and the number of the hook.  Do not use the same threads for tying that were used to knit the product.  In this case, the edge will look thick and rough.  Take the thread and hook a little thinner.  Time, of course, will have to spend more, but it's worth it. </p><p>  If we talk about patterns that are used to tie finished products, they are quite diverse and have different widths.  You can pick up a pattern about ten centimeters wide, and then your skirt will have a real lace bottom.  And you can do it in one or two rows.  But the last must be "Rachich step."  This pattern is very simple, and it got its name because of the knitting technique: the direction of knitting changes to the opposite, that is, we knit in the opposite direction, without turning the product over, as if backing away.  In most cases, crocheting the neck of the neck is carried out with just such a pattern. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It often happens, especially for those who have children, that the finished product just needs to be lengthened.  Knitting was carried out from the bottom up, and therefore, knitting from above will turn into an extremely time-consuming process: it will be necessary to dissolve the product to a certain level, tie the required length and again knit what was loose.  It is long and laborious, but tying the product with a hook can significantly save your time and effort.  Is your daughter a short skirt already?  No problem.  Buy contrasting threads, and with the help of arches from air loops you can increase the length.  You can choose a more complicated pattern.  Short sleeves at the sweater?  This also does not matter.  Match the threads to the finished product of different thicknesses.  If you have not knitted using the technique of Irish lace, it's time to learn.  The edge of the product and sleeves tied in this technique will look simply irresistible. </p><p>  But not only for clothes, you can use openwork patterns made by crochet.  The harness is also used for home decoration.  Using a hook, you can tie a towel, the edge of the curtain or a cloak on a chair.  Do you have a set of simple cloth napkins?  Just great.  The hook will allow you to completely transform them.  Tie the edges with some simplest pattern, and your guests will be sure that they have never before met such a beautiful set of napkins. </p><p>  Thus, crochet: </p><p>  · Allows you to give the product a finished look; </p><p>  · Prevents deformation of the edge of the product during wear, that is, prevents stretching and twisting of the fabric knitted with needles; </p><p>  · Is an element of decoration; </p><p>  · Allows to increase the length of the finished product. </p>
