  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Black cross stitch: patterns and design</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cross-stitch is a very popular and widespread type of needlework throughout the world.  They have infected many men and women around the world.  This type of needlework is very ancient: it goes back to the prehistoric era.  This lesson captures in its networks and does not let go until you finish the work you have begun. </p><h2>  Materials and tools for embroidery </h2><p>  Before starting work, you need to purchase materials and tools indispensable for this type of needlework.  The most important thing in this work is canvas.  This is a fabric with holes on which crosses are sewn.  It was created specifically for cross-stitch.  Canvas comes in different sizes: when buying, you should focus on the pattern that you will embroider on it.  This fabric is produced by different companies, it is sometimes made from different raw materials, and most importantly, it comes in different colors.  Black, red or blue canvas is your choice. </p><p>  In addition, for embroidery you will need a needle with a large eye, convenient to use and - importantly - with a blunt tip. </p><p>  When embroidering with a cross, one cannot do without threads.  The most popular among them are mouline thread made from natural cotton.  The color scheme of these threads will not leave anyone indifferent - I want to buy all the colors. </p><p>  Also in the work you will need scissors - small and with a sharp tip.  And a hoop.  They come in different sizes, from different materials and different shapes - in general, you can do without them, but working with the embroidery frame will be more comfortable, the result will look more accurate and move faster. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth considering that cross-stitching should be done only in good lighting conditions - when the light falls evenly on the area where the work proceeds.  And for your comfort and health, you need to keep your back straight - be sure! </p><h2>  Where to get the embroidery pattern? </h2><p>  Cross stitch patterns can be bought in any stores related to needlework, as well as sometimes in office supply stores.  Usually, in embroidery kits, everything that is needed for work is included in the kit: canvas, floss thread of the right colors, needle and, of course, the pattern itself.  If at home there are all the necessary tools and materials, and there is no desire to spend finances, then you can find the desired scheme in the relevant manuals or calculate it yourself. </p><h2>  Black and white cross stitch patterns </h2><p>  Cross stitching can be of different subjects and different color palettes.  There are both multi-colored and solid patterns.  There are schemes that use only a black cross: take at least silhouettes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Girl silhouette" class="if uuid-2442692" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85609/2442692.jpg"></div><p>  In most schemes, all colors are mixed: for example, when embroidering a landscape.  In others, any other individual color. </p><p>  The works embroidered with a black cross are minimalistic: in them nothing distracts the eye from the main thing.  They are also simple in execution due to the fact that you do not need to change the colors of the threads, but this is a rather depressing task.  Work with one color is suitable for both beginner craftswomen and already experienced embroiderers.  The combination of two colors - a black cross and white - looks very beautiful and elegant.  Such works always attract attention.  Here is a diagram of a horse for embroidery with a black cross. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="biser.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Horse embroidery" class="if uuid-2442694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85609/2442694.jpg"></div><h2>  How to arrange the finished work? </h2><p>  <span>The picture embroidered with a cross</span> necessarily needs a beautiful design.  Such works of art are often inserted into finished frames and decorate the walls of the hallway or living room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beatles embroidery" class="if uuid-2442690" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85609/2442690.jpg"></div><p>  But you can choose a more original design option.  Now it has become very fashionable to leave embroidery in the embroidery frame, which serves as a kind of frame for it - it looks very beautiful and creative. </p><div class="photo" data-original="doityourfamily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hoop embroidery" class="if uuid-2442691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85609/2442691.jpg"></div><p>  Black and white cross-stitch will also look great in the interior of the house on sofa cushions - if embroidered on pillowcases.  Anyway, there can be a lot of options - it all depends on your imagination, imagination and degree of enthusiasm for this occupation.  Go for it! </p>
