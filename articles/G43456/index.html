What fabric to sew a summer dress from?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any woman wants to look attractive regardless of age and weather, but this desire is especially pronounced in the summer, when you can part with heavy and hide clothes and appear before others in all its glory.  In addition, the hot season has a vacation season, and every girl wants to become the goddess of a beach resort, causing admiration, including her luxurious outfits.  However, in order to feel comfortable, you need to choose not only the style of the toilet, but also the material for its manufacture, so many want to know which fabrics for the summer dress are the most suitable. </p><p>  As you know, the first tissue was created 7-8 millennia ago.  This event was a real revolution, which allowed to refuse to wear skins.  Scientific and technological progress made fabric manufacturing cheaper, and the advent of synthetic materials made it possible to produce completely new types of textiles.  Today, a variety of fabrics are presented on the market.  They differ in their properties, so their right choice can make clothes more comfortable for a particular time of year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric for summer blouses and dresses" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/889350.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What fabric is best for a summer dress? </h2><p>  Talking about choosing textiles for sewing women's clothing for the hot season, it should first be emphasized that two approaches are possible.  In the first case, the choice is made based on the comfort of tissue hygiene, and in the second, based on its appearance.  Indeed, in some cases, for example, when choosing a toilet for an evening out, ladies prefer to undergo some inconvenience, but look stunning.  On a completely different principle, you should buy fabric for clothing designed for walking or visiting public places in the daytime.  In particular, it should be made of <span>natural fibers whenever</span> possible <span>.</span>  At the same time, the addition of a certain percentage of synthetic fibers is not excluded.  In particular, summer fabrics for dresses can be made of cotton with the addition of lycra (5%), which allows clothes to maintain an attractive appearance for a long time and fit the figure well. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fabrics for summer dress" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/889437.jpg" width="350"></div>

Times have changed, and most modern girls prefer summer dresses made from natural fabrics.  Most often they are made of cotton, linen and silk.  At the moment, there is a huge variety of options for such textiles.  In particular, burlap and fine linen are made from flax, and chintz, satin, percale, poplin, flannel, satin-jacquard and about dozens of <span>types of fabrics</span> are made of cotton <span>,</span> as they say, for every taste and budget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="summer fabrics for dress" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/889362.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Thus, girls who are fans of everything natural have a huge selection of options.  It makes sense to get to know the most popular ones. </p><h2>  Batiste </h2><p>  When deciding which fabric to sew a summer dress from, pay attention to the invention of French weavers.  It got its name from the name of its creator - Jean Baptiste Shamri.  The new fabric immediately became very popular with both men and women.  Today, a variety of cambric sundresses and blouses are in fashion.  They can be very simple cut or decorated with rich embroidery and lace.  The advantage of cambric dresses is their lightness, hygroscopicity and pleasantness to the touch.  In addition, regardless of style, they are younger than their hostesses, as they are usually painted in light colors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Chintz </h2><p>  Modern women of fashion, choosing summer fabrics for dresses, often undeservedly bypass their attention with ordinary chintz.  But today you can buy such textiles of very beautiful colors and prints.  Moreover, when you consider that this material is lightweight, durable and allows the body to breathe freely, it becomes clear that your wardrobe just needs a couple of cotton sundresses or blouses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what fabric to sew a summer dress" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/889359.jpg" width="233"></div>

    <h2>  Satin </h2><p>  If you are interested in fabrics for summer dresses for special occasions, then pay attention to satin.  It is made from 100% cotton and at the same time looks incredibly rich, competing even with natural silk.  Satin <span>does not wrinkle</span> and is able to withstand many washings.  Satin dresses attract a beautiful shine and are incredibly pleasant to the touch. </p><h2>  Atlas </h2><p>  For many centuries, the rich and famous have chosen to choose satin as the fabric for their summer dresses for special occasions.  It is made from 100 percent or with synthetic silk additives. </p><p>  This fabric is ideal for sewing a chic wedding toilet, including for the celebration, scheduled for the summer.  <span>Satin dresses</span> for bridesmaids or at the prom will also look irresistible, of course, if parents agree to pay a round sum, since this is far from a cheap option. </p><h2>  Chiffon </h2><p>  When asked about what fabrics should be for a summer dress, most girls answer: beautiful, light and airy.  All these epithets correspond to chiffon.  It is ideal for tailoring resort outfits, since in such a toilet it is simply impossible to go unnoticed while strolling along the embankment of the southern city in the evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="summer dresses made from natural fabrics" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/889354.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Initially, it was made from natural silk.  However, on the market today there are options with various artificial additives.  They are much cheaper and accessible to everyone, so that every girl can enrich her wardrobe with a beautiful translucent dress.  In addition, the chiffon is beautifully painted and easily draped, which allows you to create original and feminine models of sundresses, skirts and tunics. </p><h2>  Silk </h2><p>  If you are faced with a choice of what fabric to sew a summer dress for a special occasion, then pay attention to textiles, the secret of which for many centuries has been kept by seven seals.  We are talking about silk, which was originally invented in China and was valued by European fashionistas above all other fabrics.  Today, a <span>silk dress</span> continues to be considered an adornment of any girl‚Äôs wardrobe.  Such toilets are not only extremely beautiful, but also make it easier to carry even the most sweltering heat.  Of course, provided that we are talking about a 100% natural product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what fabric for summer dress" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/890225.jpg" width="600"></div>
