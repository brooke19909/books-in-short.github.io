    <h2>  Island Description </h2><p>  Tortuga (modern name - Tortu) is a rocky islet that is part of Haiti.  Located in the northeast of the Windward Channel.  It is so small that it is indicated on the map by a barely noticeable dot.  Tortuga's area is only 180 square kilometers.  About 30 thousand people of the local population live on this territory.  The island received its unusual name due to the outlines resembling a <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãturtle</span> (this is how its name is translated from Spanish).  There is another version of the origin of the toponym.  In ancient times, a rare species of large turtles was found on Tortug.  The animals died out long ago, but the memory of them remained forever immortalized in the name of the island. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Opening </h2><p>  Tortuga has a long and very fascinating history.  The island was first discovered in 1499 by the explorer Alonso de Ojeda, traveling as part of the expedition of <span>Christopher Columbus.</span>  The discovered piece of land turned out to be so small that before 1570 it was not even put on geographical maps. </p>

    <h2>  Tortuga - Pirate Island </h2><p>  Since the beginning of the XVII century, Tortuga was chosen by filibusters (sea pirates from France) who were engaged in robbing Spanish ships in the waters of the Caribbean.  She attracted robbers for several reasons.  Firstly, the island was near the Spanish colony of Hispaniola (Haiti), and many ships walked past it.  Secondly, it had a special relief.  It was possible to get to the island only through the southern harbor of Baster, while on the north side it was protected from uninvited guests (colonial police) by high cliffs.  Sea pirates founded a small settlement on a favorite piece of land.  Gradually, it began to grow due to immigrants from Europe and merchants who sailed to Tortuga and stayed here forever. </p><p>  There was bad rumor about the island.  The filibusters who inhabited it regularly attacked ships transporting goods from America to Europe across the Caribbean Sea, and then, together with the looted wealth, hid themselves behind the cliffs of their impregnable citadel.  Suffering serious losses from constant robberies, the Spanish colonialists repeatedly sent their fleet to the shores of Tortuga in the early 30s of the 17th century, hoping to destroy the pirate hangout, but all their attempts ended in failure.  The robbery raids continued with the same constancy as before. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The heyday and sunset of the pirate haven </h2><p>  In 1635, the Spaniards attacked the island of Tortuga.  Filibusters turned to the French authorities in search of protection.  They did this on completely legal grounds, since piracy in the Middle Ages was not considered a shameful occupation.  It was resorted not only to the poor, but also to <span>noble people.</span>  Sea robbers gave part of the looted treasures from foreign ships to the treasury of their state, receiving in return the protection of the authorities.  France appointed the governor of the island, Fran√ßois <span>le Wasser,</span> who ordered the construction of a defensive fortress in Baster harbor.  After that, Tortuga became impregnable for the Spanish colonialists from all sides.  The construction of the fortress contributed to even greater revelry of robberies. </p><p>  The pirate island of Tortuga flourished until the end of the 17th century.  The filibusters actively traded looted treasures and lived happily ever after.  France continued to patronize them, taking advantage of this.  The robbers did not know anything shortage.  So that in their free time from robberies, they would not be bored, the French government made sure that there were women on the island.  For the entire period of the existence of the pirate freemen, about 1,200 women were taken to Tortuga, the vast majority of whom were engaged in prostitution. </p><p>  The base of filibusters existed on the island until 1694 (according to other sources, until 1713), after which it was defeated by the Spaniards.  This ended the legendary pirate past of Tortuga.  The island was practically uninhabited for a long time and only in the 20th century began to be inhabited again. </p>

    <h2>  Benefits for Travelers </h2><p>  What can Tortuga Island attract tourists today?  Rest on it is popular with people who prefer to spend time in complete silence and away from the benefits of civilization.  Rocks, wild sandy beaches, clear sea, hot sun and coconut palms - this is what travelers come here for. </p><p>  Colds on Tortug never happen.  In the summer months, air temperature often reaches +38 degrees Celsius, and in winter it never drops below 22 degrees Celsius. </p><h2>  Features of rest: reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Travel enthusiasts are interested in knowing what Tortuga is.  The island, which is difficult to find reviews about on travel sites, is not one of the famous resorts.  Five-star hotels, noisy discos and modern attractions are not here, but this does not prevent tourists from relaxing in comfort.  The reviews indicate that the local population, unlike their aggressive ancestors, is very friendly and attentive to the guests.  When tourists get tired of basking in the sun and splashing in the sea, they are invited to go kayaking, go diving or climb the rocks.  Also among the local population fishing is held in high esteem.  The main products on the island are seafood and <span>tropical fruits:</span> they make simple and healthy dishes that will appeal to any gourmet. </p>

    <h2>  What else do you need to know about the island? </h2><p>  Unfortunately, today almost nothing reminds of the pirate past on Tortug.  There are no preserved medieval attractions that may interest foreigners. </p><p>  In the southern part of the island (just where the fortress was once erected by le Vasser) are numerous Haitian villages.  The north side of Tortuga, as before, is protected by cliffs.  The population of the island is small, so every new person causes revival here. </p><p>  Going to Tortuga is easiest from the territory of Haiti.  For these purposes, tourists are provided with yachts.  You can also get to the homeland of pirates by air by renting a private jet. </p>
