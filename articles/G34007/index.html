Addresses of Kazan hotels</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Kazan is one of the most beautiful places in Russia, which is visited by a large number of people every year.  Tourists come here in order to admire the beautiful architecture and to feel the unusual atmosphere of the city. </p><p>  In one of the oldest settlements in our country there really is something to see.  To visit at least the most famous places, you need to come to Kazan for a few days, which means that you need to find housing where you can leave your things and relax at night. </p><h2>  Choose a hotel </h2><p>  Naturally, any person who is going on a trip, first of all, must choose a place of residence that meets all his requirements.  Where to stay in Kazan?  The answer to this question depends on many factors. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to stay in Kazan" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60149/1982444.jpg" width="600"></p><p>  If the first place for you is the cost, then to save money you can stay in low-cost hostels in Kazan and hotels where you can pay only for accommodation.  But get ready for the fact that they will be located on the outskirts of the village and you will have to get to the historical center.  Sometimes the journey can take quite a while, because Kazan is a big city. </p><p>  Those who, when choosing a hotel, are guided primarily by comfortable living conditions, will have to prepare for the fact that prices in fashionable hotels can bite.  But then the price of rooms often also includes additional services, such as meals (sometimes even three meals a day), free parking for cars and Internet access.  Elite complexes are located in the center, so getting to interesting places in the city is not difficult. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to stay overnight in Kazan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/1984078.jpg"></p><p>  But it is best to choose a place of residence, guided by the optimal ratio of convenience and cost.  There are special hotels located near the center of Kazan, where it‚Äôs quite possible to stay inexpensively, and the living conditions will also be on top. </p><h2>  Cheap hostels </h2><p>  Where to stay in Kazan for a night or a few days and not spend an astronomical amount on accommodation?  There are several suitable hostels that provide their guests with rooms at an attractive price.  If the main criterion for choosing a home is precisely its cost, then welcome to such mini-hotels. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="Hostel Kazan" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60149/1982447.jpg" width="600"></p><h2>  "Kazan Compound" </h2><p>  A small hotel-type building is located less than one kilometer from the city center, its exact address is Ul.  Bauman, 68. Both a lone tourist and couples who have taken children on an exciting journey can stay in it.  This Kazan hostel provides both four- and six-bed rooms, and rooms designed for one or two people.  Some of them are even equipped with air conditioning, which is a luxury item in such establishments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The price of apartments ranges from 1400 to 2500 rubles.  And it is worth noting that this includes not only accommodation, but also breakfast.  Free of charge, you can use special lockers designed to store things. </p><p>  In 2016, Kazan Compound was recognized as the best hostel in the country.  This means that travelers who decide to stay in this place will not regret it: such living conditions can not be found in any other institution of this type. <strong></strong></p><h2>  "Wings" </h2><p>  The hostel, located right in the center, on Chernyshevsky street, 16, is a great place where you can stay for the night in Kazan at a very reasonable price.  Guest reviews speak better than all other descriptions: people note the unusual comfort of a mini-hotel, home furnishings and, of course, a convenient location. </p><p>  Nearby is Bauman Street - a favorite place for tourists and residents who prefer hiking.  After a short distance, you will find yourself on a busy boulevard, where there are many shops, bars and cafes. </p><p>  The hostel service is at a fairly high level.  Visitors are offered bed linen, bath accessories (towels and slippers).  There is no need to bring a lot of things with you, especially if you are planning a short stay in Kazan - most of the basic necessities can be obtained in the guest house itself. </p><p>  Wings also have a specially equipped kitchen where you can prepare food, which also significantly reduces the cost of travelers - the prices for ready meals in the center of Kazan are quite high. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Budget hotels </h2><p>  If you prefer not to stay in hostels, where it‚Äôs almost impossible to stay alone and have to be surrounded by strangers, and sometimes even live with them in the same room, then you can easily choose a cheap hotel in Kazan, where you can stay for one day, and for the long term. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazan where to stay cheap" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60149/1982443.jpg"></p><h2>  "Dune" </h2><p>  The hotel is located very close to the historic city center - on Ak.  Queen, house number - 19. To get to the Kazan Kremlin by car or public transport, you need to spend only 10 minutes.  Exactly the same amount of time will be required to get to the famous Riviera water park. </p><p>  The hotel offers a choice of 12 rooms, among which there are both standard rooms and superior amenities.  There is also a standard set of hotel services that you can use if you wish: wireless Internet access, parking, as well as breakfast, which is included in the price. </p><p>  A feature is the ability to order excursions directly in the hotel building.  Guests now do not need to contact travel companies or explore local attractions on their own - just convey your desire to explore interesting places in the city to the staff. </p><h2>  "Davydov" </h2><p>  If you are looking for a place to stay inexpensively, in Kazan, in the building at number 35A on Nursultan Nazarbayev Street, there is another hotel, the prices of which are democratic.  Of course, there are more expensive rooms here, which not every average citizen of our country can afford, but a person who plans to spend a small amount of money on accommodation can find a room here. </p><p>  To save money will also help the service of free room reservation.  A nice addition will be breakfast, which is already included in the room rate, and Internet access. </p><p>  The hotel is located near one of the main transport hubs of the city - Kazan Station.  Of the local attractions nearby is the Botanical Garden - a favorite vacation spot for naturalists and simply wildlife lovers. </p><p>  In addition to the standard set of services, the hotel provides its guests with the opportunity to have breakfast at the buffet, and during the day snacks and drinks can be bought in the bar located in the hotel building.  There is also its own restaurant, which serves dishes not only Russian and Tatar cuisine, but also dishes prepared according to European standards. </p><p>  ‚ÄúDavydov‚Äù is perfect for city guests who have come to Kazan not for the sake of idle curiosity, but for business.  For them, the hotel organized two conference rooms and allocated a special room for negotiations. </p><h2>  The best hotels of Kazan </h2><p>  For those who are used to comfortable living conditions and do not want to give them up even while traveling, there are several hotels in Kazan where you can stay in rooms that have all the necessary equipment, and the interior is striking in its thoughtfulness and modernity.

Their interiors are united by a single design solution - all apartments are designed in turquoise and ocher colors with the addition of beige. </p><p>  The hotel is truly royal-style, and in some rooms belonging to the deluxe and deluxe categories, perhaps, only members of royal families or other powerful people of this world can stay.  They all comply with European standards: cosmetics of famous brands, modern televisions with many functions and minibars with a rich collection. </p><p>  The Ramada Hotel located in Kazan also has classic rooms, the price of which is more budget-friendly, but this does not mean at all that they are inferior to luxury apartments.
