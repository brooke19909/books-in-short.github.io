  <section class="page js-page"><h1>US War of Independence</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For a long time, part of the territories of <span>North America</span> was under British control.  Until 1775, these colonies were subject to exorbitant taxes and fees, which caused discontent among the population.  The US War of Independence was the logical conclusion to this part of their history and economic development.  As a result of events that lasted 8 years, a state was formed, called the <span>United States of America.</span> </p><p>  The British government regarded the territories of North America as a source of cheap raw materials and a profitable <span>market.</span>  The last straw was the <span>stamp duty</span> on all printed materials.  Great Britain accepted it without agreement with the colonies.  A <span>boycott of this</span> law was announced.  Further, the British government decided to introduce a customs fee.  When a batch of English tea arrived at the port of Boston, the cost of which included <span>customs duty,</span> opponents of British policy attacked the ships and drowned their cargo.  Thus began the war for US independence. </p><p>  Armed detachments began to be created in the colonies to combat the colonialists.  At the Continental Congress, it was decided to ban the import of English goods.  Some of the population remained on the side of the English government.  They were called loyalists.  It was they who provided assistance to the troops of the colonialists. </p><p>  Armed clashes of British troops with militia units began.  In April 1775, the British were attacked in <span>Massachusetts.</span>  They were forced to retreat.  The ranks of the militia were replenished by volunteers.  They fiercely resisted, as a result of which the British troops were losing ground.  The US War of Independence was gaining momentum. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Charlestown, the British troops received the support of the fleet and took a more reliable position.  Then there was another major battle at Bunker.  It was an attempt by the British to return Boston, but they failed. </p><p>  Meanwhile, a continental army was created, led by George Washington.  Thanks to his successful command, the British left the area in the Boston area and retreated. </p><p>  On July 4, 1776, a declaration was adopted that provided for the separation of 13 colonies from Great Britain.  But the war for independence and US education is not over yet.  The British government did not want to give up their positions and lose the territories of North America. </p><p>  Continental troops crossed the Canadian border in the province of Quebec.  They wanted to attract the country's population to their side.  However, the rebels did not find support there - Canadians were afraid to fall under the influence of their neighbor. </p><p>  In 1776, a battle took place in the New York area.  British forces drove the rebels out of the city.  However, Washington organized a surprise attack and defeated the British, having at its disposal 10 times fewer soldiers. </p><p>  For the next two years, the adversaries took no serious action and kept their distance from each other.  In 1778, France joined the rebel army to regain part of Canada.  This allowed the continental forces to strengthen their positions. </p><p>  From 1880 to 1882, the most important battles took place.  The war of independence in the United States was coming to an end.  The rebel forces won several important victories.  The French government ceased hostilities and withdrew its army.  Bloody war ended. </p><p>  In 1782, an agreement was signed between the United States and England on the recognition of the independence of the colonies.  A year later, it was confirmed by an agreement between France and England.  As a result, the American colonies became independent, and part of Canada remained under the influence of the British. </p><p>  At the end of 1783, there were no British troops left in the United States.  The US War of Independence began a new stage in the development of this country. </p>
