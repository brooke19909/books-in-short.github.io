And no wonder!  Pompons, due to their ease of manufacture and unsurpassed decorative properties, never go out of style.  They decorate not only clothes for children - this is a classic, but also adult things, handbags, accessories and even the interior.  From a large number of such fluffy balls, mats, scarves, toys and furniture covers are created. </p><p>  There are several <span>ways to make</span> pompons.  I will tell about each of them. </p><p>  <strong>How to make a pompom using cardboard circles (the most famous way)</strong> </p><p>  Prepare 2 cardboard circles of the diameter you want to receive the product, plus 1 cm. Cut a hole in the middle of the circles.  If you make it larger, the pompom will be thicker and more fluffy, if smaller, it will be softer.  When it comes to an impressive amount, then perhaps the second option is better, because  it uses less yarn. </p><p>  Combine the 2 obtained blanks with each other, thread the end of the thread into the needle with a large eye and begin to evenly wrap the rings with yarn.  In principle, there is not much difference in which order to lay the rows of wool on the cardboard - clockwise or counterclockwise, or in general as necessary.  The pompom will work out anyway.  But if you combine several colors during its manufacture, it‚Äôs better to still put stitches in a row so that the color border is more clearly expressed. </p><p>  If the thread ends, cut its end from the needle and continue with a new one.  No nodules are needed, all areas will be fixed at the same time at the end of work. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the needle ceases to fit in the ring, complete the winding.  Take scissors with sharp tips and cut through all the layers of wool at the same time.  For convenience, gradually move the workpieces a little along the way.  After that, disconnect the inside of the rings to gain access to the center of the future pompom.  With a piece of the same thread that was used in the work, wrap it tightly and tightly and tie it to several knots.  All cardboard can be removed.  If it does not work out, cut them, for the new product, prepare one more.  Fluff the ball with your fingers and cut to a smooth sphere.  Do not cut the long thread coming from the center - it is useful for attaching work somewhere. </p><p>  <strong>How to make a pompom using a special device</strong> </p><p>  A strange-looking device, similar to the letter ‚ÄúH‚Äù under the name ‚Äúdevice for making pompons,‚Äù is being sold in hardware stores.  It is most often made of plastic and has 2 sides - larger and smaller, depending on the size of future balls. </p><p>  To work with such a thing is very simple: select the size, then put a piece of thread (to fix the middle) inside (to the middle bar) and start wrapping half of the device with wool.  When it seems that there are enough threads for the volume, circle the fixing segment several times around the winder and tie it with a knot.  Then remove the semi-finished product from the device, cut one and the second loop and get a full pompom. </p><p>  Doing this is even easier than telling, so once you try, you can easily repeat this procedure as many times as you want. </p><p>  <strong>How to make a pompom easy</strong> </p><p>  If there are no devices at hand, but the desire for simplicity is, try to make a semblance of such a gadget yourself.  It‚Äôs not difficult at all!  It is enough to cut a couple of wide strips of cardboard with a length of 15-20 cm and a width equal to the diameter of future balls, and then cut them in the middle along, but not to the end, but about 1.5-2 widths. </p><p>  Then, with this blank, do the same manipulations as described in the previous paragraph: place the fixing thread in the slot and wrap the cardboard with wool.  Then tie the workpiece and cut along the edges.  That's all! </p><p>  Often, craftswomen argue how to make a pompom easier and more beautiful, opinions are different, but the essence is the same: if you need products that will often be washed or cleaned, it is better to use the classical method - such pompons hold their shape tighter, after washing it is enough to shake them - and they like new.  For interior decorations and adult accessories, 2 and 3 options are suitable, as they are more economical in terms of using the material. </p><p>  Now you have a choice in which way to make a pompom to decorate the baby's hats or for larger projects.  In any case, funny puzzles will not leave anyone indifferent, especially if they are made with love. </p>
