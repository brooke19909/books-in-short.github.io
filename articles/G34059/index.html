    <p>  In general, it has long been customary to conditionally divide the city of Sousse into two zones, the first of which is a port town with many amazing architectural monuments, and the second is a resort area called Port El Kantaoui, intended for receiving vacationers.  The last geographical point is 10 kilometers north of Sousse itself.  The port has an artificially created harbor, which connects to the luxurious embankment square. </p><p>  As for tourist accommodation and a calm, measured rest, in Sousse there is a huge number of various hotel complexes for every taste and budget.  On the territory of the city built hotels of any star rating, starting from 3.  There are also luxury hotels, which provide an opportunity to relax just a few steps from the sea.  Russian tourists love to come to this resort.  This is evidenced by numerous reviews of hotels in Tunisia.  Jinene 3 *, according to vacationers, is considered one of the best hotels in its category. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is not necessary to talk about the infrastructure of the city of Sousse from a negative point of view, because there is everything that a beginner or an experienced traveler can only imagine.  Within walking distance from the hotel are all kinds of cafes, bars, restaurants, water parks, dolphinariums, clubs and other entertainment venues. </p><p>  There are spacious golf courses, equipped with everything necessary for exciting battles, and numerous centers of thalassotherapy sessions, and much, much more. </p><p>  Due to the huge number of nightclubs located in the resort areas of the city, reckless young people who want to have a good dinner go here with pleasure.  However, the relatively close location of the city from airports and other transport stops makes the resort popular among couples and among people who have reached retirement age. </p><p>  Among other things, amazing sandy beaches are recognized as a real visiting card of the resort, the service at which corresponds to the level of quality accepted in Europe.  The nearest beach to the hotel Jinene Beach 3 * (Tunisia) is no exception. </p>

    <p>  The size of the hotel is average, inside there are only 223 rooms.  There are rooms for smoking clients and for those who do not suffer from this addiction.  From the service in the rooms, a regular change of bed linen is provided (2-3 times in 7 days), as well as daily thorough cleaning with a wet method. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Each room has a toilet room with a bath or shower, toilet, sink, towels and all necessary accessories.  Some rooms have a loggia or balcony.  All apartments have satellite TV and internet.  A mini bar is available for a fee.  There is air conditioning and a card phone. </p><p>  The best criterion for evaluating the hotel Jinene 3 * (Tunisia) - traveler reviews. </p><h2>  Guest comments on accommodation </h2><p>  Check-in at the hotel is very fast at any time of the day or night.  If you don‚Äôt reserve a place in advance, you can get an option with a view of the construction site or the road.  For 15 euros, if you wish, you can be moved to a room with a sea view.  It‚Äôs better not to save on this, as in apartments with windows overlooking the construction site, it is almost impossible to sleep due to loud noise.  Surprisingly, if you complain about such inconvenience to the administration, they will easily transfer you to a quieter room at no extra charge.  There are no ideal rooms in the hotel, everything is relative. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2>

    <p>  In three-star hotels it is not always possible to meet a huge variety of dishes.  Hotel Jinene 3 * (Tunisia, Sousse) is no exception.  But the food here is very tasty.  From the dishes, fruit assortment is daily offered (melon, apples, watermelon, grapes, peaches, oranges, plums, pears).  They are quickly dismantled, so it is better to arrive early.  Ice cream is served in the evenings.  Fried foods can cause heartburn. </p><p>  When you first visit the restaurant you need to present a food card, which is issued at the reception upon check-in.  They will fix a table for you. </p><p>  The most fastidious tourists leave reviews about the Jinene 3 * hotel bars (Tunisia) not the most flattering. </p><h2>  Bar Service </h2><p>  Unfortunately, local bars are not the best place to stay.  The waiters here are not very welcoming and may even require a tip.  Dishes do not wash well, odors can be found in drinks.  Advice from experienced guests: be careful with dairy products.  To prevent milk from clotting, not very pleasant additives can be added to it, but no one will tell you the truth. </p><p>  In the bar you can take only water.  Each guest is given one bottle daily.  Then you can draw water in the cooler. </p><p>  Bar on the beach and in the night club is paid.  Local drinks are not of very good quality, but on vacation it is not felt much. </p>

    <h2>  About staff </h2><p>  The hotel staff, according to guest reviews, is friendly and friendly.  Everyone is smiling and doing their job efficiently.  Rooms are cleaned daily.  You can not worry about your things, no one steals. </p><p>  Tipping is in love here.  Therefore, to improve the quality of service, it is better to leave them periodically. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The beach is a three-minute walk from Hotel Jinene Spa 3 * (Tunisia).  The coastal zone is small, but there is always enough space.  Air mattresses can be rented for just 1 dinar.  <span>Beach towels are</span> best brought from home. </p><p>  Numerous annoying sellers walk along the beach, offering various small goods.  But if you ignore them, they quickly leave. </p><p>  The sea is just wonderful.  There are a lot of jellyfish in the summer, so it‚Äôs better to choose a different time for a trip or be content with swimming in the pool. </p><p>  Unfortunately, there are no changing rooms on the beach. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  As a rule, vacationers do not like to spend free time at the hotel.  Especially if they came to Tunisia.  Hotel Jinene 3 *, however, offers its guests all kinds of entertainment.  The complex has two good animators.  During the day, you can attend water aerobics classes, play darts, table tennis or mini-golf.  Every evening, at 9 o‚Äôclock, dances are arranged for children, then they hold very interesting shows for adults with famous artists.  Hotel guests can even participate in contests and receive prizes.  After that - an incendiary disco until one in the morning. </p><p>  Animators are constantly invited to night clubs.  The most worthy is the ‚ÄúMetalica Platinum‚Äù.  For hotel guests admission is free and you can count on a table. </p><p>  Girls should be careful, it‚Äôs better not to go to clubs alone.  Arabs really like Russian ladies, and by hook or by crook they try to draw attention to themselves, and sometimes they do it.  But such resort novels do not last long, so you should not take to heart the courtship of local young people. </p><h2>  Hotel contingent </h2><p>  The main public of the hotel is Europeans.  Here you can meet young people, and senior citizens, and families with children.  Students here really like to relax.  For the younger generation, the hotel is ideal.  They are not picky about rooms and food, and there is enough entertainment here.  If you travel in a big company, it will be a lot of fun. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Experienced travelers like to emphasize the negative aspects, which are not many in the Jinene 3 * hotel. </p><ol><li>  In appearance, the hotel is very modest and definitely needs renovation.  The furniture located on the floors is old.  The walls are ragged in some places.  In the corners you can find spiders.  On the lower floors there is a smell of sewage. </li><li>  The staff cleans the hotel during the day, which can cause inconvenience to visitors.  Floors are wet and slippery.  Sometimes even water drips from the stairs directly to the guests on their heads.  It is important for staff to do their work, and at what cost - this is a secondary issue. </li><li>  There are power outages, so it‚Äôs better to walk to the upper floors, otherwise you can get stuck in the elevator for a long time. </li><li>  In the evenings it is better to walk with a flashlight, again due to problems with electricity.  There are no windows on the floors. </li><li>  The rooms are better to choose on the upper floors.  They offer a good view, and the smell of sewage is not so audible. </li></ol><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  There are many shops near the hotel, but for large purchases it is better to go to Medina.  At the local bazaar, you can purchase goods at reduced prices, much cheaper than at a hotel.  Here you can even bargain and get a 50% discount.  For souvenirs, you can safely go to the trading shops located near the hotel.  Everything is relatively cheap.  There is a Monoprix shop across the road from the hotel, where you can buy anything at good prices.  The roads in Tunisia are very dangerous.  You need to proceed carefully, the Arabs are extremely inattentive while driving.  With taxi drivers also need to bargain.  For their services, each of them depresses its value. </p>

    <p>  Fans of a hookah should contact the hotel bartender.  Outside the complex, it is better not to purchase anything.  You can get a completely different product that was expected. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2><p>  Hotel Jinene Beach 3 * (Tunisia) deserves its category.  You should not expect luxury from him, but it is quite possible to rest comfortably.  This is a good budget place for picky tourists who prefer to relax in large companies.  Surprisingly, it is fun and cozy. </p><p>  The food is commendable.  Despite the small variety of dishes, all dishes are very tasty and satisfying.  You do not even need to visit any additional restaurants. </p><p>  Leisure can be spent by the pool or on the beach.  During the rain, a rainbow hangs over the coast.  When you observe this beauty, the mood immediately rises. </p><p>  The hotel staff tries to monitor the cleanliness of the room and rooms.  Guests can refuse cleaning services by hanging the Do Not Disturb sign on the door.  Attendants love to tip, then they become more friendly. </p><p>  There are very few Russians in the hotel, mostly Poles and French have a rest here.  Europeans are quite cultured people, therefore, in a hotel there is almost always order and silence. </p><p>  I am glad that there are no insects in the rooms.  Cats live near the pool, but they do not bother anyone, sometimes they even catch mice. </p><p>  In general, the hotel is good for youth recreation.  The sea, sun and pleasant doing nothing are provided to you.  Tunisia is an amazing country.  Those who don‚Äôt like to spend time inside the hotel can go sightseeing.
