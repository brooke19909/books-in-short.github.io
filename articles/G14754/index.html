    <p>  The hotel has several pools.  The largest of them is filled with fresh water, but the indoor pool with thermal water is intended exclusively for medicinal purposes.  In winter, tourists can use a heated artificial pond. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Rest for children </h2><p>  The staff of Odyssee Resort 4 * (Tunisia) takes care of the leisure of children.  They have their own swimming pool, as well as a team of animators with entertaining activities for different ages. </p><h2>  Sport and animation </h2><p>  In Odyssee Resort Thalasso 4 * there is a large team of animators (ten people).  Entertainment events and programs are held in Italian, French, English and German. </p><p>  Every day, tourists can participate in sporting events, do aerobics, windsurfing, archery, play mini-golf, tennis and table tennis, and kayak. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  As we already said, Hotel Odyssee Resort 4 * is located in the town of Zarzis.  It is the least known among other Tunisian resorts to Russian tourists.  Zarzis cuisine is considered one of the best in the country.  The city is located in the southeast of the country.  It is a port of the Mediterranean.  Tourist trips to these places have become less popular nowadays due to the proximity of Libya. </p><p>  Zarzis boasts a long history; references to it date back to the period of the Roman Empire.  In those days, it was already incredibly popular because of its advantageous location.  Trade was actively developing here, the city was a rather large port of Tunisia. </p>

    <p>  However, from those times and past glories there were not even traces left.  Now Zarzis is a small seaside town.  Its local residents live due to the fact that they grow olives, and then they make oil from them.  As for hotels, here you will not find fashionable complexes.  All hotels are 3-4 star.  Local beaches are always half empty, you will not see crowds of tourists on them, it is comfortable and calm to relax in these places. </p><p>  Due to the fact that Zarzis is the southern region of Tunisia, it is also the warmest.  In autumn, hot weather lasts much longer.  Due to the fact that the desert is located very close, there is almost no rain in the city even in winter. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Relaxing in the Odyssee Resort 4 * <span>(Tunisia, Djerba,</span> Zarzis), you can briefly distract from the beautiful sea and devote time to excursions to local attractions.  The town of Zarzis itself is very ordinary, and there is nothing interesting in it.  However, those who first came to Tunisia, it will probably be interesting to walk along its streets and see the life of local residents. </p><p>  In the town you can admire the Jewish synagogue, a mosque with minarets, a city museum. </p><p>  If you have long wanted to visit the desert, then Zarzis is an ideal place for this.  Local travel agencies vying offer guests interesting tours: </p><ul><li>  Jeep and ATV riding in the desert. </li><li>  Inspection of the settlements of the Barbary nomads.  Vacationers can see how such people live, try their dishes. </li><li>  Sightseeing trips to the Sahara (it is supposed to spend the night in the open air and exciting camel riding). </li><li>  Matmata is an exotic troglodyte house. </li><li>  "Country of Ksars" - ancient landscapes. </li><li>  Gabes is a small coastal town famous for the spice market. </li><li>  Paintball club. </li><li>  Thalassotherapy. </li><li>  On Djerba you can see the sights and visit entertainment venues. </li></ul><h2>  Odyssee Resort 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the complex, I want to discuss the reviews of guests who visited it. </p><p>  It should be noted that the hotel is an ideal place for a quiet, relaxing holiday.  If you plan to relax away from the bustle of the city, enjoy the sea and bask in the sun, then Odyssee Resort 4 * will definitely suit you.  Tours offered by agencies attract with reasonable prices and good conditions.  But supporters of noisy parties until the morning should look for a different place.  The main contingent of hotel guests is families with children or European pensioners.  In general, the hotel public is very calm and pleasant in every way. </p>

    <p>  The food in the hotel is very high quality and varied.  The main restaurant is spacious, so crowds and queues never occur in it.  The cook tries to cook a variety of dishes even in Ramadan.  Serving tourists, the waiters are fast.  The main restaurant uses an all-inclusive system.  A large assortment of buffets is worthy of attention: beef, lamb, turkey, rice, seafood (tuna, shrimp), pasta, potatoes, cream soups, couscous, lasagna, vegetables.  And desserts performed by a local chef deserve special attention.  There are just an amazing amount of them.  You should definitely try them all, even if you don‚Äôt like sweets. </p><p>  For breakfast, tourists are served delicious omelettes, croissants, sausages, cheeses, crepes, natural yoghurts, cereals, jam.  A delicious pizza is prepared near the pool.  In the bar you can find cookies and all kinds of snacks after dinner.  So it‚Äôs simply impossible to stay hungry here. </p><p>  The beach is sandy.  A pantone is built on the shore, which goes into the sea, on it you can go down into the water.  The local coast is shallow, which adults complain, but the children here are completely expanse.  Algae often appears in the water, the staff tries to remove it, however, they are not removed from the shore, this is prohibited by local laws (algae protect sand from erosion).  In these places, relaxing with children is just fine.  One of the advantages is the cleanliness of the coast, a sufficient number of umbrellas and sunbeds. </p>

The staff is attentive, pleasant and polite, always trying to help, without bringing to conflict situations. </p><p>  The hotel has three pools, including one for children.  Guests note that they are all clean.  Thermal is especially good.  However, it should be remembered that you can‚Äôt sit in it for a long time (the therapeutic effect is achieved within fifteen minutes). </p><p>  Tourists emphasize that the complex as a whole is very good and stands out among other hotels on the coast of Arzis.  There is a reason for this - a beautiful green area.  There are many diverse flowers, plants, palm trees.  In the evening, when the heat subsides, it is pleasant to walk along the park paths and enjoy the exotic beauty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="odyssee resort thalasso 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1489820.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Experienced tourists are advised not to limit the rest only to the sea, but certainly pay attention to sightseeing trips.  A very interesting entertainment is the desert safari.  All vacationers highly recommend it.  No less interesting will be a trip to the island of Djerba, where there are many attractions for tourists. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Hotel Odyssee Resort 4 * - a good four-star complex for families.  It can definitely be recommended to tourists with young children who are looking for peace and quiet.  Life in the hotel is slow and measured, which allows you to fully enjoy your vacation. </p>
