It is covered with tropical evergreen forests in which rare species of trees and plants grow.  Its deserted shores with golden and white sands, as well as mangroves bordering the bright lights of nightclubs and noisy parties in local casinos.  The underwater world is breathtaking, and coral reefs reveal the diversity of ocean life. </p><p>  French charm blended with a touch of local indigenous traditions and Melanesian culture.  Incredible views of waterfalls, relict trees and limestone caves will definitely leave a huge positive imprint on an unforgettable vacation.  The closed lagoon of the main island with the border in the form of a coral reef, which is not inferior in size to the Great Barrier Reef, extends for many kilometers of the purest water areas. </p><h2>  Briefly about the country </h2><p>  New Caledonia is the island of the same name among the waters of the Pacific Ocean, surrounded by small islands in the Melanesian part.  It is a special administrative unit of France.  Its borders lie along the Australian economic zone from the southwest, in the southeast meet with Fiji, and in the north - from Vanuatu.  Since this is a French ‚Äúcolony‚Äù, banknotes here are presented in the form of the French Pacific franc.  The population of the country totals only 245 thousand people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.traveltourismblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monumental waterfall" class="if uuid-2285421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2285421.jpg"></div><p>  The largest island formation is the Grand Ter, its relief is mountainous, and the coast is all rugged with cliffs.  Numerous cozy secret bays hide the beauty of coral reefs, which are part of the coral ridge.  The island has a large number of rivers and reservoirs, and the red soil is very fertile.  Very valuable tree species, including araucaria, grow in local forests, which occupy fifteen percent of the entire island.  It is he who is depicted on the coat of arms of New Caledonia.  A huge number of geckos can be distinguished from the animal world; on the other brothers of our smaller lands, the islands are very poor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 2018, the second referendum on the separation and acquisition of the status of an independent country is expected.  In the meantime, the French High Commissioner, who is appointed by the President of France, monitors state life. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The island was discovered by the famous traveler and navigator James Cook in 1774, and named it in the image of the name of his native country of Scotland - Caledonia, which is what it was called in ancient times.  The history of the settlement of the island dates back 3,500 years ago.  According to the study of historians, it began in the 13th century BC.  At the beginning of the 20th century, archaeologists discovered the remains of ceramic products in the territories of New Caledonia.  In 1853, the French authorities established expansion over the island and, a decade later, sent a ship there with convicted criminals.  The French began to cultivate coffee plantations and process coconut palms, and in the 19th century, the extraction of gold, lead, chromium and other minerals began. </p><p>  After gaining the status of overseas territory, local Aborigines - Melanesians - began to organize strikes and organize riots in honor of the declaration of independence of their country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newcaledonia.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paradise Bungalow" class="if uuid-2285419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2285419.jpg"></div><p>  The ethnic composition is also dominated by the Melanesians (Kanaks), the French are a little behind them in quantitative composition.  Also, the island is constantly inhabited by Polynesians, Indonesians and other nationalities.  Basically, the population of New Caledonia professes Christianity (Catholic and Protestant), there are Muslims, Sunnis, but, along with these religions, Aborigines continue the traditions of local beliefs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to the French language, thirty-three Melanesian and Polynesian dialects are common. </p><h2>  Culture </h2><p>  In comparison with other countries of the Melanesian region, a culture of European character prevails in New Caledonia, rather than the traditions of Aboriginal people.  Even Aboriginal village settlements have become Europeanized areas, although their appearance is preserved in an archaic style.  Those authentic round houses, covered with palm leaves instead of the roof, can only be found in very remote places. </p><p>  Sometimes the leaders of the tribes can still build such a home for themselves, but now the clothes and interior decoration are already keeping up with the times.  In preparing food, the New Caledonians also use a European recipe, sometimes mixing with their traditional one. </p><h2>  Island paradise </h2><p>  Holidays in New Caledonia begin with its capital, Noumea, which is a real city of fashion and entertainment.  Here you can find cool boutiques with casinos and beautiful gardens with sandy beaches.  Near the main island, which was mentioned above, there is an archipelago called Luaite and the famous Ile de Pen (or pine island).  The latter is a real dream for a perfect vacation: it is surrounded by white fine sand and incredibly clear water.  This is a real refuge from the bustle, and you can get to it in just fifteen minutes of a flight from Grand Ter. </p><p>  Shops, hotels, restaurants and cafes accept Australian and <span>New Zealand dollars.</span>  You can exchange currency at the airport and at banks.  Some banks charge a commission fee of five dollars for each cash withdrawal operation; the commission does not apply to the euro.  Bank plastic cards are accepted in all city institutions, but when leaving the city, you will have to pay mainly in cash.  For one week through an ATM there is an opportunity to withdraw no more than 350 dollars.  The Master and Diners Club cards are a bit limited in use, but tourists will not have problems with Visa and American Express.  It is possible to cash <span>traveller's checks</span> at banks or hotels with at least four stars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The capital of New Caledonia" class="if uuid-2285435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2285435.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, having bought a tour to New Caledonia, everyone wants to take a piece of their vacation as a keepsake.  Therefore, the list of the most popular souvenirs on the first lines will be amulets of local aborigines (kanaks) and jade jewelry.  All this can be purchased in the markets.  But since in European countries there is no particular habit of bargaining, here there is the same principle - the purchase is made at the price announced by the seller.  Moreover, if a tourist begins to bargain, then the locals will perceive this as a manifestation of disrespect and, at a minimum, refuse to cooperate with him. </p><p>  Before acquiring a tour to New Caledonia, you need to think about how much a person can tolerate a hot climate, because the sun here is much closer to the earth and the radiation is very powerful.  It is dangerous to be outdoors in the daytime - from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.  Every day it is necessary to use sunscreen and be sure to wear hats, glasses that protect against ultraviolet radiation, and drink as much liquid as possible (preferably fresh water). </p><p>  Bathing rules are best followed since all beaches are mainly part of the ocean coast.  Frequent ebbs and flows occur, and there is also a coastal current that can behave very unpredictably.  Tour operators and guides recommend swimming in the lagoons.  Do not forget about marine life.  Inside the coral lagoons, representatives of the water part of the planet, of course, are rarely found, but in the remaining parts of the coastal zone you may not accidentally notice a sea urchin or even a shark. </p><p>  Diving enthusiasts will definitely appreciate the deep-sea reef paradise.  Diving must be carried out with an experienced instructor in the escort who knows the characteristic features of the surrounding waters, as large depths and complex currents around the islands can be an unexpected trap. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chabilmarvillas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Diving" class="if uuid-2285431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2285431.jpg"></div><p>  With traffic on the roads, everything is easier here: more than five thousand kilometers of good roadway stretches in different directions, you will have to pay for a quarter of them.  The rules of the road are identical to French.  The traffic here is average, and there is practically no traffic congestion, because the capital of the state is the largest settlement. </p><h2>  Cuisine of New Caledonia </h2><p>  An important moment.  When buying a ticket to New Caledonia, you must understand that all the traditions of cooking come from French cuisine.  The main component of the whole island diet is, of course, seafood: shrimp, oysters, spiny lobsters, salads of local Aboriginal people from ocean fish in lime juice.  In addition, bananas, coconuts, and sweet potato are widely used.  Of the alcoholic drinks, New Caledonians prefer wines, and of non-alcoholic ones - freshly squeezed juices of various exotic fruits and coffee, the same that the French brought here.  On the territory of the country there are more than two hundred restaurants with excellent European-class service and delicious dishes from cooks. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  The climate of New Caledonia is estimated as tropical trade wind.  The air here is humid and hot, the air temperature during the year remains virtually unchanged and averages 23 to 30 degrees Celsius above zero.  Rains begin in November and continue until March, when cyclones pass over the islands.  New Caledonia is characterized by the appearance of tropical hurricanes, in the fall the prevailing season is the trade winds - that is, clear skies, but very windy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Games on the beach" class="if uuid-2285420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2285420.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Since there is no direct flight connection between Russia and the islands, the flight from Moscow to New Caledonia can be carried out in the following ways: </p><ul><li>  Across French lands using Air Austral Airlines. </li><li>  Across Australia with Qantas and Aircalin. </li><li>  Through New Zealand, which, however, will also have to fly in transit, with the airlines Air New Zealand and Aircalin. </li><li>  Across the lands of Vanuatu, using the services of Air Vanuatu. </li><li>  Via Fiji, South Korea or Japan by choosing Aircalin. </li></ul><h2>  What you can see while relaxing </h2><p>  Sightseeing in New Caledonia is best to start with the capital.  After all, she is the clearest example of the merging of cultures.  Noumea has a special charm of the French province, although it is almost the only normal and real proud on these lands.  The city center is notable for its green area and a large cultural center of local peoples.  The sleeping areas are filled with ancient buildings of the colonial era.  Several tens of square kilometers included: a library, a museum, a zoo, a huge area with an aquarium and tropical fish, Neuville, where you can see ancient precolonial ruins, a large number of yacht clubs and much more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.noumeadiscovery.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fort Teremba" class="if uuid-2285423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2285423.jpg"></div><p>  Around the capital there are mangroves that encircled sandy beaches with developed tourist infrastructure.  Judging by the reviews, you should definitely visit <span>the</span> Rusa <span>deer farm</span> , where animals live in conditions close to their real habitat.  The wineries hiding in the Amyu Pass Valley are no less interesting.  For local folklore it is better to go to the vicinity of the city of Jengen, where the "Black Rocks" with the cultural center of Bvarhat are located.  Every week, events are held there aimed at reviving the traditional culture of the local people. </p><p>  According to tourists, New Caledonia has its own picturesque old fort of Teremba near La Foa, which must be included in the must visit list, and it is also worth walking through the market without a roof - Farino.  Tourists also report on the beautiful Paserel de Marguerite bridge, which was designed by the engineers of the design office of Eiffel himself. </p><h2>  We go deep from civilization </h2><p>  Not far from the city of Burai is a natural turtle paradise.  This place is located quite far from the capital, 150 kilometers.  Therefore, here you can observe the pristine nature and representatives of ancient armored animals.  The northern part of the island is more authentic, here you can enjoy the views of the savannah and mountain landscapes.  Rocky capes, thermal springs, waterfalls of unique beauty and tropical vegetation will not leave indifferent any traveler. </p><p>  Here you can see whole coconut groves and see how real coffee is grown.  Moreover, in this part, nickel is mined, which is the main export commodity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wallpaperstudio10.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Black Rocks" class="if uuid-2285424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2285424.jpg"></div><p>  Separately, you need to consider the island of Pen.  This is a closed VIP class resort.  It is very expensive and is covered with unique trees - Norfolk pines.  It preserved the original natural beauty with sand, whiter than snow, and the life of local Aboriginal people - Kanaks who have been living on this earth for hundreds of years. </p><p>  Loyalty Island looks like coral atolls, they are like precious stones in a ring, framed by a picturesque picture of flora and fauna.  There are a couple of tourist villages where you can order a diving service, rent a yacht and calmly relax from all the worldly bustle, following several memorable contrasting routes. </p>
