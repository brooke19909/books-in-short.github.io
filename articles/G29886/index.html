In addition, it is promising, despite the large number of already created inventions.  But before you act, you need to understand what electrical engineering is with the basics of electronics.  We will consider them using the example of the devices used. </p><h2>  AC operation </h2><p>  An engine will be considered as an example.  Electrical engineering and the basics of electronics in this case are based on two main parts: fixed and expressed.  The first is understood as an inductor, and the second is an anchor with a drum winding.  Important in this case is the presence of a number of conditions.  So, the inductor must have a cylindrical shape and be made of a ferromagnetic alloy.  We also need poles with an excitation winding, which are fixed on the bed.  The winding creates the main magnetic flux.  Learning to calculate the necessary values ‚Äã‚Äãwill help the problem book on general electrical engineering with the basics of electronics.  In addition to this method, the magnetic flux can be created by permanent magnets, which are mounted on a bed.  An anchor means a core, a winding and a collector.  The first is assembled from insulated sheets of electrical steel. </p><h2>  Analog devices </h2>

The main feature of analog devices is the continuous change in the received signal in accordance with the described physical process.  Mathematically, it can be expressed as a continuous function, where there is an unlimited number of values ‚Äã‚Äãat different points in time.  In this case, we can give an example: the air temperature changes, and the <span>analog signal is</span> transformed accordingly <span>.</span>  Which is expressed as a voltage drop (although there are many other ways to indicate this, for example, a pendulum changing its position).  Analog devices are simple, reliable and fast.  This ensures their widespread use.  True, to say that they can boast of special signal processing accuracy is impossible.  Also, analog devices do not have high noise immunity.  They strongly depend on various external factors (physical aging, temperature, external fields).  They are also often charged with signal distortion and low efficiency. </p><h2>  Digital devices </h2>

    <p>  They are aimed at working with discrete signals.  As a rule, it consists of a certain sequence of impulses, which can take only two values ‚Äã‚Äã- ‚Äútrue‚Äù or ‚Äúfalse‚Äù.  Everyone who knows the basics of electronics also knows that they can be implemented on different element bases.  So, a person has the opportunity to choose among transistors, optoelectronic elements, <span>electromagnetic relays,</span> microcircuits.  That is, diversity is present, and it is quite extensive.  As a rule, circuits are assembled from logic elements.  For communication, triggers and counters are used (but not always).  Something similar can be seen in robotics, automation systems, measuring instruments, radio and telecommunications.  An important advantage of digital devices is their resistance to interference, ease of processing and recording data.  They can also transmit information with such small distortion that they can be ignored.  Therefore, digital devices are considered more preferable than analog ones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Semiconductors </h2>

    <p>  Due to their diversity and properties, they have become an independent field of electronics.  The foundations of this were laid a very long time ago, when crystalline detectors began to be used.  They were semiconductor rectifiers designed for high-frequency currents.  Originally used devices based on copper oxide or selenium.  True, as it turned out, they are much less suitable for work than those devices that are made on the basis of silicon. </p><p>  OV V. Losev, an employee of the Nizhny Novgorod radio laboratory, who even back in 1922 created a device where received signals significantly improved due to the generation of natural oscillations, was the first to succeed in this area.  But these developments, alas, did not receive proper development.  And now the semiconductor triodes are used in the world (they are also transistors), which were jointly developed by Brattain, Shockley and Bardin, and modern electronics are now built on them.  The basics of working with them, although complex, are necessary for anyone who wants to learn and practice in this area. </p><h2>  Microelectronics </h2><p>  In its own way, it is the quintessence of electronics, where informational properties reach maximum values.  Here, the density of data flows per unit weight is much higher than that in other parts of this science.  But the task of microelectronics is information processing.  In this case, only two digits are used: a logical unit and zero.  But practical work in this area is very difficult - because it requires a number of conditions that are difficult (almost impossible) to provide at home.  Among them, perfect cleanliness, high accuracy and the use of sophisticated technology. </p><h2>  Mathematical justification </h2>

    <p>  For technology, the algebra of logic is used.  It was invented by <span>George Bull.</span>  Therefore, it is also sometimes called Boolean algebra.  For practical purposes, it was first used by the American scientist Claude Shannon in 1938, when electrical circuits with contact switches were studied.  When using <span>Boolean algebra</span> (also called logic), then all the statements considered can have only two meanings: ‚Äútrue‚Äù or ‚Äúfalse‚Äù.  Alone, they are not complicated.  But simple statements can form multicomponent due to the union with the help of logical operations.  If they are also denoted by something (for example, letters), then using the <span>laws of the algebra of logic,</span> you can describe any, even the most complex digital circuits. </p><p>  Of course, in order to know the basics of electronics, one does not need to delve into the nuances of theory.  A fairly primitive understanding of this direction.  So, consider the following example.  We have an LED, a switch and a power source.  When the light element is on, we say "truth."  The LED is not active - it means ‚Äúfalse‚Äù.  It is from the construction of a large number of such solutions that computers consist. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  General electrical engineering with the basics of electronics will help to understand the processes taking place in this area.  Also, knowledge about the safe technical operation of devices will not be superfluous.  It is necessary to work in a place specially prepared for this activity.  You should also take care to exclude the possibility of electric shock.  To do this, you can use rubber gloves (when working with bare wires) and other protective equipment.  Useful in practice will be the use of a respirator or similar device when soldering. </p>
