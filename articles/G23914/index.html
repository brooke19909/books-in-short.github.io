    <p>  The company presented in this article is the largest producer of high-quality telecommunication equipment.  Phone ZTE in quality performance is very different from the artisanal counterparts of expensive smartphones.  Many are frightened by the low price of these devices, but this does not affect the quality in any way.  By filling, you can compare them with budget models from leading manufacturers.  However, you do not need to overpay for a big name.  Components for assembly are also purchased at Chinese firms, but their production is factory-made, and the quality is quite high. </p><h2>  Budget models of smartphones from ZTE </h2>

A typical ZTE phone is a candy bar with a virtual keyboard.  There are a lot of positive reviews about this brand in the network - both about more expensive gadgets and the most affordable ones.  They last a long time, have good performance and are equipped with powerful cameras.  At the same time, the first model belongs to the budget category, and the line of Grand models to the premium class. </p><h2>  Indicators </h2>

If we talk about the parameters, then it is worth considering them on the basis of one of the most popular and typical models.  We chose the ZTE V815W phone for this.  It has a light weight, 4-inch screen and a 5 megapixel camera.

    <p>  The smartphone comes with an original proprietary 1400 MAH battery.  Its advantage is that these batteries take charge very quickly.  Even those models that have a low capacity, hold it for a long time.  For example, for the <span>ZTE V815W</span> (smartphone phone), the instructions for use indicate that with active use, its charge will last for 36 hours.  At the same time, you can use the capabilities of the Internet and work in applications. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another advantage of gadgets from ZTE is the camera.  Despite the modest declared characteristics, the pictures are colorful and clear.  Perhaps they are not as good as those made on more expensive models, but for quick photos, which can then be posted on social networks, this is quite enough. </p><h2>  Mobile phone ZTE Grand </h2>

We will provide a description of another typical representative of gadgets from ZTE, but now premium.  For this, we chose the Grand Era V985 model.  Its parameters are higher than the already described V815W.  At a cost it is higher than the budget counterpart, but there is a simple explanation for this - it has a more powerful processor, as well as fairly high other indicators.  Thanks to this, he can perform several tasks at once, and also think fast enough.

    <p>  ZTE V815W <span>(a smartphone phone, instructions for use</span> which indicates that it has only 512 MB of RAM) is quite suitable for simple games, lightweight applications and making calls.  If you want more, then you should look at the Grand family, as in this regard they justify their name.  Era already has one gigabyte of memory, which allows you to run quite demanding games on it.  The processor has 4 cores, in contrast to the two above models. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If we talk about the design of both tubes, then the manufacturer tried.  Both phones have a well-designed and concise design.  Despite the fact that one refers to budget models, and the second to the premium segment, there is no special difference in design.  They both look stylish and elegant. </p><p>  <span>The strong point of</span> all models is the speakers, they are powerful and give a very good sound.  Quality does not depend on the price category of the device.  Here the headphones that come with the kit are not worth using, their quality is quite low.  The manufacturer in this case reduced the cost of accessories in favor of the quality of the gadgets themselves. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of budget models from this manufacturer </h2>

In any case, they are offset by an attractive price.  The weak point of the device is the display.  Color rendering leaves much to be desired, since when you change the viewing angle, the shades on the screen change to contrast.  The budget V815W lacks an IPS matrix.  The multi-touch is designed for the touch of just two fingers, but I would like to work more fully.

    <p>  It does not suit users that for installing a SIM card in low-cost models it is necessary to remove the back cover completely.  On the other hand, this can also be attributed to the advantages, since a failed battery is easy to replace on its own.  However, remember that after you remove the battery, you will need to set the phone back to normal operation.  This is easy to do if you have the ZTE V815W phone manual at your fingertips. </p><h2>  Instructions for ZTE phones </h2>

It lists all the main characteristics and adds tips for users: what to do in a given situation.  Often you can find complaints that the instruction is incomplete, and only the main characteristics are listed there.  It depends on the configuration.  Some models are supplied specifically for companies that sell them (for example, for MTS).  There you can find only a short leaflet, not a complete guide.  You can also find schemes that indicate where and which buttons are located on the device.  You can learn the skills of working with the touch screen and the main applications for writing text messages and making calls.

    <h2>  How to get instructions for ZTE smartphone models </h2><p>  If you have not received a detailed guide in the kit, then it can be downloaded from the official website or file hosting.  To do this, just enter the name of your model and the phrase "download instructions."  Choose those sites where you will not be asked to enter a fee or phone number.  If you just took the phone out of the box, carefully inspect the packaging.  When checking in the store, the manual could be shifted so that it was not immediately noticeable in the kit.  To solve simple problems, you can use the information below and do not resort to the instructions. </p><h2>  Parameters </h2><p>  You should know how to set up your ZTE phone.  Setting parameters on any model from this manufacturer is not difficult, since they do not differ from other standard Android functions.  The first time you turn it on, you will need to enter the current time, date and set the language.  The menu that appears immediately after switching on will help you make the necessary settings.  Use the scroll icons to enter data. </p><p>  In order to use the capabilities of the Google Play Market and install the necessary applications, you will need to set up mobile Internet or Wi-Fi.  For the first option, you will need a SIM card that supports access connection (it is best to purchase a card with a special tariff).  The second option is simpler, but you need to have a router at your home leading the distribution of traffic.  You can also connect Wi-Fi in public places where it is allowed to use it for free. </p><p>  Go to the settings, in the "Data Transfer" section.  There you will need to set a checkmark in the paragraph on connecting via a <span>mobile network.</span>  After that, it will be enough for you to activate your Internet connection.  Once it is installed, you can start registering in the application store. </p><p>  For Wi-Fi connection, ZTE phones have standard settings.  Simply start the search and select the desired network by name, enter the password using the virtual keyboard and start using.  If the network is unavailable or it says "connected" on the screen, and the Internet pages do not open, check the settings of the router. </p><h2>  How to unlock ZTE phone </h2>

If you make the shift incorrectly, then later crashes or a complete failure of the device to work may appear. </p><p>  Your phone may also be unavailable if you have forgotten your pattern or PIN.  In this case, it is best to hard reset the phone.  To do this, hold down the power and volume up keys.
