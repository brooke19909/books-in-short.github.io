Not only building plots of 12-36 acres are put up for sale here, but also finished houses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.novostroy.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Village in September 2015" class="if uuid-3035223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13352/3035223.jpg"></div><h2>  Location and conditions </h2><p>  The infrastructure of this microdistrict is already present in the engineering part: there is a central water supply and electric networks, good dirt roads.  Absolutely every site is located in a beautiful pine forest, a kilometer away is the picturesque Okhta River, and seven kilometers away there are no less picturesque lakes - Khepoyarvi and Kavgolovskoye.  However, the inhabitants of the cottage community "Okhtinsky Park" were not far from civilization.  Walking distance is Derby - an equestrian club with an excellent restaurant, a mile and a half - Okhta Park, a famous ski resort with skating rinks, cafes and restaurants.  This will be described in more detail below. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="60.1179612" data-lng="30.45705780000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/4/8/3/13483.png"></div><p>  From the center of St. Petersburg to the cottage village "Okhtinsky Park" is very easy to get, the journey takes about thirty-five minutes.  Ring Road is very close, and therefore the route you can choose the most convenient.  You can make the necessary purchases right on the way to the cottage village "Okhtinsky Park".  There are a lot of hypermarkets on Vyborgskoye Shosse, including Lenta and O'Kay, on Mega Avenue of Engels, where there is literally everything: IKEA, OBI, Auchan and the like.  On the avenue of Culture - "Crossroads" and Real.  No matter what you need on the road, you don‚Äôt have to look for shops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  More on the benefits </h2><p>  This is an ecologically clean area located on the Karelian Isthmus.  There are no industrial enterprises here, and therefore, all nearby beauties are preserved in their original virgin form.  Nevertheless, the history of these lands is very rich, and new residents of the region will not fail to get acquainted with it.  Since ancient times, these forests, lake and river banks have been inhabited, which is found in the territories closest to Enkolovo (Okhtinsky Park - five hundred meters), the sites of the primitive hunters of the Neolithic era - on Lake Chai and also near the Commandant Mountain.  Mentions of these places in the annals are found in the XI century.  Not only Finns and Balts populated the Prievsky territory, there were many Slavs as well. </p><p>  Real estate in the Leningrad region, this cottage village is the most worthy.  Closely located settlements are Kuzmolovsky and Enkolovo (Vsevolozhsky district).  The total area is 150 hectares in the village of Okhtinsky Park, the number of plots is 450, they are all different in size, there are fourteen, and there are almost forty hundred.  All this is being implemented in stages, the construction is divided into seven phases.  In truth, it is difficult to find real estate in the Leningrad region, where a number of advantages will be longer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fazenda.spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Equestrian Club" class="if uuid-3035230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13352/3035230.jpg"></div><h2>  Places for outdoor activities </h2><p>  In the equestrian club, both adults and children are engaged with interest, since there is hardly any activity closer to nature, closer communication with beautiful animals - smart and beautiful.  Experienced trainers work at Derby, so classes are held purely under the supervision of professionals.  Horse riding, one might say, is the "horse" among the advantages of the Okhtinsky Park KP.  This sport does not leave anyone indifferent: it‚Äôs scary to ride yourself, so you can enjoy watching the easy run of graceful animals, and anyone is allowed to stroke the horse. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And for lovers of skiing and snowboarding there is a suitable area for classes to their liking.  There are as many as six slopes of varying difficulty in Okhta Park, both beginners and experienced athletes can ride here.  The slopes are well equipped, they monitor safety.  Reviews of the cottage village "Okhtinsky Park" among the advantages of buying a site first of all mention this far from every available type of winter vacation.  The riders willingly warm up and regain their strength in a cafe or restaurant, which are located on the territory of the Okhta Park.  In addition, the ski resort ‚ÄúNorth Slope‚Äù is very close by, where the class of service meets established international standards. </p><p>  Very pleased with the choice of hunters and fishermen.  Fishing on the local lakes is great!  In summer, beach holidays dominate on Khepoyardi and Kavgolovsky lakes, while fishing dominates in winter.  Almost close to the sections of the Okhtinsky Park (seven minutes drive) is Toksovo, an ecotourism center.  Here you can visit the bison nursery.  In addition, the center willingly works with both adults and children, and numerous joint family recreation programs have been developed.  And finally, the cherry on the cake is the famous Igora ski resort, which can be reached quickly along the New Priozernoye Highway directly from the Okhta Park.  How to get there  Three kilometers from the village, a highway begins with signs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fazenda.spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The location of the village" class="if uuid-3035237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13352/3035237.jpg"></div><h2>  A little bit about the developer </h2><p>  The cottage village "Okhtinsky Park" is not the first on the account of the objects of the developer.  This company of German origin was established in 1999 as a ticket agency for Pulkovo Airlines in cooperation with it.  In 2004, another path was chosen: PulExpress is now engaged in development in Russia, choosing to use the style of the company for suburban real estate.  A year later, the sale of KP ‚ÄúBorisovo-2‚Äù was launched, after which the customers remembered this developer and gained respect for him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Two years later, PulExpress had already formed its own brand, and the black-and-white-gold colors changed the white-blue (aviation) color on the logo.  Then the company has its own realtors based on a real estate agency.  Now the company‚Äôs data bank has residential and elite real estate (more than one hundred objects, as well as more than five hundred suburban objects).  Among them, eleven cottage villages in the Leningrad Region alone are being erected by PulExpress, and Okhtinsky Park is a pearl in this necklace. </p><p>  All objects from this developer are located on the banks of rivers and lakes in the Gulf of Finland and the Karelian Isthmus.  We offer for sale both land with a built house, and just plots with utilities, as well as plots with and without a contract.  In the cottage village "Okhtinsky Park" communications are summed up.  All PulExpress facilities have an insurance program for clients, which the developer implements with Rosgosstrakh.  Construction, engineering, maintenance and landscaping is carried out by a subsidiary, Cottage Service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spb.novostroyki.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pines in the village" class="if uuid-3035239" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13352/3035239.jpg"></div><h2>  The infrastructure of the cottage village </h2><p>  The houses are built very beautiful - two- and three-story, spacious - from 220 square meters to 684. There are six ready-made projects in construction that organize a single style of the whole village.  The materials are the most reliable, and therefore popular: brick, logs, aerated concrete.  Floorplans in the houses are free according to the project, even each client will arrange the stairs according to his own taste, but entrance metal doors, two-chamber double-glazed windows made of wood and fireplace mines are installed. </p><p>  Engineering networks are also summed up in this microdistrict: electricity for each plot, central sewage and water supply, gas main.  Good paved roads are already being laid throughout.  The cottage village has a rather rich infrastructure of its own.  This is a kindergarten, spa, business area, sports grounds.  The entire perimeter of the village is fenced.  Since there are settlements nearby, you can use their infrastructure.  These are clinics, schools and kindergartens. </p><p>  But the sports complex will be at the village‚Äôs own - five hundred meters.  And two kilometers away there are two comprehensive schools, one music school, kindergartens (including private ones), a health center for children (the village of Kuzmolovsky).  Equestrian sports are very close - in Enkolovo, where the Pegasus and Derby clubs operate.  The picturesque area is the best suited for horseback riding and hiking: a healing pine forest, river, lakes. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Okhtinsky Park enjoys well-deserved fame for its convenient location.  From KAD - only six kilometers, from the metro "Devyatkino" and "Prospekt Enlightenment" - ten.  Enkolovskoye Shosse, leading to the Ring Road, is adjacent to the village.  Near the territory in areas of the fifth, second and first stages, public transport stops.  It can be used to get to the metro or to the Kuzmolovo railway station.  If you try or take advantage of luck, half an hour will take all the way from the threshold to the center of St. Petersburg, in extreme cases - about fifty minutes. </p><p>  Good location and proximity to the Northern capital are the trump cards of this project.  Hypermarkets and ski resorts, a forested environment with an abundance of greenery, clean air, beauty, peace - even all this remains in the background.  Despite the fact that some houses are located near a major highway, the sale of these sites was just as successful.  Almost everything has already been bought up, and this is natural, since the developer has an excellent reputation, impressive experience and a high responsibility for his work.  Seven villages have already been commissioned and sold with his light hand in the Leningrad region. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spb.novostroyki.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Peace and quiet" class="if uuid-3035243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13352/3035243.jpg"></div><h2>  About the disadvantages </h2><p>  The reviews about this cottage village are for the most part very positive, although occasionally you can come across some facts that roads are not yet completed, that prices in the cottage village "Okhtinsky Park" are exorbitantly high, and that utility bills are too high.  Single reviews indicate interruptions in water supply and electricity.  But a significantly larger number of customers note that the supply of communications, including sewage, gas, water, electricity, is fully included in the total cost of the site. </p><p>  The entire cottage village is securely fenced around the perimeter, there is internal lighting on the territory.  Dedicated business zones for social infrastructure are being mastered.  If negative reviews were true, the Okhtinsky Park newcomers would use their cottages not for permanent residence, but for seasonal recreation.  However, people settled here forever. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pulestate.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="General plan of the village" class="if uuid-3035271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13352/3035271.jpg"></div><h2>  What real estate experts say and write </h2><p>  In October 2018, only five of 450 sites remained unsold.  But even a year ago there were only 12, so how can these rates be considered not too high?  However, experts are strict.  They calculated the offers for the secondary sale: the owners are currently selling as many as 25 plots (out of 450!).  Resell, of course, is much more expensive than bought.  So, maybe these people just have financial problems, and not the cottage village is bad? </p><p>  Experts write a lot about price scatter.  The range is really great, even strong.  There are plots for 6.7 million rubles, but there are also for 86.7.  Cottages also cost differently: from 10.8 million rubles to 180 million.  Perhaps this variety of offers was accompanied by fast sales. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  Basically, customers-buyers agree with experts.  Plots in the cottage village of the road, however, are unusually in demand.  Judging by the size of 450 sites, this is no longer quite a village, rather a town.  Buyers compare the conditions for buying a cottage or a plot in Okhta Park with other villages and explain what reasons prompted them to buy real estate here. </p><p>  It is noted that the village is ready for living completely, all the promised communications have been carried out, even all minor problems that have arisen in the process of development of the new territory by residents have been eliminated.  Novoselov is pleased with the special comfort they found in the village, silence, since each house is at a fairly large distance from the others, as well as the greenery in which the village literally drowns.  Pine trees grow right on the plots and between houses.  Already in 2014, sales were so active in all seven lines that far more than half of all 450 sites were sold.  And it should be noted that this interest has not faded to this day. </p><p>  Everyone writes the same way: this is the most famous of all the cottage villages of the region with a successful and well-developed project, perfectly balanced in terms of price and quality.  All lines have already been handed over.  This is not surprising, according to reviews, since PulExpress is involved in the construction, the developer is the most experienced of those present in the real estate market.  The company coped with all its obligations perfectly. </p><p>  Living in a cottage village will not be fraught with any difficulties, they simply are not expected.  The cottages are solid, the town looks wonderful, even, perhaps, respectably.  The distance from the metropolis is comfortable - not too far, but environmentally friendly.  All this allows you to use the cottages for permanent residence.  It is good here absolutely in any season. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zakadom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Village in winter" class="if uuid-3035274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13352/3035274.jpg"></div><h2>  Renome of "PulExpress" </h2><p>  The rating of developers shows that in St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region ‚ÄúPulExpress‚Äù was marked with the highest score - ‚ÄúA‚Äù, and now the fate of the erected cottage village ‚ÄúOkhtinsky Park‚Äù once again confirmed the height of this reputation.  This whole array has long been commissioned, communications are working, roads are done, landscaping is done, security is provided.  Life is comfortable.  That is why the buyer voted for this project with his own ruble, despite the high prices of both land and cottages themselves. </p><p>  This developer has always embarked on projects fully equipped, competently approached the choice of location, because this is most often a determining factor.  Especially if the purchase is made by the target audience.  PulExpress has never delayed the commissioning of a facility under construction, and this village was no exception.  There are picturesque views, high transport accessibility and a high degree of readiness. </p><p>  Prices, of course, are not optimal.  But despite this, sales are almost complete.  The nearest industrial zone is five kilometers away, it is not so close to affect environmental cleanliness.  Highways passing nearby can affect this.  But the pine forest solves the problem of fresh air exceptionally well, and there are a lot of pines left even in the village. </p>
