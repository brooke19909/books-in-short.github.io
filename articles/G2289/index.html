Map of Phuket (Patong) hotels</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Phuket is a <span>paradise island</span> in southern Thailand.  Its warm <span>Andaman Sea</span> attracts many tourists, who at the moment provide a flow of funds to Phuket.  Patong is its largest beach, having won the fame of a party center.  But this is not just a resort that can entertain people who are tired of the gray days of cold countries.  It is also a place with a rich history. </p><h2>  Island history </h2><p>  Europeans became aware of Phuket in the Middle Ages.  From the book of Claudius Ptolemy, they learned that sailors often have to go through a certain cape Chunk Silon, holding the path to the Malay Peninsula.  This area has long been considered a transit point for merchants between China and India.  Their hospitality and generosity provided an occasion to visit not only for geographical reasons.  The main natural wealth of the island was tin.  It was mined so much that by the 17th century a real war broke out between nations for the possibility of trade with Phuket.  The first trading port was founded by the Dutch, and then the British and immigrants from Portugal.  As a result, the influence of these countries spread so widely that the king of Ayutthaya, who ruled at that time, decided to alliance with France in order to gain hope for independence.  By the end of the century, the French had gained the long-awaited monopoly on the extraction of tin, but this did not last forever, since the Siamese revolution took place.  Looking at Patong, <span>Phuket, the photo of</span> which is presented in this article, it is difficult to imagine that it was not rest that was the primary concern of the islanders.  The 18th century turned into a real nightmare for them, expressed in the Burmese invasion.  The next century was marked for the island by a change in ethnic pattern: crowds of Chinese workers came to develop tin.  All this time, Phuket was not considered a separate province, becoming such only at the beginning of the 20th century.  Currently, the prosperity of the island is possible thanks to tourism and the production of rubber.  Back in the 70s, a wonderful climate led to the formation of several resort areas on the island of Phuket: Patong, Kata and Karon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tourism business as the basis of Phuket welfare </h2><p>  In the 60s, the issue raised regarding tourism in Phuket would be ridiculed.  At that time, the island was suffering from transportation problems, since there were almost no real solid roads.  Therefore, no one could find out about this place in connection with the limited <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãtransport.</span>  The economic crisis caused by the disruption in Thailand's metals industry has led residents to think about alternative enrichment methods.  Quality roads begin to rebuild, the first hotels appear, an uncharted, fabulous island is advertised.  Magazines with flashy names in full urge sophisticated travelers to try something new in a region almost untouched by civilization.  Nowadays, the island lacks hotels for a huge number of visitors to an exotic place.  Every year the number of hotels is growing rapidly, but this is not enough for everyone.  The same trend is observed with the size of the Phuket airport: recently it had to be doubled, investing a lot of money, since by 2012 there were so many tourists that the landing strip was unable to accommodate half the aircraft. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket, Patong" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19601/388279.jpg" width="353"></div>

The province is famous for its National Museum, an exhibition of sea shells and a mining department.  Scuba diving takes an honorable second place in popularity after beach activities.  The beauty of the deep sea and walks with their inhabitants do not leave tourists indifferent.  Expeditions to the <span>Similan Islands</span> have long been considered the basis for diving enthusiasts. </p><p>  Another great vacation on the island is golf.  The territory of Phuket has completely changed by man to create some of the best golf courses.  They meet the set standards so well that they even hold world competitions here.  Some experts believe that soon Phuket Patong will share the level of popularity with golf.  According to experts, every year this type of entertainment brings Thailand billions of dollars. </p><h2>  <strong>Patong Beach (Phuket</strong> ): Key Features of Thai Paradise </h2><p>  Patong is <span>Phuket</span> 's largest <span>beach.</span>  This is a place full of life, fun and idleness.  For a tourist who prefers peace and quiet, it will not work.  This is a resort for active party-goers dreaming of plunging into the world of nightlife, parties and tropical cocktails.  There are a lot of nightclubs, expensive restaurants, as well as hotels, which are famous throughout Thailand.  Phuket, Patong and other beaches of the island can awaken the thirst for adventure for any visitor to the party.  Dozens of different bars can be found on Bangla's main street.  Non-alcoholic relaxation can be found in Patong massage parlors.  The choice of the tourist will provide an erotic or therapeutic massage.  And it can be done right on the seashore, on the beach itself.  For fans of non-standard spectacles, cabarets with transvestites and strippers are always open. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Patong, Phuket, photo" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19601/388290.jpg?1399147350809" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Water sports </h2><p>  Water sports are one of the main advantages of places like Patong (Beach).  Phuket - diver's paradise corner.  Here you can always rent equipment and buy a card for swimming.  Barracudas and turtles, sea snakes and unusual fish - all this is the underwater world of Thailand.  A unique chance to live to see a whale shark or a rare manta ray is provided to Phuket fans.  It is also possible to take a boat trip to other islands of Thailand.  Jet skiing or parasailing are also popular. </p><h2>  Night clubs </h2><p>  Club life is one of the main advantages of a place like Patong.  Phuket, whose photo is replete with party shots, has earned a reputation as the most "detached" island.  Starting from small establishments, such as Banana Disco, you can try to visit the largest clubs during the night.  ‚ÄúBanana‚Äù is preferred by lovers of small and comfortable rooms with high-quality music, because <span>well-known DJs</span> will not fail to appear in such a place for music lovers. </p><p>  Do not forget about the bars and dance halls located directly in the hotels.  In some of them, dance floors can compete with club ones in size and arrangement. </p><h2>  Large establishments </h2><p>  Hollywood Club is the most attractive place for locals.  Most of the workers in the neighboring bars come here after working hours to enjoy light pop music.  In the midst of fun, small souvenirs begin to be scattered and offer free drinks. </p><p>  Pinky Bar is famous for its striptease and dance music of various styles.  Nevertheless, the old Tai Peng club, where most of the people gather, should be put first in popularity.  Its central location and fame among residents make it the most interesting to visit. </p><h2>  <strong>Thailand.</strong>  <strong>Phuket Patong Hotels</strong> </h2><p>  To choose a hotel in Phuket, you need to decide on its purpose.  Since this is primarily a short-term accommodation (after all, most likely tourists will prefer to spend time on the beaches and other places of outdoor recreation), an inexpensive hotel may well be suitable.  As mentioned above, hotels are what Phuket has recently been famous for.  Patong provides 3 star hotels in an amount not dreamed of by other beach resorts.  Despite such a number of stars, in any hotel in Patong, travelers will find a comfortable room, and even with air conditioning, without which life on the island would have seemed much more difficult. </p><p>  For connoisseurs of good shopping, a significant number of hotels have been built near shopping centers.  As soon as dusk falls on Patong, preceding the incendiary atmosphere of nightly dancing, it turns into a real market.  Shopping street and all roads are lined with tents selling handicrafts.  Such a souvenir will be the perfect gift for relatives. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Patong, the beach.

    <h2>  Hotel Map </h2><p>  For better orientation, there is a map of Phuket hotels.  Patong is depicted in great detail with all the major hotels.  This card can be bought in bookstores, found in guidebooks, at the reception of the hotels themselves.  As a rule, it depicts beach lines, hotel coordinates, main attractions and paths to other islands. </p><p>  Hotels located in the third line are not necessarily far from the beach.  So, many of them are located 15 minutes from it, and along the main street.  Three star hotels can provide customers with transportation.  Nearby, as a rule, gasoline is sold.  This type of room has no frills, but all the basic amenities are provided: shower, beds, tables and even a small balcony.  The room always has clean cups and tea.  Sheets are regularly changed.
