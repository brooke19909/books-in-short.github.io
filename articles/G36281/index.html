Key dates and events</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Rome is located in the center of the intersection of trade routes, around the settlements along the Tiber River.  Historians say that Rome arose in the 9th century BC.  e.  like a small village created by two central tribes of Latins and Sabinians.  The periodization of Ancient Rome includes three main stages: royal, republican and imperial. </p><h2>  Etruscan legacy </h2><p>  Etruscans are an ancient tribe that occupied a vast territory of the Apennine Peninsula (modern Tuscany).  They created a large and developed civilization that stretches between the Tiber and Arno rivers.  The Etruscan culture had a huge influence on the Romans, who inherited a huge part of their traditions and customs.  This civilization preceded the Roman one and was much stronger than it.  But it was the Romans who assimilated and destroyed the Etruscans.  Periodization of Ancient Rome without the Etruscans would have been impossible, because the Romans used the entire legacy of their predecessors in order to create a powerful state. </p><h2>  The foundation of Rome </h2><p>  The foundation of Rome begins with the legend of Romulus and Remus, two twins who regained their rightful place and avenged their grandfather Numitor. </p><p>  In the middle of II millennium BC.  e.  below the Tiber began to settle the tribes of Latin Sikul.  Latins designated their territory with two hills - Palatine and Great.  The remaining hills were occupied by sabins.  Soon, the two tribes, as one would expect, united as a result of demographic and selfish goals.  VIII century  BC  e.  became the century of the unification of the two tribes that laid the foundation for a great empire.  Together, the fortress of Rome was built, which is located on Capitol Hill.  It is from here that the periodization of Ancient Rome originates. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="periodization of ancient rome" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1467784.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we go into the legend in more detail, then it should be said that among the Etruscans lived the vestal Reya.  Fate was such that she gave birth to two sons from the god Mars - Romulus and Remus.  According to legend, Rhea was ordered to throw the children in the basket into the river.  They sailed with the current and soon approached the Palatine hill, where they were picked up by a she-wolf.  Date of foundation of Rome - 753 BC  e.  This year, Romulus erected Rome on a hill, and the she-wolf became a sacred and revered animal. </p><h2>  Imperial period </h2><p>  The founding date of Rome marked the beginning of the royal period, during which the state ruled 7 kings.  The kings ruled in the following order: Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Gostilius, Ankh Marcius, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius and Lucius Tarquinius the Proud.  Periodization of Ancient Rome without 7 kings is unthinkable, because it was they who laid the foundation for the future empire. </p><p>  Initially, Romulus ruled together with Tacius, the king of the Sabines, but after his death, Romulus continued to rule alone (753-715 BC).  His reign is significant in that he created the Senate, managed to strengthen the Palatine and form the Roman community. </p><p>  The second king, <span>Numa Pompilius,</span> was distinguished by great piety and justice.  Tullus Gostilius was a warlike king who fought with the Fiden, Sabines and Wei.  Ankh Marcius expanded the borders of Rome towards the sea, strengthening relations with the Etruscans.  He did not wage a single war. </p><p>  Tarquinius Priscus was an Etruscan.  Rome was enriched with innovations in language, politics and religion.  Tarquinius increased the senate by 100 people.  He also fought with his neighbors and began a long process of draining the marshlands of the city.  Servius Tullius has always been a mysterious person, since even his origin remains a mystery.  <span>Tarquinius the Proud,</span> son of Tarquinius Priscus, seized power through murder.  He ruled cruelly and did not take into account the opinion of the Senate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The reign of Tarquinius the Proud and also the permissiveness of Sextus Tarquinius (the son of the king) led to the fact that the royal power fell into decay.  To a large extent this was served by the Latin-Sabine patricians. </p><h2>  Foundation of the Republic </h2><p>  The period of the republic was quite lengthy, so historians divide it into two parts: the Early Roman Republic and the Late Roman Republic.  The early Roman Republic was characterized by the power of the aristocracy and patricians, to which the plebeians, the descendants of the defeated people, obeyed.  The plebeians had no rights: they were forbidden to carry weapons, and their marriages were not recognized as legal.  All this was aimed at depriving them of protection on all sides.  The crisis of the Roman Republic was caused precisely by this confrontation between the patricians and plebeians. </p><p>  The republican system did not greatly change the political structure of Rome.  Instead of a tsar for life, power was given to two elected consuls, who ruled for only a year.  At the end of their term, the consuls reported to the Senate. </p><p>  During the Early Republic, the Romans participated in a series of wars that led to the capture of Italy.  By 264 BC  e.  Rome became the most powerful power in the whole Mediterranean.  The later Republic was marked by a series of Punic wars that led the Romans to the conquest of Carthage.  However, the crisis of the Roman Republic grew more and more. </p><h2>  Roman Samnite Wars (343-290 B.C.E.) </h2><p>  The Roman-Samnite war consists of three periods and is a series of armed conflicts.  The cause of the struggle in the first two wars was Campania, a beautiful and fertile region of Italy.  The third episode of the war was caused by the elimination of the Samnite threat in central Italy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The Rebellion of Spartacus (74-71 BC) </h2><p>  In Rome, the number of slaves was constantly increasing, and their position in society was proportionally worsening.  These factors and the brutal rule of Sulla are the two main causes of the Spartacus rebellion.  It began after the death of the ruler and reached enormous proportions.  Runaway slaves constantly arrived at the army of Spartacus, who were trained in battle by gladiators.  With his army, the rebel passed through Italy and intended to cross to the island of Sicily, but was tricked by pirates.  It was a large-scale in number and scope of the uprising, which showed the courage and thirst for freedom of slaves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="foundation date of rome" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1467786.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As a result, the uprising was stifled.  Spartak himself fell in battle, and all the minions were crucified on crosses along the Appian Way as a warning to the rest. </p><h2>  Guy Julius Caesar </h2><p>  Gaius Julius Caesar was either a dictator or a consul until he became the Great Pontiff of the Roman Empire.  He had a great influence on the empire in its last years.  Caesar came from a clan of patricians, so from birth he was endowed with a certain power. </p><p>  He was a cunning politician and bribed people in every way.  This worked great, and he had serious support among the general population.  Caesar's dictatorship was welcome and glorified by all.  He demonstrated his talents as a great commander and strategist in the Gallic War, defeating the Germans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caesar's dictatorship" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1467783.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  He made many campaigns, expanding the boundaries of the empire.  Caesar was cunning, but careful.  Historians celebrate his gift as a speaker, for many times he raised the morale of soldiers with a short speech.  Caesar left behind several works that are recognized as classics of Latin prose ("Notes on the Gallic War" and "Notes on the Civil War").  His activities had a huge impact on the development of Western Europe. </p><h2>  The fall of the republic </h2><p>  The fall of the republic was inevitable, as discontent with the old order was constantly growing.  The power of the senate ceased to be fair, it was concentrated in the hands of several noble families.  It was obvious that the republican system was not suitable for a huge power.  Not only ordinary people suffered from oppression by the authorities.  As a result of nearly a century of dissatisfaction, the republic fell.  The main role in this was played by the army. </p><h2>  Empire </h2><p>  The emperor was recognized as the main ruler of Rome due to the fact that the old power was overthrown by the army (previously commanders were called emperors).  The first three centuries in Rome, republican orders were preserved.  The emperor was the head of the Senate and was called the "Princeps."  At first, the Roman Empire was quite democratic, and all power remained with the Senate.  <span>The first emperor of Rome</span> was <span>Octavian Augustus.</span>  He completed the formation of a professional Roman army, which lasted about a century.  The soldiers had to serve 20-25 years, not having the right to start a family and living on a regular allowance. </p><p>  The Yuliev-Klavdiev dynasty began Tiberius Claudius Nero - the second emperor of Rome, who significantly expanded the boundaries of his possessions.  Separately, it is necessary to highlight the third emperor - Caligula, who ordered to call himself ‚ÄúGod‚Äù and imposed the imperial cult.  He lived in a big way and spent a lot of money from the treasury on performances for the lower strata of society.  His rule provoked widespread indignation, and he was killed in another conspiracy. </p><p>  Next, the Flavian dynasty came to power in Rome, which adequately defended its territory and expanded its borders.  She is also known for having built her own theater - the Colosseum.  Then the dynasties of the Antonins and Severs ruled. </p><h2>  Flavian Dynasty and Coliseum (69-96 BC) </h2><p>  This dynasty built the world famous building - the Colosseum amphitheater, which is located between three hills.  The construction of the building required 8 years of hard work.  The discovery of the <span>Colosseum in Rome</span> was marked by large-scale games of gladiators.  Many ancient historians describe the opening of the amphitheater as a large-scale and spectacular performance. </p><p>  It should be noted that the name "Coliseum" appeared only in the VIII century.  There are two versions of this name.  The first consists in the size and grandeur of the structure, and the second version says that the name comes from a huge statue of Nero, which he erected in his honor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coliseum opening" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1467787.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the Coliseum there were fights of gladiators, marine games and animal persecution.  All this was arranged on holidays or in honor of the arrival of eminent guests.  In 217, the building was damaged by a severe fire, but by order of Alexander Sever it was restored. </p><h2>  Dynasty Antoninov </h2><p>  The reign of the Antonin dynasty is considered more or less stable for Rome.  In history, Antonins are known as the ‚ÄúFive Good Emperors‚Äù.  The Roman Empire during the reign of the Antonin dynasty reached its peak.  Peace was achieved in relations with the Senate, autocracy was finally recognized.  As for foreign policy, Rome has expanded its borders as much as possible. </p><h2>  The reign of Antoninus Pius (96-192 B.C.) <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reign of emperor Antoninus pius" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1480730.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><p>  The reign of Emperor Antoninus Pius is characterized by an unprecedented flowering of small settlements and provinces.  He was open and accessible to each of his subjects, and this greatly attracted the people to him.  His activity in the field of legal relations served to the fact that at the beginning of the III century Roman law began to develop by leaps and bounds.  The emperor was assisted by 5 well-known lawyers who were able to raise Roman law to a new level.  He also introduced an important principle, which stated that before the trial, people cannot be considered guilty of anything. </p><p>  Pius also raised the question of the status of slaves in society, equating the killing of a slave with an ordinary crime.  Moreover, slaves who sought refuge in the walls of the temple, could not return to their masters.  The emperor softened the torture for slaves, and also forbade the slavery of children under 14 years of age.  He also introduced a law that stated that the daughter‚Äôs preferences should be taken into account when concluding a marriage contract.  The reign of Pius was recognized as very humane, which was facilitated by the influence of Greek philosophy and stoicism. </p><h2>  Marcus Aurelius </h2><p>  The reign of Emperor <span>Marcus Aurelius</span> from the Antonin dynasty was largely based on the postulates of Antoninus Pius.  Marcus Aurelius always emphasized respect for the Senate, and paid great attention to law.  He supported low-income families, developed a philosophy.  By nature, he was calm, but life forced him to participate in hostilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reign of emperor marcus aurelius" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1467785.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The fall of the empire </h2><p>  The collapse of the Roman Empire occurred against the backdrop of the collapse of the Western <span>Roman Empire.</span>  The reason for this was the attack of the barbarians throughout Rome.  The 476 year of the fall of the Roman Empire was a historic date that marked the complete completion of the history of Rome.  Visigoths and Ostrogoths, Burgundians and Vandals actively invaded the territory.  Over the years, pressure on the empire from the Germanic tribes only intensified, and the 476 year of the fall of the Roman Empire became the climax.  Soon the Roman throne became a tempting toy for barbarian military leaders. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chronology of the history of ancient rome" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1467782.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The chronology of the history of ancient Rome is full of terrible, strange and bloody events.  But without going through all these stages, Rome would not have become a powerful empire that could have a huge impact on the whole world.  He left a large number of cultural monuments, as well as invaluable works of his best emperor philosophers. </p>
