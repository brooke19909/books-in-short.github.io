    <h2>  What to do, what to see </h2><p>  Even if you came here exclusively on business, we advise you to at least briefly explore the city.  Hotels - there are many of them in Dnepropetrovsk - can be located in different areas, but the main thing that attracts most tourists is, of course, the embankment.  It is considered the longest in all of Ukraine.  Here you can take a walk in the afternoon, and in the evenings - sit in a cozy restaurant and smoke a hookah.  Modern shopping centers can give odds to foreign shopping malls, and ancient parks and well-maintained islands attract soul and body.  There are also historical sights in the city - the Potemkin residence, the Astoria Hotel, which used to be the headquarters of Nestor Makhno, and much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Five star hotels (Dnepropetrovsk) </h2><p>  There are only a few hotels corresponding to the highest category in the city.  They can be said to be the main competitors in the hotel business.  Two central hotels of this class are located near the Dnieper, and most of the rooms have stunning views of this great river.  The rooms of the Axelhof Boutique Hotel surprise with luxury and gilding in the style of the so-called belle epoque, or boudoirs of kings and emperors.  The Bertolomeo Yacht Club also owns superior bungalows corresponding to the Five Stars.  He stands right on the promenade.  And another similar hotel - "Sunray" - is located twenty kilometers from the city.  It is famous for its stunning landscaped park, as well as huge apartments with several bedrooms, a kitchen and modern appliances.  Prices for rooms in this hotel range from a hundred to a thousand dollars per day, but at the same time there are always a lot of guests in them. </p>

    <h2>  Four star hotels of Dnepropetrovsk </h2><p>  There are much more such hotels in the city than there are fives.  They can be located both in the central part and on the outskirts, as well as in park areas.  Such, for example, is the Yekaterinoslavsky Hotel, built in the English Art Nouveau style at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  This is a comfortable hotel with an alpine lawn and shady walkways.  Far from the center is another popular Quartet - the Hudson.  This hotel is located in a pine forest in the resort area.  It is suitable for training and seminars, as well as for corporate leisure.  It has one hundred and ten apartments, a pool and a sauna.  The boutique Park Hotel with its original interior, unique floral decor and <span>Venetian stucco</span> on the walls, on the contrary, is located in the city center, like the European Hotel of the same category. </p><h2>  "Three stars" </h2><p>  Hotels of this class are the majority.  This is the main type of hotel in Dnepropetrovsk.  Among them there are large complexes and buildings of medium capacity.  Many of them can also offer beautiful views of the embankment and good services, and at the same time for a very reasonable price.  The historical hotel Astoria already mentioned here has not practically changed its appearance since the time of construction.  From the central hotels for business people, guests recommend the Reikartz business hotel.  It can offer not only standard rooms, but also the Superior category and suites.  The new mini-hotel "Niagara" has only seven rooms.  But they are decorated in thematic styles.  Among them are Japanese, medieval, autumn, sea, and even Lenin.  Caspian only offers suites with the interior of the Arab East.  And one of the economical accommodation options is the private hotel "Berlin" (Dnepropetrovsk).  Reviews about it indicate that the institution is located at the entrance to the city (from Donetsk).  The rooms are very comfortable;  There are apartments, suites and junior suites.  The premises of the highest category have their own sauna and jacuzzi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel southern dnipropetrovsk reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/670680.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  "Sail" </h2><p>  The symbol of Dnepropetrovsk in Soviet times was to become this still unfinished hotel.  Thirty-two floors make it the tallest hotel in Ukraine, despite the fact that its construction has not yet been completed.  The construction of the hotel was conceived in 1975, and was planned by its young and ambitious Ukrainian architects, in particular, Alexander Zuev.  In those days, this project had no analogues in the world.  Ten million rubles from the state budget were allocated for the construction of the hotel, and another fifteen were to come as patronage assistance.  However, with the decline of the USSR, money for its construction became less and less ... A pity.  Interestingly, the latest technology was used for this unique skyscraper - the shell armor of the Azovstal plant.  However, in 2005, construction work resumed, and in 2015 their completion is expected.  Then, finally, the Parus Hotel (Dnepropetrovsk) will open.  Reviews of this object so far only say that excursions are organized on the roof of a long-term construction.  These "climbers" became the highlight of the city, because from there you can see Dnipropetrovsk in all its glory. </p>
