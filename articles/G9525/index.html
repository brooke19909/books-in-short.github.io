This country is already interesting because it is the most Europeanized in Africa and the Arab world.  Tunisian resorts are focused on various ‚Äúconsumer audiences‚Äù.  So, Sousse is designed for budget travelers.  This resort has many three- and four-star hotels.  Sousse borders Port El Kantaoui, a ‚Äútourist reservation‚Äù with a huge selection of hotels.  Mahdia is suitable for family vacations.  Monastir will appeal to those who want to plunge into the world of the Arab East.  The island of Djerba is designed for lovers of secluded beach vacations.  And Hammamet is a resort for wealthy travelers.  Lovers of respectable rest stop there.  But this does not mean at all that the entire resort is full of luxury hotels.  In this article, we describe four-star Hammamet hotels (all inclusive).  Reviews, prices, a brief overview of the best hotels in the city you will find below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="All-inclusive 4-star hotels in Hammamet" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1489287.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What you need to know about the hotel base of Tunisia </h2><p>  This country is known among tourists for its centers of thalassotherapy.  <span>Seaweed wrap,</span> mud treatment - that's why they go to Tunisia.  And according to the notions of comfort, the hotel may have a ragged facade of the building and not entirely new furniture, but a thalasso center must be present.  Many 4-star Hammamet hotels (‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù) indicate ‚Äúsea treatment‚Äù among their services.  The lion's share of the hotel base of Tunisia was erected in the eighties of the last century.  Since then, only cosmetic repairs were carried out.  Therefore, an experienced traveler who has experienced many tours in Turkey and Egypt, may be somewhat surprised by the dilapidated view of the hotels.  But the compensation will be the sincere cordiality that distinguishes the hospitable Tunisian people.  Travelers' reviews are advised to choose former "treshki" who have recently raised their status by one star.  As a rule, they have more territory turned into a fairy garden. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What you need to know about the Tunisian All Inclusive </h2><p>  Tourists who are accustomed to "all inclusive" in Egypt and similar resort countries, can get into a mess.  In Tunisia, this concept has its own nuances.  In fact, not all is included, but only some amenities.  In nutrition, the Tunisian ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù resembles, rather, the Spanish ‚Äúfull board‚Äù, with the exception that drinks in Hammamet will still be free at lunch and dinner.  Three (less often - four) meals are held on schedule.  Of course, you can find a hotel with "ultra all inclusive", but it is likely to be the "five".  Yes, and located in quiet resorts, for example, in Mahdiye (Tunisia).  Hammamet <span>(</span> all-inclusive <span>4-</span> star <span>hotels</span> here are worthy of competition for luxury hotels) is also distinguished by the fact that the all inclusive concept is fully implemented there.  But reviews are still advised to check which services are "free" and for which you will have to pay extra.  Sometimes the hotel does not provide beach towels, but only sun loungers and umbrellas.  It happens that a sauna is also charged. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Foursome Resort Overview </h2><p>  Why choose Hammamet 4 star all-inclusive hotels?  This category of hotels is most popular.  The reasons are understandable.  Firstly, a vacation here is cheaper than a five star hotel.  And secondly, the level and range of services is practically no different from what luxurious Hammamet hotels provide to tourists.  Most Quartet have thalassotherapy centers.  But, recall the reviews, it will not be superfluous to ask about the list of really free procedures in them.  Often Hammamet's 4-star hotels (all-inclusive) differ from the Fives only in their remoteness from the sea.  They are not on the first, but on the second line of the beach.  But what does the three hundred meters that you need to overcome to get to the sea mean, compared with the difference in prices for accommodation in the "four" and "five"?  There are also coastal hotels in Hammamet, on the facade of which there is 4 *.  But the cost of rooms in them immediately increases.  Let's make sure of that. </p>

    <h2>  Prices for hotels in Tunisia 4 and 5 stars all inclusive (Hammamet) </h2><p>  In this completely non-budget resort, accommodation in a double room of the "five" starts from 7250 rubles per night.  Examples: the luxurious LTI Jasmine Beach, as well as the top 5 best in Hammamet, Madik Life African Imperial, Holiday Village Manar, Iberostar Solarium, Le Royal Hammamet and Rio Palace Ocean.  And now let's take the ‚Äúlittle sister‚Äù of the Iberostar Solaria mentioned.  It stands on the front page of the beach and belongs to the same hotel chain.  But the room rate in Iberostar Averroes 4 * is already reduced to three thousand rubles per night.  Now take the 4 star Hammamet (all inclusive) hotels located on the second line.  Here is the Hyde Yasmin.  To come to the hotel‚Äôs own beach, you need to walk only one hundred and fifty meters.  At the same time, the cost of a standard double room in Hyde Jasmine is only 1954 rubles per night.  So is it worth paying more? </p>

    <h2>  Overview: 4 * Hammamet hotels - the best ‚Äúfours‚Äù of the resort </h2><p>  The hotel "El Muradi El Menzah" is in the lead.  This "four" is unusual.  Unlike most Tunisian hotels, it was built in 1999.  And it is located on the first line.  You will need to walk only twenty meters to your own beach from the hull.  In addition, ‚ÄúEl Muradi‚Äù occupies a key place in the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãYasmin, on the southern outskirts of Hammamet.  The hotel is open all year.  On its territory there are two huge swimming pools - in the open air and indoors.  Six restaurants (one of them a la carte), four bars, animation, a mini club, a thalassotherapy center, special services for children - the list of services and entertainment is quite long.  What did you want?  Indeed, next to the four-star "El Menzah" is her eldest star - "El Muradi Hammamet 5 *." </p>

    <h2>  Hammamet Garden Resort 4 * </h2><p>  This hotel is for those who, in search of a water park in the list of All Inclusive services, have arrived in <span>Tunisia, Hammamet.</span>  All-inclusive 4-star hotels rarely have slides and other water activities on their territory.  Therefore, ‚ÄúHammamet Garden Resort and Spa‚Äù is so popular among tourists with children.  True, you have to go to the sea in a quarter of an hour.  But is it really so scary when a stone's throw from the room there is a giant pool with a variety of slides?  And those who arrived in Tunisia for thalassotherapy can try the procedures in the hotel spa.  Here you will find the programs ‚ÄúFor sore feet‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnti-stress‚Äù, and various wraps, mud therapy, raflexology and massages.  And, of course, you can enjoy the hammam and sauna for free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in Hammamet" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1488583.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Paradise Palace </h2><p>  Four-star hotels in Hammamet are often located away from the sea - on the second, and even on the third line.  A pleasant exception to this rule is the Le Paradise Palace Hotel.  She perched on the very shore of the bay, next to her own wonderful sandy beach.  Reviews of tourists say that the proximity of the sea is not the only plus of the hotel.  A huge territory, transformed by the efforts of gardeners into a flowering park, a chic building, as if descended from the pages of the fairy tales ‚ÄúOne Thousand and One Nights,‚Äù several bungalows, two swimming pools, a thalassotherapy center - this is not a complete list of services in this wonderful ‚Äúfour‚Äù.  Naturally, the all-inclusive hotel has animation for both adults and children. </p>
