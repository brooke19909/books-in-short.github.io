The advantage of such models is primarily that, having removed the panel, you can not worry about the theft of the car radio.  After all, if the robber wants to abduct her, he will not be able to do this.  More precisely, he can, but the action will not make sense. </p><h2>  Instrument Features </h2><p>  2DIN car radios are one of the most well-known standard options that replace regular car radios.  There are several basic criteria that can persuade the buyer to purchase just such a model: </p><ul><li>  There is a large selection of radio tape recorders from different manufacturers. </li><li>  All 2DIN car radios are equipped with a host of additional features. </li><li>  With their help, you can build a high-quality speaker system.  But you must additionally purchase a sound amplifier, speakers and adapters. </li></ul><p>  Due to the 2-din models, the regular appearance of the dashboard may be disrupted.  And this does not always have a positive effect.  To install the device in the car, you may need a adapter frame.  It is inexpensive, but you still have to spend money.  At the same time, <span>1-din radios</span> cost a little less. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="2 din car radio reviews" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32880/973326.jpg" width="441"></div>

    <h2>  Major manufacturers </h2><p>  The choice of car radios in size 2DIN is great.  However, there are even models created for a particular car.  They are called regular.  And if they have to choose among very unknown names (Intro, Ca-Fi and others), then 2DIN multimedia car radios are created mainly by well-known companies.  This is Alpine, and Pioneer, and JVC, and even Sony.  Of course, there are other manufacturers of car radios, but most often it is these that most buyers choose.  Consider the most famous models. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

They note that the device is a small computer with which the path will no longer be monotonous. </p><h2>  How to install? </h2><p>  All radio tape recorders are mounted on the same principle.  The installation of the 2DIN radio is the same as the installation of a 1-din device.  First of all, remove the old radio.  To do this, it is better to use a Phillips screwdriver.  With it, you can remove the console, which is attached with four bolts.  2DIN car radios are easily removable from the jack.  To do this, you can slightly pry it with a flat screwdriver.  Two latches are located on the sides, which are easily opened.  After that, the car radio should be easily dismantled.  After removing the device, access to the wires will appear.  Each plug is quite difficult to push out.  Therefore, it is better to tilt the radio toward you and carefully disconnect the plug.  The new 2DIN car radio on Android should be installed in the reverse order. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car radio installation 2 din" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32880/973329.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <p>  That is, you can install the radio with your own hands.  After all, in a car service, the price of this work may turn out to be too high, but why waste money? </p>
