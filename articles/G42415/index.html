    <p>  In the modern world there is a huge variety of expensive gifts, but all of them are worth nothing compared to those made with their own hands.  These things are full of <span>warmth</span> and caring attention.  They are priceless. </p><p>  Everyone knows that usually grandparents love grandchildren more than children.  Over the years, our ancestors become more sentimental, and even the simplest things donated by children and grandchildren are the most expensive for them.  Therefore, to receive ‚Äúkalyaki-kalyaki‚Äù as a gift for babies is a special pleasure and tenderness.  But seriously, what gift to give grandfather?  We‚Äôll talk about this now. </p><h2>  The best gift for grandfather from grandson - drawing </h2><p>  Kids are great artists: small prints of pens and legs on a white piece of paper or a T-shirt will look very cute. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Parents, brothers, sisters and friends can help young talents.  You can draw a tree with branches, and each talented participant in the project will leave a fingerprint in the form of a leaf on a branch.  Write your name or wish on it. </p>

    <h2>  Poems and Songs </h2><p>  How to give grandfather a gift that he will remember for a long time?  It will be funny if the baby tells poetry or sings a song in honor of his beloved grandfather.  And if he himself (with the help of adults, of course) tries to rhyme a few lines, grandfather will be delighted! </p><h2>  Skillful pens </h2><p>  The granddaughter-needlewoman will remind her grandfather of his care on a cold winter evening when he will put on her gift - a warm blanket or sweater, a scarf, socks or mittens that she personally ties.  A handmade gift for grandfather on his birthday will be both emotional and unusual.  You can embroider a picture or weave beads keychain. </p><p>  Grandfather <span>‚Äôs birthday</span> is a great occasion for a master-grandson to prove himself.  And to make, for example, original key hooks.  To do this, the old keys must be bent into a hook and nailed to a wooden plank. </p><p>  In every house where children grow up, there are parts from the designer, from which you can make light key rings for keys, and a panel on which you can attach them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Edible gifts </h2><p>  Gourmet grandfather should be pampered with goodies. </p>

    <ul><li>  A jar of raspberry or orange jam will be not only a sweet addition to tea, but also the prevention of colds. </li><li>  A cake or cookies of their own production will make a grandfather happy smile. </li><li>  Adult family members can prepare a special birthday for their birthday. </li></ul><p>  To do this, you will need: </p><ul><li>  red, green and / or yellow bell pepper sliced ‚Äã‚Äãin rings; </li><li>  2-3 eggs; </li><li>  cheese; </li><li>  greens. </li></ul><p>  On a hot frying pan greased with butter, lay out multi-colored rings of bell pepper, beat the eggs inside, sprinkle with grated cheese and herbs.  Breakfast is served, sir! </p><p>  Make grandfather sweet tooth bananas with chocolate on the grill.  Cut the banana lengthwise, leave in a peel.  Paste <span>chocolate</span> into transverse cuts <span>.</span>  <span>Chocolate</span> heats and melts.  As you can see, it‚Äôs not at all difficult for a grandfather to make a gift with his own hands, especially if it is filled with love. </p><h2>  Life story </h2><p>  After a delicious dinner and dessert, we give grandfather a beautiful transparent jar with colorful leaves on which each family member wrote one or more questions. </p><p>  Sample questions: </p><ol><li>  How was your childhood? </li><li>  What did the parents do? </li><li>  What are cherished dreams? </li><li>  Funny stories from childhood? </li><li>  Favorite hobby? </li><li>  Favorite toys? </li><li>  Formula for life success? </li><li>  First youthful love? </li><li>  Dear memories from the past? </li><li>  Best friends? </li></ol><p>  Handing this gift to grandfather, explain that it will be interesting for you to learn his life story.  The task of the birthday man is to write a book of memoirs with the help of asked questions.  If this is a rather laborious process for grandfather, just sit in a circle and listen to his story firsthand. </p>

    <h2>  Fridge magnet </h2><p>  If you do not live with grandfather together, this does not mean that he cannot see you every day.  Make a fridge magnet with your photo.  This is not difficult.  You can use an old magnet or buy a magnetic tape in a store for creativity.  The magnet should be slightly smaller than the photograph.  First you need to glue the magnet on a thick cardboard, and then stick a photo there.  This is how an excellent and unusual gift is made for grandfather on his own birthday. </p><h2>  Crafts from the branches </h2><p>  In a park or forest, we collect twigs of different lengths, widths, shapes, thicknesses. </p><p>  Still need: </p><ul><li>  cardboard; </li><li>  glue for wood (‚ÄúMoment‚Äù glue is also suitable); </li><li>  beads; </li><li>  buttons </li><li>  multi-colored threads; </li><li>  fantasy. </li></ul><p>  <em>Hot cup stand</em> </p><p>  On a square-shaped cardboard about 95x95 in size we glue branches of the same thickness.  You can diagonally, you can one half - horizontally, the other - vertically, but can be divided into 4 equal parts.  Break branches, as you wish, there are many options. </p><p>  <em>Beautiful stylish frame</em> </p><ul><li>  We need a cardboard of rectangular shape - you want white, you want color.  Paste your favorite photo with grandfather or family photo as a keepsake for grandfather.  Glue around the perimeter with branches of different lengths.  Glue the cardboard stand on the back. </li><li>  Grandfather will be happy to see the photograph of his beloved grandson in a frame in the form of a twisted nest.  Such an original frame will look good on the wall. </li></ul><p>  <em>Custom framed picture</em> <br><br>  What else can you make a <span>birthday</span> present for <span>grandfather</span> from twigs <span>?</span>  With your own hands, unusual frames can be decorated with multi-colored buttons or beads.  Branches rewound with colorful threads or ribbons will look bright. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to give grandfather a gift" class="if" height="254" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12194/369567.jpg?1396946531693" width="370"></div>

If you are preparing a <span>birthday present for your grandfather,</span> it will be very simple to make it yourself, because for your beloved grandfather, it is not the aesthetic side that matters, but what you thought about it. </p><p>  The main thing is to put your love and warmth into your masterpiece, which will warm your beloved grandfather in the hours of gloom. </p><p>  We wish you unusual creative ideas!  Take care of your loved ones! </p>
