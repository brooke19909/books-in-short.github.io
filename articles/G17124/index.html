This is due to the fact that in the areas allotted for rest (including foreign citizens), at the same time, many currencies are distributed, the amount of which is most often equal to the number of representatives of vacationing countries.  So, in the same store you can easily pay in rubles, dollars, euros or the same Turkish lira. </p><h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  Back in 1923, the Turkish reformer Atat√ºrk decided to replace the Ottoman lira existing at that time with a more modern version - the Turkish lira.  This is far from the first replacement of the national currency in this country, since the replaced Ottoman lira lasted only 79 years (although in everyday life it was still 4 years old, simultaneously with the Turkish one).  In turn, even before this currency, there were kurush, which were also a means of payment and for a rather long time successfully walked in the country along with other monetary units. </p><p>  However, <span>the government of</span> the country in question did not calm down on <span>this</span> , and very soon another currency was introduced.  It should be noted that the Ottoman lira used until 1923 was a pretty serious coin for a country like Turkey.  The monetary unit, the rate of which was equal in 1902 to more than $ 4.5, the other could not be by definition, but it was very outdated and at that time did not meet the needs of the country.  And this despite the fact that it was the Ottoman lira that was the first currency in this country, printed on paper. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  New Turkish Lira </h2><p>  At the end of the twentieth and the beginning of the twenty-first century, an economic crisis broke out in the country, as a result of which the currency of Turkey practically depreciated.  However, the government of the country has undertaken quite effective reforms, as a result of which in 2005 a new currency appeared: the new Turkish lira.  Starting from 2009, the ‚Äúnew‚Äù prefix officially went out of use, at the moment the Turkish currency is simply called the ‚ÄúTurkish lira‚Äù, without any prefixes.  However, during the transition period (all three years, starting from 2005 and ending with 2008), this money was also officially not called the new Turkish lira, but simply the lira, which is why many are still confused in names, although if you look at it, everything isn‚Äôt so difficult. </p>

    <h2>  The currency of Turkey in modern times </h2><p>  At the moment, the same currency runs in this country, while there are no prerequisites for the next replacement.  The monetary unit of Turkey to the ruble refers at the rate of approximately 0.05.  That is, for one hundred rubles (at the time of writing this article), you can purchase about 5-6 Turkish liras.  However, given the rarity of circulation of this currency anywhere other than directly in Turkey, the chance to buy it in the CIS is rather small, which does not hinder trying to search, especially since at this stage Russia and Turkey are beginning to cooperate quite actively, and the likelihood that the currency of Turkey will appear in free sale is quite high. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It should be noted that in circulation now there are banknotes in denominations of 5 to 200 lire, as well as coins that are still called chicken (like a penny in Russia) and whose ratio to the lira goes as 100 to 1. These coins are issued on metal and are denominated from 1 to 50 chicken.  An interesting fact is that, unlike many countries that print on their banknotes or presidents, or monuments (historical or natural), on Turkish coins, absolutely on all, the same portraits of <span>Mustafa Kemal Ataturk are</span> depicted <span>.</span>  Among other things, there is another metal coin, denominated in 1 lira, made by bimetallic technology, with exactly the same portrait on it. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance of paper lire </h2><p>  The banknote of 5 lira is made in brown and has the smallest dimensions relative to other paper money in this country.  In exactly the same way as on coins, on the obverse is an invariable portrait of Ataturk, and on the reverse there is a fragment of a DNA chain, a fragment of the solar system, a portrait of Professor Aydin Sayyly and the structure of the atom. </p><p>  The second most valuable banknote - 10 lira - is red in color, on the reverse side of which are mathematical formulas and another professor - Jahita Arfa.  On the obverse, as on all other banknotes, is Ataturk. </p><p>  A 20 lira paper bill boasts a greenish color and images of a cylinder, cube, ball, a university building in Gazi, an aqueduct and a portrait of Mimar Kemaleddin. </p><p>  Subsequent denominations of the denomination are made in orange, blue and purple.  Portraits of the famous Turkish writer, musician and poet are depicted on them.  The company portraits are made up of appropriate tools: feathers, paper, musical notes and so on. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  We found out what currency is in Turkey.  Officially - the Turkish lira, but you can buy anything for almost any other more or less common currency of different countries, including the ruble.  However, given that the currency of Turkey, the exchange rate to the ruble of which is 0.05, is rare in sale, it is much more profitable, it turns out, to purchase dollars or euros and go to this country already with them. </p><p>  No need to worry about finding a place where they can be exchanged, anything that will be available for sale, any tourist can buy for these currency options, without losing anything on the <span>exchange rate difference.</span>  It is interesting that only in 2012 did the currency of Turkey have its own sign, similar to the world-famous dollar or euro icon, although it has not yet received wide distribution, despite the fact that it was included in the Unicode standard. </p>
