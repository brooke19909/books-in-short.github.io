The best conditions for beginners are created here - the presence of a huge number of training schools. </p><h2>  May Vacation Features </h2><p>  Holidays in Greece in May have some features.  Despite the not very comfortable temperature of sea water (the beach season is not yet fully open), a wonderful tan here is quite possible to get.  Holidays in Greece in May - cloudless sunny days that contribute to a beautiful safe tan. </p><p>  Especially good conditions for sunbathing in May are on the island of Crete and the islands of the Aegean Sea.  Athens and the continental part of the country at this time can be accompanied by five cloudy days. </p><p>  It should be noted and the temperature difference between day and night.  It is about 10 degrees.  Therefore, on vacation you need, in addition to summer clothes (swimwear, shorts and T-shirts), it is imperative to take some warm clothes (a sweater or a light windbreaker, as well as jeans). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.discovergreece.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunny sandy beaches" class="if uuid-2406211" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2406211.jpg"></div><h2>  About beach vacation </h2><p>  According to tourists' reviews, a vacation in Greece in May is good for those who like to soak up the southern warm sun.  Sunbathing and relaxation on comfortable sun loungers are the main occupation of vacationers.  As for the sea baths, they are not to everyone's liking. </p><p>  It should be noted that the temperature is not the same in different resorts.  The highest marks are in the waters of the island of Crete (about +20 ¬∞ C).  To open an earlier bathing season, you can go to Rhodes, where the water temperature off the coast is about +19 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  You can visit the Greek Caribbean.  This is a fairly compact islet of Elafonisos, which is located in the southeast direction from the Peloponnese.  The water there warms up faster by May due to the shallow bottom of the sea off the coast.  In general, the joys of the May beach character are more limited to sunbathing. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Beach holidays in May in Greece are not particularly popular due to weather conditions.  But to explore the magnificent sights, this is the most wonderful time.  Greece's springtime is amazing.  Nature here miraculously comes to life after a winter holiday, and everything around becomes bright and colorful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.adavegastravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Acropolis of Athens" class="if uuid-2406246" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2406246.jpg"></div><p>  The main leisure in the month of May is exciting cruises on islands of amazing beauty.

Familiarity with the diverse architectural, religious and natural sights of Athens, Thessaloniki, Kastoria, Pieria, Halkidiki, Volos and Peloponnese - all this will be interesting for curious travelers.  Particularly exciting is a visit to Lake Plastira, the monasteries of Meteora, the Athenian Acropolis, the ancient cities of Delphi and Mystra, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="miriadna.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knights Castle in Rhodes" class="if uuid-2406247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2406247.jpg"></div><h2>  Holidays </h2><p>  This month in Greece begins with May Day - the workers' day, which takes place in the country cheerfully and noisily: lush parades and solemn demonstrations.  On them the Greeks pour out all their emotions accumulated during the year.  The first days of the month are also significant for festivals of flowers that are romantic in nature.

This event takes place in one of the villages of the northern regions of the state (Melique Verriase or Langadas). </p><p>  May 9 is Europe Day.  On this day, philharmonic orchestras and amateur groups perform in many cities.

In Patras, a grand rally is held, attracting riders from all over Europe. </p><h2>  Family holiday </h2><p>  Holidays in Greece in May with children are the best option to visit this country at this time of year.  The weather is quite favorable: it‚Äôs not very hot yet, but the damp and cold are already retreating. </p><p>  Greece is a leader in the number of historical monuments and palaces, shrines, ancient ruins, museums and fortresses with ancient treasures.  All this is useful to see for both adults and children.  Greece is an exotic nature with fruit and olive groves, as well as delicious local cuisine.  All this may appeal to young travelers. </p><p>  The organization of family vacations in Greece in the month of May is a real gift.  This is an unforgettable experience and a great opportunity to enjoy not only the warm and gentle sun, but also events dedicated to local holidays.  It should be noted that prices are relatively low, especially after the May holidays, closer to the end of the month. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.discovergreece.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The wonderful nature of Greece" class="if uuid-2406254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2406254.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Despite the weather established for a full beach holiday, a vacation in Greece in May, according to the reviews of happy tourists, is ideal at this time.  The climate is quite light and pleasant.  This time is the beginning of the awakening of nature, pleasing with a riot of colors and freshness. </p><p>  It is quite possible in May (especially at the end of the month) and active water procedures, especially for the most seasoned and courageous.  The most important thing is favorable prices and a relaxed atmosphere. </p><h2>  Recommendations for tourists </h2><ol><li>  It should be stocked not only with summer things, but also with some warm wardrobe items for evening walks or for excursions to the highlands. </li><li>  Sunscreen is needed. </li><li>  You can attend May events dedicated to national holidays. </li></ol><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Especially good, judging by the reviews, rest in Greece at the end of May.  Climatic conditions during this period are closest to the conditions of the height of the beach season. </p><p>  Mainland Greece allows vacationers to take advantage of the recovery from chronic ailments in the resorts of Loutraki and Halkidiki.  Indispensable components of holidays on Greek soil are unlimited shopping trips and getting an excellent gastronomic experience in national taverns. </p><p>  It can be concluded that, visiting Greece in May, you can get a chance that the vacation spent in this country was one of the best and unforgettable in life.  Relatively mild weather, lush greenery of nature and the lack of crowds of people - the most comfortable conditions.  However, spending all the time in May on the beach (alternating swimming with sunbathing) is not yet realistic. </p>
