    <h2>  Options, design and ergonomics </h2><p>  Although the dimensions of this smartphone are quite impressive, but the manufacturer himself attributes it to the class of medium-sized devices.  It turns out that there is no reason to expect anything unusual in the configuration.  Everything in this case is quite boilerplate: </p><ul><li>  Smartphone with overall dimensions of 170 x 86.5 mm.  At the same time, its thickness is 8.7 mm and the weight is only 170 grams, which is very small for a phablet with such dimensions. </li><li>  A battery with a capacity of 3000 milliamps / hours. </li><li>  The usual stereo headset.  The sound quality in it is very mediocre, but this will be enough for the average average music lover.  But music lovers better immediately think about buying another, better speaker system. </li><li>  The cord and the adapter in one person - "MicroUSB" - "USB".  He charges the battery, and allows you to connect to a PC. </li><li>  Charger with output "YUSB". </li></ul><p>  There is also a mandatory user manual and, of course, a <span>warranty card.</span>  <span>Screen protector</span> and case are not included with the Lenovo S930.  The front panel of the gadget is made of ordinary glossy plastic.  So without a special protective film can not do.  The side ribs are made of nickel-plated iron and the back cover is made of polycarbonate.  The volume and off buttons are grouped on the right edge of the device, and the touch buttons are located under the display.  All this allows, if necessary, to control the smartphone only with the fingers of one hand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone lenovo s930 reviews" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/584531.jpg" width="500"></div>  But still, 6 inches impose their "imprint" on the ease of management, with such dimensions it is still better to do this with both hands.

Still, MT6582 with 4 revision cores ‚ÄúA7‚Äù and a peak frequency of 1300 MHz is not enough already today.  But still, most of the tasks with the help of its computing capabilities can be solved.  This is watching movies, and playing music, and reading books, and surfing the World Wide Web.  Also, Lenovo S930 will cope with most games without problems.  An exception in this regard are only the most demanding toys of the latest generation, which require large CPU resources.  The situation is similar with the Mali-400MP2 graphics card.  As noted earlier, the display diagonal of this smartphone is an impressive 6 inches.  It processes a maximum of 5 touches at a time.  Its resolution is 1280 x 720, it displays over 16 million color shades.  Also, it is based on a high-quality IPS matrix, which makes viewing angles close to 180 degrees.  The S930 main camera is based on a rather modest 8 megapixel matrix.  Its capabilities are complemented by an autofocus system, LED flash and digital zoom.  As a result, the quality of the photographs is at an acceptable level, both for the average price range.  The second camera, located on the front panel, is based on a 1.6 megapixel sensor and is great for making video calls. </p><h2>  And what about the memory </h2><p>  The amount of memory installed in the Lenovo S930 mobile phone is not satisfactory.  The amount of RAM in it is 1 GB.  And the built-in drive has a size of 8 GB.  If desired, this value can be increased by 32 GB by inserting an external flash card standard MicroSD.  All this in total provides a smooth and comfortable operation on this device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Autonomy and battery </h2><p>  Not very resistant, as for such a large-sized device, the battery is installed in the <span>Lenovo S930</span> phone <span>.</span>  <span>Reviews of the</span> owners of the gadget indicate that one charge in most cases is enough for 12 hours of battery life.  That is, this smartphone must be charged every night.  Although the <span>battery capacity</span> is an impressive 3000 milliamps / hours, it‚Äôs also 6 inches diagonal.  Do not forget about the processor, which consists of 4 cores.  In general, it is difficult to say how long the battery can last in such an intensive mode.  But you can immediately purchase <span>an external battery</span> with the MicroUSB connection interface and at least somehow solve the problem of autonomy.  Of course, this will ruin the appearance of the smartphone, but at the right time it will not let you down. </p><h2>  BY </h2><p>  It works under the control of the outdated, but at the same time the currently most popular version of the Android mobile OS with number 4.2, the Lenovo S930 SILVER smartphone.  Overview <strong> </strong>  set settings indicates the presence of "Lenovo Laucher".  Its main task is the ability to customize the interface to the needs of the user, and he copes with this excellently.  A standard set of utilities is also installed: calculator, calendar and browser.  In addition, a set of programs from Google was installed.  Chinese programmers have not forgotten about social networks.  In this case, we are talking about Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.  The rest of the software the owner will have to download and install from the "Android" -market. </p>

    <h2>  Data exchange </h2><p>  Lenovo mobile phones are always equipped with a rich set of communication capabilities.  S930 in this regard was no exception.  First of all, it is worth highlighting the support of ZhSM and 3Zh networks.  Moreover, they fully and simultaneously work.  That is, both SIM cards are constantly in active mode.  ZhSM networks allow transmitting information at speeds up to 500 kbit / s, and 3Z - up to 15 Mbit / s.  In the first case, you can chat on social networks or upload simple websites.  But ‚Äú3‚Äù allows you to fully work with any amount of data, and even make video calls.  There is also a ‚ÄúWi-Fi‚Äù, the capabilities of which are similar to networks of the 3rd generation.  True, the speed in this case is much higher - 150 Mbit / s, but the radius of action is reduced to 10, a maximum of 15 meters.  Another important wireless interface is Bluetooth.  It has a low speed and a small radius of action (similar to "Wai-Fai").  But in the case when you need to transfer a small amount of information from one tablet or smartphone to another, it will be very difficult to do without it.  The set of wired interfaces on this smartphone will be more modest.  There is only MicroUSB and 3.5 mm for connecting external speakers. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  This phone has been selling quite successfully for quite some time.  Therefore, you can already find a lot of reviews about it.  Most of them show the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  The large diagonal of the display, which in this case is fantastic 6 inches with a good resolution (1280 x 720). </li><li>  Well-honed hardware.  The interaction of RAM, the graphics adapter and the central processor is not satisfactory. </li><li>  Optimized power consumption.  The battery lasts for 7 hours of video playback in very high quality. </li><li>  The sound is impeccable.  Both low and high frequencies are felt. </li></ul><p>  But he has one drawback - the unstable operation of the firmware.  But if desired, this minus can be eliminated by reinstalling the software.  At the same time, the price of it is only 190 dollars.  That for a device of this class and with such parameters is quite a bit. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  An excellent combination of excellent technical characteristics and low cost is the Lenovo S930.  One significant drawback of this smartphone is its low battery capacity.  But it‚Äôs impossible to put a battery with a larger capacity in such a thin case.  Otherwise, this is a great mid-range smartphone with a very large screen size, which in this case is fantastic 6 inches. </p>
