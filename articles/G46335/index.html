    <h2>  Who is a tax collector </h2><p>  In short, the tax collector is an old word that describes a person whose service is to collect taxes from ordinary people.  It is not surprising that at that time these people were so treated in society!  And at all times, people who ripped off the poor were not held in high esteem among the people.  What then prompted Jesus, the Son of God, to sit among such people who were not respected at all?  What role did these people occupy in those days and throughout history?  Let's try to understand these issues. </p><h2>  What did the publicans in Rome do? </h2><p>  In the Roman Empire, the collection of taxes on land was carried out by Roman military leaders.  This system was well regulated.  However, in principle, anyone who possessed the corresponding influence could have the power to export or import goods transported through the country by merchants.  It was enough to get the necessary permission.  But this privilege could cost a considerable amount of financial resources.  When such "tax collectors", or pickers, were engaged in their work, they could profit from tax revenues that far exceeded the amount of their usual rate.  True, all this activity was not carried out at all as easily as it might seem.  Subcontractors or supervisors constantly monitored the lawfulness of tax collection in some parts of their territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Zacchaeus and Matthew - tax collectors of the time of Christ </h2><p>  As we read the <span>scriptures,</span> we find information about a tax collector named Zacchaeus.  From the Gospel of Luke, the nineteenth chapter, verses one and two, we learn that he was most likely the chief placed over other tax collectors or tax collectors.  Publican Matthew is the next one whom we learn from the Word of God - the Bible.  Jesus, the Son of the Creator, appointed him an apostle or ‚Äúmessenger‚Äù (as comes from the literal translation of the word).  Apparently, Matthew was not only involved in collecting taxes in Capernaum, but also had his own tax office in this city. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The tax collectors in ancient Russia are" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23824/538786.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Why publicans were not respected </h2><p>  People like Zacchaeus and Matthew were treated with deep contempt and disrespect in those days.  They overstated the taxes levied on ordinary people; these people were not very much honored by their compatriots.  Also in the scriptures we find information that some Jews considered abhorrent to even eat with such people.  They were treated like sinners and placed on a par with public prostitutes.  The Jews expressed their contempt for these people because they supported the Roman Empire, which consisted of what was believed to be ‚Äúunclean‚Äù pagans.  If such a person were lying unconscious on the street, then hardly anyone would have helped him. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tax collectors and Christ </h2><p>  However, reading the Gospel that tells about the life of the Lord Jesus, we notice how strikingly the views he taught differed from those generally accepted at that time.  We do not read anywhere that Matthew or Zacchaeus continued to deceive people after becoming Christians.  On the contrary, as we learn from the Bible, Matthew left his office in order to follow his Lord.  No wonder Christ valued this man so much!  He himself repeatedly said: ‚ÄúNot healthy people need a doctor, but patients,‚Äù thereby showing that the tax collector is not such a hopeless person, as the majority thought at that time.  Moreover, the way in which Matthew wrote his story about the life of Christ delights many connoisseurs of world literature.  ‚ÄúReading his gospel,‚Äù they say, ‚Äúyou feel how warmly he speaks of his Lord.‚Äù  It is evident that the message of the Son of God found feedback in the hearts of even those who in the eyes of others found only contempt. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Publican Matthew" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23824/538814.jpg" width="208"></div></h2><h2>  What does the word "publican" mean? </h2><p>  In order to better understand the meaning of the word publican, one must investigate the origin of this very concept.  It turns out that in the old days the words "washes" and "washes" meant the points where vehicles were inspected on land and on water.  All kinds of duties that were imposed on them, imposed an unbearable burden on the people.  The tax collectors in ancient Russia - these were often "thieves in law" - bandits whom they did not like.  In the Ozhegov dictionary, this word is given a simple definition.  According to him, the tax collector is a tax collector in Judea.  And Dahl's dictionary complements <span>this definition.</span>  It contains some additional information.  According to this dictionary, the tax collector is a collector of washes in Russia.  Two others come from this word - "to scrub" and "toll."  According to the vocabulary of Ozhegov and Shvedova, the first concept conveys the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgiving someone ordeal or suffering, and the second indicates torment or suffering.  Obviously, the word "publican" has become synonymous with a cruel person, a sadist, who gives other suffering.  Already by this we can judge the reputation that these people had.  Previously, various ancient professions were condemned, but especially this one. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Meaning of the word publican" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23824/538819.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><p>  Obviously, close in meaning to the word "tax collector" is such a concept as "wash" or "ordeal", which means to transfer to hire or take (Dahl's dictionary).  This word, among other things, may mean someone else's disease, illness or suffering.  In addition to all this, this word can indicate someone who lives at someone else‚Äôs expense or is parasitic. </p><h2>  "Ordeal" in Russia </h2><p>  In those days, all the duty or tax collected by tax collectors went to ensure the princes owning one or another inheritance.  They had the right to allow or not to allow washing in their territory.  For example, when two princes agreed on joint cooperation, then the first and second were obliged, out of courtesy, to allow merchants to transport their goods across the territory of another without unnecessary obstacles.  At that time it was called ‚Äúwithout frontier‚Äù (that is, without borders) or ‚Äúwithout clues‚Äù (that is, without obstacles). </p>

    <p>  If there were those who in every possible way wanted to avoid paying the mandatory tax, then such people could be fined for violating the oral law.  Such a fine was called "washed."  From here comes the word ‚Äúwash‚Äù, which is consonant with the modern ‚Äúsquander‚Äù, which, obviously, indicated penalties, because of which a person could lose his last property. </p><h2>  Types of taxes </h2><p>  In those days, several types of such "wash" were distinguished.  We fell under the ordeal, as we already learned, both land trading routes and water routes.  Therefore, several types of wash were distinguished: ‚Äúfloating wash‚Äù, ‚Äúcoastal wash‚Äù, ‚Äúbridges‚Äù and ‚Äúland wash‚Äù.  Such a duty tax could be paid in cash or by the same goods.  Mostovshchina meant paying taxes when traveling through bridges. </p><p>  In addition to all of the above types, the tax was levied for the transport of goods, its simple and its sale.  It is not surprising that for ordinary people, and even for the prosperous, this was tantamount to bullying. </p>

    <h2>  Tatar-Mongols and duties </h2><p>  The Tatar-Mongols increased the already heavy burden of the people.  Since the Horde conquest, they introduced a new type of wash, which was called "tamga".  If someone wanted to participate in trading in the market squares or fairs that were so popular at that time, he also had to pay this type of tax.  According to Ozhegov‚Äôs dictionary, tamga is a duty that was levied by the customs service for the stamps attached.  The size of this tax depended not on how much was shipped in one place or another, but on how much a particular product was worth.  In a similar way, even monasteries could approve tenders on their territory and take tamga from the goods that were brought.  These were the ancient professions. </p><h2>  Modern publicans </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax collector" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23824/538832.jpg" width="340"></div></h2><p>  It is worth noting that the tax collector is a profession that has always been pursued by ordinary people, and even in our time, people who deprive the latter of ordinary people are hated by others.  Today you can also meet a lot of dishonesty in government circles in charge of taxes.  Thus, the customs service, which is engaged in checking luggage and verifies the certification of goods transported abroad, is also often dishonest.  You can hear a huge number of complaints about slow service and delay in order to fetch at least one of the people.  Thus, the customs service today is the same as tax collectors in ancient times. </p><h2>  Jump into history </h2><p>  As we learned from this article, tax collectors in ancient Russia were those people whom they did not like very much.  We also learned how Christ, the Son of God, related to such people.  In addition, we had the opportunity to draw a parallel with our time, with various tax offices and customs services. </p>
