tries to help domestic tourists.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">At least in 2017 it was just that.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">None of the hotel employees, including the waiters, show greed about a tip.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span
