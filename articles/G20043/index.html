The same goes for consumer electronics, Russian phones and tablet computers have never claimed to be flagships.  They will never find world recognition, but they are very popular in the homeland, where the consumer is not used to spending money on high technologies and always appreciated the ratio of cost and quality with a significant bias towards a low price tag. </p><p>  The St. Petersburg company TeXet realized this situation and began to develop extremely cheap devices charged with the most worthy (for their value) set of features and accessories, which compares favorably with many manufacturers from Korea and China.  Devices are focused on solving simple problems, reading books, searching for information on the Internet, listening to music and so on.  Their devices can not cope with complex tasks and games, so the main target audience is schoolchildren, students.  One such device was the TeXet TM 7043XD tablet. </p>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  One of the important features of TeXet is its approach to supplying its gadgets.  In addition to the device itself, in the box there is always a place for a lot of convenient accessories, covers, headphones and the like.  In fact, a person does not acquire a device, but a whole set.  TeXet TM 7043XD was not an exception, with which it is delivered: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  A small brochure with instructions for working with a tablet computer. </li><li>  USB cable for charging the device and connecting to a computer (for synchronization, data exchange). </li><li>  Adapter for connecting to the mains. </li><li>  OTG cable for connecting additional devices (physical keyboards for more comfortable working with text, gamepads and others). </li><li>  Complete headphones. </li><li>  Case. </li></ul><p>  Not everyone, even an advanced manufacturer, can boast of such a rich basic kit.  Despite the fact that the wires are not of the best quality, and the headphones have a mediocre sound, in most cases these accessories will be enough for comfortable work with the device.  Also, one cannot fail to note the multifunctional and comfortable case with stand. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  - Dimensions: 188x125x10 mm. </p><p>  - Weight - 300 grams. </p><p>  <span>The</span> TeXet TM 7043XD <span>tablet computer</span> has a classic design, akin to that used in other devices of the manufacturer.  Most of the front of the tablet is occupied by the display panel, with fairly massive (by modern standards) frames around.  On the one hand, this approach limits the useful space on the front side of the gadget, on the other hand, the frames allow you to hold the device with great comfort, avoiding accidental touches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the back of the device you can find the camera, the manufacturer‚Äôs logo, as well as a plastic insert under which the antenna is installed. </p><p>  The back of the TeXet TM 7043XD, unlike most representatives of this price category, is made not of low-grade ‚Äúsoft-touch‚Äù plastic, but of aluminum, and not of the cheapest series.  The device case is characterized by good ergonomics, resistance to damage, chips and small scratches. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  Unlike its counterparts, TeXet TM 7043XD, at a similar cost, offers a significantly better display.  Like other gadgets of this family, the tablet is equipped with a 7-inch display.  Its resolution is 1280 by 800 pixels.  It cannot be called particularly clear, nevertheless, there are 216 inches per inch, which is already enough for comfortable use and even reading. </p><p>  The tablet computer has a standard IPS-matrix, the quality of which is poor.  The brightness is not impressive, the contrast is also weak.  The viewing angles leave a more or less neutral impression, even with a serious tilt, the device can be used. </p><p>  The multitouch sensor, which can in no way be called a wooden one, is pleased, it responds to touch instantly, with an average load, the interface almost does not lag behind and does not annoy with incorrect recognition of gestures and taps.  At a higher load, the system already starts to slow down, as a result of which there is a feeling that the touch panel is unstable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The display is protected by an oleophobic coated glass panel.  Glass is protected from fingerprints.  At the same time, it is quite easily soiled and not too strong, quickly collects small scratches.  There are problems using the gadget in the sun, because there is no anti-reflective coating. </p><p>  The display is widescreen, which has a positive effect on watching movies (black areas in videos and films are significantly reduced). </p>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The heart of the device is the little-known and virtually unchallenged dual-core chip from Amlogic.  Each core individually can achieve acceleration up to 1500 megahertz.  The power of this chip will be enough for everyday needs and for the operation of the pre-installed system as a whole. </p><p>  For graphics performance, the Mali-400 processor is responsible.  In principle, the power of this video card should be enough to run simple games, as well as AAA projects released between 2010 and 2013. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Despite the fact that ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù is unsuitable for working with such a small amount of memory, under the hood of the gadget there was a place for only one gigabyte of RAM.  Because of this feature of the tablet, you will have to put up with the fact that applications will be unloaded from RAM quite often. </p><p>  As for the main physical memory, the device has 8 gigabytes of flash memory.  Of course, this is not enough, but the situation can be corrected with a microSD memory card.  Supported cards up to 32 gigabytes. </p><h2>  Shooting quality </h2><p>  <span>The TeXet</span> TM 7043XD tablet, whose specifications are not brilliant anyway, has received very modest cameras. </p><p>  There is no need to talk about the high quality of photos in a budget device.  Therefore, two very mediocre photomodules were installed in the tablet. </p><p>  The main lens is 2 megapixels (without autofocus), capable of performing a utilitarian function, photographing documents, business cards, any necessary information.  Creating a photo masterpiece with such a low-quality camera will not work, the picture is grainy, the detail suffers. </p><p>  The second lens is located in the front.  A regular VGA (0.3 megapixel) selfie camera that can handle video calls without any problems. </p>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The battery for the TeXet TM 7043XD tablet is at the level of modern smartphones, the battery capacity is only 3200 milliamps hours.  Given the fact that the gadget works on the basis of ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù of the 4th generation, you can‚Äôt even dream of long-term operation on a single charge.  The only thing that saves the TeXet TM 7043XD's tablet performance, which is so weak in this regard, is HD resolution and a weak economical chip that allow the gadget to survive a working day (nevertheless, you should take care of buying an additional portable battery). </p><p>  Tests showed that the average operating time when watching a video reaches 5-6 hours. </p><h2>  Wireless interfaces and ports </h2><p>  Mostly wireless technologies passed TeXet TM 7043XD, the only thing that went to the tablet was an old Wi-Fi module (802.11n) with support for one frequency. </p><p>  The problem with the wireless connection can be solved with the help of a 3G modem, which is connected via a USB port. </p><p>  Of the ports, you can highlight the presence of micro-HDMI support.  It is possible to connect the tablet to the TV and broadcast content on large screens (photo materials, films, games, and so on). </p>

    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  Any modern gadget is a set of programs that determine its capabilities.  Therefore, it is important to pay special attention to the software part of the device, the system and the shell used.  The hero of this review works on the basis of the Android operating system version 4.1.  At the same time, third-party shells are not used on the tablet, which cannot but rejoice (pure ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù wins in performance).  This fact can be safely written to the pros of TeXet TM 7043XD.  The firmware is still not without preinstalled software.  The system has a whole set of duplicate applications created by the Yandex team.  Among them are ‚ÄúNavigator‚Äù, ‚ÄúMaps‚Äù, ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù and others. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Today it is almost impossible to purchase such a copy, since officially the manufacturer completed its sale.  Nevertheless, the gadget can still be found in online stores and buy for nothing. </p><p>  The average price of a TeXet TM 7043XD with a memory capacity of 8 gigabytes is 3600-4300 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Those who have already purchased a tablet and managed to test it for some time leave very mixed reviews.  There were many critics who considered the model to be absolutely a failure and unworthy of attention.  A lot of those who liked the device.  And someone just adequately evaluates the capabilities of the device, based on its cost. </p><p>  There are a number of annoying issues that plague the TeXet TM 7043XD: </p><ul><li>  Battery.  Yes, in theory, a battery can withstand daylight hours.  Alas, in fact, every user experiences problems in this area.  Many even say that a tablet computer is not capable of living for two hours. </li><li>  Weak Wi-Fi signal.  Many users complain about the speed of the connection, and it's not even about supporting the old frequencies, but the modem.  Problems also affected the stability of the compound, which often broke and was lost for a long time. </li></ul><p>  Among the advantages of the device, called by the users themselves, it is worth highlighting: </p><ul><li>  Performance.  Oddly enough, the vast majority of those who bought this engineering miracle from TeXet were satisfied with the speed of work.  Moreover, many say that the tablet is capable of working with modern games of the level Most Wanted. </li><li>  Body.  Nevertheless, aluminum is much nicer than plastic, therefore, users note primarily tactile sensations from working with the tablet.  Also, the rear panel was very resistant to wear. </li><li>  Display.  Many users are pleased with the picture and aspect ratio of the tablet, and this despite the modest resolution. </li></ul>
