Wagons of both trains were built at the <span>Tver Carriage Works.</span>  A distinctive feature of these modern trains is much larger capacity compared to conventional ones. </p><h2>  Fare </h2><p>  Travel in each of these two-story trains will cost a little cheaper than in a regular train.  However, only if the ticket is purchased in advance.  The less free space remains in the cars, the more expensive they cost.  A ticket for the double-decker <span>train Moscow</span> - Adler, purchased in advance, will cost about 4000 rubles.  A train ticket to St. Petersburg costs about 1300 p.  Sale for a flight starts as usual - 45 days before departure. </p><p>  Both double-decker trains are classified as branded.  There are no <span>reserved seats</span> in them.  In addition to the compartment there are several CB.  The capacity of one car is 64 seats.  This was mainly the reason for reducing the cost of travel on a double-decker train.  For comparison: a car usually has only 39 seats. </p>

    <h2>  Features of the composition </h2><p>  The double-decker train differs from the usual one primarily in the height of the wagons.  The fifth-generation locomotive EP-20 is lucky, capable of operating both on alternating and <span>direct current.</span>  Tall wagons have a modern appearance.  Each has a proprietary abbreviation for Russian Railways, written in red letters, clearly visible on a gray background. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The restaurant of the adler staff is designed for 60 seats, St. Petersburg - for 48. Two waitresses serve visitors.  The restaurant is located on the second floor of the train.  As in conventional formulations, food is also sold several times a day in the corridors.  In addition to the restaurant, a double-decker train also has a bar for eight people.  It is located on the ground floor.  Next to it is the kitchen.  Two elevators connect it to the restaurant.  One of them is designed to lift up ready-made dishes, and the second - to lower dirty dishes down. </p><h2>  Disabled Facilities </h2><p>  The convenience of these two new trains can be attributed to the fact that they provide cars specifically designed for people with disabilities.  Their distinctive features are wide corridors.  Passengers can move on them directly in a carriage.  A special lift is provided at the entrance to the car.  Thus, a disabled person can get into the double-decker train itself (a photo of it can be seen on the page) without getting up from the stroller. </p><h2>  Ground floor </h2><p>  Most passengers who have already managed to ride these trains speak of them as quite comfortable.  Wagons are a bit more crowded than usual, but quite comfortable.  The corridors are a little over two meters high.  The doors in the compartment can be closed / opened using a magnetic card.  Traveling by train is completely safe - the passages between the cars are airtight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  <span>The branded train is</span> two-story - the composition, judging by the reviews, among other things, is also very clean.  Smoking in the vestibules is prohibited.  Each carriage has three dry closets.  You can use them, including at stops.  Containers for sorting garbage are also available on the train. </p><h2>  Second floor </h2><p>  A rather well-equipped staircase leads upstairs from the first floor.  Its steps are highlighted, but you can hold on to comfortable handrails.  A trash container is installed on the floor.  A panoramic spherical mirror is suspended above it.  Passengers descending the stairs can see those ascending, and vice versa. </p><p>  The second floor of the train is very similar to the first.  The only difference is that the ceiling is slightly slanted and the windows are very low - at the level of an adult's belt. </p><h2>  Train compartment </h2><p>  Passengers who bought a ticket on a branded train Moscow - Adler two-story or to St. Petersburg can settle in very well.  Compartments in these compositions are quite comfortable and well equipped.  Each of them is designed for four people.  The length of the shelves in the compartment is slightly less than in the wagons of conventional trains.  However, even tall people can sit on them more or less comfortably.  The only thing - to sit at full height on the second shelf does not work.  The ceilings on both floors are pretty low.  Third luggage racks in the compartment and SV are not provided.  Suitcases can only be placed under the bottom. </p>

    <p>  The lighting in the compartment is LED, and next to each of the two lower shelves, wall sockets for charging phones and laptops are built into the wall.  Available in double decker trains and free Wi-Fi.  Communication is provided by Megafon.  In addition, each compartment has a separate radio point.  Increases ride comfort and climate control.  However, unfortunately, it is impossible to regulate the temperature in each individual compartment. </p><p>  The windows throughout the train are equipped with modern soundproof double-glazed windows.  In SV cars, there are liquid crystal monitors designed to view video programs. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  When boarding a double-decker train, as in any company train, passengers are given bedding.  The ticket price also includes a sanitary-hygienic set, a press, boiled water during the whole trip and rations.  The latter includes bottled drinking water, jam, cracker, chicken paste, mustard, mayonnaise, waffles.  As with regular trains, tea is distributed periodically.  The hygiene package includes a spoon, fork, knife, toothpick, paper towel. </p>

    <p>  Both double-decker trains are escorted by police officers.  In order for them to observe the order in the wagons, video cameras are placed in the corridors. </p><h2>  Double-decker train: reviews </h2><p>  As already mentioned, passengers have a good opinion of these trains.  First of all, the low fare and the absence of standard inconveniences of Russian trains are noted: closed toilets at stops, heat or cold in cars, idle boilers, etc. </p><p>  The disadvantages of these trains passengers include primarily a certain cramped cars.  Clean and comfortable toilets are also what a double-decker train boasts.  Reviews in this regard about him are also very good.  However, sometimes it is smoked in toilets.  Smoking in the vestibules of both compounds is prohibited.  Therefore, some passengers do it in the toilet.  Causes certain inconvenience and lack of third shelves.  If there is too much luggage, there is simply nowhere to put it. </p><h2>  Composition Schedule </h2><p>  A double-decker train moves a little faster than usual.  The average speed is about 160 km / h.  The schedule is designed so that most passengers are on the road the least time.  From Moscow to Adler, a two-story train can be reached in about 25 hours.  To St. Petersburg - in 8 hours. </p>

    <p>  As you can see, the double-decker train (photos confirm this) can be estimated as quite convenient and comfortable.  A ticket is inexpensive, and the train moves very quickly.  So you can even come to terms with some crowding. </p>
