  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The origin of belief and how to hang a horseshoe</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The horseshoe has long been considered a "happy" element of decor.  But do you know what are the reasons for this attitude to the horseshoe?  After all, this is not exclusively a Russian tradition.  Many countries also believe in the ‚Äúmiraculous‚Äù power of the horseshoe.  Do you know how to hang a horseshoe correctly?  Let's take a closer look at this element of ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù. </p><p>  The belief that a horseshoe brings happiness arose in time immemorial.  No one remembers why such a belief arose. </p><p>  According to one version, such a belief arose in ancient Egypt.  The reason for the belief in the luck of the horseshoe was the pharaoh.  Driving on his chariot past the jubilant crowd, he had no idea what would cause such a belief.  The fact is that the horses that pulled his chariot could accidentally lose a horseshoe.  You understand that this is a very real situation.  But the fact is that these horseshoes were made of gold.  And some simple Egyptian who found such a horseshoe was reasonably happy to find a piece of gold on the road ... As you can see, the Egyptians did not get up the question of how to hang a horseshoe correctly. </p><p>  Another version describes a slightly different situation.  According to legend, the devil himself appeared in the form of a horse to a noble blacksmith.  You understand, not just like that, but in order to tempt him.  But the ideologically savvy blacksmith immediately understood the situation, if only the horse began to incite him to dark affairs ... And in order to discourage the evil one, he shod it.  And so that the devil did not forget science and did not appear anymore in the forge, he hung a horseshoe above the door.  As they say, since then people hang horseshoes over the door to scare away evil.  And how to hang a horseshoe? </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The stories of the origin of faith in the "miraculous" power of the horseshoe, as you see, are quite interesting.  However, over time, the ‚Äúspecialization‚Äù of the horseshoe has changed somewhat.  Now she just brings happiness.  Now, as over the past centuries, a horseshoe is also considered an object that brings happiness and protection. </p><p>  Finding a horseshoe is a very good sign.  In some countries, there is a certain practice of actions when finding: you need to raise the horseshoe, then remember the <span>cherished desire,</span> throw the horseshoe over your shoulder and not looking back to move on.  But it‚Äôs more customary for us to pick up such a valuable find and nail over the entrance to the house. </p><p>  How to nail a horseshoe?  It is not strange, different nations have their own practice.  In most countries of the world, horseshoes are set with their horns down, as they say - "so that happiness pours."  But in England and Ireland, horseshoes are hung with their horns up, so, according to popular beliefs, happiness does not "flow out" of the house.  In Mexico, a horseshoe is decorated with ribbons and coins and hung very high, but it is generally forbidden to touch it.  In Italy, there is a belief that a horseshoe should be hung so that every guest at home hurts her for happiness.  In Russia, as in most countries, a tradition has been established of hanging a horseshoe with its horns down. </p><p>  But supporters of Feng Shui philosophy hang the horseshoe with their horns so that there is always a full bowl in the house.  According to this version, energy comes from space to the earth, and the horseshoe is its conductor, and therefore it is necessary to install it with its horns up.  If the horseshoe is hung with its horns down, then the energy will go to the ground.  As you can see, how many people - there are so many opinions.  So how to hang a horseshoe?  Actually - choose using intuition.  You understand that this is more a matter of faith.  As you believe, it will be rewarded to you. </p><p>  Speaking of a horseshoe.  The most ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù is the horseshoe that was found by chance.  If you have not met your horseshoe yet, you can buy it.  So how to hang a horseshoe?  Convex side up, as is done in Russia or in accordance with the philosophy of Feng Shui?  Can test in practice the power of luck horseshoe?  Hang it first in one position and if you feel good, leave it in the position in which it was.  If luck doesn‚Äôt really smile at you, hang the horseshoe on the other side.  Have a good experiment! </p>
