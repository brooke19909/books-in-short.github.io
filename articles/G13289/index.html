    <p>  Of the large cities along the way - Biysk, the gate to the Altai mountains and the beginning of the Chuysky tract.  The city was founded in 1708 by decree of Peter I. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Further along the route is the birthplace of Vasily Shukshin, the village of Srostki.  Here you can visit the Shukshin Museum and Mount Picket, where Shukshin readings are held every year in the month of July. </p><p>  Moving along the Chuysky tract, you will see Mount Babyrgan, if you wish, you can climb there.  It takes about two hours.  Next is the stella on the border with the Altai Republic.  We cross the border, in front of us is the village of Maima - a suburb of Gorno-Altaysk.  At the 452nd km is Rybalka village and a large number of pointers to recreation centers, campsites and other tourist sites.  <span>The Katun River</span> in all its glory appears before you on this section of the tract.  The main tourist complexes of Altai are concentrated here. </p><p>  At 455 km you can see the suspension bridge over Katun, although it‚Äôs inactive.  A little further - a new bridge that leads to Lake Aya and the village of the same name, as well as to the village of Altai. </p><p>  Aya Lake is located in a nature park.  Moving on, we find ourselves in the vicinity of the village of Manzherok.  It is worth visiting the Manzherok spring, the rapids - the Manzherok Gate and <span>Lake Manzherok.</span>  The attraction of the lake is chilim, or water chestnut listed in the Red Book. </p><p>  Going on a trip to the Altai mountains by car, visit <span>Mount Sinyuhu</span> near Manzherok.  In winter you can visit the ski resort, and in summer you will be offered ATV excursions, rafting and motor rafting. </p><p>  Tavdinsky caves are another important point of the Chuysky tract.  The first cave of Maiden Tears is located seventy meters from the road, then another one, from which a beautiful view of Katun.  There are about thirty caves in total. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The mineral spring with silver, copper and manganese, Arzhan-Suu, you will meet at 485 km. </p><p>  <span>Kamyshlinsky waterfall</span> on the Kamyshla river falls from a height of 12 meters.  Here you can stop for a halt. </p><p>  The endpoint in this route is the village of Ust-Sema.  To the left, the Chuysky tract goes to the border with Mongolia, directly - the road to Chemal. </p><p>  Such a route is suitable for traveling to Altai by car with children, since there are enough places along the road where you can relax and eat, the road itself is not very dangerous.  It is suitable for traveling with the whole family. </p><h2>  To Altai from Krasnoyarsk </h2><p>  If you travel to Altai by car from Krasnoyarsk, you can, as with the option from Novosibirsk, get to Biysk, and then follow another route.  But it is more suitable for a group of adults, as it involves hiking trails, somewhere even dangerous. </p>

    <h2>  Other options </h2><p>  Eco-hotel "Altika", recreation center "Tursib", the complex "Own Homestead", camp site "Mountain Fairy Tale", Park Hotel Aya are also suitable if you went on a trip to Altai by car with children.  Yes, and you can always drop by the attractive cottage and find out the prices of what is offered, whether there is food and so on.  A journey through the Altai by car is a savage and involves an overnight stay in tents. </p>
