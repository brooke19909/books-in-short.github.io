    <h2>  An amazing find of the spouses Lika </h2><p>  Louis and Mary Leakey were anthropologists to the core.  Their friends often joked about who they love more - science or each other.  Indeed, the family of scientists spent all their time studying the fossil remains and the numerous archaeological excavations that they carried out in all corners of the planet. </p><p>  And in November 1960, they stumbled upon what would later become one of the most controversial discoveries of the 20th century.  While excavating in the Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania), the couple unearthed a well-preserved saber-toothed tiger skeleton.  It would seem that what might be interesting in such a find?  But no, nearby lay what made their heart beat a hundred times faster. </p><p>  A few steps from the tiger, they saw the remains of an unknown hominid science.  Among them was a fragment of the skull, collarbone and part of the leg.  After a thorough analysis of the bones, the spouses of Lika came to the conclusion that in front of them was a child 10-12 years old, who died more than 2 million years ago, who, most likely, was the progenitor of the entire human race. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Homo habilis: characteristic of the species </h2><p>  The find of Louis and Mary was the first, but not the last.  Soon, other archaeologists also began to dig up the remains of the Homo habilis.  It is noteworthy that almost all hominid bones were found in South and East Africa.  In this regard, scientists came to the conclusion that this species appeared in these lands and only at the end of its existence migrated to other lands. </p><p>  Given the age of the remains found, it becomes clear that the first Homo habilis appeared approximately 2.5 million years ago.  Its further evolution took no less than 600 thousand years.  But this is not important.  What is more interesting is that this species was already able to stand firmly on two legs, as evidenced by the toes brought together. </p><p>  The rest of the homo habilis was more like primates than human.  On average, his height did not exceed 130 cm, and the weight was supposed to fluctuate between 30-50 kg.  Against the background of the body, long arms stood out strongly, which in the recent past helped the higher primates to climb trees.  However, as the species developed, their upper limbs decreased, and the lower ones, on the contrary, became more muscular. </p><h2>  Family ties </h2><p>  For almost half a century, there has been heated debate about the role played by Homo habilis in the general spectacle of evolution.  It is only known for certain that he appeared at the sunset of the existence of Australopithecus.  Given their many similarities, scientists came to the conclusion that a skilled person became the next steps of an extinct species.  However, there are those who believe that these are two completely different hominids, having a common ancestor in the past. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  No less controversial is the issue of the heritage of Homo habilis.  According to the generally accepted version, Homo erectus, the first upright descendant of man, became his successor.  The proof of this theory is the similarity of the found remains, as well as the time frame in which both species existed. </p>

    <h2>  What changed the world </h2><p>  Despite all the controversy, one fact has always remained unchanged.  On the day that the first Homo habilis appeared, the world changed forever.  The reason for this is a new skill that extolled these hominids over other creatures, namely the ability to think logically. </p><p>  Such changes have occurred due to the fact that the brain of a skilled person has significantly increased in size compared with their ancestors.  On average, it was about 500-700 cm³, which was quite impressive by those standards.  In addition, its structure has changed: the occipital part, responsible for instincts, has decreased, and the frontal, temporal and parietal, on the contrary, have increased in size. </p><p>  But a much more impressive discovery was that the brain of Homo habilis turned out to have the beginnings of Brock's center.  And, as science knows, it is this appendage that is responsible for processing speech.  And, most likely, it was <span>these hominids who</span> first began to use combinations of sounds, which later developed into a full-fledged language. </p>

    <h2>  Lifestyle features </h2><p>  Unlike his ancestors, Homo habilis rarely climbed a tree.  Now the former "house" served only as a source of food or a temporary haven for relaxation.  The reason for this was the deformation of the hind limbs, which adapted to long transitions on the ground, but because of this they lost their former grip.  But as a refuge, a skilled person more and more often began to use caves that could protect him from bad weather and wild animals. </p><p>  However, in one place, a hominid tribe rarely lingered, especially if it consisted of many families.  And all because our ancestors still did not know how to grow food, and natural resources too quickly depleted.  Therefore, they led a predominantly <span>nomadic lifestyle,</span> moving from one place to another. </p><h2>  Social structure </h2><p>  Scientists believe that in the Homo habilis tribe there was a hierarchy and distribution of responsibilities.  In particular, men were engaged in hunting and fishing, and women were picking berries and mushrooms.  At the same time, the tribe divided all the extracted products equally among themselves, thereby taking care of the offspring and disabled individuals. </p><p>  Scientists are also inclined to believe that at the head of all men was one leader.  Such a statement is more likely based on logic than on facts.  But most experts adhere to it, since a similar model of behavior is inherent in almost all higher primates. </p>

    <h2>  Implements Homo habilis </h2><p>  This species is not in vain called a skilled person.  In truth, he was the first representative of the human race to learn how to use and manufacture various tools.  Naturally, their quality and variety are very scarce, but the very fact of the existence of a craft is already a great achievement. </p><p>  All tools were made of stone or bones, sharpened on other objects.  Most often, archaeologists came across scrapers and knives that were obviously used for cutting meat.  The use of such objects has led to the fact that over the next 500 thousand years of evolution, the brush of Homo habilis was completely transformed into a palm capable of holding objects tightly. </p>
