    <h2>  Ordinary mobile or smartphone: what is better to buy a baby? </h2><p>  If the child uses the device only to contact his parents, then, of course, the simplest phone will be enough.  However, today children grow up so versed in technology that such an apparatus is simply not enough for them.  At 3-4 years old, they can easily use a smartphone on their own, not only playing applications, but also managing various programs. </p><p>  And indeed, in childhood there is always some kind of competition.  Moreover, earlier it was based on a comparison of who has the best toy.  Now, students boast multi-functional mobile.  If the family has an unresolved question about buying a phone for a child, then it is worth considering that a smartphone is no longer just a means of communication, but rather an image. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Smartphone for a student: what should it be? </h2><p>  Most parents, deciding to give their child a device for communication, choose primarily a budget smartphone.  For a child, this is the most ideal option for one simple reason: fidgets often lose or break devices, so buying an expensive mobile will be inappropriate.  Having dealt with this moment, it is worth moving on to two main features of choosing a smartphone for the baby.  Firstly, it should be attractive, and secondly, moderately functional. </p><p>  As for the appearance of the model, then parents should not have problems, since everyone chooses in accordance with their own taste.  But the functionality of the smartphone for the student should be considered in more detail.  Parameters to pay special attention to when buying a device: </p><ul><li>  Size and resolution of the display. </li><li>  Battery capacity </li><li>  Performance. </li></ul>

    <p>  The convenience of using the baby's phone will directly depend on these characteristics. </p><h2>  Display: not to spoil the vision </h2><p>  A good smartphone for children must have a large screen and a wide viewing angle.  If the phone has a small display, then the baby's eyes will get tired of constant voltage.  A wide viewing angle is needed due to the fact that children do not always hold the device directly in front of them - they can deflect it in different directions.  Therefore, they need clear visibility of the image from all sides, otherwise using the device may adversely affect vision.  Parents are better off staying on a model with an IPS screen, since it is this type of matrix that provides a large viewing angle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is very important that the display has excellent resolution.  Most modern models are equipped with HD-screens that support viewing images in 1280 * 720 pixels.  In this case, even a simple smartphone for the child will provide a bright and clear image on the display, as well as allow the baby to freely enjoy the graphics of his favorite cartoons and games. </p><h2>  Battery: to stay connected </h2><p>  Perhaps it‚Äôs not worth saying that a capacitive battery is simply necessary for a powerful smartphone, especially if it is intended for a child.  It is advisable that the device is not discharged for at least 6 hours, provided that the baby will actively use games and other applications.  To ensure this condition can only a device with a battery capacity of at least 4000 mAh.  In principle, in the modern technology market it is not at all difficult to find an apparatus with similar characteristics. </p><h2>  Performance: for smooth operation </h2><p>  A smartphone, which is a practical device, and not a ringing rattle, must be equipped with a powerful processor.  If this condition is not met, then on the device it will be impossible to calmly watch high-resolution videos and even more so play games.  For children, it is impossible to install nothing on a smartphone: they will download various applications, thereby clogging up RAM.  Therefore, the RAM in the phone should also be enough to withstand such ‚Äúattacks‚Äù. </p><p>  So, this concludes that a high-quality and justifiable smartphone is a model with a quad-core processor and at least 1 GB of RAM. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Protect your device from damage </h2><p>  None of us are safe from the fact that the smartphone can accidentally crash.  They dropped it or even just touched it with something - and that‚Äôs all, there was a scratch, or even a huge crack.  In babies, this happens much more often than in adults.  And it‚Äôs good if the phone can just be repaired.  Often, a device after a fall simply fails.  Therefore, choosing a <span>smartphone for children,</span> it is worth thinking about its protection. </p><p>  To maintain the integrity of the display, special transparent glasses are suitable.  They are glued to the screen, allowing it to be protected from scratches, scuffs and cracks.  You can find glasses of various price categories and brands on sale, but <span>Gorilla Glass</span> is the undisputed leader in this niche <span>.</span>  This manufacturer produces products for most existing smartphone models.  The degree of protection of glass is determined by the number after the product name. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone for a child of 9 years old" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35566/972646.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Is the mobile device safe for the baby? </h2><p>  When choosing a device to communicate with a child, many parents face a dilemma.  After all, I really want to give a child such a gift, but will this not affect his health?  It is known that all phones emit a certain amount of electromagnetic waves, determined by the value of SAR.  When choosing which smartphone is best for the child, it is worth paying attention to this particular inscription.  It is usually placed on the box with the device.  It is desirable that the radiation generated by the apparatus does not exceed 2 W / kg.  It is also worth abandoning models equipped with a GPS receiver.  Such devices emit increased radiation. </p><h2>  Operating system selection </h2><p>  At the moment, most mobile devices are based on the following operating systems: </p><ul><li>  Android </li><li>  Apple </li><li>  Windows Phone </li></ul><p>  The first system is the most common among modern devices, since it is quite simple to use.  As for Apple, devices based on it are considered the most reliable.  However, these smartphones can not be attributed to the budget, as they are extremely expensive.  The Windows Phone system, although it simplifies the synchronization of the device with the computer, but at the same time it consumes a lot of energy, which is why the phone quickly discharges.  From this we can conclude that the best smartphone for a child is an Android device. </p><h2>  The device for children of 5-10 years </h2><p>  Younger school age is a period when children learn everything that they see and hear around them, actively absorbing a huge amount of information.  They are interested in everything, they want to know and understand a lot.  Therefore, the main requirement when choosing a smartphone in this case is a capacious battery.  A small user will begin to use the device to its fullest, which means that a device with a weak battery will quickly discharge.  As a result, most of the time you will remain deprived of the opportunity to contact the child.  Additional requirements include a powerful processor and wide screen.  With a constant load of applications, a weak device will begin to provide information poorly.  So a smartphone for a child of 8 years old (or any other age close to this) should have a maximum of opportunities for constant and active use. </p><h2>  <span>Galaxy samsung</span> Star Plus is Duos </h2><p>  For the smallest by given parameters, the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Star Plus Duos will be an excellent choice.  This unit is equipped with all the functions that children need.  For example, it has a convenient 4-inch screen that supports multi-touch technology.  The phone also has a built-in 2 megapixel camera and a slot designed for flash cards.  For parents, a low price of the device - within $ 100, as well as a capacitive battery (up to 7 hours of work in the mode of watching movies and games) will be a nice bonus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone for child 8 years old" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35566/973411.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Device for children 12 years and older </h2><p>  A teenager like anyone else needs a phone that combines a lot of different functions.  Here you can‚Äôt do with a simple smartphone - you need something more modern and powerful.  If the budget allows, then you can purchase a flagship gadget that will surely impress the child.  Otherwise, you can get by with a more economical option, but at the same time pay attention to the functionality of the device.  If a smartphone for a child of 8 years old could still be an excellent choice with a large display and a powerful processor, then this will not be enough for older children.  It is desirable that the device was equipped with a good camera and camcorder, and also supports Bluetooth and 3G.  A child may need a large amount of space to store files, so it is better if the device has more than 16 GB of internal memory or a slot for installing a flash card. </p><h2>  Lenovo A5000 </h2><p>  Like all smartphones of this brand, this device is a very economical solution for parents.  For a nice price, you can get a great combination of features in one device.  Many parents have proven that the Lenovo A5000 is the perfect smartphone for a child.  Reviews inform that the phone remains in working condition for a long time even with active use.  This is due to the high battery capacity of 4000 mAh.  In addition, the smartphone screen has HD-resolution and a wide diagonal of 5 inches.  A powerful quad-core processor, as well as 1 GB of RAM, will become an advantage of the device.  Among the disadvantages of the device can be distinguished except that not too reliable housing made of plastic.  However, this nuance can be eliminated with a conventional silicone case. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best smartphone for baby" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35566/973410.jpg" width="600"></div>
