    <h2>  Divnomorskoe, pensions with own beach: reviews of vacationers </h2><p>  Almost everyone is unanimous in the opinion that this is a paradise for relaxation, where there is a unique nature.  The Black Sea and freshwater river create a mild subtropical climate all year round.  The sanatoriums differ in comfort: some buildings have not seen repair and reconstruction for decades.  Even in the Fakel sanatorium, guests who are not Gazprom employees will be accommodated in separate buildings (10, 10a), where the service leaves much to be desired.  The beaches of the boarding houses are equipped with bunk tanning beds with sun loungers and awnings, they have medical posts and rescue stations.  Entrance to these recreation areas is provided only on the sanatorium cards of boarding houses.  Otherwise, the beaches of the boarding houses can be called conditionally, because the entrance to them is free in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation. </p>
