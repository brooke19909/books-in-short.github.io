During the winter, the figure has changed, and now there is nothing to wear!  Of course, every representative of the fair sex dreams of losing weight, but this is a long process.  And how to brighten up a figure today, which ... well, not quite perfect. </p><p>  Not how to brighten up, but how to decorate, emphasize all the merits - that is the question that should concern a lady of any age and any complexion.  All women are beautiful in their own way, you just need to know how to give yourself! </p><p>  Probably, this is exactly what the fashion designers reasoned for, who came up with such wonderful clothing in every way - a cardigan for women.  A slender girl in a tight-fitting model will become even more slender in it, especially if a wide knitted belt is casually tied to her waist or a wide belt is fastened.  By the way, the belt on the waist looks gorgeous, hanging freely on the belt. </p><p>  Chubby donuts look great if the female cardigan that they put on themselves has a rather deep Y-shaped neckline and is fastened to one upper large button.  Beautiful breasts, which will be visible from the neckline, outweigh all the imaginary flaws of the figure, if they even have a place to be.  Although many full women and in addition to a beautiful breast have something to brag about ... Of course, if the belly is a little too much, you should not emphasize it.  But if there is no special abdomen, then you can put on a female cardigan in a style that quite frankly emphasizes the seductive curves of the figure. </p><p>  Only one fact can be offensive: it can be quite difficult to buy a now fashionable cardigan for women.  Well, one can always find a way out of this situation!  Indeed, today, mainly, women's <span>cardigans are knitted with knitting needles</span> from yarn!  Are we afraid of difficulties?  If you want to be beautiful and attractive, the most charming and charming, and besides, to be known as a fashionista and needlewoman for the whole world - a march for knitting and yarn!  We will <span>knit a</span> female <span>cardigan!</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First you need to choose the right model for the future gizmos.  You can offer one that is suitable for almost every woman.  This is a cardigan without a fastener, which is simply wraped in front and tied with a belt.  A very beautiful thing, knitted from yarn of the melange type, is a net that is not trivial one-color, but such when several colors are mixed in a thread. </p><p>  <span>You</span> can either buy ready-made <span>yarn</span> or make it yourself.  For example, a thrifty housewife can dissolve several different things that have gone out of fashion or become worthless.  Taking the ends of the thin threads of several different colors, you should rewind them into one ball.  You can also bind alternately multi-colored threads in case they are of the same thickness.  Combinations can be very diverse: brown with blue, green with pink, marsh with yellow.  The main thing is that no more than three colors are used in the product. </p><p>  Knitting can also be the simplest, for example, garter, that is, when the craftswoman uses only facial knitting on both sides.  When decorating the shelves, it is worthwhile to perform a wide bar with a 2X2 rubber band.  After the shelf goes above the waist line, you should draw a collar - a shawl, that is, the bar should begin to expand.  After closing the shoulders, the loop of the collar does not need to be closed, but continue to the middle of the back.  Later, when assembling the product, these protruding edges are sewn to the neckline on the back of the product. </p><p>  The sleeves of this model deserve special attention.  It is recommended first to use 2X2 elastic band to perform wide cuffs - lapels.  Then, from one end of the cuff, loops are gathered and they continue to be knitted with a <span>garter stitch.</span>  Sleeves upward taper. </p><p>  Pockets are made in the side seams or patch pockets are made.  But a model without pockets is entirely acceptable.  The belt is also knitted with elastic, well, if it matches the width of the bar on the shelf.  The belt must be made long so that after tying it hangs below the edge of the product. </p>
