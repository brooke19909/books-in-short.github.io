    <p>  Mumbai is an Indian metropolis city, which is located on the shores of the Arabian Sea, at the mouth of the river.  The capital of the state of Maharashtra.  Initially, the metropolis was built on seven islands: Colaba, Mazagaon, Little Colaba, Mahim, Wadala, Parel and <span>Matunga-Sion,</span> which due to dense urbanization, over time they became part of the land.  This happened in 1845 due to the reconstruction of the city, which began in 1817.  Mumbai, considering all its satellites, has more than 21 million inhabitants, which puts it in fifth place on the list of the largest megacities of the planet.  Today Mumbai consists of 7 administrative <span>districts: South, South-Central,</span> North-Central, Western outskirts, Central outskirts, Gulf outskirts, North-Western Mumbai.  In <span>terms of population density, the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãis also among the leaders.  It is one of the world's shopping centers, respectively, there is a high level of business activity and there are always many vacancies on the labor exchange.  However, such an amount of the working-age population allows employers to save on hiring labor resources. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mumbai for tourists </h2><p>  The city is visited annually by many tourists, including from Russia.  Time in Mumbai differs from Moscow by 3 hours, so difficulties with changing the time zone and acclimatization are possible.  It is also worth preparing for the dirt and poor hygiene of the locals.  Where Mumbai is located, there is a danger of catching an exotic disease.  Therefore, upon arrival, it is recommended to conduct a voluntary vaccination.  In Mumbai (India) there are problems with drinking water, so it is worth drinking bottled water only. </p><p>  The city boasts four beaches.  However, their condition leaves much to be desired, and not every visitor will dare to soak up them.  But this is a favorite vacation spot of local residents, where there is free entertainment. </p><h2>  Mumbai Attractions </h2>

It is located on the outskirts of the Apollo Bunder pier, on the border between the Arabian Sea and the Colaba harbor.  The arch is made of basalt and is a popular destination for tourists.  The height of the monument is 26 meters.  The arch was built in memory of the arrival in India in 1911 of King <span>George V</span> and Queen Mary.  On the sides of the arch are two halls with a capacity of 600 people each.  Local lovers often make appointments near the Gate. <br><br>  Another colorful spot in Mumbai is Victoria Terminus Train Station.  This is the largest railway junction in Asia, the main building of which is rather eccentric and is a symbiosis of Indian, Victorian and Islamic styles.  A unique mixture of architectural solutions does not leave indifferent even the most experienced tourist. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="time in mumbai" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33695/817431.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Oddly enough, the Taj Mahal is a tourist attraction worth understanding to understand Mumbai (India).  This is a five star hotel located very close to the Gateway of India.  The building dates from 1903.  Gustavo Eiffel even participated in the construction of the hotel.  The seven-story building is made in European traditions, and the furniture and interior were brought from Europe at the beginning of the twentieth century.  The hotel has the most memorable event for any Indian citizen.  It was here that in 1947 the independence of India was proclaimed. <br><br>  Today it is a fashionable hotel with the best restaurants in Mumbai, which is loved by both the local elite and world politicians and movie and show business stars.  At one time, such famous personalities as John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Mick Jagger, Bernard Shaw and others rested here. </p><h2>  Mumbai on a world map </h2>

This city is an example of how to combine ancient traditions with modern ones.  Where Mumbai is, life boils 24 hours a day.  The Indian capital rightfully owns part of the world's cultural wealth, both material and in the form of preserved traditions.
