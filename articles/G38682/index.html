  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The psychology of color in advertising as a sales tool</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The advertising industry is constantly growing and developing, but a deep study of human psychology as a potential buyer remains unchanged.  <span>How to attract, how to draw the attention of</span> buyers to a particular type of product in a number of similar ones?  The psychology of color in advertising is one of the main levers of influence on the buyer. </p><p>  Let us turn to psychology, which says that each color carries certain information and this information has a much more effective effect on the senses, and not on the mind.  What do colors mean in psychology?  Each color carries certain information, which is different in different countries and peoples, but also for one people in different social strata. </p><p>  The psychology of color in advertising is based on the following knowledge: </p><p>  Red - annoying and at the same time warming.  Creates a feeling of tension and narrowing of the space.  Great for sexual and emotional personalities.  It is better to use it in a small and limited space with gray or turquoise color. </p><p>  Yellow - attracts attention and lasts longer in memory, but too bright can bring out of psychological balance, it is better to use it in a limited space and combine it with green. </p><p>  <span>Orange color</span> carries a feeling of joy, impulsiveness.  It is advisable to use on small and "cold" surfaces, for example, on goods of machinery. </p><p>  Lemon (light yellow) - this color repels, a feeling of colorlessness and insignificance appears from it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Green is the color of life, the main properties of which are the removal of pain, fatigue.  It goes well with white.  By itself, it is too reassuring up to melancholy. </p><p>  Blue color has a pronounced therapeutic effect, perfectly helps with neuralgic pain. </p><p>  Blue - gives a sense of harmony, relieves stress and instills confidence in one's strengths, and is perfect for people who are disappointed and tired of life. </p><p>  Violet color is suitable for people who are temporarily in an unstable psychological state. </p><p>  White has always been and remains a symbol of purity, although it is better to combine it with other colors, such as red, green or blue.  White alone is too sterile, which may cause it to be rejected. </p><p>  <span>Black color</span> is a symbol of sophistication and individuality. </p><p>  Cinnamon is the color of conservatives. </p><p>  Beige is subconsciously associated with gray hair. </p><p>  The turquoise <span>color is</span> quite <span>cold,</span> so it is advisable to combine it with red in order to compensate for this. </p><p>  Golden is the color of powerful people who constantly strive for it, feel their superiority over others. </p><p>  <span>Pink color</span> carries a feeling of weakness and sweetness. </p><p>  Not only the color itself is important, but also their quantity.  The best will be a combination of two colors, which can also be supplemented with similar shades for greater expressiveness.  The psychology of <span>advertising</span> actively uses this knowledge to promote products on the market. </p><p>  The psychology of color in advertising is the most important and basic element of maximum sales, and if all colors were chosen correctly and the sale of the advertised product went up, then this indicates correctly selected colors that, over time, can become a trademark sign, that is, a corporate color. </p><p>  The psychology of color in advertising involves the use of knowledge provided by research by psychologists: such as the meaning and <span>influence on a person of color,</span> form, and much more.  To advertise a new product on the market, there is nothing more important than the correct advertising strategy - there are no important details, everything needs to be investigated and analyzed. </p>
