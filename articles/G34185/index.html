They have long ceased to be an ordinary ‚Äúdialer‚Äù.  Now it is a camera, Internet browser, game console and much more.  But to use the device to the full, you need to know what programs you need to install on your phone. </p><h2>  For what? </h2><p>  Software can be different and not everyone is suitable for everyone.  Teenagers have a large number of social networks and games, young people use various services for listening to music, watching videos and reading books, and the adult generation remains true that the phone is only needed for calls. </p><p>  Therefore, it becomes clear that you need to install certain software as necessary.  What programs are needed for the Android phone? </p><div class="photo" data-original="appspy.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Programs on the phone" class="if uuid-2731392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2731392.jpg"></div><p>  Most often there is a universal set, which includes applications: </p><ul><li>  social networks; </li><li>  instant messengers; </li><li>  listening to music; </li><li>  watching videos; </li><li>  web browsing; </li><li>  reading of books; </li><li>  office programs; </li><li>  smartphone maintenance; </li><li>  auxiliary tools, etc. </li></ul><p>  In each of this group there are several options for programs that the user may like.  Therefore, everyone should choose something of their own. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Social networks </h2><p>  Recently, this category includes a large number of useful programs for the phone.  Now everyone uses various social networks, and therefore often these applications are the first to be installed on a new smartphone. </p><p>  Among all, Instagram is considered the most popular now.  You can install it from Google Play for free.  This service works with photography and allows you to find friends around the world.  It was installed by more than 1 billion users, and 66 million people rated the application.  The average score is 4.5. </p><p>  The program is quite resource-intensive, and long-term use takes a large amount of RAM.  Users who have a smartphone with 2 GB of RAM will have to periodically close the program.  Otherwise, they will be waiting for an emergency shutdown. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makeawebsitehub.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Social networks" class="if uuid-2731401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2731401.jpg"></div><p>  Twitter is also considered popular.  This is a social network that allows you to embed your thoughts in just a couple of sentences.  The program has been installed by more than 500 million users.  The average score is 4.3.  Twitter is very popular in America and Europe, and in the CIS countries it is used by a small percentage of people.  The program is not resource-intensive, for a long time it can save data in RAM and takes up little space in the phone‚Äôs internal memory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many users install Facebook and Vkontakte.  Both services are copies of each other, only in the first case the application has an audience from all over the world, and in the second - from Russia and other CIS countries. </p><p>  Facebook is a resource-intensive program that weighs over 100 MB.  In addition, a messenger is automatically installed for communication on Facebook, so it takes up even more space.  If a social network is running in the <span>background, it</span> can take a lot of resources to maintain its activity. </p><p>  Vkontakte is not a demanding software that weighs less than 100 MB.  It does not take up much space in the internal memory of the phone, but with prolonged use it can take up all the RAM, so the device will start to slow down. </p><h2>  Instant messengers </h2><p>  These are useful phone programs that allow you to keep in touch with family and friends.  Many of them may not take traffic at all, work in the background and not require a lot of RAM.  Popular are: </p><ul><li>  Telegram </li><li>  Viber </li><li>  Whatsapp </li></ul><p>  Telegram is a popular and convenient messenger that is used in the CIS countries.  This program has a scandalous reputation, because it has a strong encryption code, and therefore cannot be hacked.  Hence the constant persecution by the authorities and attempts to block. </p><p>  Nevertheless, Telegram remains a convenient messenger, with a huge number of individual settings.  Especially loved by many thanks to its stickers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.windowscentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Messengers for the phone" class="if uuid-2731422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2731422.jpg"></div><p>  Viber is another popular messenger used by the older generation.  It works according to a similar scheme as Telegram, and mainly has a difference only in the interface.  But, as practice shows, it has a high resource consumption, which is why failures often occur on phones with a small amount of RAM. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  WhatsApp is a very old useful phone program that is more popular in America and Europe.  However, our compatriots also often use software.  More than 1 billion people have installed this messenger.  It takes up little space in the phone‚Äôs memory and also does not require a lot of RAM. </p><p>  All of the above programs allow you to not only send instant messages to each other, but also make free calls and video calls.  You can share files and create communities. </p><h2>  Listening to music </h2><p>  It's no secret that they used to listen to music on Vkontakte most often.  Since the service made audio paid, many users started looking for another alternative.  Some people prefer to use YouTube for this, but the screen cannot be locked, and accordingly listening to music while walking or jogging is completely inconvenient. </p><p>  From here, music services are becoming more popular: </p><ul><li>  "Play Music"; </li><li>  "Yandex. Music"; </li><li>  Deezer </li><li>  SoundCloud et al. </li></ul><p>  There is no point in separately describing these musical useful programs for the phone, since they practically do not differ from each other.  The only difference is the cost of a monthly subscription, as well as the interface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fieldguide.gizmodo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Useful programs for android phone" class="if uuid-2731429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2731429.jpg"></div><p>  Otherwise, each software quickly allows you to find the desired song, create playlists, highlight your favorite tracks and subscribe to artists.  Each program offers the user a month of free use in order to understand whether the interface is convenient. </p><h2>  Watching videos </h2><p>  Everything is very clear here.  It's about the famous YouTube video hosting.  This is another record holder for downloading on Google Play.  Over 1 billion users have chosen this program. </p><p>  This software weighs about 30 MB.  He receives updates regularly, and developers try to quickly fix bugs.  You can link the program to your Google account or create an independent account. </p><h2>  Web browsing </h2><p>  There are a large number of mobile web browsers.  Here, as in the case of a computer, you have to choose the one that seems the most convenient. </p><p>  Each smartphone has a "native" browser, therefore, if it suits the user, you can not install anything extra.  In addition, many use Google Chrome or Opera. </p><p>  Google Chrome is a mobile browser, which with confidence can be called a useful program for your Android phone.  In addition to the success of the computer version, software for a smartphone also remains convenient and familiar to many.  More than 1 billion times the program has been installed.  It weighs only 50 MB, but still requires additional space, like any other browser. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.itpro.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Web browsers" class="if uuid-2731434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2731434.jpg"></div><p>  Opera is an old web browser that has long been popular on mobile devices.  Previously, they often installed the regular version and the Mini version, and in April 2018 Opera Touch was released. </p><p>  The browser has changed the color of the logo, and now also allows you to quickly synchronize the work of the mobile and computer versions.  If you configure the binding, you can send interesting links with one click and leave notes in both versions in the Flow stream.  This browser has been installed 1 million times and weighs about 12 MB. </p><h2>  Reading of books </h2><p>  Many consider readers as necessary programs for the Android phone.  But as practice shows, choosing a successful application is very difficult.  Some do not support popular formats, others are "stuffed" with a lot of advertising. </p><p>  The most successful are FBReader and AlReader.  In this case, you will again have to pay attention to the interface and ease of use.  Both applications weigh only 6 MB.  They do not take up much memory and do not require a large amount of RAM. </p><p>  For PDF and DJVU, EBookDroid is great.  This is convenient software, but some users are critical of a rather boring and unassuming interface, so they try to find an alternative to this program. </p><h2>  Office programs </h2><p>  These are some of the most useful phone programs.  One way or another, many often have to use this type of software.  Most often these are text editors and spreadsheet programs. </p><p>  Of course, in this case it is better to turn to services from Google.  Especially if the user uses cloud storage from this company.  Then you can install Google Docs.  The program weighs 77 MB and works via the Internet.  Therefore, to use offline, you will have to look for another alternative. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vimeo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Office programs" class="if uuid-2731439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2731439.jpg"></div><p>  For example, you should pay attention to the Polaris Office and OfficeSuite office suite.  Both applications allow you to get software for reading PDF, editing documents, tables and presentations.  They weigh less than Google Docs, despite the fact that they have more functionality. </p><h2>  Smartphone service </h2><p>  What programs are needed on the phone?  As practice shows, it is difficult to do without service software.  To begin with, all standard applications are already pre-installed: alarm clock, calculator, voice recorder, notes and more.  If for some reason you don‚Äôt like the interface of preinstalled programs, you can find the best option on Google Play.  But you should know that the ‚Äúnative‚Äù software cannot be removed.  Accordingly, there will be no way to free memory. </p><p>  It is advisable for each user to acquire one of the antivirus programs.  Most are paid programs, but you can install a trial version to check your smartphone for viruses and malware.  There are also many useful Android phone programs like Cleaner Master.  This is a simple software that allows you to clear the "garbage" on your smartphone, as well as to control the fullness of RAM while working with applications. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thedroidguy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Utilities" class="if uuid-2731446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2731446.jpg"></div><h2>  Auxiliary tools </h2><p>  Here you can list a huge number of applications.  For example, each mobile operator has created software to control balance and bonuses.  These programs are lightweight, have convenient widgets and a simple interface. </p><p>  It is also worth noting software designed to search for vehicles, ordering a taxi or food.  A huge number of programs with online stores.  All of them help to simplify the use of services and goods, ordering and buying something. </p><h2>  Installation and configuration instructions </h2><p>  Speaking about the programs for the Android phone, it is worth mentioning immediately that it is recommended to install software from Google Play.  But even in this app store you can find malware, so you should carefully look at the average app rating and reviews. </p><p>  To install any of the above programs, just enter its name in the search on Google Play, then click on the green ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button and wait for the smartphone to download and install software on its own. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobileinternist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Installation Instructions" class="if uuid-2731448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2731448.jpg"></div><p>  Setting up any program is automatic.  It is enough to follow the instructions and select the necessary parameters.  For example, installing Google Chrome, you need to synchronize its work with your Google account or create a new one, so that it is easier to use bookmarks and browser history. </p><p>  If you need a program for flashing the phone, it is better to turn to w3bsit3-dns.com for help so as not to ruin anything.  There you can choose a phone model, as well as the best firmware versions.  Next, an instruction will be indicated in which the necessary software is mentioned. </p><p>  Most often, the FlashTool program is used for this, which is installed on a PC, then they connect the smartphone to the computer and begin flashing.  In order to do everything without the help of a PC, just go to Recovery (phone menu) and download the firmware that was previously transferred to the root folder. </p>
