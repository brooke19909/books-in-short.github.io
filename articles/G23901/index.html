It is a city with a population of more than one million people.  Many citizens choose it for residence after resettlement, for example, from areas of the Far North.  Therefore, in terms of building houses, the city is very promising.  The residential complex ‚ÄúAlbatros‚Äù (Volgograd) under construction is one of the most successful projects of developers. </p>

    <h2>  A little about Volgograd </h2><p>  Former Stalingrad (the site of the Battle of Stalingrad), a hero city, a huge metropolis - all this is now Volgograd.  It cannot be said that at present it is the largest industrial center of the country, since many industries are in a difficult economic situation.  Although it was due to a decrease in production in the metallurgical and chemical industries, the ecological situation of the city came to some equilibrium.  Road transport continues to be the main polluter of the atmosphere, throwing about 70% of harmful substances into the air. </p>

    <p>  It sounds paradoxical, but among cities with such a <span>population Volgograd</span> takes first place in terms of low wages, worn-out infrastructure, and a small number of organizations representing small businesses.  With such indicators, only Volgograd officials cannot complain - they have the highest salary ratings in the Southern Federal District. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location of the residential complex </h2><p>  The residential complex "Albatros" (Volgograd) is located almost in the center of the city at the intersection of Poddubnoy, Bashkirskaya and Metallurgov Avenue.  The developer chose the most convenient location for the construction of his project, providing the most efficient transport accessibility using any type of transportation on the territory of the city.  For owners of their own cars, it is not difficult to get to the complex along the indicated streets.  Those who do not move on personal vehicles will be able to get to the house by various types of public transport: tram, minibus. </p>

    <p>  There are no industrial enterprises near the complex, so the amount of harmful emissions into the atmosphere in this area is not so great.  The Volga River flows nearby; there are squares and parks.  Therefore, residents of the complex will be able to breathe fresh air in full breast. </p><h2>  Layouts of apartments and their cost </h2><p>  The whole complex will consist of 453 apartments.  "Albatros" is a residential complex (Volgograd), the layout of the apartments is diverse, it offers various living spaces: from one-room to three-room.  Most of the complex is planned one-room positions - 220. They have always been the most sought after in the real estate market, and their cost per square meter has always been quite high.  The least designed three-room apartments are 28 apartments.  Thus, the apartment complex "Albatross" (Volgograd) will be able to offer its future customers housing for every taste and budget.  And both for large families, and for single people. </p><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartments in the complex is also the most diverse.  It starts with 41 square meters.  The largest apartment is slightly larger than 118 square meters.  The average cost of one square meter of living space is 41 thousand rubles.  Thus, the minimum cost of an apartment will be just over 1 million 700 thousand rubles.  The maximum will reach 4.5 million rubles. </p><h2>  Reviews about the complex </h2><p>  Since Albatros (a residential complex, Volgograd) offers housing prices quite comfortable, this adds positive reviews about the property to the builder's piggy bank.  Most of them are really happy that they were able to purchase an apartment at such an attractive price.  Also, many buyers are satisfied that you can buy an apartment in a variety of ways: for cash, on a mortgage loan and by installment payment. </p><p>  Many positive reviews are also related to the pace of construction.  Currently, the developer is fulfilling all its obligations, and the deadline for completion is planned for the fourth quarter of this year.  Judging by the pace of construction, the delivery of keys should occur within the time periods indicated in the documentation and contracts. </p><p>  A few negative points are due to the fact that the developer does not finish and finish the living quarters, that is, before moving in, tenants will need to make at least minimal repairs.  Also, many buyers would like apartments with a free layout in order to realize their desires.  But the developer does not offer them such a solution. </p>

    <p>  Until the house is rented out and the first tenants have settled, it is difficult to judge the impressions of life in it.  And also about the quality of construction and the fulfillment of all obligations by the developer.  Although now it is already possible to judge a very good choice of the location of the residential complex, the services of which are all well-developed infrastructure of the city, transport links, excellent ecology. </p>
