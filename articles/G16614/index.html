Therefore, car owners are required to pay maximum attention to headlight lighting.  The bulbs in the H1 and H2 sockets are hopelessly outdated.  Today, they have been replaced by improved modifications of lighting devices.  Most often, 4 and 7 generation bulbs are used for head lighting.  They are more economical and have a long service life. </p>

    <p>  To determine which <span>H4 bulbs are</span> good, it is worth considering their varieties.  To date, there are three types of such light sources. </p><h2>  Halogen lamps </h2><p>  Now halogens are used most often.  Most motorists consider the most favorable ratio of their price and quality.  Devices of this type are bulbs made of refractory glass.  Inside is a halogen gas, in turn, it contains a filament (spiral) through which voltage is applied.  Due to this, the temperature rises in the flask, the gas heats up and a glow occurs. </p><p>  Halogen products with base H4 shine with a bright <span>white light.</span>  They contain not one thread, but two.  The first is responsible for high beams.  The second is for the neighbor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  If we talk about which H4 bulbs are good, then it is worth paying attention that halogens have several significant disadvantages: </p><ol><li>  If one of the spirals fails, you will have to change the entire bulb. </li><li>  Products are very hot, so they can not be used with plastic optics. </li><li>  Lamps are quickly damaged by vibration. </li></ol><p>  Most often, motorists are interested in which bulbs are better - H4 halogens or biksenon.  The second type clearly wins.  Consider why. </p><h2>  Biksenon </h2><p>  Bi-xenon lighting devices are very different from halogen analogues.  They also represent a flask filled with gas.  However, in this case, not 2 spirals are located inside the lamp, but two electrodes projecting an electric arc between themselves. </p><p>  If you use lighting products with a base H4, then they additionally have a magnet and a special screen.  Thanks to these elements switching of a high beam and a passing light is carried out. </p>

    <p>  When choosing which <span>H4 bulbs are good, you</span> should pay attention to the benefits of Bi-Xenon.  Such products: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  They are characterized by increased light output, which is several times higher than the same indicators for halogens.  This increases the illuminated area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe roadway. </li><li>  Not afraid of vibrations.  Due to the fact that there is no incandescent thread in the device, the products are characterized by increased reliability. </li><li>  They do not heat up, so they can be installed in modern plastic headlights. </li></ul><p>  However, when deciding which H4 halogen lamps to choose, it is worth paying attention to the disadvantages of these lighting devices: </p><ul><li>  High cost. </li><li>  The difficulty of self-replacement. </li><li>  The need for extremely fine tuning. </li></ul><p>  Because of these disadvantages, LED lighting is increasingly preferred. </p><h2>  LEDs </h2><p>  LED lighting devices are the most promising and versatile.  In the process of testing, such products show the best results. </p><p>  LEDs withstand loads, do not overheat and do not fail after the first bump.  At the same time, they work equally well in conditions of heat and severe cold.  Among other things, LED devices have a huge work resource. </p>

    <p>  The only drawback is that LEDs are not suitable for every optics.  Since LED devices form a light beam, they require special lenses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Nevertheless, if we talk about which H4 bulbs shine better and burn out less often, then it is worth giving preference to LED lighting. </p><h2>  Weatherproof lamp </h2><p>  Of course, every driver wants to purchase the most versatile vehicle lighting.  However, today a rather wide selection of H4 bulbs is on sale.  Which are better? </p><p>  In fact, it all depends on the frequency of use of the car and weather conditions.  If you have to ride on wet asphalt every day in fog or rain, it is better not to choose lamps with diffused white light.  Such lighting is almost invisible in bad weather. </p><p>  On sale there are special devices for such cases - all-weather bulbs.  A special coloring coating is applied to the flask of these products, due to which the luminous flux becomes yellow.  This color is clearly visible on wet asphalt, so the roadway is clearly visible both during the day and at dusk. </p><h2>  Which bulbs are better: H4 or H7? </h2><p>  If we talk about these two socles, then we will consider their main differences: </p><ul><li>  In terms of the working life of the product, 7 modifications outperform H4 lamps almost twice. </li><li>  In the lamps of version 4, 2 spirals are installed, while the more modern analogue has one. </li><li>  The seventh option is usually used with free-form headlights. </li></ul><p>  However, it is very difficult to single out one type of lighting device.  It all depends on the particular car.  For example, consider the Volkswagen Transportet.  What bulbs are good in T5?  H4 for dipped and main beam.  Other modifications to this car are not provided. </p><p>  Therefore, before buying this or that lighting element, it is recommended to check with the technical characteristics of the machine. </p><p>  Now consider which H4 bulbs are good, based on their manufacturers.  Below is a list of the most popular and high-quality devices. </p><h2>  Koito VWhite </h2><p>  The Japanese manufacturer offers low and high beam bulbs in the base H4.  This company is famous for high-quality lighting that meets all the requirements of modern drivers.  The products are great for harsh weather conditions. </p>

    <p>  Among the advantages of Koito VWhite it is worth highlighting: </p><ul><li>  High wear resistance. </li><li>  Compliance with the regulations of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Light output 55-60 watts.  True, the manufacturer indicates 100 watts, but in reality this is not so. </li><li>  Power and excellent light output. </li><li>  Universality.  Lamps are suitable for headlights of various shapes. </li><li>  Long service life. </li></ul><p>  Such products are the best option for budget cars. </p><h2>  Osram night breaker </h2><p>  This manufacturer has long been famous for its lighting technology.  At one time, Osram halogens were accused of blinding oncoming drivers, but the company proved that all these insinuations have nothing to do with reality.  For this, independent tests were performed.  Therefore, if you ask any car owner today which H4 bulbs are good, Osram will be the most likely answer. </p><p>  Of the advantages of these lighting devices can be identified: </p><ul><li>  Excellent light output.  The road is well lit in any conditions (snow, rain, wet asphalt). </li><li>  The ability to "break through" the fog.  Due to this, there is no need to use foglights. </li><li>  <span>Blue light</span> with a white tint.  That is why the light beam is clearly visible on the roadway. </li><li>  Roadside lighting.  Many light bulbs shine only in front of themselves, but Osram products also capture the pedestrian part. </li><li>  Relatively low cost. </li></ul><p>  Nevertheless, it is worth saying about one drawback of these devices.  They quite often burn out for no apparent reason.  However, there are also a huge number of satisfied customers who claim that these speculations are just another ploy of competitors. </p><h2>  Philips X-Treme Vision </h2><p>  The developments of this company and Osram practically do not differ, therefore it is not surprising that this version is very similar to the Night Breaker line.  Identical colors, diffuse light beams and other characteristics - all this combines products from these two manufacturers. </p><p>  However, it is worth noting that Philips pays more attention to product quality, since their lamps did not receive negative reviews related to quick failure. </p>

    <p>  Philips lighting elements have the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  Very high durability.  At the same time, the lamps work perfectly in all weather conditions. </li><li>  High quality lighting of the roadway.  Even on an icy surface there are no glare. </li><li>  Clear roadside lighting.  According to recent tests, the Philips X-Treme Vision line showed the best results. </li><li>  Increased light output. </li><li>  The ability to select the shade of the light beam from bright white to blue. </li></ul><p>  To date, Philips lamps are considered one of the best, according to experts and car owners themselves.  However, they will cost several times more than Night Breaker. </p><h2>  Bosch Plus 90 </h2><p>  Anyone who is not used to saving money on their car and can afford to buy the best lighting for a car should definitely pay attention to Bosch products.  These lighting elements are characterized by high light intensity throughout the entire operational life.  At the same time, Bosch lamps work equally well in the city and on the highway.  It‚Äôs worth highlighting the excellent curb control and the range of the light beam. </p><p>  In addition, it is worth highlighting other pluses of Bosch Plus 90: </p><ul><li>  The highest light output (in comparison with the analogues described above). </li><li>  Unique light beam control technology.  So far, nobody has been able to repeat this achievement by Bosch. </li><li>  Warranty for all lamps. </li><li>  The highest intensity of illumination of the roadway. </li></ul><p>  At the same time, the lamps do not blind the rest of the road users, which is also an important advantage.  However, for such a list of advantages and the complete absence of negative sides, you will have to pay very dearly.  Nevertheless, if you are trying to determine which H4 bulbs are good, the photo will help in choosing. </p>
