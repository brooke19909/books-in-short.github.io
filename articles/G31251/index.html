From these marriages, children were born.  They did not choose their father, they were born in a family and lived under the total control of the odious ruler of the Soviet empire.  Unfortunately, the fate of the children of Stalin after his death was mostly tragic ... Some consider this a natural phenomenon, and some believe that children should not be responsible for the actions of their parents.  How many children Stalin has and their fate - we will talk about all this in an article. </p><h2>  Firstborn </h2><p>  So how many children did Stalin have?  So it‚Äôs hard to answer right away.  Let's go in order ... </p><p>  At the beginning of the twentieth century, the future ruler of the Soviet empire first married.  He was twenty nine.  Fiancee - 21. Her name was Ekaterina Svanidze.  This marriage lasted only sixteen months.  The spouse has passed away.  But one month before her death, she gave her husband the firstborn - Jacob. </p><p>  Relatives of the deceased wife had to raise an heir.  Father and son saw each other fourteen years later, already in the era of the USSR.  By this time, the Leader of the Peoples already had a second family.  Jacob's stepmother, Nadezhda Alliluyeva, belonged to the stepson with warmth.  But his father treated him like a jerk.  He did not like practically everything in him.  He severely punished him for the slightest misconduct.  Sometimes, he didn‚Äôt even let the boy into the apartment, and he spent the night on the stairs. </p><p>  When Yakov was eighteen, he decided to marry his classmate, which happened.  Father was categorically against this marriage.  Because of this conflict, Jacob even tried to take his own life.  After an unsuccessful suicide attempt, relations between Stalin and Jacob completely deteriorated.  The son began to live with relatives in the northern capital.  It was then that the newlyweds had their first child - daughter Elena, who, unfortunately, died in infancy.  After some time, the couple decided to leave. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Return to the capital </h2><p>  Returning to Moscow, Yakov entered the Institute of Transport Engineers and after graduating from high school he worked at one of the power plants.  True, he worked very little in his specialty, since his father insistently recommended that he choose a different field.  As a result, Jacob became a cadet at the Artillery Academy.  Over the years, he gained fame as one of the best and most talented students. </p><p>  Meanwhile, Dzhugashvili met Olga Golysheva.  She was born in Uryupinsk, and in the capital was trained in an aviation college.  Thus, acquaintance turned into a love affair.  However, Stalin was again against this relationship.  Olga returned to her homeland, where she gave her beloved heir Eugene.  Relatives from the Golyshevs began to raise the child.  And the young mother returned to Moscow.  But her relationship with Stalin‚Äôs son did not work out at all.  After some time, they decided to leave. </p><p>  In 1939, Jacob again married.  His wife was a ballerina Julia Meltzer, who soon gave birth to a daughter, Galina.  Surprisingly, the omnipotent Stalin did not fix obstacles in the way of the young.  But, predicting the course of events, we say that during the war, Jacob's wife received a term in the Gulag. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Captivity </h2><p>  When the war broke out, Jacob was among the first to be at the front.  Father, of course, a priori could arrange him for a staff position.  But he did not do this. </p><p>  Dzhugashvili fell into the thick of it - near Vitebsk.  He took part in one of the major tank battles.  He was even presented for the award.  However, he did not have time to get it ... </p><p>  The fact is that his battery broke out of the environment twice.  But the third time, Jacob was not able to do this.  He was captivated. </p><p>  For two years, the Germans tried to persuade him to cooperate.  But Jacob categorically refused.  At the same time, during interrogations, he spoke of deep disappointment associated with the unsuccessful actions of the Soviet troops at the beginning of the war.  But he did not provide the necessary information for the Nazis.  In addition, he never said bad things about his homeland and state system. </p><p>  The Germans invited Stalin to exchange his son for one of the major German officers.  But the leader was adamant. </p><p>  ... Jacob died in mid-1943.  He was shot dead by a sentry in one of the death camps. </p><p>  The children of Stalin and their fate, a photo from the archives - all this interests those people who are not indifferent to our history.  Therefore, we will continue. </p>

    <h2>  Barchuk </h2><p>  In the first years of Soviet power, Stalin married again.  He was already forty, and his chosen one - 17. Nadezhda Alliluyeva was the daughter of Stalin's comrades-in-arms.  At the same time, in his youth, an affair began between Stalin and her mother.  Thus, after a while she became the mother-in-law of the Leader of the peoples. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Initially, this marriage was happy, but later it was simply unbearable.  And for both.  In late autumn 1932, after another skirmish with her husband, her husband closed the doors to the bedroom and shot herself. </p><p>  As a result, after the death of his wife, Stalin left their two common children - the twelve-year-old son Vasily and the six-year-old daughter Svetlana.  They were looked after by nannies, housekeepers and security guards. </p><p>  Vasily grew up a pretty mischievous boy.  Father repeatedly told educators to act very strictly with him.  Probably, it was not in vain that the leader called his youngest son "grub". </p><p>  In 1938, Vasily became a cadet at the Kachin Aviation School.  He enjoyed great authority, in the team was considered a livable person.  But most importantly, he was very fond of flying.  Although constantly arguing with the authorities. </p><p>  On the eve of the war, Vasily married.  Wife was Galina Bourdonskaya.  Her great-great-grandfather is a soldier of the Napoleonic army.  During the battles of 1812, he was wounded and settled in Russia. </p><p>  The marriage with Bourdon lasted four years.  Did Vasily Stalin have children?  Their fate (photo in the article) was not the best.  Parents broke up.  Vasily forbade his wife to communicate with the offspring.  She saw her children only eight years later. </p>

    <h2>  War </h2><p>  In 1941, as a twenty-year-old officer, Vasily went to the front.  During the war he made twenty-seven sorties.  In addition, he was awarded prestigious military awards for participating in military operations. </p><p>  At the same time, he repeatedly received penalties for hooligan actions.  He was also demoted.  So, once he was removed from the command of the regiment.  The fact is that he and his fellow soldiers went fishing.  During fishing, he used aerial projectiles.  As a result, the weapons engineer Vasily died, and one of the pilots was injured. </p><p>  In 1944, Vasily married again.  His chosen one was the daughter of Soviet Marshal Tymoshenko.  Two children were born in this marriage. </p><p>  In 1947, Vasily was appointed commander of the Air Force of the Moscow Military District.  By this period, he already seriously suffered from alcoholism and did not take part in flights. </p><p>  But he had a completely new hobby.  He began to create football and hockey teams "pilots".  He provided these athletes with more than generous financial assistance. </p><p>  In addition, Vasily began to build a sports center.  However, during one of the May Day demonstrations, he ordered several aircraft to fly over Red Square.  Some of them, unfortunately, crashed.  After that, Stalin dismissed his own son from the post of commander ... </p><h2>  Opal </h2><p>  When Stalin was gone, Vasily‚Äôs life went downhill.  At first, they decided to appoint him to a position away from the capital.  But he did not obey the order.  Then he was fired in the reserve.  And just a month and a half after the death of the head of state, he was completely arrested.  There was one reason.  During one of the feasts with the subjects of Great Britain, Vasily presented his version of the death of his father.  He believed that he was poisoned. </p><p>  As a result, the former combat pilot and general spent eight years in prison.  In 1961, the ruler Khrushchev returned his awards, title and pension.  But 2.5 months after the release, Vasily had a small accident in a car.  After that, he was forbidden to live in the capital.  So he ended up in Kazan.  He lived in this city quite a bit, since Vasily died in the early spring of 1962.  He was only forty years old. </p>

    <h2>  Only daughter </h2><p>  The only daughter of the Leader of the Nations Svetlana was born in 1926.  Initially, Stalin himself did not look for her. </p><p>  However, as a high school student, she began to have romance novels.  So, at the age of sixteen, she was in love with the forty-year-old screenwriter A. Kapler.  Her lover managed to introduce the girl to good literature and poetry.  He was able to educate her artistic taste.  But the head of state was outraged.  They started a case at Kapler and sent to the camp. </p><p>  The new chosen one of Svetlana was a friend of his brother Vasily G. Morozov.  The father allowed his daughter to get married.  In marriage, their first-born appeared.  Despite this, after a while the couple broke up.  And the ex-husband was immediately removed from the capital.  For three years he could not find a job. </p><p>  Meanwhile, Svetlana met with the son of a Soviet figure A. Zhdanov Yuri.  Stalin was very fond of the Zhdanov family and sincerely wanted these families to become related.  And so it happened.  There were children.  By the way, at one time it was the head of state who helped appoint Yuri to the post of head of the department of the Central Committee.  But the personal life of the children of Stalin did not work out ... And this marriage also fell apart. </p><h2>  Non-return </h2><p>  The third wife of Svetlana was Raj Bridge Singh.  This elderly man was a Hindu by nationality.  Their acquaintance happened in the Kremlin hospital.  And after a while, Singh passed away.  The inconsolable widow was allowed to take her husband's ashes to India.  After that, she decided to seek asylum at the British Embassy.  Then she moved to the United States.  Note, she fled abroad without children.  By and large, they did not expect such an act and betrayal then. </p><p>  Meanwhile, in the West, Alliluyeva published a number of books related to her father.  She called him "a spiritual and moral monster." </p><p>  There she again married.  Her husband was an architect Peters from the United States.  From this marriage, a daughter, Olga, was born. </p><p>  After some time, and this marriage broke up.  Svetlana returned to the shores of Misty Albion.  And in the middle of 1984, she was allowed to return to the USSR.  Alas, she was not forgiven either by close people or distant relatives.  For this reason, she again went abroad. </p><p>  In recent years, she has lived in a nursing home.  She died in 2011.  She was eighty-five. </p>

    <h2>  Foster-son </h2><p>  But these are not all the children of Joseph Stalin.  He also had an adopted son, Artem.  His father, a close friend of the leader, ally Fedor Sergeyev, died in a <span>railway accident.</span>  At that time, Artem was only three months old.  Stalin adopted him and took him to his family. </p><p>  The boy was the same age as the middle son of the head of state.  They became best friends.  Stalin almost set him as an example, unlike Vasily.  Artem was really very interested in learning.  Although the leader of the peoples he never made any concessions. </p><p>  After school, Artyom entered one of the artillery schools.  He graduated in 1940.  Just like Vasily, he went to the front.  He was captured, but, fortunately, his attempt to escape was successful.  He ended the war as a brigade commander. </p><p>  In 1954, Artem studied at the Academy of the General Staff and became a great military commander.  Many believe that he is one of the founders of the anti-aircraft missile forces of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  <span>Artem Sergeev</span> rose to the rank of major general.  Until the last days, he was a devoted communist.  He died in 2008. </p><h2>  Happy leader son </h2><p>  In addition to the official, stories are known for illegitimate children of Stalin (photo is in the article).  By and large, in his youth, Stalin was generally seriously interested in the fairer sex.  At one time, he even intended to get engaged to one of the noblewomen from Odessa. </p><p>  But all the <span>illegitimate children of</span> Stalin (their fate - further in the article) were born when he dangled through the links. </p><p>  So, the future leader was sent to Solvychegodsk.  He was sheltered by Maria Kuzakova.  From this connection the son Konstantin was born.  Stalin practically did not remember his son, but for some reason, Costa was constantly lucky in his professional career. </p><p>  Kuzakov, in fact, was a very modest person.  He was, in fact, the leader‚Äôs happiest son.  He grew up without a father and found out about his kinship with Stalin when he matured. </p><p>  After school, Konstantin became a student at the financial and economic institute in the Northern capital.  Having received a diploma, he remained at the university and worked as a teacher.  Later, he lectured in the regional committee of the party of Leningrad, and then Moscow.  Since 1939, he became head of the propaganda and agitation department of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks.  The assistant to the head of state Poskrebyshev treated him well.  And sometimes he gave him instructions from Stalin himself. </p><p>  In 1947, in the wake of another repression, he was removed from all posts and expelled from the party.  Beria generally demanded to arrest him.  But, as it turns out, the leader himself stood up for Konstantin.  As a result, party membership was restored, and Kuzakov‚Äôs career resumed. </p><p>  In subsequent years, Konstantin focused on work on television.  His last post was the Deputy Minister of Cinematography of the Soviet Union.  It was under him that the editors of the literary and dramatic programs of the Central Television became truly elitist.  Subordinates sincerely respected, appreciated and loved him.  He was actually an intelligent and intelligent leader.  Moreover, the origin of Kuzakov was not a secret at all.  Apparently, career advancement was primarily due to his extraordinary abilities. </p><p>  Kuzakov died in 1996. </p>

    <h2>  The ordinary life of the son of Stalin </h2><p>  We continue to talk about illegitimate children of Stalin and their fate.  Another illegitimate son of the leader was Alexander Davydov. </p><p>  Finding himself in another link, the future head of state cohabited with Lydia Pereprygina.  At that time, the girl was only fourteen.  The gendarmes were determined to punish the lascivious revolutionary.  But he vowed to them that he was going to marry Lida.  However, this did not happen.  Stalin escaped from exile.  And the future bride of the revolutionary at that time was expecting a child. </p><p>  After some time, she gave birth to a son, Sasha.  According to several sources, Stalin first corresponded with Pereprygina.  Then there was a rumor that Dzhugashvili was killed at the front.  As a result, Lydia did not wait for her groom and married Jacob Davydov, who worked as a fisherman.  The new husband Pereprygina adopted Alexander and gave him his surname. </p><p>  They say that in 1946, Stalin unexpectedly gave an order to find out information about the fate of his son and his mother.  The leader‚Äôs reaction to the results of this search is unknown. </p><p>  By and large, the illegitimate son of the leader lived a fairly simple life.  He fought on the fronts of the Korean and World War II.  He rose to the major rank.  In the postwar period, he lived with his family in the city of Novokuznetsk.  Davydov worked as a foreman, and also managed the dining room of one of the city enterprises.  He died in 1987. </p><p>  Now you know all the children of Stalin and their fate (photo in the article).  It's time to make out some more moments from the life of his descendants. </p><h2>  Children and grandchildren of Stalin.  Their fate </h2><p>  Photos of the huge family of Stalin you have the opportunity to see in the article.  The leader had eight grandchildren.  But he saw with his own eyes only three.  Their fates are quite different.  There are tragic, and there are happy ones.  Their attitude towards their grandfather was also more than ambiguous. </p><p>  The eldest son of Stalin, Jacob, had two children.  Eugene was born in 1936.  He was destined to become a military historian.  First, he studied at one of the Suvorov schools, then - at the Academy of Engineering.  For ten years he worked in the system of military missions at various enterprises of the capital and the region.  He took part in the preparation and launches of several space objects. </p><p>  In 1973, he defended his dissertation and began to work as a teacher.  He died in 2016. </p><p>  The daughter of Jacob Galina became a translator and philologist.  She specialized in Algerian literature.  By the way, her husband is Algerian.  At one time, he worked as an UN expert.  From this marriage a deaf and dumb son was born.  Galina died in 2007. </p><p>  Vasily Dzhugashvili had four children and three adoptive children. </p><p> The life of the eldest son of <span>Alexander Bourdonsky</span> was the most successful.  He became a famous director.  He served the <span>Theater of the Soviet Army</span> in the capital.  It was he who managed to stage a number of excellent performances.  We are talking about such productions as ‚ÄúVassa Zheleznova‚Äù, ‚ÄúA Lady with Camellias‚Äù, ‚ÄúOrpheus Goes Down to Hell‚Äù, ‚ÄúSnow Fell‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Last Ardently in Love‚Äù and many others.  The talented director died in 2017. </p><p>  Daughter Nadezhda studied at one of the theater schools, but she could not finish her studies.  She moved to Georgia, but then returned to her homeland, the capital.  By this time, she met with the son of the writer <span>Alexander Fadeev.</span>  And soon they became husband and wife.  They had a daughter, Nastya.  In the late 90s, Hope died. </p><p>  The second son, Vasily, lived only nineteen years.  As a student, he decided to take his own life.  On the day of his death, he was in a drug state. </p><p>  Daughter Svetlana died in 1989.  She was only forty-three. </p><p>  Three adoptive daughters were adopted by Vasily Dzhugashvili.  They say that they kept this name after their marriage. </p><p>  Svetlana Alliluyeva had two daughters and a son. </p><p>  Joseph was the eldest.  He was born in a marriage with G. Morozov.  But when Svetlana married <span>Yuri Zhdanov,</span> his name passed to his son Joseph.  Joseph became a famous cardiologist.  He is considered a real authority in his field.  And his patients still adore him. </p><p>  Daughter Catherine after studying at the university became a volcanologist.  She got married.  From this marriage a daughter was born.  When her husband passed away, Catherine moved to Kamchatka.  They say that she is working there right now. </p><p>  The youngest daughter Olga was born in 1971 in America.  In 1982, his mother moved to Great Britain with Olga.  Olga studied there in Cambridge.  Then she returned to her homeland, in the USA.  According to some sources, she does business.  She has her own haberdashery store in Portland. </p>
