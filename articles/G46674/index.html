    <p>  The great migration of peoples is considered a unique phenomenon in the history of the transition period.  This era (no longer Antiquity, but not the Middle Ages) was limited by time and territorial limits.  In the period from the 2nd to the 7th century, the interaction of civilization and barbarism began to develop intensively in Africa, Asia, and Europe.  As a result, a new <span>type of culture</span> was born <span>.</span> </p><p>  The great migration of peoples determined the further direction of development of Europe, gave a powerful impetus to the formation of new nationalities, states, languages.  The spiritual and socio-psychological atmosphere, morality and morality began to emerge. </p><p>  The great migration of peoples began at a time when the southern and western parts of Europe were occupied by ancient civilization.  It existed within the framework of the Roman state.  The central and eastern European territory was inhabited by tribes of the Balts, Finno-Ugric, Germans, Slavs and other nationalities that did not have a <span>state system.</span> </p><p>  The Germans began the Great Migration of Peoples.  Following them, numerous nomadic tribes and associations began to move from Asia to Europe.  This entailed movement among the local population. </p><p>  Many tribes left their homes and went on a journey.  This became the reason for the formation of the peoples of ancient and new Europe.  Barbarian tribes rushed mainly to the <span>Roman Empire,</span> in which internal contradictions were observed at that time. </p><p>  Researchers divide the Great Migration into three phases. </p><p>  The first is the German period.  It lasted from the 2nd to 4th century.  This era covers the time from the battles of Marcomannos to the Battle of Adrianople. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second period, the Hunnic, lasted from the 4th to the 5th century - the time between the Battle of Adrianople and the battle on the Catalunya Fields. </p><p>  The third stage (from the 6th to the 7th century) is called Slavic.  This period is associated with the movement of Slavic tribes in Central, Southeast and Eastern Europe. </p><p>  Each period had its own characteristics.  The stages were distinguished by ethnic composition, the position of the tribes, the direction and result that the Great Migration of Peoples led to. </p><p>  The Slavs represented a vast nationality.  The tribes were not isolated, they intensively developed, established interethnic contacts.  For that time, both a peaceful neighborhood and a confrontation were characteristic.  The composition of the <span>Slavic tribes</span> changed over time, nationalities mixed with each other, with other peoples.  Along with the perception of the new culture, old traditions were preserved.  The great resettlement contributed to the separation of tribes.  Along with this, new nationalities were formed with new names. </p><p>  The Slavs began moving south.  Their migration to the 7th century was completed.  Having settled on the <span>Balkan Peninsula,</span> they began to unite with the Celts, Illyrians, Thracians.  Turkic-speaking Bulgars "dissolved" in their midst.  The Slavs established contacts with the Greeks and Epyroths, thus laying the foundation for the development of South Slavic ethnic groups. </p><p>  Two interconnected components in the ethnic space of resettlement should be noted.  The first, undoubtedly, are the peoples and tribes that were real participants in the movements.  The second component is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthese nationalities, embodied both in ancient and <span>early medieval</span> writing, and in modern national historiography. </p><p>  The reasons for the Great Migration of Nations are composed of various factors.  The main impetus for the beginning of the movement of tribes is considered a qualitative shift in economic life.  Within the Germanic and Slavic tribes there was an increase in <span>social welfare</span> and a fairly large number of people free from productive labor.  The elite sought wealth.  Campaigns in the Roman Empire became a means of obtaining wealth.  Along with this, the ground was prepared for subsequent resettlement. </p>
