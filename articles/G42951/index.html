The capital of the Khazar Khaganate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Khazars have been known since the 6th century, especially for their attacks on Georgia and Armenia.  They settled from the Volga to the Caucasus, on the territory of modern Russia and Ukraine. </p><p>  From history textbooks it is known that the capital of the Khazars, built at the mouth of the Volga is Itil, which existed in the 8-10th century.  Written sources have been preserved about it, for example, in Arabic-Persian literature on geographical research. </p><p>  Historians still do not know which group these tribes belong to.  According to the main version, they are considered T√ºrks, although there are suggestions that they were Bulgars or Caucasians from the North Caucasus.  The Khazar Khaganate is worthy of attention, since by the 10th century it was able to subjugate the Northern Black Sea Coast and a significant territory of Crimea.  The history of Kievan Rus is closely connected with the existence of the Khazars. </p><p>  An important place for the Khaganate was the capital of the Khazars, built at the mouth of the Volga - Itil.  This city is dedicated to this article. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The city was located at the mouth <span>of the Volga River.</span>  He stood on the shore of the <span>Caspian Sea,</span> which was a very advantageous geographical location.  This allowed the city to become a trading center <span>of the Middle Ages.</span> </p>

    <p>  The exact location of historians and archaeologists has not been determined.  This is due to the fact that the city itself was completely abandoned.  Some scientists believe that the capital of the Khazars, built at the mouth of the Volga - Itil - was located 15 kilometers from Astrakhan.  Others suggest that the city stood north (near modern Volgograd). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The only ancient settlement known to archaeologists is Samosdelskoye, located in the <span>Astrakhan region.</span>  It has been studied since 1990 and dates from the 9-10th century.  Many scholars consider it the capital of the Khazars.  There is a version that the settlement was washed away by the Caspian Sea due to rising water levels. </p><h2>  What is the reason for prosperity </h2><p>  The capital of the Khazar Khaganate was a large sea and river port, as well as an important trading center.  This was due to the advantageous location of the city, through which the most important trade routes of that time passed. </p><p>  The main trading directions in the Middle Ages: </p><ul><li>  <em>China-Europe.</em>  Europeans have always been interested in things from the East.  One of the most important commodities for which they were prepared to pay in gold was silk.  In addition to it, spices and luxury goods were delivered to the port.  In another way, this road is often called the Great Silk Road. </li></ul><ul><li>  <em>Biarmia-Baghdad Caliphate.</em>  Along this path, traders exchanged silver for furs. </li></ul><ul><li>  <em>"From the Varangians to the Khazars."</em>  This path opened up trading opportunities for the Khazars with Western Europe.  The road passed through the cities of Regensburg, Prague, Krakow, Kiev. </li></ul><p>  There is information according to which it becomes known that Russian merchants descended along the Volga to Itil. </p><h2>  What is the name Itil </h2><p>  The city was located in a river delta, therefore it is not surprising that in translation from Turkic its name means ‚Äúriver‚Äù.  There is a Hebrew translation version, according to which the name means ‚Äúcustoms tax‚Äù, which was really collected from passing ships.  However, translation from the Turkic language has greater recognition. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  It is important to understand that the name Itil appeared in relation to the capital only in the 10th century.  So foreigners began to talk about the city, although the Khazars used a different name for the entire settlement, and what we knew was the name of either a river or one of the parts of the city. </p><h2>  Capital buildings </h2><p>  Scientists were able to approximately recreate the appearance of the city.  It is believed that it consisted of three parts located on the cardinal points.  The western and eastern territories were divided by the Volga.  Crossed between them in boats. </p>

    <p>  In the west of the river there lived a king with his associates and an army.  It was this large part of the settlement that was called (west of the Volga River) Itil.  From 10 to 16 thousand people lived in it.  The western part was fenced off from the settlement by a fortress wall, in which there were four exits in the form of a gate.  Two of them went to the port, and two others - to the steppe. </p><p>  The eastern part of the city was a shopping center with markets, warehouses and baths located in it. </p><p>  Between them (presumably on the island) was located the third part with palaces for rulers.  They were created from burnt bricks.  Ordinary residents were not allowed to build from this material, so their homes were felt yurts, wooden tents.  Some people lived in dugouts. </p><h2>  City population </h2><p>  The capital of the Khazar Khaganate was distinguished by a rather motley population.  Here Christians, Gentiles, Muslims, Jews coexisted peacefully.  The Muslim community consisted of merchants, artisans, and the imperial guard.  Judean - from merchants, residents who escaped persecution in Byzantium.  The pagans were mostly Slavs. </p><p>  All disputes between people were decided by judges, who were controlled by a special official of the king.  There were two judges for Jews, Christians and Muslims, one for the Gentiles. </p>

    <p>  The capital of the Khazars, built at the mouth of the Volga - Itil - suggested living only in winter.  From April to November, residents were accommodated on their patrimonial plots of land, and the poor were engaged in field work.  Around the city were villages and arable land, from which crops were delivered to Itil by land and water. </p><h2>  The death of the city </h2>

    <p>  The capital of the Khazars (Itil) was destroyed in the second half of the 10th century.  This event is associated with the <span>prince of Kievan Rus</span> Svyatoslav Igorevich.  The population that survived the capture of the city was able to take refuge on the islands in the river delta. </p><p>  By the beginning of the 11th century, the Russians left the capital and the Khazar royal court was able to return to it.  However, the city was, according to al-Biruni, ruins.  His further history is unknown. </p>
