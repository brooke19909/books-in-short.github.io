    <p>  In the museum you can get acquainted with things, objects, documents, photographs, personal notes of Pasternak.  Among them are books, a flask, a snuffbox, family photos.  For the museum was allocated the second floor of the building.  The museum is located at: st.  Lenin, 81. Tens of thousands of people visit him annually. </p><p>  Some sights of Chistopol, photos of which are presented in the article, <strong></strong>  known for their unique architecture.  Such is the house of the merchant Melnikov.  The building cannot be called ancient - it was built relatively recently.  Nevertheless, he is considered an unofficial visiting card of Chistopol. </p><p>  This building is painted white with a gray edging, and a spire is installed on its roof.  The history of the building is connected with the success of the local merchant Melnik.  With the proceeds, it was decided to erect an unusual building for those times.  The original design and subtlety of design to this day distinguish it from other Chistopol houses.  Now this house is considered a public building, inside is not of great interest to tourists: it houses a library and an art hall. </p><p>  The sights of Chistopol include the city museum.  It is one of the most popular museums in Tatarstan.  It is located in a merchant's house.  Here you can get acquainted with the paintings of local and foreign artists, as well as with ancient relics found in local excavations: ancient beads, knives, horseshoes, precious stones, dishes, etc. The museum includes 5 spacious and well-lit halls. </p><h2>  Picturesque places </h2><p>  The remainder of the ancient settlement is the ancient settlement of Djuketau.  Sight <strong></strong>  located in the suburbs of Chistopol, on the banks of the Kama River.  The settlement was founded in the 10th century AD and was a military, political, commercial and cultural center of regional significance.  Initially, the city was like a fortress, after which it became a real principality.  After 200 years, presumably in 1236, he was badly damaged by military raids, and after another 200 years, residents left him.  The remains of the ancient gate, the existing wells, the foundations of houses - this is all that remains of the ancient settlement. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the ruins, tourists can get acquainted with the nature of the Lower Prikamye.  Skaryatinsky garden is not only a place of rest for citizens, but also a historical attraction of Chistopol.  It is located in the central part of the city and is abundantly landscaped.  The year of foundation is 1867. In 2013, the garden acquired a more modern look, a cafe, carousels, playgrounds for children appeared.  From the point of view of historical value, this is a minus, but in a modernized form it attracts numerous visitors, as there are more opportunities for recreation and amenities. </p>
