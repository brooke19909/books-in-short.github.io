So, Andaman Phuket Hotel is located almost in the city center.  In its vicinity there is a large shopping center, a grocery hypermarket (many tourists bought fruits here to take home with them), lots of cafes, restaurants and bars, as well as a huge market where you can find a variety of products. </p><p>  As for the rooms, in general, the guests were satisfied with them.  However, according to them, the windows of the apartments overlook either the garden or the neighboring building.  Experienced travelers advise the first option to those who want to enjoy the pretty scenery from the room, and the second to those who do not want to be disturbed by extraneous noise from the street.  All apartments here have a pleasant design, it is noticeable that they have recently been renovated.  Our compatriots note very comfortable large beds.

So, you will not find sausages and cheese here.  But you can taste eggs, sausages, dried cereal, rice, pasta, fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as delicious pancakes that bake right with you, with jam.  During the day you can eat in the surrounding cafes and restaurants. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The nearest Patong beach, according to tourists, from Andaman Phuket Hotel can be reached in 10 minutes by leisurely step.  On the way you need to cross the road.  The beach here, according to most of our compatriots, is not very clean, but overall it's nice to relax here.  However, many tourists rented a scooter and went to other beaches. </p><p>  Since Andaman Phuket Hotel 3 * is a typical city hotel that does not have its own territory, special entertainment is not offered to guests here.  However, tourists can have a good time on the roof of the hotel, which has a small pool and sun loungers and parasols.  There is a spa on the ground floor of the hotel.  According to our compatriots, they make an excellent and very inexpensive massage in it. </p>
