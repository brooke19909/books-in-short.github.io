    <h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  The Paris Nha Trang Hotel offers a variety of rooms to potential guests.  There are superior 2-seater with a view of the city (designed for 2-4 people), executive apartments, spacious deluxes.  These rooms can be either with one wide bed or with two standard beds.  Apartments with a separate bedroom are also very popular.  There is an option for 2-4 people and 4-8.  In the second case, the apartments will have two separate bedrooms. </p><p>  In addition to the above, the hotel has premium rooms - the same suites.  That is, luxury apartments with all kinds of amenities and services.  And of course, all of the listed rooms differ in price, conditions and view from the windows.  Well, it‚Äôs worth briefly telling about all the premises listed above. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Superior 2-bed apartment </h2><p>  This is the first room category of the Paris Nha Trang Hotel, which is worth telling more about.  So, the apartments have a living area of ‚Äã‚Äã24 square meters.  Renting such a room for 2 weeks will cost about 40 thousand rubles for two (with breakfast, fees and taxes included in the amount). </p><p>  The amenities have everything you need for a comfortable stay, starting with a safe and ending with towels.  The room is really furnished with various things - there is air conditioning, a private seating area, a flat-screen TV with satellite and cable channels.  Spacious wardrobe, minibar, electric kettle, alarm clock, toilet, bathroom.  There are even slippers and free toiletries in the room. </p><p>  I would also like to note the marble lined floor.

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  This is the last topic I would like to touch upon when talking about the Paris Nha Trang Hotel 3 *.  The hotel reviews are excellent.  And this is not surprising, because here they really care about the guests.  The hotel has everything - from free parking and wireless Internet to delivery of food, drinks and packed lunches in the room. </p><p>  Car rental, shuttle service, express check-in or check-out, tour desk services, and dry cleaning and laundry services are also available.  There is even a currency exchange.  Needless to say, the hotel even organized rooms for conferences, banquets and other events.  Even a business center - and that one is here.  In general, everything that can come in handy.  So, taking into account all the above, you can not ask yourself why this hotel is so popular and in demand.  By the way, for this reason, experienced travelers recommend booking a room for their vacation early, about two months before entry, otherwise vacant apartments can be dismantled. </p>
