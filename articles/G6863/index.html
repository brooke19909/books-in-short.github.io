All of them, as a rule, are similar to ourselves.  And those who are different in something, immediately cause genuine interest.  Children tease and do not accept them in games, and adults try to avoid them.  But sometimes it is dissimilarity that becomes the reason why the whole world notices us. </p>

    <h2>  Growth far above average </h2><p>  The longest man in the world, according to the Guinness Book of Records, is still growing.  Sultan Kosen - a Turkish young man of 29 years old - was born in the most ordinary farming family.  From childhood, he suffered from a serious illness - a tumor in the pituitary gland.  Because of this, a huge amount of <span>growth hormones was released</span> into the body <span>.</span>  At 27, the longest person reached a mark of 2 meters 47 centimeters. </p><h2>  Life story - medical history </h2><p>  For many years, doctors tried to rid Cosen of a terrible disease.  But all their efforts were in vain.  The tumor continued to grow, and the boy continued to grow.  Only recently, thanks to the rapid development of medicine, did the operation succeed.  Education has been removed, but no one has yet decided to talk about complete success.  Today, the growth of the young man has reached 2 meters 51 centimeters.  In addition to outstanding growth, he also has the longest feet on the planet with 36.6 centimeters and palms at 28.5 centimeters.  The longest man in the world has difficulty moving around.  To do this, he has to use crutches.  They not only help rearrange huge legs, but also reduce the load on the bones.  The fact is that the size of the body is so large that there is a big risk of damage to the knee joints.  In addition, it has recently become known that Sultan Kosen has vision problems, which are rapidly deteriorating. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the tallest man" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6836/387008.jpg?1399024436608" width="224"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A young man often says that it is difficult for him to communicate with people.  Many are afraid of him and try not to make friendship with the giant.  He still has not found happiness in his personal life, since he can not meet a girl.  He really wants to get married and have a family.  For this, he participated in the competition "The Longest People of the World".  A photo of him in all its glory was to attract attention and make the weaker sex admire, not fear.  Whether Kosen achieved his goal is still unknown. </p><h2>  It could have been otherwise </h2><p>  What <span>is the tallest man</span> on the planet?  It would seem that the answer is obvious.  However, everything is not as simple as it seems.  Sultan Kosen received his title not only due to outstanding growth.  The fact is that <span>Leonid Stadnik</span> refused to participate in the competition.  In fact, the longest person in the world is he.  The height of the Ukrainian is 2 meters 57 centimeters.  He argued his refusal by the fact that he did not want too much popularity, which greatly interferes with his quiet life.  He does not see any benefit to him in this.  Thanks to this, the young Turk took first place. </p><h2>  Leonid Stadnik </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the longest people in the world photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6836/387011.jpg?1399024496855" width="405"></div></h2><p>  Forty-year-old Ukrainian lives in the <span>Zhytomyr region,</span> in the village of Podolyany.  This is a small village with one single street.  A person with his height would stand out even in the largest city, and even more so here.  Locals are already accustomed to the sight of an unusual neighbor.  Moreover, he will never refuse to help and will do any work that many healthy men cannot do.  The longest man in the world wears huge shoes.  Of course, this is not on sale and is unlikely to be in the near future.  Leonid has long been a regular customer of custom-made ateliers.  Mother helps him take care of the shoes.  After all, this is by no means an easy task: to wash, peel, file and so on.  This job usually takes a couple of hours.  Almost the same problem with clothes that wears out faster than shoes.  His horse helps Eugene to move around.  Not a single bike can stand it.  He tried to sit on it several times.  As a result, two bicycles were broken.  Recently, a giant bought a car, which greatly accelerated his life. </p><h2>  How did it all happen? <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the longest man" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6836/387012.jpg?1399024528544" width="361"></div></h2><p>  His story is very similar to the previous one, or rather, his illness.  Leonid was born a completely healthy child.  He grew up and developed like all the boys until he was 12 years old.  It was at this age that he discovered brain tumors in the pituitary gland.  This led to grave consequences, namely to acromegaly.  For a long time he worked as a veterinarian.  However, due to health problems, he stopped this activity.  Due to the huge growth, he has difficulty with movement.  To do this, he needs support.  In 2008, the president honored him with a Chevrolet automobile.  Personal life, like many prominent people, he does not add up.  He blames only his illness and, of course, growth.  Not every girl will decide to establish a relationship with a person who is almost twice as high as anyone.  By nature, Leonid is a sociable person.  Loves company and fun.  At present, medicine cannot help him in any way.  Doctors try to make his life easier.  However, this is not an easy task. </p>
