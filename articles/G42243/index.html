    <h2>  Sony Vaio VPC-Z21V9R </h2><p>  Ultrabooks Sony are primarily distinguished by an ergonomic design.  This model managed to combine a powerful "stuffing" and an attractive appearance.  The case is made of high-quality plastic, which does not collect dirt and does not wipe with time.  The manufacturer did not make the cover glossy, which can be found in many budget devices.  This, of course, only benefited him.  Ultrabooks Sony, among other things, are also famous for their displays with excellent color reproduction.  Vaio VPC-Z21V9R received a good 13.1-inch matrix with a resolution of 1600x900 pixels, which is enough for a high-quality picture.  The screen is very contrasting and does not glare in the sun, which allows you to use the model outdoors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
