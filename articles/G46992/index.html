    <h2>  Sberbank Gold Credit Card: grace period conditions </h2><p>  This question is of interest to customers in the first place.  Among the many products, Sberbank's gold credit card is special.  The terms of use of this offer are considered to give the holder some privileges.  All this unobtrusively creates him the status of a premium client. </p><p>  On the issue of repayment, you need to know that it is best to make payments through ATMs or cash desks of Sberbank.  Today there is another payment option - through the online system. </p><p>  <span>The grace period,</span> that is, the time when interest is not accrued on the limit amount, is 50 days.  However, it is worth noting that this period does not apply to the return of money received through an ATM.  If it is not possible to return all the amount used from the card, it will have to be paid in certain parts.  A single payment should be at least 5% of the total amount. </p><p>  It is best to familiarize yourself with the terms of debt repayment in advance if you have received a gold credit card from Sberbank of Russia.  Interest on the card can be accrued not only by agreement, but also for violation of payment terms.  They will make up 36% per annum. </p>

    <h2>  Comparison </h2><p>  To assess the premium merits of a gold card, it is best to compare its characteristics with similar products in other institutions. </p><p>  Alfa-Bank offers annual interest from 18 to 33. At the same time, the grace period for the cards of this institution is 60-100 days.  The maximum limit is the amount of 300,000 rubles.  And annual service fees vary from 1,500 to 3,000 rubles. </p><p>  VTB 24 has a clear interest rate on the loan in question at 22%.  Moreover, the maximum amount for cash is 600,000 rubles, and the grace period is 50 days.  Serving a VTB 24 credit card will cost a client from 2,000 to 3,500 rubles. </p><p>  Raiffeisenbank offers interest on such a credit card from 24 to 27. The maximum amount is 600,000 rubles, and the annual service fee will cost the client in the amount of 1,500 to 28,000. </p><p>  Summing up, I would like to note that many citizens of the Russian Federation appreciated the benefits of such a product as Sberbank's gold credit card.  The terms of use of this offer allow you to make favorable purchases in stores both at home and in other countries.  In addition, the card has a feature - there is no payment for its annual service. </p>
