The world did not know such a number of talented military leaders at once and in one place.  Most of them rose from the very bottom, thanks not to kinship, not to a monstrous caprice, not to bought patronage, but exclusively to talent, zeal and other outstanding qualities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="savoart.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="army generals of napoleon" class="if uuid-3071523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3071523.jpg"></div><h2>  The reign of Napoleon in France.  First empire </h2><p>  Napoleon Bonaparte, a native of a wealthy noble family in Corsica, met the Great French Revolution with great enthusiasm.  Endowed with phenomenal memory, performance and many other excellent data, he played a huge role in the fate of France of this time.  In 1793, Napoleon became a general.  His ambition is not fully satisfied. </p><p>  He dreams of more, rapidly climbing up the career ladder and overcoming any obstacles.  Everything great attracts like.  Only this can explain the appearance in France of that time of such a number of talented military leaders.  After the coup on November 9, 1799, a new regime was established under which three consuls formally ruled.  Actual power was concentrated in the hands of the first consul of Napoleon Bonaparte.  After a plebiscite in 1802, the power of the General of the Revolution Napoleon Bonaparte was consolidated for life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The new government did not support either the Republicans or the royalists.  Against Napoleon, conspiracies were constantly carried out.  To give legitimacy to the authorities, new, previously unseen rules of law were developed.  Until 1804, a new form of power was constitutionally fixed - the bourgeois monarchy and its leader Napoleon Bonaparte, who has unlimited powers. </p><p>  Napoleon, in order to restrain her, began by creating an army of a new type, which Europe did not yet know.  To do this, he needed loyal commanders, including generals.  Napoleon relied both on those who served with the Bourbons, but for some reason did not want the return of the old power, and on people from the people who possessed the necessary qualities.  He flirted with the army in every way, the top commanders received ranks, titles, awards, estates.  At the same time, the conscription service was extended to 7 years. </p><h2>  The creation of the third coalition </h2><p>  After the Anglo-French war of 1800-1802, the peace of Amiens was concluded, which in fact turned out to be fragile and short-lived.  He was essentially a short-lived truce.  On all international issues, a clash of English and French interests took place.  The British were very suspicious of the colonial policy of France. </p><p>  At the beginning of the XIX century, France was the largest and centralized country in Europe, whose army was unrivaled, both in the field of weapons and equipment, and in the field of quality and strength of personnel.  Recruitment to the French army was carried out on draft, soldiers underwent training.  The command posts were held by worthy and experienced officers and generals.  Napoleon could be credited with the fact that he developed and improved the use of mass armies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1805, a third coalition was created, which was directed against France.  It includes the states: Austria, England, Russia, Denmark, Sweden and two states of Sicily.  The total number of military forces of these countries amounted to more than 500 thousand soldiers.  The purpose of its creation was also outlined - the liberation of Germany, Italy, Holland and Switzerland and the restoration of monarchy regimes on their territories.  Napoleon answered this with the creation of the Great Army in 1805-1808. </p><div class="photo" data-original="clubz.bg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napoleon generals" class="if uuid-3071504" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3071504.jpg"></div><h2>  Creation of a Great Army </h2><p>  At the initial stage, this concept should not mean all the armed forces of France.  It was part of it, which initially consisted of 7 army corps, each of which consisted of 2 to 4 infantry divisions, a light cavalry brigade, artillery consisting of 35-40 guns, as well as units of sappers and wagons.  It was a mobile unit that could well conduct combat operations separately from the main army. </p><p>  The commander of the corps could be a military leader in the rank of marshal or brigadier general.  Napoleon himself carried this title in 1796.  The size of the corps could vary from 20 to 70 thousand, but the structure was strictly observed - these were infantry and cavalry units, artillery, convoy supplies.  The system of using army corps made the army mobile, easily manageable, one that could act as a broad front against the enemy.  It was a certain type of innovation in the art of war.  In the creation of a new type of army were actively involved colleagues - marshals and generals of Napoleon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A large role was given to reserves.  The cavalry included two cuirassier divisions, with the support of 24 four artillery pieces.  Their number was 22 thousand.  A separate artillery reserve was formed, which amounted to almost a quarter of the entire artillery of the army, it included mostly 12-pound guns.  The imperial guard reserve included units of elite grenadiers, which were selected in active units.  This was not some kind of innovation, since the general of the revolution Napoleon began to create artillery reserves in 1796. </p><h2>  Increase in the size of the Great Army </h2><p>  She at the time of its creation had a 350 thousandth composition.  But from year to year she increased her numbers, mostly at the expense of the Allies.  Already in 1812, more than 500 thousand soldiers were put up against Russia, and 250 thousand were on the Iberian Peninsula.  The main value of the Great Army is, of course, the commanders, including the marshals and generals of Napoleon. </p><p>  Historians studying the Napoleonic campaigns are surprised to note a large number of prominent military leaders who were in his immediate circle, and call this a phenomenon.  In the framework of the article, we can consider short biographies of only some of them that have become the national heroes of France, but this in no way detracts from the dignity of others. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nam.ac.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napoleon war generals" class="if uuid-3072518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3072518.jpg"></div><h2>  Des Des Louis Charles Antoine (1768-1800) </h2><p>  Division General, member of the first two companies of the consul and General Napoleon Bonaparte.  He died leading a counterattack at Marengo.  Napoleon, learning of his death, cried, unable to restrain his feelings from the loss of his ally and friend. </p><p>  Dese came from an ancient, but impoverished noble family.  After graduating from military training, he received the rank of 2nd lieutenant and began to serve in the infantry regiment.  But, unable to bear the lack of discipline and the complete licentiousness of morals, he left.  He served as adjutant to the Duke of Broglie, commander of the French troops on the Rhine.  At the beginning of the revolution he received the rank of 1st lieutenant, and a while later - the captain. </p><p>  Taking wholeheartedly the revolution and its ideals, the future general of Napoleon Bonaparte opposed the bloody repression, for which he spent several months in prison with his general.  They were released at the request of generals Kyustin and Biron and again departed for the Rhine army.  With his open statements against repression, he was considered an ardent royalist and an enemy of the Jacobins.  In addition, he was known as a talented commander and in 1793 was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and after a while to generals. </p><p>  Despite the flattering reviews of the generals and his immediate superiors, the Committee for Public Safety makes a decision on his arrest, but the soldiers, learning about this, came to his defense, not allowing it to be done.  In the years 1795-1796.  Dese was an associate of General Moreau on the Rhine.  Participated in his campaigns for the Rhine.  It was at this time that he became a brigadier general.  All of France knew about his exploits.  Dese was so calm and restrained as brave and brave.  His dream came true - he became a general of Napoleon, their personal acquaintance occurred. </p><h2>  Battle of Marengo </h2><p>  He goes to Italy, to the army of Napoleon.  He, having learned of his arrival, was incredibly happy, because he had heard about the successes and military talents of Dese.  He gave his future ally a magnificent reception.  Dese completely fell under the charm of Napoleon and expressed his intentions to take part in his upcoming Egyptian campaigns.  What he received the consent of Bonaparte.  For all nine months of the campaign, Dese, being a general of Napoleon‚Äôs army, showed himself to be an excellent strategist, a good commander, bearing all the hardships of the campaign together with his soldiers.  Returning to Europe, Napoleon firmly decided that this general would be with him. </p><p>  After completing the campaign, Dese arrived at the Italian port of Livorno, where he was arrested by the English admiral Keith.  He spent more than a month in captivity and was released on an exchange.  By this time, the preparation of the Italian military campaign of General Napoleon was completed.  Dese arrived in France two days before the battle of Marengo and appeared before Napoleon, who joyfully met his friend and entrusted him with command of the corps, which included two divisions. </p><p>  On the morning of the battle Napoleon ordered Desa with one division to advance towards Genoa and cut the road from Alexandria to stop the transfer of Austrian troops.  Napoleon‚Äôs troops were to advance to the Alexandria region, where the main forces of the Austrian army were concentrated under the command of General Melassus.  The division under the command of Dese was on the march when the sounds of cannonade were heard from the side of Marengo.  Having understood everything at once, the division took the side of the ongoing battle. </p><p>  Napoleon lost it, but higher powers sent him luck in the form of General Dese, who brought with him a whole division, weary of the transition, but determined to enter the battle.  The Austrians, reporting on the victory, did not expect the beginning of new actions.  Runaway Frenchmen, inspired by the appearance of Dese, turned back.  After some time, the Austrians were crushed and fled.  The battle of Marengo was won.  Division General Dese died, pierced by a bullet on the spot.  Napoleon could not rejoice in the victory, he grieved for the loss of a friend, the talented General Dese, who was only 26 years old. </p><div class="photo" data-original="muzeysheremetievyh.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="general of the revolution napoleon" class="if uuid-3071536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3071536.jpg"></div><h2>  General Louis St. Hilaire </h2><p>  <span>Brigadier General</span> Louis Saint-Hilaire, an active participant in the Napoleonic Wars, count from 1808, also entered the galaxy of outstanding French generals of Napoleon.  He was born into the family of an artillery captain in September 1766.  At the age of 11 he entered the cadet in the regiment, at 14 set sail for the West Indies.  At the age of 17, he was enrolled as a lieutenant in the Aquitanian regiment, at age 26 he received the rank of captain and served in the Alpine army.  Here fate brought him together with Napoleon.  In 1793, he received the post of battalion commander. </p><p>  A year later he was transferred to the Italian army in the division of General Lagarpe, a Swiss by birth, who died in the vanguard battle of Lodi in 1796.  Saint-Hilaire has been appointed by the Directory as Colonel of Staff.  He was injured near Mantua and was appointed commandant of Lodi.  From May 1798 to 1799 he was in administrative service - he was the commandant of the depot in the Eastern Army of Napoleon in Toulon, commander of the 8th military district in Marseille.  In December 1799 he received the rank of brigadier general in the army of Suchet. </p><p>  In 1803 he took command of the 1st Infantry Division of the Army of Marshal Sult.  It was here that St. Hilaire's leadership talent was fully revealed.  It was with this division that he covered himself with fame and earned the title of one of the outstanding generals of the army of Napoleon.  He participated in the battle of Austerlitz, where he was injured and a sign of the Great Eagle of the Legion of Honor.  He took an active part in the Prussian and Polish companies. </p><p>  After the first Great Army was dissolved in 1808, its division became part of the Rhine army of the legendary Marshal Davout.  He takes part in the battle of Tengen, where, together with the division of Frian, he holds back the 60,000-strong army of Archduke Karl.  Davout admires his strength of mind and stamina, as reported by Napoleon. </p><p>  But in the battle of Essling, the general was wounded in the leg, which he was then amputated, after which he was sent to Vienna, where he died on June 5, 1809.  In the Austrian company, besides him, Marshal Lahn died.  They are both buried in the Paris Pantheon.  In his memoirs, Napoleon calls him a knight without fear and reproach, emphasizing that he was always honest and noble in everything. </p><h2>  The creation of the second Great Army </h2><p>  Before going to Russia, Napoleon with the generals of war decided to create a new Great Army.  The time of its creation is January-February 1811.  Its composition increased significantly, its number was approximately in the range from 462 to 516 thousand, where the majority were Poles, Austrians, Germans, Croats, Spaniards and Italians.  It was created 10 infantry corps, 4 cavalry corps and the eleventh reserve corps of 60 thousand soldiers under the command of Marshal Augereau.  The corps was commanded by the marshals and generals of Napoleon in 1812: </p><ul><li>  1st.  Marshal Dawu commanded.  It had 68-72 thousand people. </li><li>  2nd.  Marshal Odin.  The composition of 35-35 thousand people. </li><li>  3rd.  Marshal Ney.  Composition 38-39 thousand people. </li><li>  4th.  General Beauharnais.  Composition of 45 thousand people. </li><li>  5th.  General Ponyatovsky.  Composition 36-38 thousand people. </li><li>  6th.  General Saint-Cyr.  Composition of 27 thousand people. </li><li>  7th.  General Rainier.  Composition of 18-25 thousand people. </li><li>  8th.  General Wandam.  Composition of 17-19 thousand people. </li><li>  9th.  Marshal Victor.  Composition 33-34 thousand people. </li><li>  10th.  Marshal MacDonald.  Composition 30-32 thousand people </li><li>  11th reserve.  Marshal Augereau.  Composition of 60 thousand people. </li><li>  Guard.  Marshal Mortier.  Composition up to 47 thousand people. </li><li>  1, 2, 3rd cavalry corps.  Marshal Murat.  Composition up to 32 thousand people. </li><li>  4th cavalry.  Marshal Latour-Mobour.  Composition up to 8 thousand people. </li><li>  In addition, at the headquarters consisted of 2 thousand people, in convoys up to 21 thousand people. </li></ul><p>  The fate of the 2nd <span>Great Army of Napoleon is</span> more than tragic.  Of the total number of soldiers and officers who crossed the borders of Russia in 1812, 23 thousand French, 15 thousand Prussians, 25 thousand Austrians, 10 thousand Poles, 8 thousand Saxons and 2 thousand Bavarians passed through the Russian border back.  For some generals who fought in 1812, fate was just as tragic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nl.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="military campaigns of general napoleon" class="if uuid-3071543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3071543.jpg"></div><h2>  The best generals of Napoleon, who became marshals </h2><p>  In the first place you can put Davout, Des, Bertier and Desser - excellent strategists and cool-blooded tactics.  Reckless brave men and brave warriors were Murat, Ney and Oudinot.  Each was unique in its own way.  But they all had one thing in common - the talent of the military leaders and selfless devotion to Napoleon Bonaparte. </p><p>  Of course, each of them had certain qualities.  Murat, Ney was united with Davout selfless courage.  If Ney and Murat, she was reckless, then Davout - deliberate and justified.  The fame of Napoleon, surrounded by generals such as Davout, Des, Berthier, Desser, Murat, Ney, Oudinot and others shone above him with a halo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.art-prints-on-demand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="french generals of napoleon" class="if uuid-3071565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3071565.jpg"></div><h2>  Bessi√®res Jean ‚Äì Baptiste (1768-1813) </h2><p>  Born in the family of a surgeon.  Having reached adolescence, he was sent to study in Montpellier to become a doctor.  But there was not enough money and I had to quit my studies.  He returned home and began to work as a barber.  In 1789 he entered the Constitutional Guard of Louis XVI, after it was disbanded, began to serve in the National Guard.  In 1794 he received the rank of captain of the Horse Jaeger Regiment. </p><p>  In 1796 he was transferred to the Italian army under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte.  He was distinguished by his courage, which earned the location of Napoleon, was appointed commander of the guard, from which the famous guard formed.  He participated in the military campaigns of General Napoleon, such as Egyptian, Syrian.  In the coup of the 18th Brumaire, Bessi√®res became the shadow of Napoleon, providing his protection.  After this, he is appointed deputy commander of the Consular Guard.  At the Battle of Marengo, in 1800, brilliantly attacks the enemy with cavalry.  A month later he was awarded the rank of brigadier general. </p><p>  In 1801 he became commander of the Horse Guards.  In 1802 he received the title of division general.  In 1804 he was awarded the title of Marshal.  He was a devoted ally of Napoleon, fearless, cold-blooded and brave in battle.  He remained his close and devoted companion.  He was given the title of Duke of Istria, so he commanded troops in Spain, where he achieved considerable success and gained up to Medina de Rioseca. </p><p>  In 1812 he participated in a campaign against Russia.  During the retreat, he showed surprising composure and judgment.  In the campaign of 1813 he became commander in chief of the entire cavalry.  Bessi√®res died in May of the same year at the battle of Weissenfels from a nuclear hit. </p><h2>  Louis Nicolas Davout (1770 - 1823) </h2><p> Born in Burgundy, in the small town of Anu, in the family of a cavalry lieutenant.  He entered the Brienne military school and after graduation he went according to the family tradition to serve in the cavalry regiment.  It was this military school that Napoleon graduated from Davout a year before entering.  Before the revolution, he served in the Northern Army, commanded by Dumurier, who ordered to speak out against rebellious Paris.  Davout calls not to listen to the general, and in case of a repeated order - to shoot him.  Dumourier hastened to hide, and Louis-Nicolas Davout received the rank of colonel from the Girondins. </p><p>  He sympathizes with the Girondins, but does not accept revolutionary terror.  For this he was subjected to short-term arrest.  In protest, he renounces the rank of brigadier general and resigns.  Davout returns after the coup of the 9th Thermidor.  For three years he participated in the Egyptian expedition, where he became friends with Dese.  For outstanding abilities in 1804 he received the title of Marshal and took part in the Ulm operation.  The talent of commander Davout ensured the victory of the Great Army in the battle of Austerlitz. </p><p>  He defeated the army of the Duke of Braunschweig, having a strength twice that of the French, for which he was awarded the title of Duke.  In 1809 he defeated the Austrians at Ekmule and Wagram, having received the title of prince for victory.  It belongs to the generals of Napoleon in 1812.  He participated in battles against the army of Bagration near Saltanovka, Smolensk and was shell-shocked at Borodino.  This is the only general and marshal who has not disowned his ruler.  After the return of Napoleon from the island of Elba, he was appointed Minister of War. </p><p>  After the defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in response to a proposal for surrender, he issued an ultimatum in which he demanded an amnesty for everyone who participated in Napoleon‚Äôs return, he was adamant in this, threatening to redeploy troops to positions.  The allies had to agree.  He was the only marshal who never swore allegiance to the Bourbons, and they failed to accuse him of treason.  Louis XVIII brought him closer to the court and made him a peer of France in 1819.  Four years later, he died of tuberculosis. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napoleon became a general" class="if uuid-3071551" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3071551.jpg"></div><h2>  Napoleon and Talleyrand </h2><p>  Not the least role in Napoleon‚Äôs career was played by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord, who used it to his advantage.  This man became famous for his cunning, unscrupulousness, recognizing only his personal interests.  It was these qualities that allowed him to be Minister of Foreign Affairs under the three rulers of France.  Having taken the same post during the management of the directory, he understood that this was not for long. </p><p>  Therefore, he relied on the ambitious and proud General Napoleon.  Tolerant had the tricks to rub his confidence in him.  He assists Bonaparte in organizing the 18th Brumaire coup.  It was after his prompts that Napoleon became the first consul.  The emperor gave Talleyrand huge revenues. </p><p>  Already with the existence of the First Empire, the minister begins to collaborate with the Bourbons for money.  However, for the sake of profit, he collaborates with everyone, betraying subsequently as unnecessary.  Sensing the imminent fall of Napoleon, he did the same to him. </p><h2>  Moro Jean Victor (1763-1813) </h2><p>  The future general was born in the family of a lawyer.  His military career began in 1791, when he joined the National Guard as commander of a battalion.  Two years later he was transferred to the army of General Pishegru with his battalion.  After some time, he received the rank of brigadier general and was appointed commander of the right flank of the Northern Army as General Napoleon. </p><p>  Moreau and Bonaparte were on good terms.  This continued until his marriage in 1800 to Eugene Alexander Gulo, a friend of Josephine Beauharnais.  Eugene, being very ambitious and envious, provoked a feeling of alienation between friends, which later developed into open hostility. </p><p>  In 1794, Moreau wins the Battle of Turkuen, where the armies of the Austrians and British were defeated.  In 1796 he led the Rhine-Moselle army and won a number of victories over the Austrians.  He became famous for his famous departure through the Black Forest to the Rhine, having established himself as a wonderful strategist.  In 1799 he was appointed commander of the Italian army and was defeated by Suvorov on the Adda River. </p><p>  In 1800, Moreau was appointed as commander of the Rhine Army, having won several major victories over the Austrians, occupying the cities of Regensburg and Munich.  He won the battle of Hohenlinden and, approaching Vienna, concluded a truce with the Archduke.  But Moro prevented further advancement in his military career because Bonaparte saw him as his rival and accused him of conspiracy.  This was followed by expulsion from the country. </p><p>  Moreau went to America, where he was found by representatives of the Russian government, who offered to serve in the Russian army.  Under the influence of royalist generals, he returns to Europe and gives his consent to Alexander I. One month after arriving from America, he was mortally wounded by a cannonball in the battle of Dresden.  Both legs were amputated and a few days later he died.  There is a legend that this is the revenge of Napoleon, who avenged his betrayal by seeing him in a telescope talking to Alexander I. </p>
