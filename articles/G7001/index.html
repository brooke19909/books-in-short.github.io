We need time in order to be alone with ourselves, with nature, to gather our thoughts and, on the whole, to prepare ourselves for new labor feats. </p><p>  Truly a relaxing place to relax is Vietnam.  If you had the opportunity to visit other Asian resorts, for example, Indonesia, India or Thailand, you probably have an idea about the vacation itself, the level of service and the exotic that accompanies it.  But among all this variety of resorts, Vietnam still stands out.  And all because it is suitable for more picky tourists who pay great attention to comfort, service, quality of service and the cleanliness of the beach and sea.  Vietnam is just perfect for a beach holiday, it will surely appeal to those tourists who have long dreamed of getting to know Asian culture, philosophy, but have put off this. </p>

    <h2>  Features of accommodation </h2><p>  In Vietnam, there are many urban-type hotels that are remote from the coastline, that is, the beach.  But here you can find excellent, even chic bungalows located on the coast - they are most often chosen by newlyweds and couples in love.  Which option to choose is up to you to decide.  The only thing is that at the planning stage of the trip, it is necessary to carefully study all potential options so that upon arrival at the resort you will not be disappointed with what you saw, and do not spoil your vacation.  In principle, if every tourist traveling to Asia understands that he will spend only a night in his room, will not expect much from a hotel or a hotel, he will have a great time.  If you look for flaws, then even in the most luxurious hotel you can find them.  We want to offer tourists a modest and not the most popular hotel among Russians in Vietnam - Dai Duong Hotel 2 *.  What conditions for accommodation and leisure for tourists can he offer?  What should all tourists prepare themselves for?  This is what we will understand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  So, Dai Duong Ocean Hotel 2 * won our attention only because it is not very popular among Russian tourists, despite the proximity to the sea.  I want to understand what is the reason for such inattention.  So, it is located on the first coastline, that is, from it to the sea no more than 200 meters.  This is a great option for those tourists who prefer a beach holiday and are not ready to cover a significant distance daily in order to swim in the sea and soak up the warm sand. </p>

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  Politeness and attentiveness - the visiting card of hotels in Vietnam.  The Dai Duong Hotel 2 * (Nyasang) did not become an exception.  Tourists and vacationers note that they settle in the room quickly enough, there are no problems and difficulties.  The hotel administration is well aware of the long journey that tourists have traveled, so we try to give the room keys as soon as possible and give vacationers the opportunity to put themselves in order and relax from the road.  In general, the hotel is not for Russian tourists, there are quite a lot of Vietnamese, that's why the situation in the rooms, food - everything is focused on them.  This feature will seem to someone an advantage, but for other tourists - a disadvantage.  But just this fact must be taken into account when planning a vacation </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Surely tourists are interested in the location of the Dai Duong Ocean Hotel 2 * hotel.  Reviews about him, admittedly, are pretty good.  Not far from the hotel are the best cafes of the coast, where you can get acquainted with national cuisine, appreciate it in full glory.  In the evening, live music of national motifs comes from the street - quite fun and interesting. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Some tourists are struck by the absence of the hotel entrance as such - it is replaced by a typical canopy.  For Vietnam, this is quite common, there is nothing strange and surprising.  If you are used to relaxing in luxurious conditions, enjoying spacious and bright rooms, Dai Duong Hotel 2 * is definitely not your story.  Reviews of tourists, of course, affect the condition of the rooms, and most of them note the presence of old, worn-out furniture from time to time, completely not modern interior.  Indeed, many rooms need not only cosmetic but also overhaul: the walls are cracked, the furniture is old, sometimes even broken - that is why during check-in, it is necessary to carefully inspect everything in the presence of hotel staff and point out any deficiencies. </p>

    <p>  The view from the window spoils the presence of metal grilles - but it is they who are responsible for safety on vacation.  The rooms themselves are cramped, barely enough space for the necessary furniture.  Unfortunately, the room does not even have a wardrobe, so you have to store all things in a suitcase.  Of the amenities in the room, excellent air conditioning, it works properly, without interruption, so the room is supported by pleasant freshness and coolness.  But with the refrigerator in the room of the Dai Duong Hotel 2 *, everything is not so rosy: in some rooms it does not work at all.  All drinks stored in the bar are paid.  You should not hope that the staff will not notice the absence of at least one of them - you will be presented with an invoice for eviction from the room.  Each room has a kettle and dishes, so in the morning and evening you can drink a cup of tea or coffee with fragrant pastries from a local cafe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is no mirror in the room, which will surely upset all the fair sex.  Dai Duong Hotel 2 * (Vietnam) equipped each room with a private bathroom with hot water.  Outages with hot water sometimes occur, but they are short-lived.  The bathroom is just as small, it has absolutely no shelves for cosmetic accessories, but in order to perform the necessary hygiene procedures - it‚Äôs enough. </p>

    <p>  In no case do not leave crumbs, food leftovers in the room - you will bring on an attack of local ants, getting rid of which will be very problematic.  Exoticism, unfortunately, is evident everywhere.  That is why, if you do not want to become a victim of local insects, do not attract their attention.  Of course, the administration of the Dai Duong Ocean Hotel 2 * (Nha Trang) hotel will try to save you from their presence, but the impressions of your vacation will be definitely ruined.  Soundproofing is not the strongest side of the hotel, tourists should be prepared for the fact that they have to put up with the sounds coming from the next room. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  On the eighth floor of the building there is a spacious outdoor terrace, breakfast is arranged here.  Hotel Dai Duong Ocean Hotel 2 * <span>(Vietnam, Nha Trang)</span> offers travelers a good Asian breakfast.  Of course, they are not impressive in variety, but they allow you to eat in the morning.  They are fed with dishes from the menu, which must be ordered the day before.  Usually breakfasts are represented by vermicelli, rice, vegetables, fresh tropical fruits, toasts with jam, eggs, coffee, tea and juices to choose from. </p>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  Speaking about the shortcomings of the Dai Duong Hotel 2 *, it should be said about the dirt in the rooms, which many tourists refer to.  Indeed, in the best case, rooms are cleaned every three days, furniture and plumbing and no one wipes at all.  For 10-12 days in a room, even in which tourists just spend the night, so much dirt accumulates that just being there is not comfortable.  Get ready for the fact that you will have to deal with dirt on your own, which you certainly do not want to do on vacation.  Bed linens are changed once for all stay in the room, towels - daily, but they are all far from new, washed, with huge stubborn stains.  That is why for hygienic reasons it is better to use your own towels. </p><p>  Tourists will not find here also free drinking water - for all drinks left by the administration in the minibar and refrigerator, you will have to pay.  I would like to pay special attention to the staff of the Dai Duong Hotel 2 * hotel (Nha Trang) - only a few of them understand English, so sometimes it can be difficult to explain. </p>

    <p>  Laundry services can be ordered at the reception for an extra fee: your items will be cleaned and ironed. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  All vacationers will be able to use the wireless Internet on the territory of the hotel for free.  The signal quality is excellent, it is quite enough to exchange news with relatives and friends, as well as plan your acquaintance with the resort, watch movies before going to bed. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  To the sea from the hotel at your fingertips, just 150 meters from Dai Duong Hotel 2 *, and you are on the beach.  The sea here is quite clean with a gentle entry into the water.  For a small fee, you can rent a sunbed and umbrella, which will make your beach holiday more comfortable.  Be sure to stock up on sunscreens with a high protection factor before the trip - only they will help you escape from the rather active best scorching sun.  Many tourists spend all their time on the beach, admiring the beauties of the opening landscapes.  The sea here is beautiful, often pleases surfers with gorgeous waves.  By the way, if you want to get on the board, to master water sports.  Vietnam is a great opportunity.  On the beach you can rent all the necessary equipment and equipment, here you can also use the professional services of specialists who will certainly introduce you to the intricacies. </p>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  After a full review of the Dai Duong Hotel 2 *, you can understand why he was awarded only 2 stars.  This place is definitely not suitable for those tourists who are accustomed to spacious, clean bright rooms with a balcony or a veranda, as well as impeccable service and quality room service.  If you are looking for a place where you can make all the necessary hygienic procedures and spend the night - it's quite good.  Of the advantages of the hotel, one can note only a small cost of living in it and proximity to the coast.  If you are ready to tolerate all its shortcomings, then you can consider this option for yourself. </p>
