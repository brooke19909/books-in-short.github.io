    <p>  <span>How to weave baubles</span> from ribbons? </p><ol><li>  Narrow satin ribbons are best suited for weaving.  For one bracelet, you need to choose the ribbons of two colors that are in harmony with each other, however, you can take any colors that the craftswoman will like.  Ribbons should be about one meter long and always the same in width.  For example, we call, for convenience, purple and pink ribbons and proceed to describe the weaving of baubles from satin ribbons. </li><li>  The ends of both ribbons are folded together and a knot is tied with a loop.  After that, on each of the ribbons make 2 loops with a length of about 10 to 15 cm (for future fasteners) and put them one on top of the other.  Pass the loop on the purple ribbon into the loop on the pink ribbon and tighten the pink loop. </li><li>  In order not to lose the end of the loop, at first you can fix it with an English safety pin to the base.  Although without a pin, everything works fine. </li><li>  Again, make a loop on a pink ribbon, stretch it into a purple loop and tighten the purple ribbon.  It turns out a pink loop, to which you again need to attach a purple loop. </li><li>  Thread the purple loop into the pink loop and tighten the pink loop.  Make a pink loop, and then stretch it into a purple loop and tighten it. </li><li>  Thus, weaving continues, changing and tightening the loops alternately until a bracelet of the required length is obtained. </li><li>  You should stretch the loops evenly and not tighten them too tight so that the ribbons are interlaced evenly and equally, and you will understand how to weave baubles from ribbons to get a neat pattern.  As a result, painstaking work will be crowned - you get an original bauble with square weaving, at the end of which a regular knot is tied. </li></ol>
