The company was founded by four former Acer engineers in 1989.  The path of the creators was not easy because at that time Taiwanese companies had no access to the international market. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus tablets" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/236142.jpg" width="589"></div>  At first, Asus manufactured chipsets, but due to financial difficulties, it also started developing motherboards.  Having created its first motherboard, the company handed it over for testing to the Intel test lab.  This company, in turn, approved the item received and signed a long-term contract with the new manufacturer.  Asus is now on the list of the most successful IT companies, along with Lenovo, HP, Dell, and Acer.  It produces products of medium and high price categories.  To create low-cost products, a <span>subsidiary company</span> ASRock was created, which satisfies the demand of a low price category.  Prices for goods are justified, because the Asus company ranks first in quality among all Taiwanese manufacturers. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus tablets prices" class="if" height="204" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/236137.jpg" width="594"></div>  Asus tablets: prices and specifications

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Asus tablet is not too different in price category from other products of this company.  This is not to say that it is cheap, far from it.  But it is also impossible to say that the price of the Asus tablet is too high, because the build quality and ease of use are worth the money spent.  The device requires careful handling, because the screen is large and the case is thin.  Therefore, several unsuccessful falls from a height of two to three meters can become fatal for a tablet.  But most of these devices can not stand a light blow.  This is definitely impossible to blame the Asus tablet.  It is not suitable for small children.  If you want to buy a device for games for your baby, then you should not choose this tablet.  It is better to choose something from a cheaper price category.  The Asus tablet is ideal for business people - it is multifunctional, convenient, and it works for a long time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet asus tf300tg" class="if" height="227" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15319/233441.jpg" width="336"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Tablet "Asus TF300TG"</strong> </p><p>  This model resembles one of the company's previous products.  Only the back surface of "Asus TF300TG" is made of plastic, and not of metal.  But despite this, the build quality does not cause complaints, as with most products of this company.  The main part of the front panel of the tablet is a screen of 10, 12 inches with an extension of 1280 x 800. The cost of the device has become less thanks to the screen - the brightness has decreased and the backlight has worsened.  It should be noted that the quality of the protective glass on the tablet screen decreases, so you need to buy a good film for protection.  Despite these disadvantages, the viewing angles remained the same - they are impeccable.  At the top of the front panel is a <span>front camera with a</span> resolution of 1.2 megapixels.  The main camera can be seen from the other side.  Its resolution is 8 megapixels.  No flash.  There is Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.  One of the main accessories of this model is a keyboard dock.  The tablet is inserted into a special connector on the side of the keyboard and functions as a regular laptop.  New games will work without problems on Asus TF300TG, which adds to its attractiveness for gamers.  Returning to the topic of build quality, it is worth recalling that the way you handle the tablet will greatly affect its lifespan and the performance of many functions. </p>
