    <p>  The town is located in beautiful places with eucalyptus, pine and cedar trees.  In the local forests rare birds are found.  Currently, Belek is considered the most presentable, and therefore expensive resort in Turkey.  There are not so many youth in these places.  The resort is interesting, first of all, for its wide long beach stretching for twenty kilometers.  Here the swimming season lasts from May to the end of October.  Surprisingly, the weather in Belek in October allows tourists to bask on the beach and splash around in the water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Almost all resort hotels have a category of 4 or 5 stars.

    <p>  The hotel has a steam room, sauna, aerobics, you can play tennis, play slot machines, volleyball, basketball, bocce, attend massage sessions, Turkish hammam, gym, windsurfing, archery and air rifle.  During the day, animators invite guests to do water aerobics in the pool and active games on the beach. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  The hotel has its own sand and pebble beach.  The coast itself is sandy (bulk), but pebbles are felt in the water underfoot.  It offers free sun loungers with mattresses and umbrellas.  Free towels are provided on the beach. <strong> </strong></p><h2>  Weather in Belek </h2><p>  Many tourists are interested in what is the weather like in Belek in October?  This is a very relevant and popular topic.  So October is quite an acceptable month for a vacation.  Especially in the first half in Belek it is very warm, the sea did not have time to cool down at all, therefore it is comfortable to swim in it.  But the prices for rest in this period are almost the lowest in the year.  For this reason, tourists are interested in October weather conditions.  The only negative is the fact that at this time the probability of storms and rains increases. </p><p>  In Belek, the velvet season ends in October, but in November there are sometimes very warm days.  In the first half of October, there is always good weather, and sometimes even summer heat.  But autumn is autumn.  And during this period it can always cool for a couple of days, rain or a storm.  In the resort, the average air temperature in the daytime is +26 degrees, and at night - +15.  And the water temperature can vary between +24 - +27 degrees.  If you plan to spend your vacation in October, it is better to choose the first half of the month.  At this time, there are practically no whims of nature. </p><p>  Belek has long won the title of the best resort in Turkey due to its huge sandy beaches, beautiful natural parks, eucalyptus, juniper, coniferous forests and luxurious hotels equipped with sports and entertainment infrastructure.  This resort is chosen for sports training and recreation, even professional teams.  Here are some of the best golf clubs in the world.  And in October, the golf season begins.  Since all competitions are held in open fields, during the summer heat this is simply not possible.  For this reason, a more comfortable time was chosen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sherwood dreams resort hotel 5 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1468793.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In October, the animation in the hotels is still working, but the staff is partially starting to go home.  Such nuances must be learned from tour operators.  If the weather on some day is not very favorable, then it is better to devote this time to sightseeing. </p><p>  The cost of a vacation in Belek in mid-autumn will certainly please those tourists who cannot spend a lot of money on vacation, or are simply limited to a certain amount.  In May and October you can buy the cheapest tours, and the weather at the same time most of the time is quite good.  Of course, there is a chance of rain, but the sea is warm.  But in the second half of October, the weather is more moody, and can bring unpleasant surprises. </p><h2>  Sherwood Dreams Resort Hotel 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  According to the reviews of tourists who managed to visit the hotel and evaluate all its advantages and disadvantages, I want to draw some conclusions and summarize the conversation about this complex.  The hotel is located in a quiet place in a small village.  On the one hand, the hotel is new, but at the same time, on all sides it is surrounded by complexes under construction.  Therefore, many apartments have a view of the construction site.  There are very few rooms with sea views, and even those have not a direct, but a side view of the coast.  This point needs to be considered if it is very important for you.  The territory itself is very beautiful and well-groomed, lots of greenery and flowers. </p><p>  You can book a transfer in the complex, or you can get there by yourself, however, locals can‚Äôt tell you the location of the hotel, possibly due to the fact that it is new and located at some distance. </p><p>  I would like to pay special attention to nutrition.  Of course, there will always be people to whom it seems not diverse.  But in fact, the hotel serves many dishes, there are plenty to choose from.  Hotel guests can enjoy meat delicacies and all kinds of snacks and salads.  The restaurant never has a line.  And the dishes are updated very quickly if something ends at the buffet.  Delicious Turkish sweets deserve special praise.  There are always a lot of fruit tables, if some of them are not very tasty, then this is not the hotel's fault.  In Turkey, many fruits are completely tasteless.  The ice cream in the bar is amazing, but you should always stand up for it, but it's worth it.  During the day, guests can eat in one of the bars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sherwood dreams resort hotel 5 entertainment" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1468797.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel is aimed at families with children, this is clearly visible both in the territory and in relation to the staff.  Young people who want to attend nightclubs have nothing to do here.  But for entertainment, children have the most necessary.  Animators do an excellent job with the task assigned to them by the administration of Sherwood Dreams Resort Hotel 5 *.  A children's playground, swimming pools, a mini-club make the rest of young tourists fun and unforgettable. </p><p>  No less interesting is the leisure of the adult part of vacationers.  Evening music shows, dance performances in the amphitheater and restaurant entertain tourists.  And in the daytime, animators in very original ways lure vacationers to take an active part in sporting events.  For the most persistent guests of the complex, discos are held.  True, as a rule, tourists with children simply do not reach it. </p><p>  As for the rooms, they are in very good condition.  The complex has been operating not so long ago, so the apartments have not yet had time to become worthless.  Perhaps some defects can be found, but in general, everything is working, the plumbing works well.  Towels and garbage are changed daily.  The rooms are washed every day, sometimes there are problems with the replacement of bed linen, you need to be reminded. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sherwood dreams resort hotel 5 description" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1468798.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to tourists, the hotel has a wonderful beach.  It is great for children; on the shallows, kids can splash around.  The fact that in the water at the bottom is small pebbles does not interfere at all.  The coast is quite clean, there are no problems with places, there are quite a lot of sunbeds. </p><p>  Guests of the complex note that the hotel has a lot of tourists from Europe.  Most are Germans.  There are not so many Russian-speaking people.  The staff speaks Russian, and therefore can be explained. </p><p>  For active tourists organize excursion trips to Belek.  But you can also get there yourself by calling a taxi.  It is much more comfortable and convenient than getting on the bus.  Vacationers are advised to visit not only Belek himself, but also the famous <span>canyon Kepryulu.</span>  But with children it is definitely worth a ride on a pirate ship.  This is a very exciting walk that everyone likes. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Sherwood Dreams Resort Hotel 5 * is a good place for families with children of any age.  The hotel can be recommended to those tourists who are looking for a quiet and relaxing holiday away from the hustle and bustle of big cities. </p>
