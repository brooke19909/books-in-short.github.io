    <p>  Sometimes you should not be too scared of negative exclamations about this place.  Everything needs to be evaluated adequately.  The hotel deserves its 2 stars.  Guests are greeted by a comfortable clean room.  Such apartments can be found only in three-star hotels.  The only drawback is the lack of a TV.  But on vacation, few people use it.  It is best to choose rooms that do not have a pool view.  Until the morning, loud music plays there.  From the balcony of some rooms you can even pick lemons and make them delicious lemonade.  There is also the opportunity to enjoy bananas growing in the territory.  The only drawback is the lack of a bathroom.  Some rooms had a hole in the floor instead. </p><h2>  About nutrition </h2><p>  Most tourists do not purchase food at the hotel.  Nearby is a supermarket where you can buy whatever your heart desires.  Prices are not very high.  There are also fast food outlets on site.  Every Tuesday, parties are held in the pool where you can buy a food ticket and a good discount on alcohol for a ridiculous price. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The staff of the Pambos Napa Rocks 2 * hotel (Ayia Napa, Cyprus) works according to the mood.  But this does not affect the quality of rest.  Sometimes the front desk is empty.  And sometimes your request is fulfilled without much enthusiasm.  Nevertheless, they try to do all the work efficiently.  The rooms are cleaned daily, even dishes in the sink can be washed.  The staff changes frequently, each shift has its own result. </p><h2>  Territory </h2>

    <p>  Hotel Pambos Napa Rocks Apartments 2 * has a small indoor club, which hosts various events.  The guests of the complex can visit the club for free, for the rest the entrance costs 20 euros. </p><h2>  Hotel contingent </h2><p>  This place was chosen by Europeans.  At Pambos Napa Rocks Hotel 2 * (Ayia Napa), there are always a lot of English, but you rarely see a Russian tourist here.  Perhaps our people prefer to relax in more respectable hotels, but for a budget tourist this place is just perfect.  It has everything you need for a good rest. </p><p>  This hotel is sometimes called a youth hostel.  And this is by no means accidental.  Firstly, only a particularly unpretentious person can afford a vacation here.  Secondly, a noisy company in a hotel to rest is much more interesting. </p><p>  The island is simply teeming with all kinds of nightclubs, trendy cafes, attractions for children, water fun and other leisure activities.  The vast majority of vacationers are the young generation, who loves to spend time with drive and enjoyment.  Nevertheless, this does not diminish the popularity of Cyprus among families with small children who love a calm, measured, to some extent even meditative rest. </p><p>  In Cyprus, they also like to relax due to the fact that this island is often dotted with a variety of beaches, considered the cleanest in this area. </p>
