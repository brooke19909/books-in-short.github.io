Most likely, such pleasure can be obtained on a vacation in China in December on Hainan Island. </p><h2>  Where to go in December </h2><p>  China is interesting for travelers at any time of the year.  After all, a country with a vast territory lies in three climatic zones.  In December, winter begins in China according to the calendar, but not in all provinces.  In northern and western weather conditions are severe.  Air temperature - from -10 to -18 ° .  In the southern provinces, it is still summer with an air temperature of +23 ° . </p>

    <p>  Therefore, if the choice of vacation fell on December, it is worth noting that this month of the year travelers can perfectly relax both on the beaches of Hainan in southern China, under the shade of coconut palms, and in the northern ski resorts that are relatively inexpensive.  Tourists who gather in the Middle Kingdom in December should make a choice for themselves: to go to the winter fairy tale of the north or enjoy the beaches of the south.  In any case, no matter what vacation you choose, it will be remembered for a lifetime, as this will be one of the brightest events of the New Year's Eve. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  It is impossible to know in advance what the weather is like in China this December on Hainan Island, which is located in southern China.  But if you look at the statistics of meteorological observations, then it is clear that the average daily temperature ranges from 21 to 23 ° C, cooler at night, about 16 ° C.  If you want to walk around the night island, you can not do without a windbreaker.  Those who want to come to the island to sunbathe or swim in the sea, it is better to choose another month to relax.  If the tropical heat is not to your liking, then a Chinese island with a comfortable temperature of air and water, of course, is suitable for relaxation. </p>

    <p>  The best pearls in China are mined in the waters of the South China Sea, and tourists can get acquainted with the technology of growing it and see the process of extraction on the pearl plantation at the Jingjun Pearl Museum.  You can go on an interesting excursion to the crater of the extinct volcano Ma An. </p><p>  The sights of China include its cuisine with exotic dishes.  Therefore, to visit the Celestial Empire and not to taste these dishes in local restaurants is equivalent to the fact that you have not been to China.  What is interesting about Chinese cuisine?  Its skillful combination of not only five tastes (salty, sweet, bitter, sour, spicy), but also three more, which are inherent only in Chinese dishes.  It has fresh, fragrant and golden flavors. </p><h2>  Ski resorts </h2><p>  Without a doubt, the most popular ski resorts in China in December.  After all, many people still associate the New Year holidays with snowy landscapes and winter sports.  There are several beautiful ski resorts in northern China.  The most visited of them, the largest is the resort of Yabuli.  In 1996, III Asian Games were held on its slopes, so its equipment is beyond doubt.  15 tracks of varying difficulty are prepared for beginners and eminent skiers.  In December, in China, this resort is crowded.  The temperature is kept at about -10 ° C.  Better for skiing and you can imagine! </p>

On children's tracks an additional degree of safety. </p><h2>  What to see in Beijing </h2><p>  If you come to a ski resort, you will not only find time to go to a market in Beijing and go to a restaurant for tasting Chinese dishes, but be sure to visit the Gugun palace complex and go to the Temple of Heaven.  And for every tourist it will be interesting to visit an area equal to 61 football fields (500 m wide and 800 m long) - Tananmen.  This is the heart of Beijing, the main square of China and the largest urban square in the world.

    <p>  Before Catholic Christmas, an ice festival kicks off in Harbin, which hosts a competition of ice figures, fairs and theater performances. </p><h2>  Booking tickets and hotel rooms </h2><p>  In December, China usually does not have such an influx of tourists, as happens during peak vacations in other seasons of the year.  In winter, those who like tropical coolness go to China to relax.  Many enjoyed celebrating the New Year on Hainan Island.  There is no excitement for tickets and hotel rooms this season, but early booking will not hurt.  Usually the price level for hotel accommodation jumps closer to the New Year.  If there are last-minute tours to tours, then their number is limited.  A regular budget tour costs 62 thousand rubles at the beginning of winter.  It includes the cost of a round-trip flight for two and accommodation for a week at the hotel. </p>
