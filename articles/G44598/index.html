Faults and their elimination bring a lot of discomfort to the owners, but nevertheless, basically all the problems come from improper operation.  Consumers do not take into account the hardness of the water, make improper installation and connection. </p><p>  According to the reviews of repair organizations, the main malfunctions of Ariston washing machines are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Water pump.  It is worth noting that this weak spot is characteristic not only for this brand, but also for other manufacturers. </li><li>  Weak mechanical fastening of doors, drum, top cover. </li><li>  Hose integrity.  Most often it suffers at the junction with the drum.  Directly depends on the hardness of the water. </li><li>  Control module errors. </li></ul><p>  These disadvantages are the Ariston washing machine.  Faults and their elimination do not cause difficulties for the masters, since all spare parts are in constant access.  Let us consider in more detail each type of breakdown and how to fix it. </p><h2>  water pump </h2><p>  The Ariston washing machine helps to track down and resolve malfunctions using the instructions in which there is a table with error decoding.  Damage to the drainage system is indicated by the letter ‚ÄúF‚Äù and the numbers 05 (problems with the drainage pump) and 11 (no data is received from the drainage pump). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself washing machine ariston malfunction" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1408862.jpg" width="600"></div>  In such cases, check the connection of the controller with the pump, the pump itself (voltage in it), the operability of the sensor, and the absence of clogging in the drain system.  If a cause is found, it should be corrected; if not, they will replace the pump.

Faults and their elimination of such a plan will not take much time and will not cost a penny.  But if you miss the situation, you may need major repairs, which will cost a round sum. </p><h2>  Hose integrity </h2><p>  The appearance of water on the floor indicates such a breakdown of the Ariston washing machine.  Faults and their elimination of this type bring a lot of trouble.  Repair begins with a search for a leak.  For this, not only hoses are inspected, but also the places of their fastening. </p>

    <p>  There are situations when the pipe is clogged and flies from the place of water supply.  In such cases, <span>blockage</span> should be <span>removed</span> and the hose should <span>be</span> secured back.  If the integrity of the rubber tubes is violated, then they are replaced with new ones.  Such malfunctions can lead to a complete malfunction of the machine.  Water falling on the electronic unit, electric motor, sensors, relays, incapacitates them. </p><h2>  Control Module Errors </h2><p>  How does the Ariston washing machine behave in such situations?  Possible malfunctions blinking of lamps will indicate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine ariston possible malfunctions flashing light bulbs" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1408867.jpg" width="450"></div>  In this case, the following errors pop up: F06 (failure of the buttons), F09 (failure of the volatile memory), F12 (broken circuit between the display and the controller, F18 (incorrect operation of the microprocessor). The solutions will be as follows:

    <ul><li>  F06 - check the serviceability of the buttons, their contact.  Very often, with such breakdowns, the control unit is completely changed. </li><li>  F09 - replace the controller or make firmware microchips, which is responsible for the memory. </li><li>  F12 - check the connection, if necessary, replace parts. </li><li>  F18 - to eliminate the code, change the controller. </li></ul><p>  The Ariston washing machine does not differ in special structural difficulties.  Do-it-yourself repairs can be easily repaired.  What other breakdowns can occur? </p><h2>  Tubular electric heater (TEN) </h2><p>  The following errors are typical for breakdowns of such a plan: </p><ul><li>  F03 - malfunction of the sensor that monitors the operating temperature of the heating element.  The contacts between the controller and the sensor are checked, the sensor itself for serviceability.  Replaced if necessary. </li><li>  F07 - TEN is not immersed in water when the equipment is running.  The contact between the sensor responsible for the water level and the controller is checked, the serviceability of both.  If necessary, the defective element is replaced. </li></ul><p>  With such errors, the health of the heater itself is checked using a multimeter. </p><h2>  Another series of malfunctions </h2><p>  Part of the damage may occur due to any initial. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="causes of malfunction of the washing machine ariston" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1408864.jpg" width="422"></div>  For example, if water leaks from the drainage system or its intake, electrical and electronic contacts can be flooded, which can damage any system.

    <p>  The occurrence of vibration during the destruction of bearings can displace the axis of the drum, which will also lead to overhaul.  An unstable supply of electricity is the reason for the failure of the electronic <span>control unit.</span> </p><h2>  Troubleshooting </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to correctly install the equipment.  It must be sure to level.  With proper installation, the Ariston washing machine (the malfunctions and the elimination of which we examined) will rarely disappoint with breakdowns.  In this case, the service life will increase.  How will the Ariston washing machine (vertical loading) behave when mounting and connecting out of level?  Faults that arise are the displacement and deformation of the axis.  Such repairs do not fall under warranty, and the owner will have to incur significant costs for it.  The installation of filter systems for water supply and the use of special tools will help prevent many malfunctions, including the formation of scale and its harmful effects on the heater and other systems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ariston washing machine vertical loading fault" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1408865.jpg" width="600"></div>  For washing machines, a separate cable is provided, which should be designed for the power consumption of the equipment, and in the shield - a separate machine.  Mandatory grounding device.  Do not load laundry weighing more than the recommended instructions.  This may result in failure of the drum fixing systems.  The consequence is a major overhaul. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="main malfunctions of washing machines ariston" class="if" height="273" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1408866.jpg" width="600"></div>  Whatever the malfunction of the Ariston washing machine, do-it-yourself repairs should begin by studying the instructions, which contain a diagram of the device and a table of operation errors.  Another important point, if the equipment is under warranty, it is better to contact a service center.  If you are sure that the breakdown occurred as a result of improper operation, then you can do it yourself.  This will significantly reduce time and financial costs.  And the constant availability of spare parts will help you quickly find the right part for any model.
