Due to the fact that the tourist business line in Thailand is constantly developing and improving, guests of the country always remain satisfied with the service in hotels and prices. </p><h2>  Phuket Hotels </h2><p>  Each hotel in the outskirts of Thailand boasts an unsurpassed service that can be compared with the service in the most famous foreign hotels.  Even if the choice falls on accommodation in a small private hotel, you can be sure that the quality of services will be ‚Äúon top‚Äù.  What can we say about the so-called "star" apartments.  For example, hotels in Phuket 3 stars (1 line) are distinguished by unsurpassed service, chic location and reasonable prices. </p><p>  In Phuket, even the smallest hotel is equipped with high-speed Internet, which will help to contact relatives and friends as soon as possible and share all the impressions gained during the holiday.  Among other things, the inhabitants of the island show extraordinary hospitality, which is always pleasing.  As soon as tourists stop by in Phuket, locals immediately recommend getting ready for many pleasant surprises. </p><p>  But in order to remember the rest only with pleasant impressions, it is worth worrying about housing on the island in advance.  The best budget hotels in Phuket 3 stars (1 line) will be described in this article. </p><h2>  Hotel Tri Trang Beach Resort </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel is located 16 kilometers from the central part of the island and approximately 34 kilometers from the airport.  Tri Trang Beach Resort 3 was opened in 2005, and reconstruction was carried out in 2011. The total area owned by the hotel exceeds 11 square kilometers.  The location of the hotel is very, very favorable, as it stands on a mountain, and below is the promenade, on which every vacationer can find entertainment to taste. </p><p>  Tri Trang Beach Resort 3 welcomes both foreigners and tourists from Russia.  The complex has several tall buildings at its disposal, the most cumbersome of which is building No. 5.  Its terrace offers magnificent views of the raging sea.  Also, the road to Patong is very clearly visible from this building. </p><p>  The hotel has its own private beach with pure white sand.  The beach area is equipped with several changing rooms, a rescue service, rental of leisure equipment and kiosks with many exotic goodies.  Also, this hotel has its own pool with clean, warm water and a hydromassage function. <br>  Each hotel room has a wide bed, a refrigerator, a TV, internet, a bathroom with all amenities.  Also, in each room for vacationers there is a terrace or balcony and a climate control system. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  According to vacationers' reviews, the second building is considered the best hotel building, and the fourth building is considered the worst.  Especially good guests speak about the services of local masseurs.  Although the cost of massage at the hotel is much higher than the price of that offered on the beach, nevertheless, the hotel makes it much better.  Massage at the hotel costs 450 baht, and 300 at the beach. Directly on the seashore is a restaurant that is famous for its fresh seafood dishes.  Vacationers note the advantageous location of the hotel.  Another very attractive advantage is its own beach recreation area.  The place is very quiet and clean, you can surf the Internet for free.  In terms of food, Phuket hotels practice a buffet system and free breakfast and lunch.  This suits many vacationers, however, there are those who do not like this food and those who would like to have shops and catering facilities near the hotel.  Also, there is not enough cheaper transport.  A free shuttle to Patong is often crowded, and there are simply no additional transportation options. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Among the minuses of the hotel, vacationers also highlight the fact that the elevators that deliver people to the beach work very poorly, and there are a lot of flights of stairs in the hotel. <br>  Very close attention should be paid to the height of the waves, which reaches its maximum in the summer.  Speaking about Tri-Trang beach, it should be noted that the height of the waves is minimal here, therefore, rest with children in this place is completely safe.  It is characteristic that when the waves are completely absent on the other beaches, they are present on the Tri-Trang, albeit insignificant.  3 star hotels in Phuket (1 line) are represented by another decent hotel. </p><h2>  Hotel Rattana Beach Hotel </h2>

A hotel employee takes water daily for analysis. </p><p>  The food here is excellent, but you need to get used to Thai cuisine.  Tourists are advised to choose those establishments in which locals eat.  Since they cook the same everywhere, and in restaurants for foreigners, prices are higher. </p><p>  You can also come across many positive reviews about Thavorn Beach Bungalow 3, located in western Phuket. </p>
