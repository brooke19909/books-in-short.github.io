Holidays at sea in Schastlivtsevo: private sector</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  No conflict can change the plans of ordinary people for a legitimate summer vacation.  The Arabat Spit (Schastlivtsevo, <span>Genicheskaya Gorka</span> and Strelkovoye), despite the geographical proximity to the hot spots, delight visitors with the tranquility and total apoliticality of local residents.  Prices in 2014 increased except for gasoline.  Otherwise, everything remained at the same level.  This is due to the fact that the number of vacationers has decreased - the proximity to the Crimea and the turbulent Donbass affects.  But those brave souls who nevertheless decided to come to the Arabat Spit only benefit from this.  For example, in Schastlivtsevo, the private sector remained in the same price range as several years ago.  It makes sense to pay close attention to this resort of the Sea of ​​Azov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Schastlivtsevo rest" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/461600.jpg" width="290"></div>

    <h2>  What is the Arabat Spit and Schastlivtsevo? </h2><p>  Between the Crimea and the Sea of ​​Azov, a long and narrow sand spit stretches for 110 kilometers.  It is called the Arabat arrow.  The nearest town is Genichesk.  This is the district center of <span>Kherson region.</span>  Resorts come there too, but the rest in the town is still very different from hanging out on the spit, where on the one hand there is a gentle sea, and on the other, the healing brine of Sivash.  One hundred kilometers of sandy beach remained undeveloped until the end of the XIX century.  On the advice of the famous breeder L.P. Simirenko, several families of farmers from the south of Ukraine settled here.  And the peasants did not fail.  Under hard-working hands, the land of the scythe revealed its potential.  The estates of the settlers turned into fertile gardens.  This is probably why they called one of the three villages on the Spit Schastlivtsev.  The climate here is especially mild, and the sea is a little deeper than in Genichesk, but still the coast is not as steep as on the South Coast.  All this, plus low prices, implies a cloudless family vacation.  This village is the golden mean between the bustling Genic Hill and Strelkov, remote from any civilization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest Arabatsky arrow Schastlivtsevo" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/462815.jpg" width="565"></div>

The peak of the influx of tourists falls on the second half of July and throughout August.  In principle, in May and June on the Arabat Spit, a good rest.  Schastlivtsevo boasts that there is a cloudless sky over it 300 days a year.  However, in May, cold winds still blow here, and the sea is worried.  In June, with unbearable heat, a cold current may come.  But this does not always happen.  For example, in the warm spring of 2014, the shallow Sea of ​​Azov in May was completely suitable for swimming.  And in August, the water temperature stably keeps at around 23-25 ​​C, and sometimes reaches 28-30 degrees.  Precipitation in summer is extremely low, which pleases those who prefer a tent holiday.  Schastlivtsevo, whose private sector provides a wide selection of housing, is more expensive than the neighboring Strelkovoye and Genichesk.  But still immeasurably cheaper than the similar Azov resorts located on the Crimean peninsula (Schelkino, Mysovoe, Novootradnoe). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Schastlivtsev vacation prices" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/462827.jpg" width="543"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The nearest railway station is Novoalekseevka.  Regular buses run from Kherson bus station to Genichesk.  And already from the district center to any village of the Arabat arrows can be reached by taxi.  From Berdyansk you can also get to Schastlivtsevo.  The private sector in the village is very large.  Supply in 2014 exceeds demand.  Homeowners themselves come to minibuses, so there should be no problems finding a roof over your head.  In past years, about 90% of houses, apartments and apartments were booked in advance.  But now the situation has changed.  While difficulties may arise with housing in the Iron Port, Azure and Zatok, this will not happen on the Arabat spit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Schastlivtsevo: rest, prices </h2><p>  The Sea of ​​Azov has always been considered a vacation spot with young children in Ukraine.  The soft sand of golden beaches, a gently sloping, shallow bottom, well-heated water, perfect ecology and the absence of jellyfish distinguish the Arbat arrow from other places like Berdyansk or Mariupol.  But prices in Schastlivtsevo are still higher than in neighboring Strelkovoy.  Probably the effect is that in this village there are more benefits of civilization: a post office, an outpatient clinic, three markets, a cinema, and ATMs.  Merchants scramble along the beach with all sorts of food, there are many coastal cafes and shops.  Every year, in the season, Luna Park with attractions for children and adults comes to Schastlivtsevo.  On the central beach of the village there is even a rental point for catamarans, boats, <span>water scooters.</span>  But the market will please you with rather low prices for fruits and vegetables.  But <span>gourds</span> (watermelons and melons) are brought from the mainland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Schastlivtsev private sector" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/462802.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Accommodation: pensions and recreation centers </h2><p>  We hasten to please those who prefer an “organized” vacation: Soviet boarding houses did not stay in a state of stagnation for long.  Now most of them have undergone large-scale reconstruction and they are again ready to receive guests.  However, most of these places are still oriented towards poor clients.  Therefore, the level of services is appropriate.  Be prepared for the fact that the bathroom is located on the floor, and <span>hot water</span> is supplied on schedule.  But at the same time, deluxe rooms with all amenities and air conditioning appear.  An example of such an update is the recreation center "Schastlivtsevo", located on Morskaya street, 24. The buildings are surrounded by a spacious and shady park area.  You can order organized meals.  Pension Express offers rooms both in the building and in small cottages.  On its territory there is a sauna, massage room, parking, billiards, a night club and its own beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest is happy private sector" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/462833.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Housing in Schastlivtsevo: private sector </h2><p>  Residents of the village quickly reoriented to the reception of vacationers.  Here you can find housing for every taste, or rather - for any wallet.  After all, students and state employees also need to relax at sea!  Therefore, even in the difficult year of 2014 for Ukraine, prices for a bed in Schastlivtsevo start from 30 hryvnia per day.  The village consists of neat little white neat houses-huts, buried in orchards twined with grapes.  The good-natured “aunts Masha” will always provide you with a common kitchen with a set of dishes, a place for parking a car.  But for 30 hryvnias per day, of course, you can only rely on an outdoor shower and toilet in the yard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holiday Village Schastlivtsevo" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/462837.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Inns </h2><p>  For those who prefer a more comfortable stay, Schastlivtsevo offers a more or less developed hotel base.  Mini-hotels, erected by enterprising residents on the site of private huts, grow like mushrooms after rain.  They are cheaper than boarding houses, and in terms of services, they are higher than state holiday homes.  Of course, the rooms in them are of different price categories.  For some apartments they may ask for 500-600 hryvnia per day.  But the room will have everything for a comfortable stay: a plasma TV, refrigerator, air conditioning, hot water around the clock.  The only drawback of such mini-hotels is that they, unlike pensions, are located away from the sea.  Access to the beach - through the recreation center "Seagull-2" or "Azov". </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The sea and the sun are not the only things that go to the Arabat arrow.  Wellness holidays are also practiced here.  Schastlivtsevo from the eastern side is washed by the waters of Sivash.  This shallow bay is famous for its salts, which are similar in composition to the brine of the Dead Sea.  Many sufferers of arthritis and joint diseases annually come to the Arabat Spit to be treated with the healing mud of Sivash.  Three kilometers from Schastlivtsev, a hot geyser beats from under the ground.  Its water is rich in iodine and bromine and is useful for those who have heart and respiratory problems.  You can make independent or organized excursions to the <span>Biryuchy island,</span> on which the lighthouse towers, as well as to the ruins <span>of the Arabat fortress,</span> which was erected by the Turks. </p>
