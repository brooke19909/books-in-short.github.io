It is about how to sew this model, and we will discuss further. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dress dress with a skirt sun" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1276012.jpg" width="534"></div>

    <h2>  Where to start tailoring? </h2><p>  Experienced craftswomen will agree that the right material is already half the success.  Landing, processing complexity, and, of course, the appearance of the product as a whole depend on the quality and texture of the canvas.  To sew a <span>dress with a skirt, the sun is</span> best made of flying and flowing fabric, which does not puff and lies with beautiful forks.  It can be crepe-chiffon, knitted oil, staple, chintz, cambric.  Today, shops offer a huge selection of paintings, so there are plenty to choose from.  As for the colors, then you should already rely on personal preferences.  The only thing you need to remember is that ladies with curvaceous shapes are more suitable for fine print fabrics without horizontal stripes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  The eternal question: how much fabric do you need to buy to fit a <span>pattern</span> on it <span>?</span>  <span>Dress</span> with a skirt-sun - a product quite expensive in terms of material consumption.  And it is not difficult to count it.  Four skirt lengths + the value of the waist circumference measurement, in order to cut a circle of the desired length, to the bottom of the product and one length from the shoulder and just below the waist for the top. </p><p>  The width of the roll should be considered here.  In most cases, it is 140 cm, which is quite enough for a long and <span>short dress.</span>  And in fact, and in another case, the fabric is typed in the same way.  If the skirt is less than 70 cm in length, then 2 lengths of the bottom + 1/3 of the waist circumference will be enough.  In this case, two semicircles will be placed one below the other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself sun skirt" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/1276021.jpg" width="451"></div>

    <h2>  Hardware selection </h2><p>  When the required amount of material has been calculated and the type of canvas and color selected, it's time to think about the fittings.  First of all, threads in tone of fabric will be required.  If the canvas does not stretch, then you will definitely need to purchase a 60 cm long hidden zipper. If you plan to make the silhouette not fitted, but with an elastic band, then, of course, you need a cut in waist circumference.  For decorative design, you can take a couple of beautiful buttons and, with a cut, draw a drop on the back or chest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Building a template for a skirt </h2><p>  Another important question: how is the pattern built?  A dress with a skirt the sun is sewn of four parts: the front and back of the top and two panels of the skirt.  To build patterns of these elements of the product, it is necessary to measure the circumference of the chest, waist, chest height, back width, back and front height from shoulder to waist and the width of the solution of the tucks of the chest.  It is very easy to build a sun skirt with your own hands.  On one of the edges of the material lay the length of the skirt + machining allowance of about 2 cm, then 1/3 of the waist circumference and again the length + allowance.  Next, on the middle section, you need to determine the cut line for the waist.  To do this, find the middle and, focusing on it, draw a semicircle with a radius of 1/6 of the measurement "waist circumference".  After that, from the line on the canvas lay the length of the skirt + allowances for processing the bottom and all the marks are connected in a semicircle.  The second panel is cut out similarly.  If you need a <span>long dress</span> with a sun skirt, then simply increase the length of the panels of the lower part of the product.  Construction can be done directly on the fabric, without using paper templates. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sew a dress with a skirt sun" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1276004.jpg" width="542"></div>

    <h2>  Building a template for the top </h2><p>  How is the top template designed?  What difficulties does the pattern have?  A dress with a skirt-sun is one of the simplest products.  And its upper part is built as simple as the bottom.  For this part of the dress you will need a paper template, so you will need several A4 sheets.  They are connected so that you can draw a rectangle with sides equal to the length from the shoulder to the waist along the front and chest girth value.  Immediately determine the line of the chest according to the height of the chest.  On one side, half the width of the back is marked on it.  On the opposite side, half of the tuck solution.  Next, determine the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe armhole, which is equal to ¬º half-circumference of the chest + 2 cm. Then, from the upper corners of the drawing, the neck area and shoulder seams are lowered 1.5 cm to the edge.  On the front half of the solution mark, the tucks are raised perpendicular and the tuck is drawn along the shoulder line (a few centimeters retreat, a pin mark is set and lowered to the starting point. In this case, the shoulder seam will need to be extended by the same number of centimeters. Next, you only need to draw the armhole lines for the transfer and If you want to make a dress for a child, then tucks are not needed at all. And it will be the <span>easiest pattern.</span> A dress with a sun skirt can be sewn by building the bottom of the product directly on  and fabric, and the pattern of the top to make a t-shirt of a child. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dress with skirt sun flared" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1276009.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <h2>  Product assembly and processing sequence </h2><p>  When all the cut elements are ready, you can start sewing.  First, all the tucks of the shelves are closed, then the shoulder seams are connected.  To make the product comfortable to wear, it is made with a zipper either on its side or on the back.  In the latter version, the details of the back and back of the skirt will need to be cut strictly in half.  The top and bottom are connected in series: first, the <span>top and the skirt are</span> completely sewn <span>,</span> and then they are joined along the waist line.  Sewing a sun skirt with your own hands is very simple: they connect the side seams, and a zipper is inserted into the back section. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="long dress with a skirt sun" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1276001.jpg" width="502"></div>

    <p>  Quite often, gum is inserted into the seam.  And if you make the top wide enough (this does not spoil the view, if you take into the work a flowing, light canvas), then lightning will not be needed. </p>
