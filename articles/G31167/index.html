Therefore, the problem with comfortable and affordable housing for most citizens is quite acute here.  The Berezovy settlement can partially resolve it.  Irkutsk, in its infrastructure for difficult to explain reasons, has two approximately equal housing units with the same name, located 15 km from each other.  In the first case, it is a microdistrict located in the Leninsky district, in the Novo-Lenino region.  In the second case, it is a village in the Sverdlovsk district, near Markov.  It is also often called a neighborhood, which causes confusion among many people, even taxi drivers.  This article provides information only about the village "Birch".  It began to be built 7 years ago.  During this time, 9 lines consisting of more than 200 houses were commissioned here.  The 10th stage is now being completed, but the developer intends to continue construction.  Today it is the largest ambitious housing project <span>in Irkutsk.</span> </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The village of Berezovy (Irkutsk) is located in the Sverdlovsk district of the city, but geographically it belongs to the Markov urban settlement, to which it is only 1,500 meters.  The closest neighbors of Berezovoy on the part of the town are garden partnerships Domostroitel and Bereznyaki, and on the city side are Akademgorodok, ZhK Khrustalny, ZhK Kalininsky and the cottage village Nikolov Posad. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Berezovy settlement Irkutsk" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1652807.jpg" width="495"></div>  Despite some remoteness from the center of Irkutsk, it is not difficult for residents of the village to get to any object of the city‚Äôs infrastructure, since two roads pass through Berezovy.  On both from the houses of the first stage to the city blocks - a little more than a kilometer.

Akademgorodok, railway station, central market, Energetikov street - these are the objects to which buses and minibuses run from Berezovoy.  The traffic interval is less than 15 minutes, and the more the village is being built up (now its length is 1.5 km), the farther the final stop of public transport is transferred. </p><p>  Motorists "Birch" can also easily get to work and leisure places. </p><p>  The only problem of the village is the roads, which are in poor condition, and the hilly terrain, which significantly complicates the movement of the chosen route for cars of any class and destination. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Berezovy village Irkutsk apartments" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1652800.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <h2>  Ecology and environmental conditions </h2><p>  Clean air and beautiful terrain are the undoubted advantages that the village "Birch" has.  Irkutsk in terms of pollution of natural resources is a quite prosperous city, with the main part of emissions here not from industrial production, but from motor vehicles.  In Berezovoye, since it is not located in the center of the city, there is no heavy traffic at the moment, so the air is clean enough.  There are few green spaces on the territory of the village, but around it there is a large forest park zone where residents organize picnics and hold public festivities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Irkutsk is located near the seismic tectonic fault, so earthquakes are a frequent occurrence here.  In order to protect the Berezovy settlement from their actions, all the houses in it are being built with the installation of seismic belts. </p><p>  Some residents are only concerned about the materials used in construction, namely aerated concrete.  The fact is that only aerated concrete D 700 B5, which is produced by single manufacturers, is seismically safe.  As a result, this material is expensive.  What brand the customer uses to implement an economy class project is unknown. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Berezovy settlement Irkutsk Akademgorodok" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1652787.jpg" width="493"></div>

    <h2>  Who is building </h2><p>  The settlement ‚ÄúBirch‚Äù in Irkutsk is being built by the Nord-West Insurance Company, known in the region, led by Vyacheslav Gusev.  This company appeared as a result of the transformation in 1993 of a state of emergency, also engaged in construction activities.  Nord-West mainly implements housing projects.  In 2010, it was commissioned by Ershovskiy Residential Complex, and the very first phase in the Berezovy settlement was commissioned the following year.  Unfortunately, real estate investors and tenants of Ershovskiy have complaints against Nord-West IC, right up to lawsuits, regarding the poor quality of work.  The developer explains this by the fact that he is building economy class housing.  But this class of real estate does not imply the use of low-quality materials and outdated technologies, but a small footage of apartments, a less developed infrastructure, and a simple design of entrances.  Residents of Berezovoi, who have already received the keys, also have complaints about the quality of work in their apartments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  According to the general plan, the Berezovy residential complex in Irkutsk should become a self-sufficient microdistrict, in which more than 200 houses will be built on 3-5 floors.  The developer plans to equip all yards and adjoining territories, plant shrubs and trees, plant flower beds, build playgrounds for children and recreation areas for adults, as well as several sports grounds, two kindergartens, a school, shops, supermarkets, pharmacies, a clinic, facilities household services, club of veterans.  To date, part of these plans has been implemented.  So, there is a kindergarten in Berezovoye, the construction of the second one is nearing completion, the construction of the school has begun, several shops have already been commissioned, including construction, department stores, several grocery stores.  Gardening of the yards has so far been sparse, there are few children's and sports grounds built. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Berezovy settlement Irkutsk reviews" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1652775.jpg" width="472"></div>

    <p>  For motorists in the "Birch" according to the plan should be equipped with parking areas.  In fact, cars are left right in the courtyards, under the windows of the apartments, in the driveways between the houses. </p><h2>  Housing design </h2><p>  Quite a nice appearance is the village of "Birch".  Irkutsk, as mentioned above, is located in the seismic zone, so the optimal number of floors here is from three to five.  It is these houses that are being built in the Birch.  In the first two phases, they are mainly three-story, with glazed balconies and loggias made by the developer.  In subsequent lines, the houses were built in three and five floors.  The developer no longer glazed the balconies in them.  He only installed metal fences. </p><p>  In all buildings, the design of the entrance areas is made according to the principles of minimalism.  There are no elevators in the entrances, concierge rooms and wheelchairs are not provided, only areas for installing mailboxes are allocated. </p><h2>  Construction technology </h2><p>  All buildings in the village.  "Birch" (Irkutsk) are being erected using a monolithic frame technology.  The foundation is made of cross-band reinforced concrete slabs.  The outer walls are mounted from aerated concrete slabs of the ‚ÄúSIBIT‚Äù type (autoclave hardening) with monolithic inclusions.  Wall insulation is carried out by mineral wool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pos Berezovy Irkutsk" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1652774.jpg" width="502"></div>

    <p>  Village houses are being built with some differences.  So, in the first and second stages of the roof they have made smooth, without a slope, which in winter leads to the accumulation of snow, and in the spring to excess water.  The facades are lined with brick-like siding, which by the end of the first year of operation began to fall off. </p><p>  In houses of subsequent bursts, roofs were made with a slight slope, and the facades were faced with bricks, but the insulation material was replaced from mineral wool to polystyrene. </p><h2>  Village "Birch" (Irkutsk), apartments, their layout and design </h2><p>  The project provides for the construction of apartments in the following categories: </p><p>  - one-room, the average total area (S) of which is from 24 to 35 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - two-room S = from 35 to 48 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - three-room S = from 48 to 65 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  There are 7 apartments on each floor. </p><p>  Their layout in houses of different lines is different.  In some rooms they have a shape close to square, in others they are more elongated.  In such apartments in the kitchens there are no windows. </p><p>  Apartments for rent without finishing.  Builders carry out only the installation of communication facilities and electrical wiring, make rough screed floors, install partitions between rooms and glass windows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Berezovy village in Irkutsk" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1652771.jpg" width="483"></div>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The village "Birch" in Irkutsk is quite popular.  Apartments, whose quality reviews are not very enthusiastic, are being sold out quickly.  At the beginning of construction, the price for 1 m <sup>2</sup> here was only 25,000 rubles, so people with low incomes could buy real estate, for example, pensioners, young families.  Also in the "Berezovsky" they gave housing to the military and residents resettled from disaster areas.  Now the price per 1 m <sup>2 has</sup> jumped to 35,000-40,000 rubles.  Financial institutions cooperate with Nord-West: </p><ul><li>  Sberbank </li><li>  RosSelkhozbank. </li><li>  Promsotsbank. </li><li>  VTB. </li><li>  "Bank of Moscow". </li><li>  UralSibBank. </li></ul><p>  There are already no apartments on sale for rent.  They can only be purchased as secondary housing.  Prices in this case - from 55,000 rubles per 1 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><h2>  The settlement "Birch" (Sverdlovsk, Irkutsk), the progress of construction </h2><p>  This project was launched in 2010.  9 lines have already been commissioned here.  The deadlines for each were delayed for 2-5 months.  At the end of 2016, the customer was supposed to pass the 10th stage, but so far it is not completely ready, although all the houses in it have already been erected, the windows in them are glazed, communications have been let down.  It remains to perform only some internal work.  Representatives of Nord-West Insurance Company promise to give keys to key holders in the coming days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Berezovy village in Irkutsk apartments reviews" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1652805.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The double impression of investors and residents is the village of Berezovy (Irkutsk).  Reviews about him note such positive aspects: </p><p>  - excellent ecology (near the forest); </p><p>  - good transport accessibility; </p><p>  - low prices per square meter; </p><p>  - there is infrastructure (shops, child care facilities); </p><p>  - low utilities. </p><p>  The negative aspects of the village as a whole noted in the reviews: </p><p>  - the territory has a hilly terrain, which complicates (especially in ice) the passage of absolutely all means of transport; </p><p>  - there is no specific parking place (cars put where they have to); </p><p>  - poor quality of roads leading to the city; </p><p>  - not quite favorable criminal situation (car thefts or theft of property from them are not uncommon in the village); </p><p>  - in some courtyards and porches insufficient lighting; </p><p>  - the existing infrastructure does not match the declared in the project. </p><p>  Regarding the quality of the apartments, the tenants' claims are as follows: </p><p>  - there is no sound insulation at all (in some houses the walls between the apartments are made of drywall); </p><p>  - dampness in apartments; </p><p>  - leakage of roofs (especially in <span>houses commissioned</span> after 2013); </p><p>  - poor-quality laying of walls and partitions; </p><p>  - poor flooring. </p><p>  Many potential buyers believe that all of these shortcomings are offset by the low price of housing in this village. </p>
