But is it worth it to make a decent blow to the budget by acquiring modern photographic equipment?  Or is it worth paying attention to a Soviet camera, proven over the years?  In this article, this issue is discussed in more detail, and everyone can make their choice. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  History of creation </h2><p>  All Zenith cameras are Soviet single-lens reflex cameras with small format shooting.  They are also one of the first pentaprism single-lens reflex cameras in the world.  Produced from 1952 to 1956.  Their prototype was the Zorkiy rangefinder camera, which has been produced at the Krasnogorsk Mechanical Plant since 1949. </p><p>  In the redesigned case, which had a shutter from the "Vigilant", a lifting mirror was installed, which had the ability to create a valid image on the focusing screen. </p><p>  “Zenith” and “Sharp” are united by one minus, which consists in the fact that the field of view of the viewfinder is less than the area of ​​the entire frame, since the entire shutter design did not have the ability and space to place a larger mirror. </p><p>  "Zenith" is one of the few lines of single-lens reflex cameras that have been redone from a rangefinder camera. </p><p>  Over the entire production period, 39,091 cameras were produced. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  The Zenit-12 SD camera.  Specifications </h2><div class="photo" data-original="periscope.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="device characteristics" class="if uuid-2483357" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87957/2483357.jpg"></div><p>  Zenit-12 SD is a new line in the list of all cameras from the Zenit series. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This new product differs from its ancestors by the appearance of LED indicators.

Instruction manual </h2><div class="photo" data-original="m42digital.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="instruction for use" class="if uuid-2483361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87957/2483361.jpg"></div><p>  The process of creating high-quality images is not very simple.  It has its details and some but.  Therefore, before you go outside and feel like a professional photographer, you need to familiarize yourself with the rules of shooting so that the pictures are not taken in vain. </p><ul><li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="7" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  Exposure </li></ul><p>  It must be configured in any camera.  But on modern models, this is done very easily and simply.  On the "Zenith" setting does not take much time, but in some ways it differs significantly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, in order to adjust the shutter speed, you need to rotate the shutter speed dial so that the value is set against the index, which is located on the top panel of the camera.  During installation, you should feel a disk lock. </p><p>  The numbers on the scale indicate the shutter speed, which will occur in certain fractions of a second. </p><p>  You can install it both before and after the shutter. </p><ul><li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="7" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1">  Diaphragm. </li></ul><p>  In order to configure it and select the required value, it is necessary to set its value against the installation index by turning a special ring.  If the camera has a Helios-44M lens, you must set the aperture mode switch to "A" in advance. </p><ul><li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="7" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1">  Sharpness. </li></ul><p>  In order to achieve sharpness as best as possible, you need to aim only when the aperture is in the open state. </p><p>  You can also adjust sharpness without the help of the viewfinder.  To do this, it is necessary to set the distance from the object and to the film against the large index of the scale "30", and the focus ring must be rotated. </p><p>  A small index, which is indicated by the letter "R", is used when shooting on infrared material.  Therefore, in the case of photographing in this way, pointing at the sharpness of the microraster or the matte surface, it will be necessary to make a small correction, which consists in setting the obtained distance value against the index.  It is indicated by the letter "R". </p><ul><li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="10" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  The process of creating a photo. </li></ul><p>  After all the basic details are configured and their correctness and accuracy is checked, you must gently press the shutter button, which will begin taking pictures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You need to remember one main rule that will help to recreate beautiful, clear and high-quality images.  In no case should you press the shutter button sharply.  Due to a sharp press on it, the camera will inevitably startle.  As a result, you can get a blurry image that will need to be redone. </p><p>  All the rules for using the camera during shooting are not so complicated, so the recreation of a high-quality image does not take much time and effort. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  Camera advantages </h2><p>  Despite the fact that this camera was released a long time ago, even in our time it can compete with the most modern photographic equipment, thanks to its advantages. </p><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Calibri" data-listid="14" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  Ability to set the correct exposure. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Calibri" data-listid="14" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1">  Thanks to the mirror of constant sight, you can continuously monitor the subject. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Calibri" data-listid="14" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1">  The lens has a jumping aperture mechanism, which can automatically close when the shutter is released. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Calibri" data-listid="14" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="4" data-aria-level="1">  Thanks to the fully open aperture, maximum image brightness is ensured. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Calibri" data-listid="14" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="5" data-aria-level="1">  Focusing can be performed both on a micro-raster and on a frosted surface. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Calibri" data-listid="14" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="6" data-aria-level="1">  Built-in self-timer. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Calibri" data-listid="14" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="7" data-aria-level="1">  The increased reliability of locking the back cover, thanks to its hidden lock. </li></ul><h2 aria-level="2">  Rules for handling the camera </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vsgo-russia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="machine care" class="if uuid-2483365" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87957/2483365.jpg"></div><p>  The camera is a fairly accurate optical-mechanical device, which must be handled with the greatest care.  Also, you must always carefully monitor its cleanliness, avoid any shock and much more, which can significantly affect the deterioration of the functionality of the device. </p><p>  Several storage rules: </p><ul><li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="11" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  If the camera is brought from a cold into a warm room, then you need to wait a bit, as an instant temperature drop can affect its performance. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="11" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1">  Optical parts should never be touched by hands, as this can lead to any damage to the surface. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="11" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1">  It is necessary to regularly wipe the optical coated surfaces with a clean and soft cloth or cotton wool, slightly moistened with rectified alcohol. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="11" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="4" data-aria-level="1">  In case of contamination of the surface of the mirror itself or small elements, it is necessary to clean only with a soft brush (cotton swab).  Never use wet cleaning! </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="11" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="5" data-aria-level="1">  You need to store the camera in a closed case, while the lens must be closed by a cover. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="12" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  All additional accessories, such as lenses, light filters, converters for the Zenit 12 SD camera, need to be bought only in specialized stores. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="12" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1">  You need to remove the lens only if necessary, since frequent removal can provoke frequent pollution and unnecessary dust particles entering the device. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="12" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1">  Charging and discharging should be done only if the camera is completely protected from sunlight. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="12" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="4" data-aria-level="1">  If shooting takes place in cold weather, in no case should you leave the unit in the open air. </li></ul><ul><li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="12" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="5" data-aria-level="1">  Any repair work of the camera should be carried out only in special workshops, since only there they can know how to properly disassemble the Zenit 12 SD. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="quality zenith 6" class="if uuid-2483398" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87957/2483398.jpg"></div><h2>  Photo Samples </h2><p>  If there is any doubt about the quality of the pictures taken on the Soviet Zenit 12 SD cameras, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the samples of his photographs that are presented in this article.  They will help to make sure that the device is really very high quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="periscope.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="zenith quality 1" class="if uuid-2483387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87957/2483387.jpg"></div><h2 aria-level="2">  Zenit 12 SD: reviews </h2><p>  According to reviews, it will immediately become clear that the camera really deserves attention.  TTL metering is especially praised.  Even despite the fact that this unit has already gone out of sale, some people remain true to their choice and still use it regularly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lomography.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="zenith quality 4" class="if uuid-2483394" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87957/2483394.jpg"></div><p>  This is not surprising, since, indeed, it was during the Soviet era that equipment was made that can surprise with its quality and reliability.  Therefore, it makes no sense not to trust the others, since there is no point in writing negative, unreasonable reviews about this camera. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  Is it worth buying? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="picssr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="is it worth buying" class="if uuid-2483403" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87957/2483403.jpg"></div><p>  But whether or not to buy this camera is up to the potential buyer to decide.  If a person prefers more modern, high-quality, popular and expensive photo equipment, then the answer is unequivocal - no. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="zenith quality 3" class="if uuid-2483392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87957/2483392.jpg"></div><p>  But if the company, year of manufacture and cost are not so important, then in this case the answer is yes, it is definitely worth buying.  A huge advantage is not only the functionality of the camera, but also its cost in current markets.  Since it has long been discontinued, it will be possible to find it in some small shops, markets or on the Internet.  The cost of the device will be minimal, but despite this, you can still get high-quality images that are worthy of attention for many more years! </p>
