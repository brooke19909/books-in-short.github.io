And here it is not so!  Want to fall asleep every night and wake up every morning with a delicious coffee aroma?  Then you need to follow our advice and make a charming exclusive souvenir with your own hands - a coffee cup. </p><h2>  Do-it-yourself cup of <span>coffee beans</span> </h2><p>  Perhaps it never occurred to you that roasted coffee grains are an excellent material with which you can decorate anything.  Those whose hobbies are hand-made know well that with their help you can get a great many original souvenirs.  Coffee beans decorate candles, postcards, make whole <span>decorative panels</span> and the so-called <span>topiary (coffee</span> trees). </p><p>  Having a tube of glue and a certain amount of coffee beans, it is easy to make an unusual frame for a wall clock, put out a casket or a vase.  The only drawback of this unusual material is the inability to wash a dusty product.  But there is a way out - a moisture-resistant coating is simply applied to the crafts, or it is varnished. </p><p>  In our article we will look at how to craft an original souvenir from this unusual material.  So, we begin our coffee cup master class. </p>

    <h2>  Materials and Tools </h2><p>  What do we need?  First of all, a small saucer and a cup (coffee) of a simple form, which will serve as the basis of our composition.  Of course, grains of coffee.  Well, and auxiliary materials - a skein of twine, a tube of glue, golden <span>paint in a spray can</span> and a glue gun.  For decoration, you can provide any decorative elements, for example, cinnamon sticks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to make a coffee cup?  At the first stage of our work, we should tightly wrap both items of utensil on all sides with twine.  This activity requires some patience.  First we wrap the saucer, starting from its middle.  Wrap the first few circles of twine in your hands, holding it on weight.  Then gently drop in the middle of the saucer with glue and glue the resulting circle. </p><p>  Continue to wind the turns, gently laying the twine in a circle - increasing in width.  Do not forget to wet the source material with glue.  If a little glue will protrude between the turns - it's okay, later everything will be painted over. </p><p>  Thus, the bottom of our saucer is gradually hidden under a layer of twisted spiral.  When reaching the edges, carefully lay out the edge of the saucer with twine.  Then go to the bottom.  In the same way, we continue the winding until the entire saucer disappears under a layer of twine. </p>

    <h2>  Working with a cup </h2><p>  Do it yourself coffee cup.  We start the winding from the middle of the bottom from its outer side.  Do not forget to add glue for the strength of our joints.  A coffee cup, as you know, has a handle.  Therefore, you have to tinker.  How to hold the twine under the handle and how to wrap it yourself?  There is an exit.  The twine will need to be cut into pieces, measure the right amount.  The edges of the scraps are securely fixed with glue. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When the whole cup with the handle disappeared under a layer of tightly wound twine, we assume that the first stage of work is completed.  Then we take a spray can with golden paint and evenly spray it on our product.  As soon as the paint dries, it is the turn of the coffee beans. </p><p>  We offer you to perform the composition in the form of a cup overturned on a saucer, from which a coffee stream flows.  To do this, lay our beautiful golden cup on a saucer.  Just decide in advance on which side the handle will be located - at the top, on the left or on the right side. </p>

    <h2>  Making a "lake" of coffee </h2><p>  Having fixed the overturned cup on the saucer, we begin to craft a coffee stream.  We take brown grains and spread in rows in the direction from the center of the bottom of the cup to its edges with the transition on the saucer.  The grains fit tightly in several rows onto a path pre-coated with glue.  The first layer of grains is glued with a slit down, the next with a slit up, and you should try to keep as few gaps between grains as possible. </p><p>  On the saucer, we depict a puddle of coffee (glue in the same way).  Remember that at the place of contact with the saucer (on the rim) the coffee cup should be stained brown.  To do this, gently stick a row of grains on its edge.  And from the side the cup can be decorated with a decorative flower. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To do this, take a piece of twine and lay it with a loop in the shape of petals.  We fix the middle of the flower with glue and place it on the side of the cup.  We fill the center and each of the petals with coffee beans.  The saucer can be decorated with a pair of cinnamon sticks tied with twine.  Such a wonderful golden cup with the smell of spilled coffee will brighten up your morning awakening, invigorate and make you smile. </p>

    <h2>  Soaring coffee cup </h2><p>  An even more original craft, which will be a great gift for any coffee lover, can be made by raising the cup and making it ‚Äúsoar‚Äù.  Our unusual design will be an overturned cup "hanging" in the air, from which an aromatic coffee drink is poured. </p><p>  It should be noted that in recent years, crafts made from coffee beans have become extremely popular among adults and children.  Fans of this material does not stop even its relative high cost.  The result of creative efforts are stylish decor items with a wonderful aroma.  A coffee cup made from coffee beans glued over the entire surface without gaps or our ‚Äúsoaring‚Äù design is a wonderful souvenir, a real example of a creative approach to business. </p><p>  Puzzling over the device of this "magic" cup is not worth it.  Everything is done quite simply using an ordinary coffee pair - a cup and saucer, thick durable wire, brown acrylic paint, brush, masking tape and hot glue gun.  And, of course, coffee beans. </p>

    <h2>  Master frame </h2><p>  First of all, we prepare the ‚Äúfittings‚Äù of the future coffee waterfall.  We take a piece of thick wire and gently bend it in the form of an outgoing stream of liquid.  2-3 cm from each edge are gently bent, from the bottom - up with a crochet, from above - down with a crochet.  As a result, our wire detail slightly resembles the Latin letter ‚ÄúZ‚Äù. </p><p>  Then we take an <span>adhesive thermo-gun, the</span> lower edge of our letter is firmly glued to the center of the saucer, the upper one is attached to the cup from the inside, and the cup is tilted so that it is tilted upside down at an angle of about 45 degrees.  In this position, from any vessel, the liquid will pour out in an even, dense stream. </p><p>  As an option, instead of a wire, you can take a plug made of soft metal, using pliers to bend its upper end for insertion into a cup, bend the teeth horizontally and stick to the saucer.  Do not forget to pre-determine the position of the handle of the cup, which, as in the first example, can be located on the side or top. </p>

    <h2>  Making out our "waterfall" </h2><p>  Then you should wait until the glue has completely dried and make sure that the position of our cup in the air is reliable.  Now it's time to mask the wire reinforcement with several layers of paper masking tape.  This part should imitate a stream of liquid, and its width varies from the narrowest at the edge of the cup to a wide one at the level of the saucer. </p><p>  After that, paint over the stream with brown acrylic paint using a previously stored brush.  This is done so that white tape is not visible between the grains of coffee.  <span>Masking tape</span> can be replaced with a mass for modeling, in this case it will be even easier to form a smooth and smooth stream.  Before painting, you should wait until it dries completely. </p><p>  After the paint dries, we begin to decorate our brook with coffee beans.  They must be carefully selected and tightly laid next to each other.  The work should be done very carefully so that the base is not visible anywhere.  Inside the cup, you need to depict the coffee mass, for which we paste the grains densely in several layers.  On a saucer, you need to depict a coffee puddle.  It is laid out in the same way, with a tight fit of the grains to each other.  The surface must be strictly horizontal (so that the grains do not puff). </p>

    <h2>  Shutdown </h2><p>  A coffee cup, like any craft, can be additionally decorated.  There is nothing to limit your imagination.  There are a lot of decorating options.  You can knit small flowers from coarse yarn or even from thin twine and stick them on the side of the product.  You can wrap the cup with decorative twine, putting it on glue.  You can make decorative elements from ribbons and beads, buttons, artificial flowers and the like. </p><p>  Each master seeks to come up with something of his own.
