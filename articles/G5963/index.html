    <p>  Now that smartphones and communicators have flooded the market of modern communications, many are interested in the question, what kind of device.  Let's figure it out. </p><p>  What is a communicator? </p><p>  This device is a combination of a handheld computer, camera, GPS-navigator, mobile phone.  At the moment, it is this type of gadget that has received the greatest distribution.  Most often communicators are perceived as one of the types of mobile phones.  That is why its use is limited to its use as a phone, navigator and a convenient device for browsing the Internet.  However, with all this, the device is a high-tech mobile device.  Like a regular computer, it runs under <span>the operating</span> system, having its own "stuffing."  At the moment, models are presented on the market that are comparable in terms of technical specifications and power level to personal computers of medium configuration. </p><p>  Answering the question of what a communicator is, it is worth saying about its appearance and control.  It has touch control and several soft buttons, and some models have a full keyboard, which is made in the form of a retractable.  Touch control is carried out with a finger or stylus directly on the screen of the gadget.  The display may be of different sizes and resolutions, image quality depends on this.  The use of widescreen screens is very convenient for comfortable viewing photos and videos, as well as for games.  A small screen indicates that the model belongs to the budget options, while their functionality is slightly limited.  Touch screens come in two types: resistive and capacitive. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Speaking about what a communicator is, it is worth mentioning that all modern models use memory cards.  The former used the SD format, and the modern ones used microSD, which significantly saves space.  Communicators have a mini / micro-USB interface for connecting a cable.  This cable is designed to connect the device to a computer and to recharge.  If you connect the device to a computer, it can very well be used as a flash card or card reader. </p><p>  Choice of communicator </p><p>  Like a regular computer, the performance of this gadget is characterized by processor power.  The presence of devices with a processor at 2 gigahertz is no longer a rarity.  The advent of dual-core has become another novelty.  Modern communicators are becoming more efficient due to the use of a powerful processor, an audio chip and a graphics accelerator.  For a long time, such gadgets have used graphics accelerators that support the 3D format, while not inferior to the inexpensive video cards used in computers.  An equally important point is the presence of a GPS module that allows you to use the navigator.  Using all the functions of the device requires a powerful battery.  At full load, the device can only work for a few hours. </p><p>  Answering the question of what a communicator is, it is worth saying that for all its purposes, communication is the main one.  In this case, it is understood as a telephone message and Internet connection. </p><p>  The lineup of communicators is currently very diverse.  At first, they were running Windows Mobile, but now you can find devices running other operating systems.  From which one is used depends on the set of programs available to him.  In general, the communicator is a very convenient <span>multifunctional device,</span> which occupies a leading position in the market among communications. </p>
