    <p>  When purchasing a tourist permit, it is worth checking the reliability of medical insurance, hotel reservation. </p><p>  It is recommended to compare the cost of hotels in various reservation systems.  One and the same number in different reservation systems can be treated completely differently. </p><p>  In the same hotel it is often possible to relax on an all inclusive basis, as well as on half board or without any meals at all - all depending on your wishes. </p><p>  The resort of Alanya cannot be called luxurious, but the prices for hotels in it are one of the most tempting. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  This is a fairly ancient and beautiful city, which certainly must be visited by any wanderer in order to increase their horizons.  You can go to amazing historical sights with traces of past eras and look into the distant past.  The emotions acquired on this earth make it possible to take a fresh look at the world.  Touching history, it is much easier to understand certain events from the life of the state, outlined in legends and historical sketches. </p><ol><li>  The city is located at an altitude dominated by vortices and celestial bodies.  It is divided into old and new by high cliff.  The beaches stretch along the coast and are divided into two zones - eastern and western.  The western zone of the beach is called the “Cleopatra Coast”, and the eastern one is called the “Eastern Beach”.  According to legend, the Roman commander Marc Anthony, delighted with the beauty of this place, presented it to Cleopatra.  Actually, here (again, according to legend), the mistress loved to relax from the works of the righteous, and the sand was brought here from Egypt.  After 2 thousand years, after these events, the famous coast gained the “Blue Flag” - the main symbol of the quality of world beaches.  Admission to the Cleopatra's Coast is free, a deck chair rental is 10 lire. </li><li>  The medieval castle on the cape in the town of Alanya, erected in the XIII century by Sultan Aladdin Keykubad, is located at the top of the hill.  Inside the castle is a Byzantine church of St. George.  The Red Tower - access to the castle, is considered a monument of Seljuk architecture and a symbol of the city. </li><li>  The ancient village of Mahmutlar is located further.  To get to the village, you should go on foot through a banana grove. </li><li>  <span>Damlatas Cave is</span> located in the city center.  The presence of a huge number of natural stalagmites, and in addition, stalactites, <span data-mce-mark="1">ensures the</span> natural ionization of the atmosphere and a high content of carbon dioxide, which contributes to healing. </li></ol>
