    <p>  Most residents are descendants of Spanish and French settlers.  But during its rapid growth New Orleans was overrun by Italians, Irish, Germans, Greeks.  In the last century, thousands of immigrants from Haiti joined the population. </p><h2>  French and Spaniards </h2><p>  At the end of the XVII century, the first settlers appeared at the mouth of the Mississippi.  The head of the French group, Robert Cavelier de la Salle, declared this territory the property of his country and named it Louisiana in honor of Louis XIV.  The first French colony settled here at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries, and the date of founding of New Orleans is recognized as the date of May 7, 1718. The founder of the city is Jean Battist Le Moines, a Canadian.  The name New Orleans is given in honor of Philip II, Prince of Orleans - French regent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The bulk of the first settlers were convicts sent to Louisiana for the development of new lands and not distinguished by high moral and moral qualities.  In addition, for many years, the slave trade flourished here, but the blacks living in the city were mostly free. </p><p>  The French were unhappy with the profits from these lands.  In 1762, they transferred them to their ally in the war with England.  The Spaniards owned Louisiana until 1800.  Then again the French became the owners, and in 1803 they sold it to the United States for $ 15 million. </p><h2>  American New Orleans </h2><p>  In the middle of the XIX century, the city had a population of 100 thousand people and was one of the largest in the country.  In the Civil War, Louisiana took the Confederate side, but a year later it already belonged to Lincoln supporters. </p><p>  The beginning of the twentieth century was marked by the discovery of oil reserves, which together with the development of transport roads gave a new impetus to the rapid development of New Orleans. </p><p>  By the end of the twentieth century, the city achieved great success in shipbuilding and the aerospace industry, and became a major tourist center. </p><h2>  Modern New Orleans </h2><p>  The spirit of France still hovers over the picturesque areas of the city.  New Orleans today is called the "Paris of the New World."  In the old part of the city many old buildings have been preserved.  It is called the French Quarter.  New Orleans is shrouded in legends and traditions, especially the Saint Louis Cemetery, which is an architectural monument.  According to one of them, the Queen of the Voodoo tribe Marie Lavo is buried here, so it is strongly not recommended to walk on it alone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
