  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Journalistic style of speech</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The journalistic style of</span> speech has found wide application in various areas of human life.  In particular, it is used in magazines, on television, in newspapers, on the radio, in party activities, in public speeches.  Among the areas of its application should be noted both documentary films and political literature, designed for the general reader. </p><p>  A journalistic style is a functional kind of literary language.  This concept has a close relationship with the concept of ‚Äújournalism,‚Äù which, in turn, in view of the peculiarities of the content of the works related to it, is considered a more literary than linguistic concept. </p><p>  The journalistic <span>style of speech is</span> characterized by a fundamental heterogeneity of stylistic means.  These should include special terminology, and the emotional coloring of vocabulary, as well as a combination of expressive and standard <span>language tools.</span> </p><p>  The peculiarity of this style lies in the breadth of the lexical coverage of the literary language.  A publicist is able to apply technical and scientific terms, while he can go beyond the literary language and begin to use simple <span>colloquial speech</span> (in some cases, slang elements), which, however, is desirable to avoid. </p><p>  It should be noted that the journalistic style of speech does not apply to all texts that are published in the media.  So, for example, decrees, laws, decrees presented in newspapers are official business publications.  Subject articles submitted by scientists are scientific publications.  Often on the radio you can hear reading novels, short stories, and novels.  These works are artistic. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The journalistic style of speech can relate to any topic that has penetrated the center of public attention.  Of course, this circumstance forces us to add special lexical elements to the speech that require clarification, and in some cases, sufficiently detailed comments. </p><p>  Along with this, certain topics are constantly in the public eye.  Thus, the vocabulary related to them acquires the coloring of a journalistic style, and the composition of the dictionary is replenished with the formed circle of lexical units characteristic of it.  Among the topics covered constantly, it is necessary to highlight politics, information about the elections, the activities of parliament and the government, statements by statesmen and others.  Equally important is the economic theme. </p><p>  The pronounced morphological features of the journalistic style are expressed in special ways of using grammatical forms. </p><p>  So, for example, the singular is often used in the plural: "Endurance and understanding in the Russian person has always been present ..." </p><p>  The use of plural nouns without it is also characteristic.  For example: authorities, risks, budgets, strategies, mafias, searches, freedoms and others. </p><p>  In order to attract attention in journalism, imperative <span>forms of the verb are used.</span>  For example: ‚ÄúLet's think ...‚Äù, ‚ÄúLook ...‚Äù, ‚ÄúPay attention ...‚Äù and others. </p><p>  In order to emphasize the significance of one or another event, the present form of the verb is used.  For example: "A fair opens tomorrow." </p><p>  Characteristic for the style is the use of such <span>derivative prepositions</span> as: on the basis, in the interests, for the reason, in the light, on the way, taking into account, in the course and others. </p><p>  The inverse word order is also very typical.  This allows in many cases in the proposal to put the topic in the first place. </p><p>  Rhetorical questions are often asked to enhance the emotional impact, reinforce the expressed thought.  For example: "Why are these people worse than others?" </p><p>  Genres of journalistic style of speech are usually divided into three groups: <span>analytical (article,</span> conversation, review, review, and others), information (reporting, note, report, interview) and journalistic (essay, essay, feuilleton). </p>
