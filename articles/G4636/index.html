    <h2>  Reviews of tourists: disadvantages </h2><p>  It is unlikely that there is a hotel that can boast of the absence of negative reviews.  Tourists often criticize Golden Coast Hotel 4 *.  They believe that its disadvantages are: </p><ul><li>  The restaurant is in need of renovation.  Air conditioning does not work, broken chairs for feeding are found.  Wash dishes poorly. </li><li>  Very old plumbing in rooms that does not work well. </li><li>  The entire hotel has two small elevators, so they are always crowded, and people are forced to stand in line. </li><li>  Cold water in the pool, not suitable for bathing children. </li><li>  All loungers on the beach are occupied by local people.  The beach is private, but the hotel staff does not follow this.  As a result, guests are not enough places. </li></ul><h2>  Draw conclusions </h2><p>  After reading the description and reviews of the Golden Coast 4 * hotel (Protaras, Cyprus), we can conclude that the hotel will be a good option for relaxing on the island.  It is located in a quiet area, so it is perfect for families with children, newlyweds and the elderly.  It is also worth recommending the complex for young people who want to spend a relaxing vacation. </p>
