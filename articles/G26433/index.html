  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Choosing an e-book: some simple tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Before answering the question of how to choose the right e-book, you should understand the terms.  An electronic book, or as it is often called an e-book, is a library of <span>electronic documents</span> placed in one small device that can display the text of these documents on its monitor.  Currently, there is a huge amount of literature available in electronic form, including not only books, but also magazines, newspapers, and even comics. </p><p>  The e-book screen resembles paper because it uses E-Ink technology that simulates <span>ink.</span>  <span>E-</span> books are read as easily as regular books, and the power consumption of an e-book is much lower than that of LCD monitors.  Charging a book allows you to read more than two thousand pages.  The size of the e-book is optimized for the size of ordinary books, in addition, these devices are very thin and light. </p><h3>  Display dimensions </h3><p>  When wondering which e-book to choose, first of all, pay attention to the display size of the device.  For the reading process to be comfortable, you must fully see the paragraph.  It is best to purchase a device with a monitor of at least 5.6 inches and with a resolution of 320 * 460 pixels.  As a rule, if we choose an e-book, we are offered devices with display sizes from 6 inches and with a screen resolution of 600 * 800 pixels.  There are also very small e-books that fit easily into a small handbag. </p><h3>  Memory capacity </h3><p>  All modern reading devices have built-in memory.  The size of one document, as a rule, does not exceed 5 MB.  Imagine that we choose an e-book.  A device with 512 MB of memory will be enough to download almost five hundred books.  There is also the opportunity to increase memory due to an additional memory card.  If you like listening to music while reading, then choose an e-book that can work with memory cards up to 16 GB. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h3>  Button layout </h3><p>  Button layout also plays a major role in choosing an e-book.  You should pick up the device yourself and determine how convenient it will be.  You have to solve this problem individually, but you should take it very seriously. </p><h3>  Readable File Formats </h3><p>  To date, any e-book device is capable of opening formats such as RTF, HTML, FB2, TXT and PDF.  These formats are the most common for saving electronic text documents.  Some books are capable of opening archives.  If we choose an e-book that can open formats such as DOC, DJVU or PRC, then you should pay attention to PocketBook devices and check with a store consultant if such e-books are available.  Many e-books can play <span>MP3 music</span> and JPG pictures.  The ability to open a GIF, PNG, and BMP image will need to be clarified. </p><p>  Another difficulty for the e-book is the PDF format, as it is not completely readable and has a standard page size.  Even if the manufacturer claims that his device is capable of opening such documents, do not flatter yourself, as the text quality may not be very good.  Therefore, it is best to check and clarify in advance how the device opens this format.  Of course, if you have a need for it. </p><h3>  Equipment </h3><p>  Some e-books immediately loaded a small library as a gift to the user.  Also, if we choose an e-book, you should immediately look at the case or case so that the e-book retains its attractive appearance for longer. </p><h3>  Instead of a conclusion </h3><p>  Of course, everyone <span>makes a choice</span> individually.  Someone more important is a large capacity, someone will pay extra for the size of the display and for the quality.  I really hope that this article will help you make the right choice and not regret your purchase. </p>
