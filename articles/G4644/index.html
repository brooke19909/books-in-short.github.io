    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  As our compatriots note in their reviews, the Otium Aloha Hotel (Sharm El Sheikh) will surely appeal to beach lovers.  So, tourists call the big plus of this hotel complex the fact that, thanks to a fairly compact territory, from any residential building, you can reach the coast in a maximum of seven minutes by an unhurried step.  The beach here is quite large.  Loungers and umbrellas, according to travelers, are in abundance here, so there is no talk of the need to occupy a deck chair in the early morning.  You can enter the water either directly from the shore or by going down the ladder from the pier.  In the first case, however, it is advisable to have special shoes on your feet, since there are corals at the bottom.  Parents with young children and people who swim poorly entered the sea from the shore.  If you go down to the water from the pier, then very close you will find a large and beautiful coral reef with a lot of interesting inhabitants.  So, according to tourists, here you can see a variety of bright fish, as well as a sea turtle, moray eel, etc. Therefore, going to the beach, be sure to bring a mask for snorkeling. </p>
