  <section class="page js-page"><h1>High atmospheric pressure - a reason for panic?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The number of weather-sensitive people is growing all the time.  The height of the mercury column now predicts how the day will go, what kind of mood and well-being a person will have.  But initially it was believed that atmospheric pressure only affects the weather.  Let's look at what low and high atmospheric pressure is, and whether it can really affect our lives so much. </p><p>  <strong>What is atmospheric pressure</strong> </p><p>  If we take the general definition, then this is a value that shows how hard the column of air presses, starting from the upper boundary of the atmospheric layer, on the earth or water surface. </p><p>  Above 762 mmHg this is a high atmospheric pressure, and below 758 mm, respectively, <span>low pressure.</span>  The maximum pressure at sea level was recorded - 808.7 mm and the minimum - 684 mm. </p><p>  <strong>What atmospheric pressure depends on</strong> </p><p>  First of all, pressure changes due to uneven heating of air above the <span>earth's surface.</span>  Features of landscape zones, the Earth‚Äôs rotation, the difference in heat capacity and reflective abilities of the water and the earth‚Äôs surface - all this affects in this case.  As a result, cyclones and anticyclones form, which form the weather. </p><p>  Cyclones are relatively fast moving vortices with reduced atmospheric pressure.  In summer, they bring rains and coolness, in winter - snow and thaw, but at the same time always strong winds and cloudy weather. </p><p>  Anticyclones are slowly moving areas characterized by high atmospheric pressure.  In summer, they create hot, calm weather, and in winter - frosty and clear. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On a global scale, atmospheric pressure varies uniformly from the equator to the poles.  The areas of the lowest pressure are the equator region and 60-65 degrees south and north latitude.  And the highest is 30-35 degrees latitude and both poles.  In addition, a steady high atmospheric pressure occurs every winter over cold continents. </p><p>  Atmospheric pressure also varies with the time of day.  Its peaks occur at 9-10 hours and 21-22 hours, and recessions occur at 3-4 hours in the morning and 15-16 hours. </p><p>  <strong>The effect of <span>high atmospheric pressure</span> on well-being</strong> </p><p>  Sudden changes in atmospheric pressure lead to a deterioration in the health of weather-sensitive people.  High atmospheric pressure can bring the following symptoms: </p><ul><li>  <span>pulse rate</span> reduction; </li><li>  lowering blood pressure; </li><li>  rarer and deeper breathing; </li><li>  slight decrease in hearing and smell; </li><li>  muffled voice. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Risk group with increasing atmospheric pressure</strong> </p><p>  First of all, the elderly and chronic patients suffering from cardiac and vascular problems, unstable <span>blood pressure are</span> at risk <span>.</span> </p><p>  They may have chest pains, jumps in blood pressure, exacerbation of angina pectoris, migraine, tachycardia. </p><p>  <strong>What will help with high atmospheric pressure</strong> </p><p>  If weather forecasters predict the onset of an anticyclone and an increase in pressure, then weather-sensitive people should prepare in advance - try to reduce physical activity and consult a doctor so that he prescribes special medications. </p><p>  High atmospheric pressure very often entails <span>severe frosts</span> or prolonged heat.  And air temperature affects health several times stronger than pressure.  Therefore, it is better to take care of yourself and try not to go outside once again, while the apartment should have a comfortable temperature. </p><p>  In any case, there is no need to panic so that the effect of self-hypnosis is not obtained.  An interesting fact is that people who use elevators undergo a change in atmospheric pressure several times a day, but their health does not suffer from this simply because the elevator is a common occurrence.  Take care of yourself! </p>
