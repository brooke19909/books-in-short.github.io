What kind of organization is this?  What does she do?  What are the pros and cons of paying attention to the population before contacting here?  Are customers satisfied with the work of the company?  Numerous reviews will help to judge all this.  In some cases, opinions may differ.  This should not be scared - quite a normal occurrence.  In the same way, you do not need to believe everything that is written.  What really useful information can be gleaned from the reviews? </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Ugoria is an <span>insurance company</span> that has been operating in Russia for a long time.  This company offers all standard services.  Here you can insure a car or life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance yugoria" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1517308.jpg"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <p></p>
    <p>  The corporation has quite a few branches and divisions throughout the country.  That is why some potential customers are interested in the organization.  After all, scammers will not spread throughout Russia.  This makes me happy.  But what exactly can be said about this corporation?  What are the pros and cons to pay attention to? </p><h2>  Country rating </h2><p>  The first nuance that will have to be taken into account is the rating that the Ugoria insurance has in the country.  Russia has its own list of popularity of insurance organizations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  "Ugoria" in it is far from in the first place.  Moreover, this corporation is located below the top 10 leaders of insurance companies in Russia.  The exact position of the organization cannot be said - different sources indicate different information.  Therefore, it is simply enough for the population to know that Ugoria OJSC is an insurance company that for some reason is not included in the best organizations offering population insurance services. </p><h2>  Reliability </h2><p>  An important indicator is such a component as reliability.  Thanks to her, as a rule, clients trust or do not trust the company.  Ugoria is an insurance company that cannot boast of particularly high reliability. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yugoriya insurance" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1517309.jpg"></div>

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <p></p>
    <p>  According to statistics, a given corporation has a reliability rating (or trust) at A. Sometimes it drops to B ++.  Accordingly, it is possible to decipher these indicators as ‚ÄúReliable‚Äù and ‚ÄúAcceptable Reliability‚Äù.  Not too high rates for modern successful corporations. </p><p>  That is why part of the population refuses the services that the "insurance" Ugoria offers.  Not everyone trusts firms with an A ++ or A + trust level.  And to organizations with a lower confidence rating, many are generally skeptical.  This means that there are certain disadvantages that do not allow the company to work 100% efficiently and in good faith. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Address </h2><p>  OJSC state <span>insurance company</span> "Ugoria" which has an address?  Where is this corporation located?  It has already been said that the company has a huge number of branches throughout the country.  That is why it is worth clarifying information regarding each settlement. </p><p>  But where is the corporate headquarters located?  The Yugoriya Insurance Company offers the address of the main branch: 68/70, Butyrsky Val, Moscow.  This is where it is worth sending letters of recommendation and global complaints or wishes.  In Moscow there are still many offices of the <span>insurance company.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yugoria insurance company" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1517310.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Services </h2><p>  What specific services does this organization offer?  "Insurance" "Ugoria" offers all the standard features that are available to similar corporations.  More precisely, here you can: </p><ul><li>  insure property; </li><li>  apply for a VHI policy; </li><li>  get hull or compulsory motor liability insurance; </li><li>  take out accident insurance; </li><li>  get insurance under the program "Repair at the dealer" (for cars); </li><li>  just insure life and children. </li></ul><p>  There is nothing surprising or strange about this.  Everything is extremely simple and clear.  In fact, a similar range of services pleases.  Clients can clearly say for what reasons they are advised to contact a particular insurance company. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yugoria insurance reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1517311.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Medical insurance </h2><p>  Now a little specifics about some services.  OJSC State <span>Insurance Company</span> Ugoria offers medical insurance.  VHI policies are in particular demand here. </p><p>  But here reviews the organization in this area receives mixed.  Some clients believe that Ugoria medical insurance is not covered in the best way.  Some indicate that payments are received not only with delays, but also in scanty amounts.  This is a fairly common point. </p><p>  Some say that Ugoria medical insurance is a great way to use the VHI program.  You can get all payments on time (although there are small hitches), in large sizes.  More precisely, in due. </p><p>  What to believe?  Based on the foregoing, potential customers tend to trust the first type of opinion.  It is noted that <span>"insurance</span> " Ugoria offers medical <span>insurance</span> with some drawbacks.  But it is possible that cooperation in this area will bring only advantages. </p><h2>  CTP and CASCO </h2><p>  The next caveat is car insurance.  Another common service that attracts new customers.  CASCO and CTP insurance policies in Ugoria, as they say, are issued quickly and without any problems.  Although there are some disadvantages, as well as advantages, the organization has in this area. </p><p>  Some customers emphasize that car insurance in this insurance company is 100% complete.  Repair of vehicles is carried out quickly, payments also come at a separate speed, and in specified volumes.  No cheating.  Consumers are satisfied. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance company yugoria address" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1517312.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Along with this, many say the opposite.  More precisely, the CASCO and CTP in Yugoriya leave much to be desired.  It is not always possible to take advantage of insurance policies.  Cars after accidents and other incidents are repaired for a long time, and payments come not only with delays, but also in small sizes.  All this makes us refuse to cooperate with the company. </p><p>  It‚Äôs hard to decide here.  <span>Ugoria (insurance company)</span> receives positive and negative <span>reviews</span> in approximately the same amount.  However, there is no evidence of unfair work.  Only a low rating of the organization, as well as not the best indicators of reliability.  Therefore, it is preferable to hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  Also among the negativity expressed in the address of Ugoria, it can be noted that the company often imposes additional services.  In particular, with car insurance.  Customers are also persuaded by all means to insure their life.  This is quite common. </p><p>  Some are scared away and repelled by such behavior.  Some consumers indicate excessive assertiveness of the employees of Ugoria.  Someone even says that without life insurance, CASCO and OSAGO policies will not be issued in the organization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ojsc yugoria insurance company" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1517314.jpg"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  There is no evidence or rebuttal to such situations.  Nevertheless, Ugoria ("insurance") receives negative reviews from customers precisely for the <span>imposition of services.</span>  However, this claim is found in many similar corporations. </p><h2>  Customer service </h2><p>  Customer service in the organization also deserves attention.  The thing is that some people indicate that employees of Ugoria didn‚Äôt communicate with them in the best way.  There are not the most friendly people here, and workers who are not distinguished by their professionalism.  Customers can be rude. </p><p>  Along with this, part of the visitors indicates that the employees at the Ugoria insurance company are working in good faith, with high quality and attentiveness to all visitors.  Therefore, it is recommended just to be prepared for the fact that you can not insure yourself against the human factor and rudeness.  In Ugoria, as elsewhere, they may not communicate with customers in the best way. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What conclusions can be drawn from the foregoing?  Ugoria OJSC is an insurance company that does not make customers happy.  100% quality service can not wait here.  You can get it, but there are many complaints against the company.  And given the fact that the organization's reliability rating is at a relatively low level, customers prefer to avoid this corporation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jsc state insurance company yugoria" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1517313.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Accordingly, Ugoria is a pretty good company, but it is not in demand.  She, according to some reviews, does not give stability.  You can contact here only taking into account all the previously mentioned shortcomings. </p>
