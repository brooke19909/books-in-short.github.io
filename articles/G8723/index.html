These berries can be supplemented with a juicy summer composition or hung on keys as a keychain. </p><p>  Weaving cherries from beads will not take much time, and even a beginner will cope with a master class.  This is a fascinating needlework.  There are several ways to weave a bulk cherry, but we want to offer you a simple and no less exciting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.it" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.pinterest.it/pin/155303887141919966/"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to weave cherries and beads?" class="if uuid-3079256" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3079256.jpg"></div><h2>  Master class "Cherry from beads" </h2><p>  We will weave the berries using the technique of braiding large beads. </p><p>  For this you will need: </p><ul><li>  2 large beads, the best option is 8 mm, preferably cherry or red; </li><li>  cherry-colored beads; </li><li>  green beads; </li><li>  thin fishing line; </li><li>  needle for beadwork. </li></ul><p>  High quality Czech beads are perfect for braiding beads.  Chinese may vary in size, may be unevenly sliced.  And then you have to pick up the same beads to get the perfect weave. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bead.deals" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.bead.deals/products/bead-deals-round-of-beads-color-eerie-cherry"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cherry beads" class="if uuid-3079258" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3079258.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparation method </h2><p>  Let's start weaving cherries from beads.  For the first berry, measure 80 cm of fishing line, pass it into a thin bead needle and pass through a bead.  Place the bead, 5 cm away from the free end of the segment.  Tie both ends of the fishing line together, fixing them with several tight knots.  Place the knot over the hole in the bead.  The short tip of the fishing line will not be needed, but if you cut it off at the base of the knot, there is a risk that it will untie, so first pass it through the bead, and then cut off the excess. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Take the needle, on it dial 8 beads.  For 8 mm beads, this is sufficient.  Pass the needle through the hole, thereby rounding the bead.  Tighten tightly.  So that the beads do not leave the base and hold tightly, pass the needle again through the beads and the hole of the base beads. </p><p>  Tighten the fishing line and once again go around the base, but this time without beads. </p><p>  For the next row of cherries from beads on a needle, type 5 beads, repeat the same steps with them.  Bend the bead with the line of beads, pass the needle through the beads and the hole, and fix the row with an empty line. </p><p>  The next row consists of 8 beads as well.  Alternate the number of beads necessary until the end of weaving. </p><div class="photo" data-original="simplebeads.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaded Cherries" class="if uuid-3079264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3079264.jpg"></div><p>  There are several rules for weaving cherries from beads. </p><p>  Firstly, each next row must be placed strictly in order, that is, next to the previous one, so that the weaving turns out to be even. </p><p>  Secondly, do not forget to fix the beads and a row.  This is necessary so that the fishing line does not slide over the bead while using the cherry. </p><p>  Thirdly, the last row must necessarily consist of 5 beads so that the weaving looks the same from all sides. </p><p>  When weaving is completed, the fishing line needs to be fixed.  To do this, pass it through several rows and a hole. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Cut excess.  Here is a cherry from beads (photo in the article) you should get. </p><h2>  Petiole and leaf </h2><p>  Put the finished cherry from the beads to the side.  For the second, measure out a fishing line 100 cm long, braid in the same way as the first, but do not cut off the excess.  We will weave a stalk and leaf on it. </p><p>  On the remaining fishing line, dial 1 bead of cherry color, pass the needle with the fishing line through the nearest hole.  This way you mask the bead hole.  Withdraw the needle and collect 20 green beads on it.  Holding the last bead on the fishing line, pass the needle in the opposite direction through 4 beads, passing one, the last.  Tighten the fishing line by pressing the beads tightly against each other. </p><p>  Next, make a leaf.  To do this, dial 22 green beads on the needle and again, holding one, pass the needle through one bead.  Tighten the line firmly. </p><p>  On the needle, dial 20 beads, then pass the needle through 22, leading the needle from the petiole.  When you pull out the fishing line, you get the tip of a pointed leaf. </p><p>  Holding the bead on the tip of the leaf, pass the needle through the remaining beads of the leaf towards the petiole.  Tighten the fishing line.  The leaf is ready. </p><p>  Next, we pick up another petiole of 15 beads, and after it we put on the needle a second cherry.  To decorate the hole of the bead, string one cherry bead.  We fix the weaving by passing the needle through the bead.  We fix the fishing line by passing it through several rows on a cherry, cut off the excess. </p><p>  Cherries are ready.  Let's find them a use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="simplebeads.blogspot.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://simplebeads.blogspot.com/2012/12/beaded-cherries.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ready product" class="if uuid-3079263" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3079263.jpg"></div><h2>  Brooch </h2><p>  Let's try to decorate the brooch with cherry from beads.  To do this, you need a ready-made cherry, some hot glue and a brooch pin.  Heat the glue, drip on the joint between the leaf and petioles.  Allow the glue to solidify for a moment, and then attach the pin.  Let the product dry and use it boldly.  The decoration is very interesting and moving. </p><p>  It's just that you can weave beautiful cherries from beads and even make fashion jewelry out of them. </p>
