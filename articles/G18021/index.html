Thousands of city dwellers and residents of the surrounding areas, attracted by fresh air and the beauty of nature, annually rest on a pond located in the Vyborg district of the Leningrad Region.  Petersburgers planning to spend a weekend on the shore of a reservoir often have a question about how to get there.  Beauty Lake is located near the highway, so you can reach it both by car or by bus from the railway platform of the nearest large settlement - Zelenogorsk. </p>

    <h2>  Historical background on the origin of the lake </h2><p>  The Karelian Isthmus has a peculiar geological structure.  It is called the country of lakes and granite.  The traces of the activity of the retreating glacier are especially noticeable here.  The direction of its movement is evidenced by deep and long pits, which, after the ice melts, are filled with water.  Such glacial lakes include Beauty - an extremely picturesque body of water with clear, clear water. </p><h2>  Why is it called that? </h2><p>  The official name that Lake Beauty bears is Big Simaginskoe Lake.  It, obviously, came from the nearby village of Simagino, named after Sergeant Simagin NP, who fought and died near the village during the Great Patriotic War.  Closer to the village is a small Simaginskoe lake.  In the south-east of Simagino, the Sestra River flows - one of the largest on the Karelian Isthmus.  The Soviet-Finnish border passed along it from 1918 to 1939.  The appearance of the name "Beauty" is not entirely clear.  Either the locals began to call the lake and the name stuck, or is it a translation of the former Finnish name "Kaukj√§rvi" (Beautiful Lake). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Description of the reservoir and its environs </h2><p>  Beauty is a lake (the photo can be seen on this page), which stretches for almost 3 km from the north-west to the southeast, its width is on average a little more than a kilometer.  The maximum depth is 19 m. The bottom is flat, sandy.  The eastern coast is steep, steep, overgrown with pine trees whose roots keep sandy cliffs from shedding.  The forest surrounding the lake is very picturesque, with prevailing conifers such as pine and spruce.  The air here is fragrant, healthy and conducive to a pleasant rest.  <span>The forests of the Karelian</span> Isthmus are rich in blueberries and mushrooms. </p>

    <p>  From the south-west side the <span>coast is gentle,</span> mostly sandy, with backwaters.  The western side is especially attractive for vacationers, as there is a sandy beach and not very deep.  From the north, the Yuli-Yoki River (Upper River) flows into the lake, in the west flows Ala-Yoki (Lower River), which goes to the Gulf of Finland.  The process of mixing water in the lake is not very active, due to which the upper layers during the summer period can warm up to 23 ¬∞ C, while at a depth of 8-10 m the temperature does not rise above 15 ¬∞ C. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Nearby facilities </h2><p>  Not far from the lake is the cottage village Ilyichevo (formerly Yalkala).  Here is the house-museum of V.I.  Lenin.  In August 1917, he lived for several days in the house of the former St. Petersburg foundry worker P.G.  Parviainen before leaving for Finland.  A museum of the history of the people of the Karelian Isthmus with an exposition devoted to the Winter War of 1939-1940 is also open for visitors. </p><p>  In the village there is a children's recreation camp "Spark".  The camp on the lake has its own fenced beach.  Parents of vacationing children well know how to get there.  Beauty Lake is just 7 km from Zelenogorsk Train Station. </p>

    <p>  Since 1947, the main experimental base of the State Hydrological Institute has been operating in Ilyichevo.  A comprehensive study of natural waters takes place here, field studies are conducted. </p><p>  Near the village surrounded by a <span>pine forest</span> is a resort hotel.  Currently, the shores of the lake are being actively built up; summer cottages are being created. </p><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  Despite the changes, the lake is very popular with both the local population and the residents of St. Petersburg.  Today, Beauty Lake, the most diverse reviews about it, is one of the most visited in the summer.  Since the swimming season in the reservoirs of the Karelian Isthmus is no more than two months (from late July to late August), everyone is in a hurry to have time to enjoy cool water and clean air.  According to many, the lake has lost its charm due to the active construction on its shores.  Some complain that it is difficult to find a free place on the beach.  Vacationers leave behind a lot of garbage, pollute the beach.  But this is not a claim to the lake, but to the people.  But mostly visitors note positive aspects: a sandy beach, clean warm water off the coast, beautiful nature. </p><h2>  Fishing and winter activities </h2><p>  The pond also causes interest among fans to sit with a fishing rod.  Beauty Lake, reviews of which from experienced fishermen are very tempting, is replete with fish.  Here you can find perch, roach, bream, pike and even zander.  Fishermen here argue that at a time you can catch 5-7 kg of any fish of different sizes.  You can catch both fishing rod and spinning.  The lake is also popular with winter fishing enthusiasts. </p>

    <p>  Attracts a reservoir of diving enthusiasts.  The water in the lake is clean and clear, although at a depth it is very cold. </p><p>  In winter, the lake is also not deprived of the attention of vacationers.  In the resort village located on the lake, residents are offered to use sports equipment: skiing, ice skating, <span>Finnish sledding.</span>  There is a Finnish bath, after which it is pleasant to plunge into an ice-hole with ice-cold crystal water. </p><h2>  We decide how to get there: Lake Beauty is waiting for us </h2><p>  Getting to Big Simaginsky Lake is easy.  Zelenogorsk highway runs very close to the east coast.  By car, you can drive to the lake both from Zelenogorsk and from <span>Vyborg highway.</span>  Busy routes are nearby: A120 (Kirovsk - Bolshaya Izhora), A122 (St. Petersburg - Pargolovo - Ogony - Tolokonnikovo) and M10 Scandinavia (St. Petersburg - Vyborg).  It takes about 30-40 minutes to go from the Ring Road, but this does not take into account traffic jams that often occur in the summer on weekends.  Cars are usually left on the side of the highway, a little more than 100 m to go to the lake. To get to Ilyichevo, you need to turn off the highway onto a dirt road near the sign "Museum of Yalkal". </p><p>  If you take the Beauty Lake by train, Zelenogorsk will be the ultimate travel station.  Drive from <span>Finland Station a</span> little over 50 minutes.  A lot of buses go from the railway platform to the lake (numbers 404, 409, 410, 415, 552).  You need to get off at the "Road to Illichyovo" stop, or, as it is also called, "Lake Beauty".  You can get from the city by minibus.  Minibus No. 305 leaves from the metro station "Staraya Derevnya", and No. 400 from the Finland Station. </p>
