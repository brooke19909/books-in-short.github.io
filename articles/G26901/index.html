    <p>  Megafon offered it to its customers more than 5 years ago, but today it does not lose its relevance.  Thanks to it, you can transfer part of your money to the account of another Megafon subscriber.  You do not need to search for a terminal or have Internet access.  All that is needed is a mobile phone and some money in the account.  Moreover, the service does not need to be connected.  In order for the funds to be transferred to the account of another subscriber, the combination * 133 * transfer amount * subscriber number # is dialed.  As soon as the recipient receives a mobile transfer, Megafon will notify the sender via SMS. </p><p>  Of course, this is very convenient for both subscribers.  For each such transfer, a small amount will be debited from the sender‚Äôs account - 5 rubles.  In addition, "Mobile Transfer" has some features that are worth knowing in advance.  The amount transferred to the account of another Megafon subscriber can be from 10 to 150 rubles.  There can be no more than 10 such transfers per day and no more than once every 5 minutes.  In addition, after the transfer, at least 10 rubles should remain on the sender's account.  And the last: only individuals with a prepaid payment system can use the service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mobile Transfer" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15224/233525.jpg" width="450"></div>  But all this is insignificant in comparison with the ability to fulfill a person‚Äôs request at any time of the day and in any place.  With this opportunity, many quickly forget about the limitations of the Mobile Transfer service.  "Megaphone" for this and developed it.  True, one limitation worried subscribers for a long time.  It was possible to replenish in this way only the account of customers of the same cellular company.  But today you can <span>transfer money</span> to the phone of another network.

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

    <p>  In this case, however, there are some features in the translation.  Not a fixed amount is already being charged for it, but a commission of 2.5 to 7.5%, depending on the operator.  The amount of payment can already be from 1 to 5,000 rubles, per day no more than 15,000 rubles.  For the rest, you can also carry out "Mobile Transfer".  "Megaphone" does not even restrict the rules of dialing.  It can start with the number 7 or 8, or it can be without a prefix at all. </p><p>  This service is thought out to the smallest detail, and today it is difficult for subscribers to find fault with it.  True, sometimes it happens that, when making a money transfer, you can specify the wrong recipient number.  In this case, many believe that you can say goodbye to this money.  Since the check is not on hand.  However, this is not entirely true.  If you ask for help before the end of this month in the office with a passport, you can transfer the money back to your account. </p><p>  It is probably hard to find a more thoughtful service than this.  However, hundreds of employees improve the work of Megafon every day.  The services that they will offer tomorrow to their subscribers can exceed all expectations.  Perhaps soon it will be possible to send transfers to cell phones around the world. </p>
