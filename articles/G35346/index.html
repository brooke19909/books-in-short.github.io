  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Two-tone patterns with knitting patterns. Simple and lazy patterns.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The easiest way to knit a beautiful, bright and fashionable thing without mastering the complicated knitting techniques is to learn how to knit simple two-color patterns with knitting needles according to the patterns.  Schemes in this case are an elementary combination of colors among themselves, without fanciful knotting of drawings.  The pattern is obtained through the use of two or more colors of yarn. </p><h2>  <span>Two-tone</span> knitting <span>patterns</span> : patterns for children's things </h2><p>  Children's things differ from adults not only in size, but also in greater brightness and expressiveness of colors.  The combination that the child will happily wear is often unacceptable to an adult.  Children love catchy, vibrant and contrasting colors, while adults use them for detail and to give the image a special sound. </p><p>  Consider the simplest options for two-color knitting: </p><ul><li>  The alternation of colors.  You can change the color of the yarn, breaking it into even and odd rows.  However, the ‚Äúbanding‚Äù may look boring, and in order to diversify the thing a bit, you can remove the loop from time to time without knitting it, and thus the pattern will ‚Äúcreep‚Äù up and down a bit, as if layering on the previous rad and / or wedging in the subsequent. </li><li>  You can add the offset of the vertical color rows, for example, knitting in the first row 1,2, 5, 6, 9, 10, in the second 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, in the third 3, 4, 7, 8, 11 , 12 loops respectively.  Thus, we get diagonal stripes, such as a diagonal vest. </li><li>  For children's hats, mittens, leggings, sweaters, a pattern with crossed loops is suitable.  Front loops alternate through each other, and a relatively dense, embossed canvas is obtained.  The color of the thread changes every 2 rows.  Odd vertical loops are double crochets, and even alternate <span>front crossed loops: the loop is</span> knitted either behind the back wall, or in a single crochet from the previous row. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="oknit.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch pattern" class="if uuid-2237808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69973/2237808.jpg"></div><h2>  Lazy two-color knitting patterns: diagrams and description </h2><p>  False ornament, lazy ornament, lazy jacquard - these are all simple lazy patterns.  They are called so because to use them you do not need to have rich experience and a high level of skill.  Knitting with such patterns allows you to spend an order of magnitude less time in the manufacture of the product, in contrast to knitting in the usual, often more complex ways.  The peculiarity of creating lazy patterns is that there is no color change inside the knitted row, and the introduction of a new color each time occurs at the beginning of the knitting of the row.  The lazy pattern is knitted in two rows in the same color, however, the correct alternation of the removed elongated loops creates a unique beauty.  This type of knitting is preferable for beginner needlewomen, because it avoids frequent mistakes: a tightened fabric, uneven loops that are obtained when knitting classic patterns, where the color of the thread changes inside the row. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to knit lazy patterns?  Basic rules and features: </p><ul><li>  As mentioned above, the most important rule is to knit two rows (front and back) with one color of thread, you need to change it at the end of the second row. </li><li>  In the front rows (they are always odd in the diagrams) when removing the loops, the thread remains FOR work and, accordingly, in even rows, the thread passes before work.  This allows you to leave all the broaches on the wrong side. </li><li>  In the wrong rows, the loops are knitted according to the pattern, most often leaving them wrong (but in some patterns there may also be front loops on the wrong side), while the removed loops are simply thrown over, they are not knitted. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="sozdavaisam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lazy loop pattern" class="if uuid-2245528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69973/2245528.jpg"></div><p>  The pattern for this pattern: </p><div class="photo" data-original="sozdavaisam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pattern" class="if uuid-2245531" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69973/2245531.jpg"></div><h2>  Sophisticated two-tone knitting patterns </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sozdavaisam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern with scheme" class="if uuid-2243511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69973/2243511.jpg"></div><p>  When knitting <span>two-color patterns with</span> knitting <span>needles, the patterns and description</span> are of great importance, especially when it comes to cunning interweaving of threads in the work.  When creating things for adults, small drawings cause unnecessary eye strain and look variegated, so for large things it is better to use two-color patterns with knitting needles (the diagrams are presented in the article).  It is interesting, in our opinion, that a large lattice in the form of rhombuses looks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  In the example, white and dark green yarn were used, pattern repeat - 10 loops.  The inner half of the rhombus is knitted with white yarn from 3 facial loops, then 4 facial loops in dark green, and again 3 facial white. </li><li>  The next row (odd) is knitted according to the same pattern.  Three front loops are white, 4 loops cross to the left, while 2 loops of dark green yarn must be removed to an additional knitting needle, leaving them personal, the next 2 knit personal, remove the remaining loops on the additional knitting needle and knit them personal, then knit three more loops facial yarn in white.  Thus, with the help of crosses performed either to the right or to the left, a pattern is formed. </li></ul><p>  Far from always drawing, which according to the scheme looks strictly geometric, appears on the canvas in the same way.  This must be taken into account when forming a pattern, if you create it yourself.  The height of the loop and its length may vary, so be sure to knit a simple square in front of each product with facial loops and calculate how many loops per 10 cm of canvas vertically and horizontally. </p><p>  For example, in this pattern, the alternation of color according to the scheme looks clear, but the canvas is completely different from the one on the scheme. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sozdavaisam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Diagonal pattern" class="if uuid-2243539" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69973/2243539.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting schemes </h2><p>  And a little more, finally, two-color <span>knitting patterns.</span>  Schemes and samples for clarity, for example, three-dimensional interweaving of threads.  Pleasant discreet patterns for suits, sweaters, skirts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vjazanie.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="options for patterns. schemes." class="if uuid-2239128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69973/2239128.jpg"></div><p>  False jacquard (see diagram) is noteworthy in that it knits according to the principle of removed loops, however, the pattern is more like jacquard knitting.  A few more options with schemes: </p><div class="photo" data-original="vjazanie.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="options for patterns with schemes" class="if uuid-2239130" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69973/2239130.jpg"></div><p>  Easy and unusual creativity! </p>
