It is absolutely not difficult to solve this problem - just go to the store and purchase several containers, an organizer or baskets of various sizes and shades. </p><p>  But you can buy materials and make such devices yourself, for example, handmade do-it-yourself baskets made of rope will bring an atmosphere of coziness and comfort to the house. </p><h2>  Twine Product </h2><p>  In order to master the weaving of baskets from a rope with your own hands, you need to practice with simple material.  To do this, stock up on: </p><ul><li>  thick cord, twine; </li><li>  glue gun; </li><li>  cardboard box (ideal paper covers for offices); </li><li>  long wooden or plastic skewers; </li><li>  double-sided tape; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  decoration elements - ribbons, braid. </li></ul><p>  So, to make a basket of rope or twine with your own hands at the beginning of work, you need to build its bottom: from the cover of the box of the right size, cut the edges, leaving no more than five centimeters. </p><p>  A small basket measuring 25 * 19 * 18 cm will need about 35 m of cord 0.5 cm thick. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="work material" class="if uuid-3119822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3119822.jpg"></div><p>  Using adhesive tape at an equal distance from each other (enough 1.5 cm), the skewers are attached.  Their number must be odd. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For greater reliability of fastening, the adhesive tape must first be glued to the inner side of the walls, then the protective layer should be separated.  Then fix all the skewers in order on a sticky surface, and glue on top with a second layer. </p><p>  Having finished with the preparation of the walls, proceed to the design of the bottom.  It can be decorated with fabric, paper, color cardboard. </p><p>  In order to start weaving, it is necessary to stick the tip of the rope inside the base, best in the corner.  Now, very tightly, trying to leave gaps, they lead the cord between the skewers.  Do not tighten it - this can lead to a warp, and subsequently to the destruction of the base. </p><p>  In this way they move in a circle and up to the end of the sticks.  If their length turned out to be unequal, then the deficiency is corrected with the help of nippers. </p><p>  The upper edge is glued with a cord, not weaving it, but simply laying on skewers from above. </p><p>  The walls are ready, it remains to draw up a cardboard base.  To do this, wrap the box with the same cord, tightly stacking the coils and fixing them with glue. </p><p>  At the end of the work, all the ends of the twine are cut off.  Then treated with a fixing composition. </p><h2>  Rope item </h2><p>  Such a device is necessary in every apartment.  In addition to interior decoration, she will become an excellent assistant in maintaining the house in order and cleanliness. </p><p>  To make a laundry basket with your own hands from a rope, you need to prepare: </p><ul><li>  clothesline; </li><li>  knitting yarn; </li><li>  glue gun; </li><li>  darn needle or crochet hook. </li></ul><p>  The work begins as follows.  The end of the clothesline is wrapped with yarn and knotted.  Now they begin to form a flat bottom, gradually wrapping the material and fixing it with glue.  Additionally, each turn is fixed with yarn, gently pulling it with a hook. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Upon reaching the required diameter of the bottom, similarly continue to move up. </p><p>  In the upper part of the basket, you can build handles, which are also wrapped with colored threads for gluing and glued. </p><p>  This is how you can make a simple basket from a rope with your own hands. </p><p>  In another embodiment, this method is used using any basis, for example, a bucket.  A bottom is also formed here, and then a shape is placed on it and the sides of the basket are already built on it by gluing the turns to each other. </p><p>  After complete drying, the form is removed, and the finished product is decorated and used for its intended purpose. </p><h2>  Crocheted basket </h2><p>  For this case, take the cord softer than a regular clothesline.  It can be a polyester material with a thickness of 5-7 mm.  Crochet No. 5-6, best of metal, as the plastic may not withstand such a load. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makemydaycreative.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted basket" class="if uuid-3119815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3119815.jpg"></div><p>  Also need yarn - not very thick, cotton. </p><p>  Knitting goes from the center of the bottom in a circle.  First, knit three loops on the cord.  Then they wrap it and form a flat spiral, gradually adding the number of loops.  Work continues until the bottom of the required diameter is obtained, after which they stop making increases and knit one new column in one column of the previous row.  Actions are carried out until the required height is reached.  Fasten the thread, and cut the cord.  For reliability it is possible to strengthen with glue. </p><h2>  Plastic basket </h2><p>  But a very beautiful and stylish container is very easy to create from a completely unexpected object.  This is an ordinary plastic bin. </p><p>  For convenience, it must be turned over.  The rope is wound from the top edge, gently fixed with glue.  Thus, very tightly stacking the turns, we move to the bottom.  Here the tip of the cord sticks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hgtv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="plastic bucket basket" class="if uuid-3119812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3119812.jpg"></div><p>  The hue of the product depends only on the imagination of the master.  You can choose two or more colors that match the tone of the interior of a room. </p><p>  The main advantage of self-made <span>rope baskets</span> is the versatility factor.  They also look great in the bathroom, as linen containers, and also fit perfectly into the interior of a children's room like toy baskets. </p><p>  It remains only to choose the right color for the material, and you get a design capacity for various things. </p>
