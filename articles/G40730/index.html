You can explain what constitutes an overdraft at Sberbank using this example: on a plastic card, there is a sum of money in the amount of 1,000 rubles, and the cost of the goods that you need to purchase in the store is 1,400 rubles.  The client of this bank can pay with his card or withdraw 1400 rubles and buy the desired product if he is able to use the "overdraft" service. </p><p>  The bottom line is that this client takes a small loan from a financial institution at interest, which he agrees to repay over a period of time. </p><p>  This service can be connected to a debit card (in certain cases, to a credit card).  It can be used by owners of all gold, classic, platinum, youth and premium plastic cards that are connected to MasterCard or Visa payment systems.  Many are interested in how to disable the overdraft at Sberbank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rueconomics.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="disable overdraft" class="if uuid-3128057" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128057.jpg"></div><h2>  Who can use the service? </h2><p>  At the time of introduction of the overdraft service, it was available exclusively to legal entities.  It was introduced in order to ensure a constant flow of financial turnover of companies that, in the absence of money in the account, could currently use borrowed money, after which, when replenishing the balance of the account, the required amount of money was automatically debited. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Under the terms of the bank, when using an overdraft, a banking organization has the right to direct withdrawal of funds from its customer‚Äôs card in order to repay the debt.  This means that money is debited automatically, regardless of the desire or unwillingness of the owner of the funds. </p><p>  Today, overdraft is available not only to legal entities, but also to individuals.  Depending on the specific situation, this service is connected to the plastic card automatically, or it can be done by submitting a written application from its holder. </p><p>  The overdraft limit is determined by the bank individually for each client on the basis of information received about him (income, regularity of cash turnover on the card, etc.). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newsbtc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable overdraft on a sberbank card" class="if uuid-3128031" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128031.jpg"></div><p>  The sum of money for legal entities is from 100 thousand to 300 thousand rubles, and for individuals - from 1000 to 30 000 rubles.  The interest rate is 18% per annum for a ruble account, 16% if the account is foreign currency. </p><p>  Many customers are interested in whether it is possible to disable the overdraft at Sberbank or whether the service is temporary. </p><p>  Terms of its provision - 1 year.  That is, during this period, the card holder may from time to time use overdraft funds.  The debt repayment period is 30 days.  Over the course of a month, the money used with the overdraft service must be fully returned to the card.  In cases of exceeding the restrictive amount or delay in returning funds, the amount of debt shall be calculated at the rate of 33% for the currency account, and 36% for the ruble account. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How to disable the overdraft on the Sberbank card, it is important to find out in advance. </p><h2>  The difference between overdraft and credit </h2><p>  The overdraft service is similar in certain respects to lending, but there are significant differences.  The first is set for both credit and debit cards, but most often the owners of the latest settlement accounts use it.  The main difference between this service and a loan is that overdraft limits are significantly lower than for lending services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shorelinecards.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank overdraft for individuals disable" class="if uuid-3128037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128037.jpg"></div><p>  Access to overdraft is much easier than obtaining a loan, and the conditions here are the most loyal.  The interest rate for the use of borrowed funds is 18%.  Repayment is mandatory within 30 days, otherwise certain sanctions will apply.  Repayment of the loan for the service should be in full, and not in parts, as when using credit funds. </p><p>  In case of violation of the terms of use and repayment of the debt, recalculation is carried out at an increased interest rate: 36%, moreover, it begins to operate from the first day of the use of funds, and not from the day the delay arises. </p><h2>  Overdraft on a salary card </h2><p>  This banking institution willingly offers all holders of these cards the opportunity to use financial resources using the overdraft service, since they are considered trustworthy customers with reliable solvency, since the monthly receipt of funds on the card guarantees timely payment of debts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In such a case, the bank sets overdraft limits based on the amount of cash receipts.  In most cases, Sberbank sets a limit of half the salary of its customer using this card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.barclays.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable overdraft sberbank" class="if uuid-3128028" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128028.jpg"></div><p>  Upon receipt of a salary and an advance on the card, the payment is debited to pay off the overdraft debt. </p><p>  If you do not want to use this service, it is useful to know how to disable the overdraft in Sberbank on a salary card.  One option is to call the facility hotline. </p><h2>  Credit card overdraft </h2><p>  The appropriateness of applying an overdraft on credit cards is determined by each client independently, since money at interest is borrowed from the bank, however, the provision of this service is possible.  There are various cases and the client may always need money urgently, and the credit limit has been exhausted, and it often happens that there is simply nowhere to get it from.  In such a case, an overdraft on a credit card allows the user to get out of a quandary. </p><h2>  Confirmation of solvency </h2><p>  For credit card holders, this service is provided only upon confirmation of their solvency.  Positive decisions of the bank in this case are also affected by confirmed additional sources of income, the presence of other debit cards or a valid debit account, which is considered a guarantee of a refund. </p><h2>  Service Design </h2><p>  To apply for an overdraft on a Sberbank card, it is enough to have a debit card (if it concerns individuals) or a current account (when applying for a legal entity).  Based on the information about the cash flows on the account or card, as well as other documents provided that confirm the solvency of the client, the banking organization decides on the size of the cash limit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to disable the overdraft of Sberbank" class="if uuid-3128030" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128030.jpg"></div><p>  An individual can apply for an overdraft upon receipt of a card.  To do this, in the ‚ÄúOverdraft / Desired Limit Size‚Äù column of the contract, check the box, indicate the required amount and submit an application.  If a client has been using a debit card for a long time, and has thought about connecting to this service only now, you can visit a bank branch and issue a corresponding application.  In addition, you will need to provide a passport and a document that can confirm the amount of income (most often it is a 2-NDFL certificate for the last 6 months from the place of work). </p><p>  You can also make a service through Sberbank Online, however, this method is not available to individuals, it can only be used by corporate clients. </p><h2>  How to disable overdraft at Sberbank? </h2><p>  The service has some specifics and is not always useful and understandable to holders of different cards of Sberbank.  Some people may not resist the temptation to spend all available money, others experience discomfort when analyzing their account (with an approved limit on the available amount, indicate a figure taking into account the funds that are provided for use by overdraft), and still others have fallen into unpleasant situations due to incomplete understanding of this system.  Therefore, many customers are interested in the question of how to disable overdraft for individuals at Sberbank? </p><p>  Firstly, it is necessary to think things over and decide if there is a need to draw up this service when receiving a debit card.  At this moment, the easiest way to refuse the service is by putting ‚Äú0‚Äù in the column where the amount of the overdraft restriction is indicated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nsb.lk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable salary card overdraft sberbank" class="if uuid-3128033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3128033.jpg"></div><p>  How to disable the overdraft on the debit card of Sberbank, every cardholder must know. </p><p>  Secondly, if such a service is already connected, it can be turned off by writing a corresponding application, visiting the branch of Sberbank. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, such a service makes it possible to use funds that the client does not currently have.  After a certain period, they will need to be fully returned to the card.  Overdraft terms are not always beneficial for people.  However, by connecting this service to his card, an individual can always count on some reserve of funds, which is very convenient in unforeseen situations. </p><p>  We examined how to disable the overdraft at Sberbank. </p>
