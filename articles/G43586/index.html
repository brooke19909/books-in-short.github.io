It is famous as a place of budget vacation.  Many vacationers prefer to rent low-cost housing in Ochakovo, and go to the beaches of the so-called Camp Spit.  She got her name because the troops of Suvorov once stood here.  In the middle of the road between the city and the final bus stop on Camp Spit, there is the Attica water park (Ochakov).  What is this place of water entertainment?  How far is it from the sea?  What are the attractions there?  What prices are set in 2017?  And what do visitors say about the Attica amusement park?  Read about it in our article.  The photos below will make the information more accessible. </p>

    <h2>  Where is Attica </h2><p>  Now you will not surprise anyone with water parks.  But usually these water entertainment centers are located in the city.  Therefore, the surroundings surrounding the water park are not the best.  Many slides are indoors, which, you see, is not conducive to a relaxing holiday.  But the water park Ochakova "Attica" is located outside the city.  We have already mentioned that it is located halfway between Ochakov and Camp Spit.  Nearby is the village of Chernomorka.  Therefore, for those who want to visit the water park in the city minibus next to the spit, a special fare is applied - half the fare for Ochakov-Lagernaya.  But in the summer, these buses are very crowded.  Many tourists vacationing in Ochakovo ride a scythe every day, because there is not a firth, but a real sea.  Therefore, in 2017, the water park, in order to attract customers, launched a free bus from the city.  For those who come to Attica with their own transport, there is free parking.  But, reviews warn, it is small, and those who arrived at the opening of the institution can park the car.  It should be said that the water park is located on a cliff above the Black Sea.  And so the views around (especially from the upper slides) are simply dizzying. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Rides </h2><p>  What is Ochakova water park?  Photos of tourists give us an idea of ​​the rides.  There are ten slides in the Attica: six adults and four children6.  The reviews mention that if the parents at the entrance write a receipt of their consent, so that teenagers ride on “serious” attractions, they will be allowed to go there.  Since children's slides in the water park are designed for very little ones.  Not a timid little boy may find it boring there.  Five slides - Bodislide, Kamikaze, Multislide, Freefall and Aquatube tunnels have access to one pool.  The sixth attraction, “Space Hole”, stands apart.  Most reviews mention this latest extreme slide.  This is where it’s really scary!  Despite the small number of attractions - only six for adults, an adrenaline rush is provided to you.  But there are also disadvantages.  Reviews mention the iron steps on the slides.  When there are many people, they become wet and slippery - climb carefully!  In all other respects, visitors were satisfied.  Rescuers are very careful, and if you follow their instructions, nothing bad will happen to you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterpark ochakov photo" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1900708.jpg" width="310"></div>

Everything here is decorated in the ancient Greek style.  The water park positions itself as an alternative to a beach holiday.  There are no storms, and the water is clear, clear, without algae and jellyfish.  Especially for those who want to relax comfortably, a relaxation zone is equipped a little away from the hills.  There is a swimming pool, along the shores of which there are sun loungers, sunbeds under umbrellas and awnings, family pavilions.  There is a jacuzzi and surface jet massage.  There is a bar right in the pool where you can enjoy refreshing drinks and snacks.  Seats for visitors in it are in the water.  For the youngest guests of the water park, in addition to slides, there is a soft-covered playground and a Fidget game room. </p>

    <h2>  Waterpark Ochakova: leisure infrastructure </h2><p>  On the territory of "Attica" you can not only have a snack, but also have a full lunch.  It offers guests a restaurant serving Greek cuisine with a varied menu.  Also, for a fee, you can sing karaoke or play a game of billiards.  The reviews claim that the leisure infrastructure in the water park is excellent.  There are showers, changing rooms, a toilet, a left-luggage office.  The entrance ticket to Ochakovo water park is a magnetic bracelet.  It not only records the turnstile crossing time.  At the checkout you can make any amount of money and pay them in a restaurant, bar or for paid services. </p><h2>  Waterpark Ochakova: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who managed to visit the "Attica" in 2017, assure that prices have remained affordable.
