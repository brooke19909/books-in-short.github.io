Initially, many people started by connecting IPTV to some companies, the most acceptable of which could only be called Beeline.  After many of these companies were reorganized and turned into part of Rostelecom, the entire service was completely rebooted, in particular, they invited a lot of new specialists, acquired the Smartlabs platform, and also developed software that has a single interface for all currently used models of set-top boxes in the IPTV format.  In other words, to launch really high-quality set-top boxes of Rostelecom, we did quite a lot of work, although the refinement of the service to its ideal state was ongoing and does not stop to this day. </p><p>  At the moment, the company makes a big bet on developing a digital television service, and at the same time, in almost all ways, is trying to fight for new users to constantly connect to it.  That is why the prefixes of "Rostelecom" are becoming more widespread.  People try to learn as much as possible about the main features of the service from this company. </p><h2>  SML-482 HD </h2>

    <p>  Technically, such devices can be called the most modern and advanced among all that are used by Rostelecom.  A powerful processor, maximum RAM and a compact enough body are the main advantages of the SML-482 HD, which distinguish the device from the rest.  No special problems were found during the use of this set-top box by users, and they are rarely returned with various malfunctions or defects.  It is worth noting that with the release of this SML-482 HD, the company began to gradually introduce the 3D TV support service and other more modern services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  SML-282 HD Base </h2>

    <p>  This set-top box practically does not differ from the SML-292 Premium model, and the differences between them are quite insignificant.  Outwardly, they are approximately the same - the premium model, which is provided with digital TV, has two USB connectors versus the standard one, but it is worth noting that it represents a slightly more powerful hardware and is distinguished by support for USB-Wi-Fi modules.  A good console with excellent hardware potential.  Also, there is no information that these Rostelecom consoles are characterized by frequent defects or insufficient build quality. </p><h2>  Infomir MAG-250 </h2>

    <p>  For a sufficiently long time, the prefix of this model is widespread.  It is worth noting that many people also connected digital TV to those companies that later joined Rostelecom, but at the same time they already installed such consoles.  If we consider the device from a hardware point of view, it certainly has not yet exhausted itself, and the only gripe that has not been fixed to date is the relatively weak fastening of the power connector, as well as the connector through which the cable is connected to the TV.  In this regard, quite often this TV set-top box by many users simply comes back, since subscribers can accidentally break the connector out of the mount. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  One of the most significant software features of this device is that it can be flashed using the standard firmware from Infomir, and then used as a standard media player with the ability to download a playlist and watch any digital TV channels without any restrictions.  It is worth noting that the initial supply of this equipment was carried out only with software and a remote control from Infomir, but over time, the MAG-250 set-top boxes began to be delivered with the Rostelecom branded remote control. </p><h2>  Infomir MAG-200 </h2>

    <p>  This model began to spread quite widely during the rise of Rostelecom and the spread of digital television throughout the country, but it is worth noting that the model itself is already outdated, so the described devices are practically not issued to subscribers.  At the same time, the set-top box for television can be used to this day, moreover, using the native firmware from Infomir, it allows you to watch any channel of a modern digital TV without any restrictions using a pre-loaded playlist.  The supply of such equipment was carried out exclusively with the Infomir company console, as well as with factory firmware.  Further migration to the Smartlabs platform was already done separately. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  IPTV RT STB HD </h2>

    <p>  If you recall the Infomir MAG-250 device, then almost immediately you can see absolutely identical characteristics with those offered by this Rostelecom prefix.  The instruction, software and remote control in the delivery kit were used by Smartlabs, and recently a rather interesting feature of this equipment has begun to appear - when interacting with certain models of routers from Rostelecom, the device works at least strangely.  In this regard, the prefix must first be pre-flashed, and only then it is already connected to the device.  Otherwise, the Ethernet link on the port to which this device is connected constantly starts to disappear on the router.  It is worth noting that, for example, the standard Sagemcom router does not have such a problem at all, while the rev.1 model is already not showing its best. </p><h2>  IPTV HD 101 </h2>

    <p>  This is the first prefix of Rostelecom 2.0, which began to be delivered in a proprietary box with headphones.  The bundle of this device includes an HDMI cable, but users often note that it does not always work correctly and appropriately.  If we consider the hardware characteristics of this equipment, then they are almost identical to the MAG-250 model, since there is absolutely the same processor, but there is almost twice as much RAM. </p><p>  Prefixes can be attributed to the middle group in terms of quality, and periodically they are delivered to service centers with various nutrition problems.  It is also worth noting that they completely lack an internal portal, as a result of which the company almost immediately switched to connecting the Rostelecom set-top box to the IPTV HD 103 model, which had not only a standard version, but also an additional Wi-Fi and mini option. </p><h2>  Yuxing YX-6916A </h2><p>  Chinese-made model.  These consoles can be called the first of their kind, which were supplied with an additional HDMI cable in the kit, and they were used even when Rostelecom did not acquire the majority of companies in this field.  It is worth noting that the quality of such equipment is quite high, as reliably evidenced by the almost complete absence of returns of such devices with defective products, and they themselves have been working for several years without any complaints or complaints from users. </p><p>  The only problem with these devices is the switch to software from Smartlabs, because of this, it was necessary to perform a complete flashing of the devices manually.  Another known nuisance is watching videos using a USB connector, as there are a number of codecs that this Rostelecom prefix does not support.  The standard for her with this drawback is the lack of sound when trying to view. </p><h2>  Motorolla VIP1003 </h2>

    <p>  This model is supplied in small quantities.  Over time, the company decided that this Rostelecom interactive set-top box would not be used, which is why it is currently being provided to users exclusively from old stocks.  It should be noted that consumers almost never respond badly about the operation of this equipment - it functions clearly and without any problems. </p><h2>  Standard connection option </h2><p>  In the predominant majority of cases, the set-top box is connected via an Ethernet cable, which the installer throws through the apartment to the TV from the router.  The only drawback of such a scheme is that the LAN cable will need to be hidden somewhere, because otherwise people living in this room will stumble on it regularly, but at the same time, the Rostelecom digital set-top box is connected much more reliably by compared with other methods, and is also not so sensitive to all kinds of electromagnetic interference device. </p><h2>  Wi-Fi connection </h2><p>  Several different options can be used here. </p><p>  The first involves the use of specialized wireless media bridges of the Motorolla 2400 model, which are supplied by Rostelecom itself.  The prefix, the password to which can be found on its box, is connected wirelessly, which greatly simplifies operation and makes the use of the device more convenient. </p><p>  The main advantage here can be called that to ensure multicast transmission using such a media bridge, the 5 GHz band is used, which today is practically never used.  It is also worth noting that this model of equipment provides information transfer over rather large, by Wi-Fi standards, distances.  However, there are some disadvantages. </p><p>  The first disadvantage is the considerable cost, which is approximately five thousand rubles for a set of two devices.  The second minus is called by users that the equipment is not so easy to set up, because you need to perform a sufficiently large number of actions to ensure the coupling of two adapters. </p><p>  As an alternative to such a device, you can use cheaper analogues that are produced under the TP-Link and D-Link brands, which will save a total of up to one and a half thousand rubles. </p><p>  The second connection option is the use of a standard Wi-Fi router module, as well as an adapter on the part of the console itself.  The main difficulty here is that the router must have the function of logically separating LAN ports from Wi-Fi.  In addition, you will need to try to choose an adapter model with which the selected Rostelecom HD set-top box can interact normally.  Although here you can go for some trick, and instead of using a standard USB adapter, use a specialized access point that can work in the Wi-Fi client mode. </p><h2>  How to do it? </h2><p>  After you are done with all the settings of your router, you can begin to connect your set-top box through it.  To get started, connect your set-top box and router using a special patch cord.  If you previously specified the port that will be used as a bridge, then in this case you will need to connect the cable to it. </p><p>  Also connect the TV to the HDMI port on the set-top box.  If you have previously tried to connect via any other interfaces, then in this case you will need to additionally configure the TV itself in order to switch it to use HDMI.  In the end, just plug the device into the power supply, and then activate it. </p><p>  The login screen of the device will begin to appear on the TV screen.  After that, you need to specify the username and key that the provider provides you in the process of concluding the contract.  If you forget this information, you can always find a copy of the contract, see the information in your account or check with the technical support operator. </p><p>  After entering all the personal data, it will be possible to use the IP-TV service.  It is worth noting that some special setup of the set-top box you purchased to ensure the normal operation of this service is not required.  It is noteworthy that you almost immediately have the opportunity to use a special system of parental control, integrate all kinds of social networking services, add a variety of weather widgets and a number of other interesting ‚Äúchips‚Äù. </p><h2>  Electrical connection with PowerLine PLC adapters </h2><p>  Such adapters allow the user to forward a full-fledged local network through an electric one.  The cost of a pair of devices in the kit will be approximately two and a half to three thousand rubles.  The main advantage of using this option is that it provides reliable data transfer, comparable to the quality of the cable connection.  A minus of this design is called the fact that in the event of strong power surges in the mains, the adapters can simply burn out, and as a result, the risk of burning out the LAN port on the router or the set-top box already increases. </p><h2>  Can I connect IPTV without a console? </h2><p>  Indeed, at the moment, such an opportunity is provided.  Recently, Rostelecom has begun to actively promote a new service, which provides for subscribing to several packages of TV channels at once, and also allows you to watch digital television directly through a laptop, computer, smartphone or tablet. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the Zabava application is actively being implemented by the company as pre-installed on many TVs from LG, and in the near future it is also planned to additionally integrate it into equipment from manufacturers Philips and Samsung.  However, you need to understand correctly that you won‚Äôt be able to connect digital TV services if you do not rent a set-top box, because the activation passport for this service requires you to rent such a device to the subscriber or make a full purchase. </p><h2>  Is it possible to watch video from a flash drive through a prefix? </h2><p>  For quite a long time, it was customary to save user files contained in a USB flash drive in the cloud, and each subscriber had the opportunity to place files up to 7 GB in size or expand it to 30 GB for a certain amount.  In the end, the company faced such a problem that after downloading the video, additional processing was required in order to later transfer it to the subscriber's screen.  At the same time, transcoders could not cope with such a load, as a result of which the video was processed for several months.  For this reason, the service quickly lost its popularity, a lot of negative reviews appeared about it.  That is why, starting in 2013, consoles allow you to view video files directly from USB drives without any problems. </p><p>  Today, already all consoles can play video from USB-drives, but there are some restrictions on the used video and audio codecs.  So if you encounter such a problem that you have no sound when trying to play a movie, you can just try to squeeze it with some other codec. </p><h2>  How else are you allowed to use such consoles? </h2><p>  This question is often asked by those subscribers who have already disconnected from the services of Rostelecom, but at the same time they bought the set-top box and do not understand how it can be used with benefit.  In fact, it‚Äôs unlikely that it will be possible to apply it anywhere else, and the only exception is the devices from Infomir, as well as RT HD Standart, which, if desired, can be flashed easily using standard software, so that subsequently was to use them as a standard media player. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that some SML-282 and SML-482 models that have the MTS logo come across periodically, and it is likely that in the future it will be possible to use such consoles as devices from this operator, while the remaining models will remain anyway you have a dead weight. </p><h2>  Where can I download the firmware and how to use it? </h2><p>  The prefixes from Rostelecom are configured in such a way that after connecting to the provider's network, the Smartlabs special firmware is automatically downloaded and installed.  At the same time, there is no way for subscribers to download this firmware on their own, and even if you have it in your hands, it‚Äôs unlikely that you can upload it to your device on your own. </p><p>  In order for your TV set-top box with Wi-Fi to receive the necessary firmware, you just need to reboot it.  When you turn it on again, the device will automatically check for new available software versions, and if there are any, an automatic update procedure will be activated.  ,     -      ,       ,             . </p><h2>    ? </h2><p>              HDD,         ,      .       ,        - 2.5‚Äù,        ,         ,        ,        USB-. </p><h2> - </h2><p>   -  ,     ,        "".  2.0            .   :      ,     ""     " ". </p><p>  ,        ,    -     .         ,       ,        . </p><p>          ,         "".            ,            .   ,    ,   . </p>
