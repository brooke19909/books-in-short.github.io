  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The trapezium is a muscle that we do not see in the mirror</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you often visit a regular gym, you will probably agree with me that only a few bodybuilders are engaged in pumping up such a department as a trapeze.  This muscle is usually not visible and, according to the majority of unprofessional bodybuilders, this department is simply obscured by others, for example: biceps, abs, chest.  But this is not so at all!  The trapezium is a muscle no less "ostentatious" than the same biceps, but for this it is also necessary to work with it. </p><p>  If, for example, pay attention to street fighters.  Professionals in this field have a definite sign that they face a very serious and dangerous opponent.  This sign is a powerful scruff, that is, a well-developed trapezium - a muscle.  It is this factor that is an indicator of true strength.  And therefore, most amateur bodybuilders, ignoring this part of the body and doing only exponential, popular, make a very big mistake. </p><p>  The trapezium is a muscle large enough and in area it is almost equal to the rectus abdominis muscle - the press.  How much effort is required to pump up the press and then keep it in order, I think no one needs to explain, everyone knows this today.  So, in relation to this department of effort and labor will have to make no less.  It also requires a very large and well-designed program, and it is best to start doing it right away, along with the rest, because in the future it will not be easy to correct this omission. </p><p>  But the trapezoidal muscle requires a special approach, thin and cautious enough, since its improper irritation can lead to quite serious changes in the functioning of important organs, such as the <span>autonomic nervous system</span> and the brain.  In modern medicine, many interesting discoveries have been made about this.  In particular, if you take into account the peculiarities of its innervation (nervous control), you can get an excellent platform that gives access to almost any brain centers, which allows you to use this muscle for treatment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nevertheless, if you strengthen it correctly, then it will save you from many health problems.  The trapezoidal muscle helps the neck and shoulder girdle to function normally, while it not only is responsible for their functionality, but also perfectly protects against various types of injuries in this area, for example, the cervical vertebrae and clavicle, but this is if this department is sufficiently developed and fortified.  To date, several special exercises have been developed aimed specifically at pumping the trapezoid. </p><p>  Here is one of them.  It is necessary to stand upright, legs apart a little narrower than the width of your shoulders, pick up the barbell, arms wide apart rather wide.  Then you should straighten your back, bringing the shoulder blades together and raise the chin up.  In this case, you should feel a slight tension in the muscles.  The exercise itself consists in raising the shoulders in this position, with a barbell in the hands, while trying to reach their ears as if with them.  It must be remembered that the upward movement should be a jerk, then, fix in this position and slowly lower the shoulders down.  This exercise should not be more than 10 times. </p><p>  For most bodybuilders, the soleus muscle is of high interest.  It is quite thick, wide and is located immediately under the calf.  It runs along the back of the legs, originating from the bones of the lower leg.  The soleus muscle is wider in size than the gastrocnemius, and therefore protrudes on both sides beyond its edges.  And exactly it accounts for  of the total <span>calf muscles.</span> </p><p>  The function of both of them, in general, is the same and consists in lifting our body on socks, and this is not entirely easy, because the muscles have not such a large volume.  Nature, in this case, arranged everything very smartly.  If the knee is in the upright position, then the main load falls on the calf, and if in the bent, then on the soleus, thus transferring the load from one to the other, for example, when running. </p><p>  Many unprofessional bodybuilders do not go into the intricacies of the anatomical structure, and therefore try to swing these muscles, while standing, developing only the calf, and in fact in the general composition they make up only ¬º of the total mass, which means that the training work is only performed by a quarter. </p>
