In their comments, vacationers praised the resort's infrastructure.  Finding comfortable accommodation in Beregovoy is not a problem.  There are options for every taste and budget.  You can save by booking in advance.  The jump in prices usually occurs in July.  During this period, there are very few free rooms. </p><p>  Based on their reviews, a list of the most popular hotels in Beregovoy has been compiled.  The following items are included in the rating: </p><ul><li>  Profitto. </li><li>  "Selina." </li><li>  "Atlas". </li><li>  "Alternative". </li><li>  "Zhechuzhina." </li><li>  Remez. </li><li>  Hummingbird. </li><li>  "Russian courtyard." </li><li>  "On Kurskaya 15". </li><li>  “Arthur’s.” </li><li>  "Equator". </li><li>  "Cat house". </li><li>  "Sail". </li><li>  "Assol". </li><li>  "At Vladimir." </li></ul><h2>  Service </h2><div class="photo" data-original="beregovoe.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Crimea" class="if uuid-2314982" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2314982.jpg"></div><p>  Beregovoy hotels offer a wide range of services: </p><ul><li>  connection to high-speed Internet; </li><li>  BBQ and BBQ facilities; </li><li>  aerarium or sun deck; </li><li>  room cleaning; </li><li>  Appliances; </li><li>  conditioning; </li><li>  bed linen change; </li><li>  issue of beach accessories; </li><li>  the presence of a children's playground; </li><li>  restaurant, cafe on the territory; </li><li>  cable TV; </li><li>  transfer; </li><li>  organization of excursions; </li><li>  outdoor pool, sun loungers, umbrellas; </li><li>  Private parking </li><li>  credit card payment; </li><li>  zone for self-cooking. </li></ul><h2>  Negative moments </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Food in Feodosia" class="if uuid-2314977" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2314977.jpg"></div><p>  Beregovoe is a small village, so the choice of discos and clubs in it is small.  Fans of busy nightlife can be bored.  The neighboring Theodosia comes to the rescue.  Families with young children and older people complain about difficult entry into the sea.  In some places there are large boulders and sharp cobblestones.  During calm, they do not interfere.  But during a period of unrest, they can injure. </p><p>  In calm weather, the water in Beregovoy is clear and transparent.  But the rest of the time the sea is muddy, it contains a suspension of sand and silt.  On rainy days, life in the resort freezes, and the water turns yellow.  The clay washed off the slopes colors the sea.  Two days after precipitation, the water area again becomes clean. </p><h2>  Golden Beach Benefits </h2><p>  Tourists have found a lot of advantages that this small village has, located six kilometers from Feodosia. </p><ul><li>  Firstly, they respond well to the location of the resort.  It is in close proximity to the main attractions of Crimea.  From Beregovoi, sightseeing buses run to Bakhchisaray, Simferopol and Sevastopol. </li><li>  Secondly, travelers appreciated the huge selection of modern and comfortable accommodation.  General options and premium rooms are available.  But air conditioning is not in all rooms.  This is a minus.  When choosing a hotel, be careful.  The description of the hotels indicates the remoteness of the residential property not from the well-maintained beach, but from the sea.  This means that the house may be on a cliff or not have a safe descent to the water. </li><li>  Thirdly, Russians believe that rest in Beregovoy will be cheaper than in other settlements of the southern coast of Crimea.  Prices in local restaurants and cafes are lower than in neighboring Feodosia, and the quality of the dishes is not inferior.  The farmer's market is open on weekends, and in high season, trading is carried out almost every day.  It offers vacationers fresh local fruits and vegetables, berries, seeds and nuts, dairy products.  At the market they buy meat, eggs and fish. </li></ul><h2>  Black Sea </h2><p>  Even in August, the beach is not crowded.  The water in the sea is clean, and jellyfish are rare guests.  For an additional fee, beach chairs and umbrellas are offered on shore.  The entrance to the water is almost flat everywhere.  Exceptions are wild beaches.  The choice of excursion programs is not inferior to the offers of travel agencies of Feodosia.  Passing by the coastal highway allows you to travel along the South Coast by car. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="45.09440559999999" data-lng="35.4339258" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/3/2/1332.png"></div><p>  Vacationers recommend the Golden Beach for the installation of tent camps.  If desired, everyone will find a quiet and secluded place.  Here couples with young children and youth companies can easily get along.  Nobody bothers anyone. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The most popular cafe for vacationers in Beregovoy is Athea.  This is an institution with inexpensive prices and homemade dishes.

They liked the design of the dining room.  They praised the unusual chandeliers, massive furniture made of natural wood. </p><p>  Guests recommend “Sea Divo” salad, lagman with eggplant, natural coffee, hodgepodge with sour cream.

Vacationers liked the food in the eateries and bistros “Sunrise”, “Campari”, “Beach Club 117”, as well as “Pub on Sovetskaya”, “Hops”, “Yellow Fish”, “Salute”, “Mezzanine”. </p><p>  The average check at the institutions of Feodosia is seven hundred rubles.  This amount does not include alcoholic beverages.  The resort's restaurants prepare dishes according to European, Italian, Russian, Ukrainian and even Asian recipes.  Excellent pizza is served in Iveria, Italian Courtyard, Mama Pizza.  You can dine cheaply in the city’s many eateries.
