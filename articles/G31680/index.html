You will need to attach a clip or rubber band to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.probowthehand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="large bow with gold trim" class="if uuid-2793796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2793796.jpg"></div><p>  So you made a big bow from a satin ribbon with your own hands! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hair bows </h2><p>  Elastic band for hairstyles - the most necessary thing for girls.
