It was founded in 1624, and today, according to official figures, about 12 thousand people live in it.  Despite its small size, you can spend an entire day with interest in the city and get acquainted with the sights of Likhoslavl. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="57.1246162" data-lng="35.46144849999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/7/4/5/17745.png"></div><h2>  Museum "Marmalade Tale" </h2><p>  Perhaps in Russia you rarely see such a ‚Äútasty‚Äù attraction as the marmalade museum.  Of all the sights of Likhoslavl, this is perhaps the most popular, because the museum was created on the basis of the production of this delicacy, which was known far beyond the Tver region.  Despite the fact that this dessert is simple in appearance, it needs a special technology for its production. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moscow-i-ya.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marmalade Museum" class="if uuid-3229469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3229469.jpg"></div><p>  Many people have a question: why is the museum called just a "fairy tale", because it was possible to choose a more realistic name?  The fact is that all guests, crossing the threshold, fall into a real fairy tale story.  All study tours are conducted by the characters of Russian folk tales.  Here you can check whether you know all the heroes.  During the tour you will be told about the origin of marmalade, about the methods of its preparation, about its popularity in Russia and in the world.  And of course, you can personally taste several varieties of the freshest marmalade.  And in order to treat your friends or please your family, the museum operates a store that offers a fresh treat at producer prices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="avgusttur.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="marmalade of Likhoslavl" class="if uuid-3229467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3229467.jpg"></div><h2>  Museum of Ceramics </h2><p>  Needless to say, Likhoslavl is the center of pottery production.  Household items, dishes and toys, unique in their design, are admired not only in Russia, but also far beyond its borders.  For several years in a row ceramics from Likhoslavl, a museum and craftsmen became honorary laureates of various exhibitions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tverlife.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Ceramics" class="if uuid-3229470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3229470.jpg"></div><p>  Production has changed several names since its inception, and finally, falling under the patronage of a local industrial plant, it has turned into a unique enterprise, ‚ÄúCrafts‚Äù.  The achievement of local craftsmen was the restoration of technology for glazing pottery.  Now you can buy various red-glazed and black-glazed kitchen utensils and utensils.  Pottery is one of the attractions of Likhoslavl, which you can always delve into yourself and try your hand at production.  Special excursions are held with small workshops on the manufacture of vessels, which can also be decorated independently under the guidance of experienced artists.  Such excursions will appeal to both children and adults. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Railway dispensary </h2><p>  One of the most beautiful and at the same time old buildings of Likhoslavl can be called the former dispensary without hesitation.  The building was erected at the end of the nineteenth century and served as a hospital at the railway station, in which rooms were allocated for medical personnel. </p><p>  The building is beautifully decorated with brown and milky tesa, which at the beginning of the nineteenth century was considered very expensive material.  It, like lace, frames the base of the building.  It is best to come on an excursion here in summer or early fall, when the unique architecture of the building is framed by dense foliage.  Nearby is the Likhoslavl Radiator Plant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="amsmolich.livejournal.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Railway hospital" class="if uuid-3229465" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3229465.jpg"></div><h2>  Pervitinsky Museum of Local Lore </h2><p>  Among the attractions of Likhoslavl, a special place is occupied by the historical and revolutionary museum.  All exhibits were collected by Ivan Vasilievich Zorin, historian, teacher and warrior.  It was under his leadership that the museum was opened in 1981, which Ivan Vasilyevich himself calls a gallery of faces and biographies.  The exposition is dedicated to the heroes of the Great Patriotic War, famous people and merchants living on this earth.  Part of the exposition tells about teachers - graduates of the Tver Teacher‚Äôs Seminary. </p><p>  Several stands in the museum are dedicated to the Hero of the Soviet Union, a native of this land Alexei Sevastyanov, who in 1941 made a ram in the sky above the besieged Leningrad.  This feat inspired hope in all the inhabitants of a hungry city, strengthened courage and resilience.  In 2015, the museum was reopened after a lengthy overhaul. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pervitinsky Museum" class="if uuid-3229471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3229471.jpg"></div><h2>  Temple of the Icon of the Mother of God "Sign" </h2><p>  The temples of Likhoslavl occupy a special position in the entire Tver region.  The church of the Mother of God was started back in 1505, and, according to some reports, the monks kept church records, which, unfortunately, were not preserved, burned in a fire during the Time of Troubles. </p><p>  The church, which we can observe now, began to be built in 1823 by the parishioners themselves.  It took them about twenty years.  In order to beautifully decorate the temple, a brick factory was built nearby, not far from the river.  The temple, in addition to the main hall, has several secondary buildings in which church utensils are stored and a gatehouse is located. </p><p>  The temple is surrounded by a beautiful wrought-iron fence, the inner walls are painted with scenes from the Bible and the faces of the saints, among them Mikhail Tverskoy, Arseniy Tverskoy, Ephraim Novotorzhsky.  But the main wealth of the temple is considered the miraculous icon of the Mother of God "Sign".  There is a beautiful legend that in ancient times, when pestilence began in the village and people died one by one, one of the priests dreamed of the Virgin and said that an icon was stored in one of the churches of Veliky Novgorod.  She had to be transferred to the church on foot.  Then the priest went to Novgorod and brought her on his head.  Once the icon was installed, deaths ceased. </p><h2>  Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary </h2><p>  The secret center of Likhoslavl is the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  Founded in 1887, it seems to concentrate all the city streets that flock to it.  This is a real decoration of the city, the main attraction, which the townspeople are very proud of, because at the beginning of the 19th century it was the city dwellers who built the church exclusively on their own.  The temple was built for forty years! </p><p>  This unique structure and hard times survived.  In 1937, in troubled times, the abbot of the temple was shot by soldiers of the Red Army, the dome was demolished.  Later, the building turned into a city cinema.  It was also used as a parachute tower.  The temple began to be restored in 1989 from surviving old photographs.  Then a new abbot was appointed, and in 2002, after the consecration, the temple again began to delight people with its full-fledged appearance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bankgorodov.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Assumption Temple" class="if uuid-3229473" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3229473.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of the Intercession </h2><p>  The church appeared on the land of the Tver region in the distant 1777 and immediately turned into a unique structure due to the use of the small Karelians who lived on this land in its architecture and decoration of national elements.  It is noteworthy that the prayers did not stop in it even for 240 years thanks to the monks and residents serving there, who consider it their duty to support this good cause. </p>
