Many compare it with a similar one in Sochi, which leads to Krasnaya Polyana.  First of all, it is shorter, but the views that open to tourists are hardly less picturesque. </p><p>  The Olympus cableway in Gelendzhik is a semblance of a funicular.  Only here are open benches with iron stops and a footrest.  From the outside it looks scary enough when people soar over the abyss, without any visible insurance.  In fact, it is almost impossible to get out of the seats, even if you try hard.  The speed is small, no rocking is provided.  Judging by the reviews, even tourists with a fear of heights and those who hit the funicular in bad weather do not refuse to visit again.  Considering the opening views, it is difficult not to forget about all these little things. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cable car park olympic gelendzhik" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1428132.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  Pay attention to the weather. </h2><p>  It is advisable to get acquainted with weather forecasts in advance.  The fact is that the cable car (Olimp Park, Gelendzhik) runs at high altitude.  On a foggy and windy day, pleasure can be spoiled by the fact that visibility will be much worse.  Photos will turn out not so bright, and sharp gusts of wind can frighten even the most daring traveler.  After heavy rain, there may be dampness and haze, due to which visibility deteriorates sharply. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that at altitude it is completely uncomfortable on a cool day, and, conversely, the sun's rays bake in the heat.  Therefore, be sure to stock up on things based on the weather.  Hats with fastening, so as not to be blown away by the wind, umbrellas, sunglasses and warm clothes, try to foresee what you might need from this.  Be sure to choose closed shoes and comfortable clothes, because you do not go to a restaurant, but to a park, where you expect to walk a lot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gelendzhik cableway Olympus photo" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1428131.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Photos with a beautiful view </h2><p>  This is a topical issue for every tourist, since many want to keep a good memory.  It is not surprising, because before you is the dream of a Russian tourist, magnificent Gelendzhik, the Olympus cableway.  A photo taken independently at the height of a bird's flight can be successful and even beautiful, but it is difficult to catch yourself in the frame.  However, a professional photographer works here for these purposes.  He will catch a successful shot in the most beautiful place, and after the approval of the client he will put the photo in a frame and throw it on a USB flash drive.  Houses will only print and put in a prominent place. </p><h2>  Funicular Features </h2><p>  There are two tracks here, so we want to tell you about both.  However, in order not to choose, it is better to ride on one and the other.  First of all, we are interested in the Olympus cableway (Gelendzhik).  Opening hours: from 8:00 to 02:00.  Night trips are an adventure for an amateur, but they are in demand every year.  However, the most beautiful views are here in the morning and evening hours.  They are also good because at this time it is not very hot.  This is important, because on a hot day, traveling under the scorching sun can be a big load, especially if there are health problems. </p><p>  The length of this track is 1140 meters, and it appeared later than the second one, located in the Safari Park.  In Olympus, it runs a little lower, and the journey itself will take less time.  However, both paths will show you stunningly beautiful places of the Markotkh Range. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cableway olympic gelendzhik drive" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1428129.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <h2>  Advantages of the cable car in the Olympus Park </h2><p>  On both tracks, children under 5 years old can ride for free, professional photographs are taken and there are viewing platforms with stunning views.  The Olympus cable car (Gelendzhik), which every tourist must reach, has an advantage primarily in terms of operating time.  The ticket price includes a visit to the amusement park, as well as an excursion.  Finally, the cost of a children's ticket is attractive.  If the child is 5 to 12 years old, you get a ticket for 250 rubles.  For many tourists, the Olympus cable car (Gelendzhik) remained the most beautiful in memory.  Reviews emphasize that even in bad weather, the spectacular views in its spectacle completely overshadowed all the inconvenience.  Although for the first time it can be a little scary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cableway olympic gelendzhik working hours" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1428128.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <h2>  Advantages of the cable car in Safari Park </h2><p>  This track is faster, but longer, so you won‚Äôt win in time.  The track is located on the slope of the ridge, so it will delight you with beautiful views of the park, city and rocks.  However, it is necessary to emphasize the availability of additional service.  For a fee you will be given a warm blanket that will save you from damp and cold above.  Pointers flaunt throughout the length, so you can chart your future route on the ground.  An adult ticket here will be cheaper (700 rubles) than on the second track, and a children's ticket, on the contrary, is more expensive (350).  Finally, in Safari Park, where you will arrive, there is a contact zoo where you can pet animals. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  If you have never rode a cable car, we recommend that you master this attraction.  There will be enough impressions for many years.  So that nothing darkens them, use our recommendations and stock up on clothes, as well as necessary accessories.  It is worth taking water and light snacks with you, as you will definitely not be able to quickly leave the amusement park.  Check your cameras and cameras in advance.  Beautiful views that open while you soar in the sky are worth being captured for a long memory. </p>
