One of the reasons for the fall of large manufacturers can be called the expansion of devices from the Middle Kingdom.  Chinese phone brands occupy an increasing part of the market, and restless manufacturers are actively introducing modern technical equipment, while offering <span>dumping prices</span> that attract both advanced users and not too biased ones. </p><h2>  Main models: the pros and cons of Chinese brands of smartphones </h2><p>  Brands of Chinese Android phones vary widely.  There are both fairly well-known players, and "nameless", who showed the world one or two gadgets.  Not all budget manufacturers take quantity and price.  Well-known brands of Chinese phones have managed to enter the vast global market thanks to the desperate copying of eminent competitors - similar devices at low prices disperse like hotcakes. </p>

    <p>  These devices, of course, have both their pros and cons.  The advantages of such gadgets include their price.  Brands of Chinese phones are independent of retail, they do not need advertising, therefore, having saved on these components, the creators of gadgets save significant funds, which ultimately manifests itself in the form of reduced cost smartphones.  It is clear that this fact will certainly please potential buyers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, the advantages of such devices include their "top" filling.  Chinese brands of mobile phones, despite their commitment to the middle price segment, equip their offspring with the latest technology.  If you see a 10 or 20 core chip anywhere, then this will be a newcomer from China.  Recently, Chinese phone brands can boast of an interesting design: if before all the gadgets from the Middle Kingdom looked like randomly and carelessly collected pieces of plastic, now the creators are increasingly paying attention to the appearance of smartphones.  Often there is the use of more solid materials, such as steel, glass, aluminum, sometimes even wood. </p><p>  Unfortunately, inexpensive gadgets have a number of disadvantages.  First of all, you need to be aware that phones whose price threshold is especially low will not be able to boast of high-quality assembly.  That is, those smartphones that attract less than 3 or 4 thousand rubles, still look like those same faded and cheap plastic Chinese fakes. </p>

    <p>  In addition to low-quality components, you must remember that the software content of such devices leaves much to be desired.  For example, often there is a huge amount of pre-installed, terrible in quality or completely unnecessary software, which is crammed with all the cheap brands of Chinese phones: with changing voice applications, demos of games, "national software" and the like.  The developers do not really care about optimization.  "Android" - the system is finicky and requires a powerful filling or good straightening on the part of the developer in order to ensure proper gadget performance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And finally, even large manufacturers are not averse to deceive their fans.  If your new, inexpensive smartphone has 8 cores, do not be surprised that only 4 are actually active, and a 13 megapixel camera, coupled with interpolation, also falls short of an 8 megapixel photomodule. </p>

    <p>  All that can be advised is to choose those ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù who have already gained a good reputation.  But you need to avoid those who, using the inexperience of users, deceive them.  Actually, more about devices. </p><h2>  Top Chinese premium phone brands </h2><p>  These should certainly include new products from industry giants Meizu and Xiaomi, and it‚Äôs also not a sin to recall the recently released LeEco. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Name </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Meizu Pro 6 </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Xiaomi Mi5 </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  LeEco Le 2 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Display </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  1080 x 1920 (5.2) </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  1080 x 1920 (5.15) </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  1080 x 1920 (5.5) </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  CPU </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  MediaTek Helio X25 </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Snapdragon 820 </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  MediaTek Helio X20 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Memory </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  4 GB RAM, 64 ROM </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  4 GB RAM, 128 ROM </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  3 GB RAM, 32 gb ROM </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Camera </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  21 mp, 5 mp </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  16 mp, 4 mp </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  16 mp, 8 mp </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Price </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  29 000 rub. </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  39 000 rub. </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  ~ 12 000 rub. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  As can be seen from the table, this list contains a device with a very low price.

Such a display is able to recognize the force of pressing.  This feature allows you to use additional parameters and the context menu in the system - quick actions on shortcuts, the ability to preview links in a browser, and much more.  A similar has already been implemented in the iPhone, respectively, we see here a clear borrowing, which, fortunately, everyone has not been paying attention to for a long time, and the competition benefits the buyer. </p>

    <h2>  Xiaomi Mi5 - the best shell for Android </h2><p>  The Chinese brand of Xiaomi phone is primarily known for its software platform.  The phone works with its own shell called MiUI.  She was very positively received by the public, many fell in love with her for excellent visual design, as well as for high-quality optimization.  The smartphone turned out to be quite expensive, mainly due to the fact that the famous Snapdragon is used as the processor, while others did not hesitate to put a newcomer in the form of MediaTek into their inventions. </p><h2>  LeEco Le 2 - Ahead of the Planet </h2><p>  This smartphone surprised by the lack of a headphone jack.  The Chinese have implemented their own audio system, which uses a USB Type-C port, giving the ability to play much higher quality audio using a dedicated DAC, and thanks to the full support for lossless audio formats.  But what do owners of headphones with a standard port say about this?  Most likely, they will not be very happy.  It is unlikely that for the sake of such a novelty people will run to change an existing headset. </p><h2>  Brands of Chinese phones of the middle and low price segment </h2><p>  One of the advantages of modern consumer electronics is the price range. </p><p>  Brands of Chinese phones, the list of which is being filled day after day, is saturated and gadgets are much cheaper.  Their prices are often lower than 10,000 rubles, which, of course, attracts a certain audience who do not want to give a large amount for overpriced technical equipment. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Name </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Wileyfox swift </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Xiaomi Redmi 3 </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Meizu M2 mini </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Display </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  720 x 1280 (5) </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  720 x 1280 (5) </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  720 x 1280 (5) </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  CPU </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Snapdragon 410 </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Snapdragon 616 </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  MediaTek Helio X20 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Memory </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  2 GB RAM, 32 gb ROM </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  2 GB RAM, 16 ROM </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  2 GB RAM, 16 gb ROM </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Camera </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  13 mp, 5 mp </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  13 mp, 5 mp </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  13 mp, 5 mp </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Price </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  7 500 rub. </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  9 800 rub. </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  9 200 rub. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  This is a summary table of the most affordable devices on the market, while at an acceptable level of quality that will not cause unnecessary irritation.  These phones work on proprietary shells (with the exception of Wileyfox), which allows for decent performance.  The table also shows that the brands of Chinese phones have grown to the level of the flagships of past years. </p><h2>  Wileyfox Swift - one of the first powerful sub-brands </h2><p>  When the events related to the dumping of prices for smartphones and the emergence of certain subsidiaries began, Wileyfox was one of the first to appear on the scene.  Amazing value for money impressed everyone without exception.  The device was difficult to order, which caused even greater excitement.  The case of the device is made of plastic, while it looks very presentable.  High performance of the gadget is provided not only by a powerful filling, but also by the platform on which it works, namely CyanogenMod 13. A competent combination of technical and software solutions allowed creating a decent phone of a low price segment. </p>

    <h2>  Xiaomi Redmi 3 - elegant simplicity </h2><p>  This device is a little more powerful, a little more expensive, but at the same time it is somewhat more elegant than competitors, which is beneficial to it.  Users are increasingly paying attention to the exterior of their smartphones.  A stunningly large display provides a gorgeous picture, with maximum viewing angles.  The phone runs on MiUI, a high-performance add-on on top of the Android system.  Xiaomi devices are also pleased with high-quality cameras (they are not the best among the affordable ones, but worthy). </p><h2>  Meizu M2 mini - a powerful kid </h2><p>  So the moment has come when the prefix ‚Äúmini‚Äù receive smartphones with a diagonal of 5 inches.  Yes, indeed, compared to many flagships, a display with such a diagonal already seems small, but not everyone is used to it.  This unit uses Flyme as a software shell.  This is a framework designed specifically for <span>Meizu phones.</span> </p><h2>  Fakes </h2><p>  You can‚Äôt talk about Chinese smartphones without mentioning the huge number of copies with which both the Celestial market and the Russian market are oversaturated.  In fact, you have probably come across an iPhone for 2000 rubles that runs on Android, Vertu, costing less than $ 60 and similar products.  From a distance, such phones look similar, but no matter how you are assured, you just have to touch them and it becomes clear that this is a cheap, low-quality fake.  It is easy not to fall for the trick: you must remember that Vertu and iPhone will never cost from 400 to 4 thousand rubles.  In this case, it would be wiser to take a <span>budget device.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Reviews and conclusions </h2><p>  It should be said that most users perceive Chinese phone brands as a worthy product.  This is not consumer goods - now such gadgets are full-fledged market players.  The quality of budget devices is really surprising; they work and sell well.  In addition, these models are fast, practical and beautiful. </p>

    <p>  Of course, there are those who say that such devices are of poor quality and people make the mistake of buying them.  These are mainly users who are used to flagships or have had negative experiences with acquiring Chinese phones.  As the saying goes, once a time is not necessary - the level of marriage at such manufacturers is higher than that of serious corporations.  But the chance to get a decent device is also great.  After all, not everyone wants to overpay for gigabytes, which may not be useful at all, since many do not spend time playing or using bulky applications. </p><p>  Therefore, the opinions of people are very different: someone thinks that budget gadgets are not worth attention, and someone, on the contrary, is delighted with the new product and is glad that he did not spend money on a more status model.  This largely depends on personal preferences.  Basically, buyers respond positively to their low-cost purchases and the Chinese gadget market is gradually developing.  The user votes in rubles. </p>
