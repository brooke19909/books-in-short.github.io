If you just want to run in and have lunch, have a cup of coffee, then another option is the Pea family cafe.  And the sports bar is a great meeting place for sports lovers.  Here, with a glass of fresh beer and in the company of good friends, you can watch broadcasts of the most important sports battles. </p><p>  The entertainment center also has billiards tables.  But the Cosmic Belaya Dacha considers the bowling game to be its visiting card, as it attracts studying youth, students and even couples with children. </p><h2>  Bowling Club </h2><p>  Cosmic operates the latest bowling with modern equipment, in which all the equipment is provided by the world leaders of the bowling industry.  Thirty tracks of Brunswick production are functioning here, where about 180 people can play simultaneously.  All tracks have special children's sides, which means that even kids can take part in earning points.  The beads rise and prevent the balls from slipping to the side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.2do2go.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bowling alleys" class="if uuid-2647075" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/2647075.jpg"></div><p>  Near each of the tracks is a table for the company, that is, you can combine an exciting game with communication and a snack at the table.  Moreover, during an active game, time flies very quickly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the top there is an illuminated electronic scoreboard that displays the name of each player and the amount of points earned by him.  To visit the bowling "Cosmic Belaya Dacha", you should pre-book the track by phone.  It is convenient that the club has a specialized store where various equipment for bowling is sold. </p><h2>  Billiard room </h2><p>  The shopping and entertainment center provides several billiard tables for fans of this sport.  Among them, seven tables play the Russian pyramid and five play the American pool.  Additional equipment for this game can also be purchased at the Pro-shop.  They come here to play for the soul, and arrange friendly championships.  A cozy atmosphere and professional lighting only add advantages.

Bowling and billiards are already classified as classic types of pastime, and virtual reality allows you to fully plunge into your favorite movie or cartoon.  Previously, it was fantastic, but now the child can hit the road with the cartoon characters, wearing a special helmet and picking up the controllers.  All this was made possible thanks to the development of the latest VR information technology. </p><p>  If the kid has a desire to help Mishka find the spoiled Masha, decrease to the size of Fixiks or become one of the Smeshariks, in Cinema VR this is done without problems.  In games designed for virtual reality, all the characters are the same as in popular cartoons.  It is noteworthy that, while playing, the child can not only communicate with famous characters, but also learns to do something new, solve puzzles and puzzles, and interact with teammates on a team. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.in-sports.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cafes and restaurants" class="if uuid-2647064" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/2647064.jpg"></div><h2>  Cinema VR Specifics </h2><p>  Games in virtual reality have their own characteristics: </p><ul><li>  The play area is completely safe for children. </li><li>  You can play based on the most fun animated films. </li><li>  The game is constantly monitored by the club administrators. </li><li>  The possibility of free movement inside the game. </li><li>  Up to four people can participate at a time. </li><li>  A great option to celebrate a birthday or anniversary. </li></ul><h2>  Rides </h2><p>  The play area for children and adolescents is equipped with many machines and attractions in the Cosmic RC (bowling).
