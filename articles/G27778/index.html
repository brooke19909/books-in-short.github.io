    <p>  Modern England, conservative and having a long history, <br>  strict and prim, always hospitably welcomes curious tourists.  She throws open the doors, favorably demonstrating all her beauty, impresses with the gloomy freedoms of Westminster Abbey, grants a feeling of weightlessness when looking at the rising walls of <span>Buckingham Palace,</span> admires the strict restraint of the Tower Fortress, invites you to meet Big Ben to comprehend all the secrets of the times.  Among all these attractions, a special place is occupied by an oasis of tranquility and solitude - Hyde Park in London. </p><h2>  Hyde Park and the Royal Ones </h2><p>  It is hard to imagine England without this worldwide attraction, open to visitors 19 hours a day.  But once the beloved Hyde Park, whose photos are striking in its beauty and majesty, simply did not exist.  This territory belonged to <span>Westminster Abbey.</span>  The history of the now popular park began in 1536.  This cultural complex owes its existence to King Henry VIII.  The following royal people made a special contribution to the development of the national park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <ol><li>  <span>Henry VIII.</span>  It was he who took Hyde's possession from the abbey and turned it into a hunting ground.  This was in the first half of the 16th century. </li><li>  In the XVII century, <span>King James</span> I decided to open the park, which at that time was the largest of all existing, for the public. </li><li>  Charles II made sure that this place became one of the most popular in London.  The promenade along the shady alleys, and especially along the Rotten Row road, has become a favorite pastime of the English aristocracy. </li><li>  Under Queen Caroline Hyde Park in London lost part of its territory - Kensington Gardens were separated from it. </li></ol><h2>  Charming park today </h2><p>  Today, this open-air museum continues to amaze and delight its curious public with its beauties.  Hyde Park in London can amaze and delight.  What are jumping squirrels that are not at all afraid of human presence?  And how beautifully the lake curved by a snake, dividing the famous square into 2 parts.  The park's doors are open daily from 5 a.m. to 12 a.m.  Moreover, entry into it is absolutely free. </p><p>  The scale of this wonderful corner of nature is amazing.  It spreads over an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 140 hectares.  This is more than the famous Principality of Monaco, but less than the huge Central Park in New York. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sights of the English miracle </h2>

    <p>  Hyde Park <span>in London</span> has a lot of unique compositions.  If you are already in this wonderful corner, be sure to pay attention to: </p><ul><li>  Historic Sites on Waterloo Events, <br>  which took place in 1815.  This is due to the defeat of Napoleon.  After all, it was the English Duke of Wellington who put an end to the career of the French conqueror.  In this regard, you can admire the Wellington Arch or freeze in admiration for the statue of Achilles.  And those for whom history and relaxation are inextricably linked, can visit the Wellington Museum, where you will find interesting facts and admire the exhibits. </li><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hyde Park Pictures" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/365675.jpg?1396480809516" width="200"></div>  Pay attention to the unusual burial, which is called a cemetery for animals.  Its founder was the Duke of Cambridge.  He was the first to bury his wife's beloved dog there.  Today, the cemetery has about 300 graves of our smaller brothers.  This is another curious corner that Hyde Park has in London.  Photos can give a basic idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis place.  It‚Äôs difficult to get there, as the cemetery‚Äôs doors open only once a year.  On all other days it is closed to visitors. </li><li>  They say England is a country of liberals.  This is probably the case.  Confirmation of reputation is the corner of the speaker.  Back in 1872, one of the ministers proposed to establish a platform where the British could openly express their thoughts, including about royal power. <br>  Since then, this place has been a symbol of freedom of speech, an opportunity to prove one‚Äôs beliefs without fear of anything. </li></ul><h2>  What to do in the famous park </h2><p>  If you decide to visit Hyde Park in London, you can be calm: it will definitely not be boring. </p><ul><li>  Lake Serpentine will joyfully open its arms to you.  There you can fish and even swim.  But even more unusual sensations will give a ride on a boat.  It can always be rented.  Please note that you have a unique opportunity to go on a mini-cruise on the lake on a ship that is fully powered by solar energy.  This is one of the first English models.  Its capacity is up to 40 people on board. </li><li>  The special Rotten Row is designed for horse riding.  In general, if you like horses, you definitely need to visit this amazing place.  There is also a racing circle, and a riding school. </li><li>  For sports fans, too, have their own surprises.  Feel free to head to its southern part.  There you will find sports fields for rugby, softball, cricket.  Or head west, where you will be greeted by a sports center with tennis courts and bowling alleys. </li><li>  If you are lucky enough to get into the park on a public holiday, you will experience a whole waterfall of positive emotions.  Red days in the calendar of England are celebrated with special chic.  Celebrations, concerts, shows are held.  You can also see a salute.  Royal equestrian artillerymen give it at noon, and an hour later a response volley is heard in the Tower.  Hyde Park is amazing and beautiful on such days.  Pictures cannot convey all its beauty and charms.  They can only hint at this and cause a desire to visit the miracle square. </li></ul>
