    <p>  As befits a Muslim ruler, the sultan had many wives and concubines.  Any Russian-speaking reader knows the name of Roksolana, a slave-concubine, who became the ruler‚Äôs beloved wife and an important person in the management of public affairs.  And thanks to the incredible popularity of the series ‚ÄúThe Magnificent Century‚Äù, the intrigues of the Sultan‚Äôs harem and the long-standing confrontation of the Slavic Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska (Roksolany) and the Circassian Mahidevran Sultan became widely known.  Of course, over time, all the children of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent were also drawn into this enmity.  Their fates were different.  Someone remained in the shadow of their blood relatives, and someone managed to clearly enter their name in the pages of Turkish history.  The following is the story of the children of Suleiman the Magnificent.  Those of them who managed to leave any significant trace. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Children of Suleiman the Magnificent: shehzade Mustafa and Selim II</strong> </p>

These are the <span>very children of</span> Suleiman the Magnificent who were drawn into a fierce feud by Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska and Mahidevran.  Both were not the first-born of their mothers and were not initially considered direct applicants to the throne.  But the vicissitudes of fate made them so.  However, <span>this competition</span> was largely resolved by those who started it.  Roksolana managed to win Sultan sympathies and become his beloved wife.  Mahidevran was actually exiled to Manisa with her son Mustafa.  However, the tragic vicissitudes of the fate of Prince Mustafa were just beginning.  Soon, rumors began to spread throughout the empire that Mustafa was plotting against his father.  Suleiman believed these rumors and ordered the execution of his son when they were both on one of the military campaigns.  Thus, the competitor of Selim to the throne was eliminated.  <span>Selim II</span> did not at all subsequently become such a wise and decisive ruler as his father.  On the contrary, it was with his rule that historians connect the beginning of the sunset of the majestic Ottoman port.  And the reason for this was not only objective socio-economic prerequisites, but also the personal qualities of the heir: weak character, laziness, shortsightedness and, most importantly, hard drinking.  A drunkard and he was remembered by the Turkish people.

    <p>  <strong>Children of Suleiman the Magnificent: Shehzade Mehmed and Shehzade Bayazid</strong> </p><p>  Both were sons of the Sultan of Roxolana.  Mehmed was her first son, but could not be considered an heir, since the son of Mahidevran Mustafa was older than him.  However, when the latter fell into disgrace, it was Mehmed who became the father's favorite.  He was appointed governor of the city of Manisa in 1541.  However, he was never destined to become either a great sultan or a <span>great commander.</span>  He died of an illness in 1543.  Heir Bayazid from an early age grew up as a brave and desperate young man.  Already early </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the story of the children of suleiman the magnificent" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/291590.jpg" width="441"></div>  At the age he took part in military campaigns, having established himself as a talented commander.  After the death of Mustafa, he began to be considered the main contender for his father's legacy.  For the throne in subsequent years, a real war broke out between the brothers Bayazid and Selim, in which the latter defeated.
