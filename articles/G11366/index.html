In addition, some of them have become cheaper. </p><p>  It would seem that this made the choice of a suitable phone an impossible task.  This article provides an overview of the most worthy models available on the market today, and also provides an answer to the question of which antivirus is better for an Android smartphone. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy S9 </h2><p>  The best ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù smartphone in the world in 2018 became even better.  The Galaxy S9 has a surprisingly large 5.8-inch screen and camera designed to work in low light, although the design of the device remained at the S8 level.  However, after the release of the phone, it became more difficult to answer the question of which is better - ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù -martphone or ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù. </p><p>  The size of the phone, as well as its price, has slightly decreased compared to the S9 Plus.  Like last year‚Äôs model, the smartphone is equipped with a stunning 5.8 ‚Äùdisplay that fills almost the entire front surface of the device, without unnecessary bezels and a home button. </p><p>  Samsung has listened to fans' feedback regarding the location of the fingerprint sensor and moved it under the camera.  Although this is not an ideal solution, it is acceptable until fingerprint readers appear below the screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Bixby's virtual assistant is better, although still inferior to the <span>voice assistants</span> of market leaders.  Despite this, the y Galaxy S9 is so attractive, including an impressive camera and a 3.5mm headphone jack, that the answer to the question of which ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù smartphone is the best is obvious. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dpreview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Galaxy S9" class="if uuid-2605578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2605578.jpg"></div><h2>  Google pixel 2 </h2><p>  According to reviews, the advantages of the model are the best-in-class camera, dual front speaker and the ability to receive the best applications for the Android smartphone before anyone else.  To its disadvantages, users include a wide frame and the lack of a standard headphone jack. </p><p>  It may seem that the Google Pixel 2 is not much different from last year's model, but the manufacturer has made enough adjustments and clarifications so that the smartphone can be considered one of the best Android phones. </p><p>  The high quality of the device is confirmed by its camera.  The main sensor with a resolution of 12.2 MP allows you to reach new heights in mobile shooting, especially in low light and in portrait photography.  Shots are sharp even in motion.  The small form factor of the Pixel 2 makes it easy to hold the smartphone, and its water resistance is finally equal to the Samsung S8.  In terms of performance, the good processor of Android smartphones, the Snapdragon 835 and 4 GB of RAM, together with the Oreo operating system, provide maximum performance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The phone costs a little more than the best rating model, but the high-quality camera and the original OS are definitely worth it.  Users looking for a large screen and battery should consider using the Google Pixel 2 XL. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.11street.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Google pixel 2" class="if uuid-2605623" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2605623.jpg"></div><h2>  LG V30 </h2><p>  The advantages of the model are its excellent design and a huge number of entertainment functions.  However, the owners note the high cost and insufficient quality of the camera. </p><p>  LG turned around the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat a flagship smartphone should be like when it released a device with amazing design and performance, but with features rejected by many manufacturers. </p><p>  The phone has a reliable camera app, water resistance, FM radio and a 3.5mm headphone port.  LG has installed a DAC that enhances audio playback to a level that most models cannot offer. </p><p>  Of course, the user gets all the benefits of a FullVision display, which is almost completely frameless.  For some time now, the V30 has been equipped with LG's first OLED module, and its quality is fantastic.  This technology allows you to view 2K content in HDR, and has sufficient flexibility for use in a Google Daydream View headset. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The biggest obstacle for the V30 is the price, which exceeds 50 thousand rubles.  But since this is one of the best Android smartphones on the market, there is little chance that its price will drop a little. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidguys.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy Note 8" class="if uuid-2605640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2605640.jpg"></div><h2>  Samsung Galaxy Note 8 </h2><p>  This is a model with 6.3 ‚Äùdisplay, dual camera and 6 GB of RAM.  To its disadvantages, users attribute the impressive cost and somewhat limited battery capacity. </p><p>  To say that the release of Note 8 was accompanied by great hype would be an understatement.  Given the catastrophic launch of Note 7, Samsung had a lot to do, and she took this opportunity. </p><p>  According to owners, the Note 8 is the best big phone you can buy.  And it is not just the screen size and the presence of the S Pen stylus.  Thanks to the new dual-lens matrix and 6 GB of RAM, the smartphone allows you to take excellent photos in telephoto and bokeh modes. </p><p>  However, you have to pay for everything.  This is a large smartphone and is expensive.  To reach the outer borders of the screen, it takes a longer stretch of the fingers than any previous Note phone.  In addition, the owner is limited to one day of work, which is lower than expected, probably due to last year's recall.  We can say that the difference in battery capacity is noticeable. </p><p>  Note 8 is Samsung's large home phone, debuting with a dual lens and 6GB of RAM.  He impressed and can only hope that he would not leave the stage as suddenly as his predecessor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.independent.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Smartphone OnePlus 5" class="if uuid-2607404" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2607404.jpg"></div><h2>  OnePlus 6 </h2><p>  This is the best "budget" "Android" smartphone and a real killer of flagships with high performance and at an affordable price.  Unlike the previous model, it became waterproof (although it did not get an IP rating), but its screen resolution remained the same - only 1080p. </p><p>  For some, OnePlus 6 is the best Android smartphone, and, frankly, they have every reason for this.  The Chinese manufacturer has improved OnePlus 5 and 5T, creating an excellent design, installing the main dual camera and providing the device with high-performance stuffing, including 256 GB of RAM. </p><p>  AMOLED-screen is lively and bright, despite the fact that it has ‚Äúonly‚Äù 1080p, the fingerprint sensor works quickly.  The lack of a microSD card slot and a battery that would last longer than one day spoil the overall impression, but considering the cost, OnePlus 6 has a fantastic price-quality ratio. </p><h2>  Huawei Mate 10 Pro </h2><p>  This is the flagship model of the Chinese manufacturer Huawei, and although its cameras are inferior to the Pixel 2 XL, its screen and battery life with equal processing power are better.  The 8-core Kirin 970 has the capabilities of artificial intelligence.  The CPU is equipped with a neural network that can cope with tasks such as translation and classification of images, without the need for communication with servers.  But there is no guarantee that applications using these features will appear in the near future. </p><p>  The advantages of the smartphone are a stylish waterproof case, a capacious battery, fast charge and stereo sound.  Among its disadvantages, users include the lack of a 3.5 mm headphone port, a weak GUI design and high cost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Google Pixel 2 XL" class="if uuid-2607413" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2607413.jpg"></div><h2>  Google Pixel 2 XL </h2><p>  This is an ultra-clean Android with another great phone camera.  Users are concerned about the lack of stereo speakers and waterproofing.  The model offers an unclouded OS experience, as well as a larger display with a higher resolution than the Pixel 2. </p><p>  The original interface brings joy, and a 12-megapixel camera provides high-quality images.  The fingerprint sensor not only protects the smartphone, but also uses gestures to facilitate access to the notification panel.  This eliminates the need to drag your thumb to the top of the screen. </p><p>  The price of the smartphone is quite significant, but there are no stereo speakers, slots for a memory card and protection against moisture.  And yet it is an excellent flagship device, powerful in every way, including readiness for virtual reality and work with Google Daydream View VR. </p><h2>  Moto Z2 Force </h2><p>  Motorola's modular handset is slim and shockproof, but with a weak battery and lack of moisture protection. </p><p>  If there is no desire to purchase a flagship smartphone, the Z2 Force may seem a relatively safe option, which is much ahead of its competitors.  This was made possible thanks to the modular MotoMods system, which in a broad sense expands its capabilities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bgr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moto Z2 Force" class="if uuid-2607416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2607416.jpg"></div><p>  The phone is equipped with everything you need, including a dual rear camera, a Snapdragon 835 processor and a clear OLED display, but it can be supplemented with a line of Motorola mods, which, for example, allow it to project television shows and films on the wall, print photos, print instantly snapshots (with Hasselblad add-on) and with the GamePad module play the best games for Android smartphones. </p><p>  These innovative mods vary in price and can be quite an impressive amount, but there is no other phone that would have such capabilities, except for the next model, which dared to invade the territory of Motorola. </p><h2>  Essential phone </h2><p>  According to user reviews, this smartphone has an impressive design and support for a huge number of technologies.  However, the owners note that its port for add-ons has yet to prove itself, and the cover of the case attracts fingerprints. </p><p>  Essential Phone is an amazing attempt by one of the creators of Android.  The manufacturer offers a frameless 5.57-inch screen, which until the advent of the iPhone X was (and still remains) the only ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù device that came closest to eliminating the bezel of the display without sacrificing design. </p><p>  In addition to the appearance, which can be discussed for a long time, for its price, which has recently been reduced to a more acceptable 32 thousand rubles, Essential phones have great power. </p><p>  Despite the lack of moisture protection, a headphone jack and an OLED display, presented in other flagship smartphones, the model has quite unique qualities that allow it to stand out against the general background.  A real example is the port for additional modules.  Someday he can achieve the success of MotoMods "Motorola", but so far has not demonstrated its potential. </p><p>  However, the smartphone is very good.  Even if mods are not the main motivator for buying it, there are many reasons to choose Essential.  The chassis with a titanium coating, clean software without add-ons and ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù of the manufacturer, an impressive screen and 128-GB data storage are significant arguments in favor of this product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Essential phone" class="if uuid-2607420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2607420.jpg"></div><h2>  HTC U11 </h2><p>  According to user reviews, this is a phone with an excellent camera and excellent sound.  The impression is spoiled by half-edge Edge Sense and a slightly dull screen. </p><p>  HTC U11 is equipped with a 5.5 ‚Äù2K-display, providing excellent video viewing, 4 GB of RAM, a good processor of‚Äú Android ‚ÄùSnapdragon 835 smartphones and shrinking sides (literally), which allows you to quickly launch applications. </p><p>  However, camera technology remains the focus of HTC.  The resolution of 12 megapixels may not seem very large, but the main sensor allows you to get great images, and for taking a selfie there is a 16-megapixel front sensor. </p><h2>  LG G6 </h2><p>  This is an outdated, but good and inexpensive Android smartphone with a large 5.7 ‚Äùdisplay, a waterproof case, but old chipsets and too much price. </p><p>  The LG G6 is an excellent phone with a premium design, an excellent QHD screen and a smart dual camera on the back, which provides the owner with great opportunities to realize his creative abilities. </p><p>  But the fact that the manufacturer decided not to increase the processor speed, not to upgrade the camera and keep the previous price, do not allow the LG G6 to take a higher place in the list of best smartphones on Android.  This does not detract from the fact that the G6 is an innovative product.  The display looks great, and it has the potential, from the camera and battery to the overall performance of the phone.  In addition, it became even cheaper - the price dropped to 25 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  What is the best antivirus for an Android smartphone? </h2><p>  Without a phone security application, even the best models could be at risk of malware infection.  The best antiviruses for the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù smartphone can not only detect and neutralize unwanted programs, but also offer a number of privacy and anti-theft features.  These include the ability to backup contacts and photos, track your phone using GPS, take a snapshot of a thief using your device‚Äôs camera, send commands to your lost or stolen smartphone using text messages, and even use smart watches to search. </p><p>  The shareware Norton Mobile Security also has excellent protection and does not deter users who do not want to pay 1600 rubles.  in year.  Its features of blocking calls, text messages and backing up contacts are available to everyone, as well as excellent anti-theft protection.  The best paid feature is to check the installed software and applications on Google Play for security and privacy risks.  Password manager and application blocking work well, like the new VPN for an additional 2 thousand rubles.  in year. </p><p>  Avast Mobile Security and CM Security Master antiviruses provide a rich set of functions even in free variants and, as a rule, are highly appreciated by malware detection tests.  They have a VPN and a custom blacklist.  But Avast's anti-theft and blocking features do not work very well, and CM Security Master malware detection rates vary from month to month. </p><p>  Lookout Security &amp; Antivirus was one of the first mobile antiviruses and has a good reputation among Android users.  But the company no longer allows its software to be evaluated by independent testing laboratories, so it is difficult to judge the quality of its work. </p><p>  PSafe DFNDR is an easy-to-use and fully functional application, and the cost of its paid version, which eliminates advertising, is only 320 rubles.  It has many free features.  But in tests, the malware detection level is unstable. </p><p>  According to experts, the best paid antivirus for Android is Bitdefender Mobile Security (about 1 thousand rubles a year), which offers almost perfect malware protection with a wide range of other functions and support for Android Ware watches.  However, you cannot configure scheduled scans, and there is no full-featured free version. </p>
