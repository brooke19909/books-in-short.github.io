This honorary title could only be received by the elect, who distinguished themselves by certain merits or accomplished a feat.  The Central Executive Committee on April 16, 1934, for the first time established the title ‚ÄúHero of the USSR‚Äù.  The awarded was awarded the star of the Hero of the Soviet Union.  Let's remember how many heroes there were, who first received the medal and much more. </p><h2>  All About Top Award </h2><p>  The main award of the USSR - the star <span>"Hero of the Soviet Union"</span> - appeared in 1939.  At first, it was an additional insignia for those who received the highest degree of distinction.  Then it was called in a different way: "Golden Star."  It is made of gold, sample 950, and on its reverse side is written ‚ÄúHero of the USSR‚Äù. </p><p>  A gold medal was given for special merits and for accomplished feats.  Heroes were called those who shot down planes (at least 15 pieces), saved people.  Air shooters-bombers could get the "Golden Star" for 8 enemy aircraft shot down in the air. </p>

    <p>  The youngest Hero of the Soviet Union is partisan Valentin Kotik.  He was 14 years old at the time, but he was a brave pioneer.  In 1943, Kotik was able to kill the officer and raise the alarm.  Thanks to him, enemies were discovered and defeated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To date, the <span>Golden</span> Star <span>medal</span> - ‚ÄúHero of the Soviet Union‚Äù - can even be found on sale at shadow antique dealers.  Of course, it is not cheap. </p><h2>  First Hero of the Soviet Union </h2><p>  Anatoly Lyapidevsky - the famous Soviet pilot.  He was a major general in aviation.  Today, almost no one remembers about him, but in vain.  After all, he was the first Hero of the Soviet Union.  Anatoly Lyapidevsky received the Golden Star medal - ‚ÄúHero of the Soviet Union‚Äù - had 3 Orders of Lenin and many other awards. He received a star in April 1934 for saving the Chelyuskin polar explorers. He looked for them, having made 29 flights in bad weather (there was a terrible snowstorm ). In March, he still found them, put the plane on a thin ice floe and saved 12 people, including women and two children, and then he participated in the Great Patriotic War, where he received the rest of his awards. </p><p>  Many believe that the first Hero of the Soviet Union passed away too corny.  Such a difficult and thorny path went and survived.  And then he was at the funeral of a colleague, where he caught a cold.  They could not cure him, and on April 29, 1983 he died. </p><p>  In honor of A. Lyapidevsky, the USSR postage stamp was issued in 1935.  In Russia and Ukraine, many streets are named after his last name.  A <span>memorial plaque was</span> installed at the school where the first Hero of the Soviet Union studied <span>,</span> and in 1990, a monument was erected in his honor in the village of Belaya Glina. </p>

    <h2>  Heroes of the Soviet Union: women </h2><p>  There were few of them, only 95 people who were awarded this title.  Some women - Heroes of the Soviet Union were even able to get the title twice.  Some were awarded posthumously, others live today.  Let's remember who had the Golden Star Award of the Hero of the Soviet Union. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The first woman to receive the high title of Hero of the USSR is Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya.  She was awarded a posthumous medal.  Zoe managed to burn the Germans' connection, so that they could not interact with their units.  The next time, Zoe also tried to arrange arson, but she did not succeed.  She was caught and brutally tortured.  However, Zoe did not even say her name.  She turned out to be a real partisan.  When she was led to the gallows, all battered, in blood, she walked with her head held high.  When she was being prepared for hanging, she managed to shout that the Germans would not win the Soviet Union, and her comrades would avenge their fighting girlfriend.  And so it happened.  And after her received high rank and other heroic women. </p>

If the Hero has died, and his child is studying full-time, then the state is obliged to pay the child a cash reserve. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Hero of the Soviet Union award was received by those citizens who really deserved it.  It is they who teach us to love our homeland.  They served her and were ready to risk their lives, if only their compatriots would be fine.  How can you forget Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, who until the last breath screamed at the Germans in the face, how she hates them and knows that the Soviet Union will win.  They beat her with sticks, rods, tore off her nails, but the Germans did not even recognize her real name.  There were thousands of such heroes.  They knew who they were fighting for and what they were upholding.  The heroes who received the award under the USSR were brave, decisive, and they deserve great respect. </p>

    <p>  Today there are fewer patriots who are ready to give their lives for their homeland.  Thoughts and views of people have become completely different.  Perhaps this is because time is calmer, not like during the Great Patriotic War.  Yes, many do not understand why fight, if you can live peacefully.  But, as they say, to each his own. </p>
