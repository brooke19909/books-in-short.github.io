    <p>  If we are talking about amenities, it is worth saying that an extra bed will be put in the room upon request, although there are a large number of family rooms in the hotel specially designed for the convenience of parents and children.  In the restaurant you can ask for a high chair for the baby.  There is a pretty good kids menu, and the guys just love desserts and delicious ice cream.  If necessary, you can use the services of a nanny who will happily spend time with the child if you need to leave for a short while (the service is paid). </p><p>  In terms of entertainment, the Dessole Lippia Golf Resort also stands out.  In the courtyard there is a well-equipped swimming pool where kids love to splash around.  Children can have fun on the spacious playground with swings.  Every day there is a mini-club, where small guests aged 4 to 12 years are admitted.  Here the guys are constantly under the supervision of educators and animators, and there is something to do with it.  In addition to the opportunity to play with different toys, children will be invited to do creative work, drawing, dancing, participate in theatrical productions and team competitions.  Evenings at the kids are also eventful: vivid performances are organized for them, and from time to time funny mini-discos are held.  In short, the hotel is perfectly suited for a fun pastime for children. </p><h2>  What do they say about the hotel?
