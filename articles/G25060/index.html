  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mass for modeling for children</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Is your child 2 years old?  Or maybe 3?  Then it's time to start creating.  And the mass for modeling will help to master this difficult matter.  Children have a special connection between the work of the brain and <span>fine motor skills of the</span> fingers.  The more it is developed, the faster and more clearly the child will speak.  This discovery was made by scientists from America and research data allowed us to name the most developing toy of all time - plasticine.  But now it‚Äôs not about him, but about a substitute that is more suitable for young sculptors. </p><p>  Mass for modeling has a lot of advantages over ordinary plasticine.  First of all, this is material that even weak children's fingers can knead, and even if the baby sculpts another detail of a future creation, this one will not become too hard.  Another plus, which will be appreciated mainly by parents and kindergarten teachers, is that it does not stick to clothes, a work surface on which they mold and to hands.  The colors will not only pleasantly surprise you, but they will also give you the opportunity to gain the first experience in creating colors and their combinations, because the sculpting mass mixes perfectly to a uniform color for any quantity ratio.  And for those who love the rainbow in one piece, there is advice - do not mix colors for a long time and get an excellent multi-colored pattern. </p><p>  All of the above is not yet a complete description of the merits of this miracle mass.  If you want to keep the child‚Äôs first masterpiece or just a good example, this material is an excellent choice.  Mass for modeling, hardening in the air for a long time will save everything that is dear to you.  But sometimes it happens that the container with the mass was not tightly closed and it dried up, as promised, within 24 hours.  What to do?  Sprinkle with water and seal tightly.  After some time, even a very frozen lump will become plastic and suitable for further use. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is also a mass for sculpting, not hardening in air, but in the oven.  However, this option is more suitable for adults - it is more rigid and it will not be possible for a child to make, for example, a gift to her mother. </p><p>  The modern creative materials market is full of varied sculpting options.  Trademarks producing "soft plasticine" add a variety of additions to their product.  That is why there is a mass for modeling: neon, with sparkles, glowing in the dark, with the smell of sweets, fruits, in a set of several colors, one-color in individual packaging.  Drying time ranges from 8 to 24 hours.  Some masses may remain on the material, but are easily removed after drying with a brush. </p><p>  The most popular modeling clay is a clay.  Producer - Orange Elephant (Orange Elephant), Russia.  Mass for modeling a clay is no different from foreign analogues, but it costs much cheaper.  The only negative is that the company does not produce options with delicious aromas for the safety of children.  Although, the composition of the mass does not include harmful components or dyes.  The basis is exclusively natural. </p><p>  The funniest plus for sculpting is that the figures can jump like balls.  Each child will like to make even a small bouncer who is allowed to play everywhere, not to mention something more decorative. </p><p>  Mass for modeling a clay hardens in 8 hours and is designed for babies older than 3 years.  But, if the child is sculpted under the strict control of adults, then you can try elementary figures earlier.  Believe me, sculpting from this material will captivate not only children, but also their parents.  The only negative that can be found in such an ideal material is the inability to make too thin and tall figures, because  ductility implies softness.  But, if you make the parts separately, and after hardening assemble, wet the ends with water, then everything will work out. </p><p>  Inspiration and masterpieces to you and your most beloved children! </p>
