What can be briefly said about this smartphone model?  The flagship received a good design, but it is unlikely that it will be possible to rate the hardware stuffing and performance with the highest score.  We can say that it is somewhere at an average level, well, or slightly above average, but only so, and nothing else.  The hardware platform supports the use of a special device, due to which the LG G3 Stylus, reviews of which will be written at the end of the article, is given the corresponding name.  Well, it's time to move on from words to deeds, and first we‚Äôll see what characteristics this device can surprise us (or at least please). </p><h2>  Brief Specifications </h2>

    <p>  An operating system of the Android family of version 4.4.2 is hidden in the case of the device.  She is better known as KitKat among the online audience.  LG G3 Stylus D690, reviews of which have already left many buyers of the device, belongs to the category of smartphones.  To use a cellular network, you must integrate a SIM card that has been previously processed according to the MicroSIM standard.  As expected, there is the ability to work in the GSM bands, as well as UMTS.  For data transmission at high speed, there are standards GPRS, EDGE, HSDPA.  There is no LTE module; work in fourth-generation cellular networks is not possible.  The device supports the function of using two SIM cards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Memory </h2>

    <p>  The amount of short-term (operational) memory is 1 gigabyte.  Part of it is reserved for maintaining the operating system.  However, 1 GB is often enough for the successful use of the smartphone, even in multifunctional mode.  Special problems with operation according to this criterion should not arise.  LG G3 Stylus D690, reviews of which are left by fans of devices running the Android operating system, is equipped with eight gigabytes of long-term memory.  It is reserved for the storage of personal data of the owner of the smartphone.  This can be multimedia information of any nature, including video and music, texts and photos.  You can expand the amount of memory through the use of an external drive format MicroSD.  Supported memory cards up to 32 GB. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2>

    <p>  There are no special protective devices in the phone.  Waterproof materials were not used in the manufacture of the device, the same applies to dust filters.  A battery with a capacity of 3,000 milliamps per hour is built into the device as a source of battery life.  The manufacturer does not give any specific data regarding the operating time in various modes.  Now it's time to talk about the device screen. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  The diagonal of the LG G3 Stylus Dual (reviews on the gadget allow it to make a positive assessment) is 5.5 inches.  In this case, the picture on the screen is displayed in a resolution of 950 by 540 pixels.  The matrix of the screen is made using IPS technology.  Thanks to this, we get a device from which it will be possible to read the text under any conditions for any amount of time, while the eyes of the owner of the device will be tired to a minimum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is known that IPS-matrices reduce eye strain, which allows virtually no damage to vision.  The maximum effect of this component is manifested during night reading from the screen of a mobile phone.  Density - 200 pixels per inch.  <span>There is</span> no <span>light sensor</span> .  This indicates that the automatic brightness adjustment function of the <span>screen does not work.</span>  Capacitive-type <span>touch screen</span> supports the ability to scale images using the "multi-touch" and displays up to 16 million colors. </p><h2>  Iron and camera </h2><p>  As a hardware filling, a smartphone has a chipset with four cores that operate at a clock frequency of 1.3 gigahertz.  If we talk about camera modules, the main one has a resolution of 13 megapixels. </p>

    <p>  Smartphone LG G3 Stylus, reviews of which appeared shortly after the device entered the international arena of mobile devices, takes stunning pictures, including thanks to the automatic focus function on the subject.  Video shooting is available for the owner of the phone, and in low light you can use the LED flash. </p><p>  With the front camera, things are worse.  Its resolution is 1.3 megapixels.  To be honest, the smartphone LG G3 Stylus D690, reviews of which are available on the official website of the manufacturer, in this regard will be weaker than the same ‚ÄúLumia 640‚Äù.  The company did not dare to please fans of selfie shots with a powerful module.  Could raise at least 2 megapixels, but for some reason did not do it.  The set of functions for cameras is fairly standard.  There are, as expected, digital zoom, geographical marks, but I would like to highlight optical stabilization from the entire list. </p><h2>  Communications and Interfaces </h2>

    <p>  <span>Phone LG G3</span> Stylus (reviews about it will be left taking into account the listed characteristics) has a good set of communication modules.  Among them are, for example, Wi-Fi, operating in three bands (b, g, n), and ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù of the fourth version.  Navigation in space is carried out due to GPS technology. </p><p>  The infrared port, as expected, is missing.  Using the MicroUSB standard port, the smartphone can be synchronized with a personal computer or laptop.  To listen to music in computer headphones or a wired stereo headset, a special 3.5 mm format jack is provided. </p><h2>  Rest </h2><p>  The software includes a preinstalled multimedia player for the corresponding files, analog radio.  The case is represented by the ‚Äúcandy bar‚Äù form factor, the keyboard is a screen type.  You can use it with a stylus.  A set of sensors includes a gyroscope and an accelerometer.  The price of this phone is from 13 thousand rubles or more (depending on version). </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  One of the best-selling color solutions of the model was the smartphone LG G3 Stylus D690 Black, reviews only confirm this fact.  But what is a device in general, without regard to color?  At first glance, this is an absolute copy of the previous flagship, G3.  Yes, it was with this aim that the engineers and designers of the company acted, although there are certain differences between the two models.  The latest generations of Korean devices are characterized by covering the front panel through the use of protective glass.  An insert with a company logo is only at the bottom. </p><p>  We said above that there are certain differences between the LG G3 and the G3 Stylus model.  Speaking more specifically about them, you can pay attention to the back covers of devices.  At the object of our review today you will not find the window that was responsible in the previous flagship for the use of laser autofocus.  In addition, if you take a closer look at the block of navigation keys, you will find certain differences there too. </p><h2>  Bottom end </h2><p>  It has interface connectors.  We are talking about the MicroUSB port, which is used both to synchronize the smartphone with a personal computer or laptop, and to charge the device.  There is also a 3.5 mm jack, which is necessary to connect a wired stereo headset or computer headphones.  The purpose can be different - from listening to music and audio tracks in clips and films up to the possibility of using analog radio.  In the latter case, the headphones will play the role of an antenna, since the receiver completely refuses to work without them.  Although this is not surprising. </p><h2>  Top end </h2><p>  Very interesting designers did with this part of the phone.  Here we can find a window that many users take for the location of the infrared sensor.  But the fact is that in this phone model it is simply absent.  And this means that the window is an ordinary element of decor, and it does not carry any functional load.  Nearby is a nest into which you can insert a stylus.  By the way, on the opposite ends there is one microphone, and they are almost on the same line. </p><h2>  Rear panel </h2><p>  If you remove the back cover, there you can find the connectors for installing SIM cards.  As mentioned earlier, they are installed in two pieces.  Also here is a port for embedding an external drive.  To do all this, there is no need to pull out the battery, however, the phone still has to be rebooted after these operations.  Only after that the device will work stably. </p><p>  More than once in their reviews, the owners of this phone said that even despite such a screen diagonal, the device is very convenient to use.  What is the reason for this, because we are well aware that smartphones equipped with 5.5-inch displays, using one hand is quite problematic?  In fact, everything is very simple.  Engineers and designers managed to choose the ideal dimensions of the case, which becomes clear at the first tactile contact. </p><h2>  Conclusion and reviews </h2><p>  Judging by official data, one of the best-selling was the smartphone LG G3 Stylus D690 Black.  Reviews for this device make up almost 75 percent of the total.  This is exactly the case when the classic color scheme really worked well, in fact having crossed out the other variations.  But what can still be distinguished in all models?  What do people who have walked this phone say about this? </p><p>  Often you can notice the words that the device is no different in terms of technical characteristics from its closest competitors.  In this regard, there is no zest as such.  At the same time, it was repeatedly noted that even with ordinary characteristics the smartphone turned out to be very pleasant to use. </p><p>  Among the main positive qualities distinguish, for example, the material of manufacture of the case, which is peculiar to this flagship.  Although the device does not pretend to be the most productive smartphone, its filling ensures smooth operation of the operating system, and applications open without friezes even when using multitasking mode.  A good main camera should also be included here.  If you add support for two SIM cards, good battery life, you can safely put a good rating. </p><p>  The situation is complicated by the screen.  Yes, 5.5 inches.  Yes, with an IPS matrix.  But one of the problems here will be resolution (I would like to see a minimum of HD, and a maximum of Full HD, although this is already the ultimate dream).  The second drawback is the lack of a sensor that would allow you to adjust the screen brightness in automatic mode.  However, the sane price, a good set of functions and a good hardware platform more than compensate for these shortcomings. </p>
