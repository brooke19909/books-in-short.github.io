    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Having been in Kondrovo, Kaluga region, you must definitely visit its memorable places, which are part of the history of the city and all of Russia.  The Church of the Savior Not Made by Hands was erected in 1820. The construction was financed by P. Shchepochkin.  During the years of repression, the church was closed.  In the sixties, the building was used as a store.  Since 1993, it began to serve as a sanctuary.  In 2008 it was reconstructed.  Now the temple is located on Komsomolskaya Street. </p><p>  In the city stands the monument "50 years of Victory" dedicated to soldiers who did not return from the war.  It is located on Corporate Street.  Near this monument, the Alley of Heroes is arranged in honor of the townspeople of Kondrovo who died in Afghanistan and Chechnya.

The author of this sculpture is a native of Kondrov - Svetlana Farneeva. </p><p>  Another monument dedicated to the heroes who fell during World War II is erected on Pronin Street.  The Church of the Life-Giving Trinity is the oldest sanctuary of Kondrovo (1818).  During the years of repression, it was used as a repository of a brewery.  In 1988, it was transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church. </p><p>  The paper mill building, built at the end of the 18th century, is located on Kooperativnaya Street.  This is one of the interesting places where you can get acquainted with the history of the city. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  The city is constantly visited by tourists.
