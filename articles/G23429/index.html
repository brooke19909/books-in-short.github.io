At 500 meters from it a strip of golden sand lies a magnificent municipal beach (in Goa, all beaches are municipal).  The hotel, with 60 seats, is located at some distance from the main, crowded day and night streets leading to the beach.  This is a positive factor, as the resort's life is multi-voice and noisy.

    <h2>  Optimal rest time </h2><p>  Experienced tourists, before buying a tour, always ask themselves: ‚ÄúAnd when is the best time to come (fly) on vacation?‚Äù  The climate of Goa, characterized by torrential summer trash rains, determines the optimal holiday season: from November to May.  During this period, the Arabian Sea is calmer: its waves are not so high, and underwater currents are less active. </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  The room fund of the Colonia De Braganza Resorts 2 * (North Goa) hotel is located in 3 small three- and four-story buildings, located relative to each other with the letter "P", covering the pool area.  The rooms for guests are spacious, two-room.  Furniture has an average degree of wear.  There are rooms without air conditioning.  Their prices are lower.  However, according to reviews of hotel guests, it is not worth being waged for such cheapness.  Still, the tropical climate forces people to live in air-conditioned rooms and use a refrigerator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="colonia de braganza resorts 2 north goa" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1124137.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most inconvenience to guests of the hotel complex delivers local midges.  She's petty and annoying.  Most of all, insects annoy the residents of the first floors.  Therefore, choosing a room in the Colonia De Braganza Resort 2 *, it is appropriate to focus on the third or fourth floors. </p><p>  The safe in the room is paid.  In order to use it, you must pay at least three days of use. </p><p>  The rooms have a bathroom with shower.  However, novice tourists should remember that you can neither drink water from the tap, nor brush your teeth with it, nor wash food in it.  To do this, use bottled water taken at the reception. </p><p>  Rooms are cleaned at the request of the guests. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The main food is provided by the restaurant of the Colonia De Braganza Resorts 2 * hotel.  Guest reviews indicate a multivariate food system, implemented by the restaurant of the hotel complex: boarding house, half board and breakfast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="colonia de braganza resorts 2 reviews" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1124132.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  The chef practices Indian, European and Oriental cuisine. </p><p>  However, according to realities, most tourists still buy tours with minimal food.  A light hotel breakfast, they prefer a good scrambled eggs with cheese and ham or a weighty sandwich with chicken or tuna, bought in shake.  Fortunately, there are many inexpensive cheap food establishments around.  No wonder India is called the gastronomic paradise! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In fairness, we note that the cuisine of the hotel restaurant is very decent.  A team of chefs, by order of the guests, will perfectly prepare the purchased fresh lobster, shrimp or even a small shark. </p><p>  Fruits guests of the Colonia De Braganza Resort 2 * hotel are usually overstocked in the local market.  Prices are extremely low.  Here for only 200 rubles you can buy an impressive set of watermelon, melon, papaya, passion fruit, mango, pineapple, strawberry.  If desired, you can prepare fresh fruits for yourself and your family from everything bought directly in the kitchenette (which is in every room). </p><h2>  Resort infrastructure </h2><p>  Guests of the Colonia De Braganza Resort 2 will share their leisure experience in their reviews.  What sights of Calangute do they recommend visiting? </p><p>  In terms of beach holidays, tourists recommend Baga Beach.  The local coastal restaurants (sheki) where they cook tasty and hearty deserve good recommendations.  In addition, in the evenings on the territory of this beach there are boring parties with dancing, a laser show and the consumption of the local legendary rum Old Moon. </p><p>  Young people who come to the Colonia Braganza Resorts hotel (Calangute, India) prefer the local night club life.  According to the reviews of young people, a digestible price tag and a wonderful vacation provides its nightly visitors to the club "Cafe Mambo".  The Athlete's Bar is also popular with a large plasma showing sports channels and typical American food.  Spending a good time at the Kamaki Bar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="colonia braganza resorts calangute india" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1124138.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To get an impression of colonial architecture, older tourists most often seek to visit the Catholic Church of St. Alex.  The church is snow-white in color, operating, maintained in excellent condition.  Believers highly value their impression of being in the service. </p><p>  The following stores offer a wide selection of jewelry: Shamrock Jewellary, Shalala Handicafts, Royal Jewelers.  Wonderful <span>leather jackets,</span> shoes and belts are available at Ali Leather Boutique. </p><p>  Beginning diving adepts will not be prevented by the lessons that the neophytes from the Goa Aquatics club give to the neophytes.  In a friendly and constructive atmosphere, hotel guests learn skills, which are later written by rave reviews. </p><h2>  About shopping in Calangute </h2><p>  For tourists who can‚Äôt bargain, the prospect of an overpayment of 30-60% of the price seems realistic.  Therefore, echoing the reviews of guests of the Colonia De Braganza Resort 2 *, we emphasize: in Calangute it is worth bargaining everywhere and always: with taxi drivers and in the market, with sellers of fruits and souvenirs, with merchants of shops.  This should be done, because the principle of local commerce is expressed in a simple sentence: "The whiter the skin, the higher the price."  However, according to Eastern tradition, bargaining should be good-natured and fun.  Insulting the seller is unacceptable!  So what are they - local prices? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel colonia de braganza resort 2" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1124136.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Suppose you liked local clothing or a bag with an elephant embroidered on it to purchase the appropriate surroundings.  Do not believe the words of sellers that its price is 700-1000 rupees.  In reality, its value cannot exceed 200 rupees (approximate local currency rate: 10 dollars correspond to 600 rupees.) </p><p>  Taking a taxi, you should bargain with 3-4 drivers.  And only after that choose one of them. </p><p>  In coastal restaurants (shekas), prices are fixed and indicated on the menu.  Perhaps, only here bargaining is pointless. </p><h2>  Wellness </h2><p>  Traditionally, most visitors to the Colonia De Braganza Resort 2 * hotel consider health a priority of their vacation.  And this is no coincidence, because in the resort infrastructure of Calangute there is an Ayurveda center where real professionals work.  Positive feedback was also earned by the Cyril Yoga Center and the local Thai massage parlor. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The development of resorts of the original Indian state of Goa promises many of our compatriots expanded opportunities for buying tours.  The choice of a class of resort services is wide and remains with their buyer: from the VIP class on the south coast to the economy class of northern Goa. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="colonia de braganza 2 hotel colony de braganza goa" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1124134.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is an inexpensive vacation that is relevant for the Colonia De Braganza 2 * hotel complex considered by us.  The Colonia De Braganza Hotel (Goa) provides its guests with spacious rooms, hearty meals, the ability to travel and attend excursions.  It is located in a convenient place for shopping.  However, the main advantage of tours to this hotel are still the magnificent beaches of Goa, reminiscent of an advertisement for a Bounty bar.
