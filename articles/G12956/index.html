    <h2>  Cottage villages </h2><p>  Many residents seek salvation in their suburban life.  More and more people choose housing outside the city, in the fresh air, preferring to work in the capital and live in the fresh air.  This can be seen in the increased demand for cottages in the villages.  Developers specifically select areas near the Moscow Ring Road so that future residents have the opportunity not to change their thoroughly familiar lifestyle and work, but to get to it unhindered.  Moreover, almost all citizens currently have their own transport.  In many cottage villages, single-family homes are being built, in many with cottages for several families.  One of them is the cottage village "Malakhovskoe Lake". </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  About fourteen kilometers from the main artery of the megalopolis - Moscow Ring Road - is the cottage village "Malakhovskoye Ozero".  How to get to it, you can easily find out by opening the map.  The village is located in the Lyubertsy district.  You can get to it by your own transport along one of the two highways: Ryazansky with a transfer to Zhukovskoye or Yegoryevsky.  In addition, to avoid intermittent traffic jams on the highway, the village can be reached by rail, that is, by train.  She goes to the station "Malakhovka", from where you can walk a half kilometer on foot to the village itself.  The trip home takes no more than half an hour. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  You can also take various buses and fixed-route taxis, which begin their movement from the Vykhino metro station and will comfortably deliver directly to the village. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Already since ancient times in Malakhovka it was customary among the Moscow elite to rest from the works of the righteous.  This has been a unique holiday village since 1885.  And at present, the developer has chosen this place for the construction of a low-rise residential complex for a reason. </p><p>  Why unique?  Because it was located in a pine-birch massif that has been preserved to this day among peat mud, ponds, near the lake of the same name with a huge amount of fish.  Equipped with beaches for recreation and truly healing air - this is what makes the Malakhovskoye Lake cottage community so prestigious for living.  The authors of the project managed to realize in it all their ambitions for the construction of buildings of European level, the organization of a comfortable space. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The project provides for the construction of 199 houses of different floors, designed in a single modern architectural style.  In 2010, the developer received a building permit, after which the project was put into operation.  Until 2014, the facilities were commissioned in stages.  And in 2016, almost all the buildings were already settled and happy new settlers celebrated their so successful acquisitions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to apartments, the developer also offers for sale luxury mansions up to two hundred square meters in area.  There were also four-room apartments and two-level apartments with their own land.  The developer does not finish the work, so as not to take away from the future owners their plans and ideas about future housing. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Lyubertsy district of the Moscow region is the place where the new cottage village "Malakhovskoye Lake" is located.  Indeed, a few meters from this settlement lies Malakhovskoye Lake.  Actually, it was the lake that gave it its name.  As already mentioned, the developer very successfully chose the place on which the cottage village "Malakhovskoye Lake" was built.  P. Malakhovka has its own developed infrastructure, which automatically becomes available for residents of the new village.  These are schools for children, including music, and kindergartens, and a clinic. </p>

At present, a restaurant and a shopping center are already pleasing guests.  Car enthusiasts can use the services of service stations and car washes.
