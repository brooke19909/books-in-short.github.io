    <h2>  Company Overview </h2><p>  The Tele2 brand, reviews of which are often found on thematic online portals, has been operating in the Russian Federation since 2003.  The company is known as a market player, growing from a modest regional operator to a powerful national brand.  In 2013, the Russian division of the Tele2 brand, owned by the Swedish company of the same name, was sold to VTB Group, after which the company became independent from its head office in Stockholm. </p><p>  In February 2014, Tele2 (expert reviews described this event in an extremely positive way) together with Rostelecom formed a new federal brand that could be viewed as directly competing with the Big Three players - Beeline, MTS and MegaFon.  The current license portfolio allows Tele2 to carry out activities on almost the entire territory of Russia and, therefore, build a network of mobile communication services on a federal scale.  The company has reserved 3G and 4G frequencies, which allows it to be competitive in one of the fastest growing segments of mobile services - providing Internet access. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In 2015, it expanded the geography of the presence of the Tele2 brand <span>Moscow.</span>  <span>Feedback from</span> market analysts regarded this event almost as a sensation - for many years the company could not break into the Russian capital market.  Finally she succeeded.  The presence of the brand on the Moscow market has a number of features - primarily in terms of the use of communication technologies.  Consider them. </p><h2>  Technological features of the Moscow communications market </h2><p>  First of all, experts note that the Tele2 brand does not have the ability to operate at a frequency of 900 MHz in Moscow.  That is, the operator so far will not be able to work in the capital, providing services in the GSM standard.  At the same time, there may be no real need for this - since, firstly, building a new GSM infrastructure from scratch does not always make sense, and secondly, Tele2 has a wide range of other frequencies at its disposal.  Such as, for example, 2.1 GHz, as well as 2.5-2.7 MHz.  This enables the brand to actively develop in the capital in the segment of providing access to mobile Internet - based on 3G and LTE technologies. </p>

    <p>  Another resource available for the brand in Moscow is optical cables from Rostelecom, with which, as we noted above, the company is actively cooperating.  Tele2, as analysts say, has the opportunity to install newer and more technologically advanced equipment in the expansion process in the capital market.  At the same time, those mobile operators that have been working in Moscow for a long time can not always afford to upgrade their infrastructure, because the already invested investments in current equipment have not paid off.  Indeed, in the modern market of communication equipment there are increasingly cheaper and less energy-intensive devices, moreover, compatible with advanced communication technologies such as 3G and 4G.  Moreover, those operators who are already present in Moscow will most likely need to modernize their current infrastructure in order to remain competitive.  While at Tele2 it will be quite modern. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Franchising </h2><p>  The brand is expanding its presence by various methods.  So, the operator can develop a regional network in the traditional way - by opening branches.  But there is another, actually turning into the main, way to expand Tele2 geography - a franchise.  Expert reviews regarding the business model offered by the brand are very positive.  As part of a franchise, entrepreneurs can achieve impressive results in terms of the profitability of their business if, firstly, they start activities in the geographic or social segment of the business that is not saturated, and secondly, they can make enough efforts to attract new customers. </p><h2>  Tele2 Reviews </h2><p>  Having studied the basic information about the brand, we can examine the reviews about it compiled by customers and service buyers, as well as Tele2 employees.  These points of view can be classified into several main categories: </p><p>  - opinions evaluating the competitiveness of Tele2 tariffs; </p><p>  - assessment of the quality of services provided by the company; </p><p>  - opinions regarding the level of <span>customer service.</span> </p><p>  In turn, within the framework of these categories, one can distinguish other subgroups of reviews - for example, related specifically to mobile Internet or voice communications.  A separate category of opinions will be brand assessments as an employer - by Tele2 employees.  Consider the relevant points of view on the activities of the Tele2 brand, which is considered, as we noted above, a direct competitor to the players of the Big Three, in more detail. </p><h2>  Tariff Reviews </h2><p>  Tariffs from Tele2 (reviews of many market analysts, customers and brand buyers confirm this) are among the most competitive in the segment.  If we talk about the rates of this operator for voice communications, then they can be classified as the most affordable.  Especially when it comes to tariffs within the network.  Some of them allow Tele2 subscribers to communicate without time limits for a completely small monthly fee. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Among such offers from Tele2 is the ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù tariff.  Reviews about him are extremely positive.  The subscription fee in the framework of this tariff is about 90 rubles per month - by depositing it into their account, the operator‚Äôs customers get the opportunity to communicate within the network without time limits.  As for calls to numbers of other mobile brands, they can also be made at very competitive rates.  A minute of such a conversation will cost about 1-1.5 rubles.  As for the tariffs for mobile Internet - for example, using 3G technology, Tele2 (customer reviews and market analysts confirm this) generates price offers that generally correspond to those offered by other leading mobile operators. </p>

    <p>  As some experts note, the tacit ‚Äúmonopolization‚Äù of price offers from competing players is characteristic of the mobile Internet market in the Russian Federation.  Of course, this does not mean collusion between them.  Just this segment is extremely saturated, characterized by high costs and requiring long investments.  It is very difficult for individual operators to offer tariffs that are fundamentally lower than those of competitors.  Higher price offers, in turn, need to be supported by an appropriate level of quality of services.  But not one of the Russian operators has special advantages in this sense.  The largest market players have almost the same access to communication technologies and infrastructure.  Therefore, the rates for mobile Internet are approximately the same for all operators. </p><p>  How do subscribers rate the offered Tele2 tariffs?  Customer and customer reviews of the brand regarding pricing are very positive in that they can really be categorized as the lowest in the Russian market.  This is especially true, as we noted above, of traditional mobile services such as voice communications, SMS.  Tele2 offers Internet prices, in turn, comparable to those of the Big Three players - however, in combination with cheap traditional services, using online access from Tele2, as some subscribers note, may be a more preferable scenario. </p><h2>  Voice Quality Reviews </h2><p>  What do Tele2 customers say about the quality of traditional mobile services - voice, 2G Internet, SMS?  The Tele2 brand (customer reviews of the services it provides confirms this) is known, first of all, as a service provider that concentrates its activities in large settlements. </p>

    <p>  However, as many market experts, as well as company customers, note that the brand is becoming more and more active - at a pace commensurate with those characteristic of the work of the Big Three operators - it is also actively expanding its presence in remote areas of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation.  At the same time, the quality of voice communication and related traditional services - 2G Internet and SMS, is provided by Tele2 at the highest level, regardless of the geography of subscribers using the services provided by the operator. </p><h2>  Internet Quality Reviews </h2><p>  Actually, how do users evaluate the proposed <span>Tele2 Internet?</span>  Customer <span>reviews</span> of the company regarding relevant services are largely determined by the specific geography of using online access to the network.  The fact is that updating the Tele2 infrastructure necessary to ensure stable communication of subscribers with the Internet via mobile channels cannot objectively be carried out simultaneously in all of Russia. </p>

    <p>  In some regions, the operator has successfully transferred its lines to 4G standards, in others - so far the main traffic goes through 3G channels.  Therefore, user reviews from different constituent entities of the Russian Federation regarding the assessment of online access speed, obviously, will vary.  But with regard to such aspects of access to online as connection stability, ping duration, uniform download speed, Tele2 services are evaluated quite positively. </p><h2>  Customer Service Feedback </h2><p>  The most important condition for the successful development of any business is the high quality of customer service.  Does Tele2 provide it?  Customer reviews regarding service are different and largely subjective.  It is useful to classify relevant opinions into several main categories: </p><p>  - those that reflect the experience of the interaction of the operator‚Äôs subscribers with the brand‚Äôs specialists in the office and by phone; </p><p>  - those that characterize the quality of Tele2 service to their customers via the Internet. </p><p>  We will study them in more detail.  As for the offline and telephone interaction of the brand and its customers - reviews indicate that people assess the level of competence of Tele2 specialists as high.  Employees of the company, as noted by Russian subscribers, show high professionalism, willingness to clarify any details of interest regarding tariffs for certain services, as well as the features of their provision. </p>

    <p>  Online Tele2, like many other major brands, also actively interacts with customers.  Communication between the brand and the buyers of its services is carried out very actively, in particular through social networks.  Those specialists who communicate with customers through appropriate channels can write a comment on any review or send a personal message to the subscriber with the necessary explanations. </p><h2>  Employee reviews about Tele2 </h2><p>  What do people working in <span>Tele2</span> write on thematic online portals <span>?</span>  <span>Responses of</span> company <span>employees</span> , first of all, should be distinguished from those left by specialists hired by franchisors.  It is clear that the specifics of working in a brand branch, characterized by a special corporate culture, highly competitive salary conditions and career prospects, may differ from activities in a company that cooperates with Tele2 as part of a franchise. </p><p>  If we talk about specialists working directly in the organization‚Äôs staff, their reviews, although subjective at times, reflect the positive attitude of people towards the working conditions in Tele2 and the prospects for professional development with this company.  Many experts admit that they are especially impressed by working in a company with great growth potential and ambition.  Tele2 is a brand that has to compete with experienced, powerful market players.  The Big Three operators in many components, such as, for example, the subscriber base, are still ahead of Tele2.  Employee reviews, however, indicate that many young, as well as experienced professionals, come to the company largely because of their desire to participate in the development of a promising business. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What conclusions can we draw by examining the most remarkable facts about the relatively new federal brand of the Russian cellular market, as well as the opinions of customers and customers about the company?  Are Tele2 fundamentally ahead of technology in leading mobile operators?  Tele2 (customer reviews of the company's services and market experts confirm this) is practically inferior to the largest market players in terms of technology and the use of tools to expand its business.  The brand is actively expanding both in the form of branches and in the framework of prospective franchising. </p><p>  If we talk about tariffing - this is the most competitive in terms of traditional communication services.  However, the tariffs that Tele2 offers in the mobile Internet segment can also be considered attractive enough.  Thus, a new powerful player appeared on the federal cellular market in the Russian Federation - the Tele2 operator.  Reviews about him - both among experts and in the community of customers, in general, are quite positive and reflect all the technological and marketing advantages that characterize the new brand. </p>
