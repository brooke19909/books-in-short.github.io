  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hats for women. Knitting in different techniques</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A spectacular addition to any look is a handmade accessory.  For example, always at the peak of fashion original designer hats for women.  Knitting with different techniques allows you to create a model that is ideally suited to the face and style.  A few fresh ideas from this collection will help needlewomen in their creative search. </p><h2>  Bulk Yarn Hat </h2><p>  New in the world of yarn creates new ideas for knitting.  Fashionable hats for women made of thick merino yarn are very popular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lebenslustiger.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="from thick yarn" class="if uuid-2486377" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2486377.jpg"></div><p>  It is easier to order such yarn in an online store than to buy in the nearest needlework salon, since the volume of skeins does not allow you to keep a large assortment of colors in retail outlets.  When ordering on the Internet, attention should be paid to the quality of the coat and the way it is processed.  Usually this information is indicated in the comments.  The yarn should be slightly twisted and steamed, then the spools will not appear on the product.  The approximate consumption for a cap of 54-56th size is 300 g. Sometimes in the order it is required to indicate not the weight, but the footage.  One hundred grams corresponds to about one hundred thirty or one hundred and forty centimeters.  Small excess can be used on the pompom.  In addition to yarn, you should order circular knitting needles of large diameter, about 20-25 mm.  You can replace the special tool with plastic tubes of the appropriate size.  A set of five knitting needles allows you to knit a hat like a sock, without making a seam. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Knitting hats for a woman will only take a couple of hours.  Cloths from ten to twelve rows are quite enough.  In the last two rows, you need to make uniform decreases, and tighten the remaining loops. </p><h2>  Spiral hat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="theknittingspace.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hat spiral" class="if uuid-2486298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2486298.jpg"></div><p>  A twisted spiral on the cap appears due to the fact that the fabric is knitted diagonally.  The alternation of the front and back smooths emphasizes the effect.  Interesting color patterns are obtained from sectional yarn, as in the first photo, which can be successfully used in hats for women.  Knitting begins with three loops.  Then, in each front row, one loop is added along the edges.  When the width of the web becomes equal to the depth of the cap, on one side the additions are replaced by the reduction of one loop in each front row.  The canvas thus becomes rectangular.  Its length should be equal to the circumference of the head.  At the last stage, decreases are made on both sides, until the initial three stitches remain on the knitting needles.  The joint seam should be invisible.  At the crown, the hat is pulled together in two folds and a pompom is sewn.  On the side of the rim, loops for the lapel are gathered on circular knitting needles and knitted with four or five centimeters with an elastic band. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  He takes in the enterlock technique </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="He takes in the enterlock technique" class="if uuid-2486453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2486453.jpg"></div><p>  The number of loops necessary for the rim is gathered on circular knitting needles.  It is enough to tie three to four centimeters of gum.  Before starting the main pattern, add at least half of the loops in the last row of the rim.  Additions are made of broaches so that a number of holes do not form in the gum.  Next, the first row of triangles is knitted in accordance with the enterlock technique.  The photo has a knitting pattern.  Hats knitted for women in this interesting technique always attract attention.  If the rows are knitted with yarn of different colors, the pattern will look even more spectacular.  In height, the canvas should be at least forty centimeters.  The last loops are pulled together, and the junction is closed with a fur pompom. </p><h2>  Vertical Knit Beanie </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blog.loveknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beanie hat" class="if uuid-2486325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2486325.jpg"></div><p>  The model is knitted on circular knitting from the rim to the crown.  The hat is made elongated so that you can beautifully bend it on the back of the head.  In the process, you can try on the product, pulling off the work on the knitting needles, and precisely select the depth of the fold.  The last loops are tightened as tight as possible so that there are no holes on the top of the head. </p><p>  Simplicity of work does not mean that the thing will turn out very modest.  Knitting hats for women allows a wide creative approach.  This laconic model can be transformed if you make a lapel, use an interesting pattern or sew decorative elements. </p><h2>  Horizontal Knit Model </h2><p>  Here's a hat for women with a description of knitting shortened rows.  This model is made in the horizontal direction, that is, across the forehead.  Try on the product and make a crease on the back of the head will be possible only at the end of the work.  Therefore, you will have to determine the size in advance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Beanie Hat" class="if uuid-2486415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2486415.jpg"></div><p>  On the knitting needles the number of loops is equal to the depth of the cap.  One edge of the fabric is knitted evenly, and on the other with the help of shortened rows several wedges are made for reduction.  You can use any pattern.  Each wedge is performed in thirty-two rows.  The first two fit exactly.  In the third row, the last sixteen loops are not knit.  The work is turned over, the wrong side is performed.  In the next front row, one more loop is knitted and so on, until all the loops are in operation.  The length of the blade should be a multiple of the width of one wedge. </p><p>  The seam on the back of the head is best done with a crochet; it will turn out to be more elastic. </p><h2>  Leaky hat </h2><p>  If you need to create a new interesting accessory, the knitting technique always helps.  Fashionable models of hats for women appear every season, but you can add zest to things only with your own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="knithacker.com" data-author=": SplitStitch Designs, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hat with open top" class="if uuid-2486330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2486330.jpg"></div><p>  For warm days, owners of long curls can get here such a funny hat with an open top.  She knits on circular knitting needles from the rim.  At the desired height, uniform reductions in twelve loops in a row are made.  Only three or four rows of reductions are enough, a wide opening should remain at the top.  The last loops close.  You can crochet this row so that the hat does not stretch. </p>
