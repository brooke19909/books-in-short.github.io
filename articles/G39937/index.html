They are all alike, almost like twins.  However, the company ZTE, rapidly breaking into the Russian market, can surprise.  And it is budget smartphones.  The main thing is to read reviews about them in advance.  ZTE Blade L3 - a worthy representative of its class.  And there are reasons for that. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews zte blade l3" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1061142.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About the manufacturer </h2><p>  The Russian-Chinese company ZTE has been known for a long time in the Chinese market.  But after domestic entrepreneurs entered the main directors and executives, the company began to gain momentum in sales in the Russian Federation.  And she even began to actively sponsor some projects.  In particular, programs on <span>federal channels.</span>  Instead, the company began to actively advertise, which attracted additional attention to it.  <span>ZTE Blade L3, reviews</span> of which will be presented in the article, have not yet been "promoted" on television.  But this does not detract from the dignity of the smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade l3 8gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1061141.jpg"></div>

At the same time, the display quality is really good, and the coating is oleoflob.  That is, there are practically no fingerprints left on it, and on a sunny day, the picture is visible on the screen very clearly, without dimming.  This is a very important point, because most budget smartphones, unfortunately, are very economical in this regard.  Matrices in them are cheap and not too high quality.  The screen supports HD-images with a resolution of 720p.  For a five-inch display, this is enough.  In addition, the viewing angles are very wide, as a result of which he received positive reviews from the ZTE Blade L3.  No matter how you turn the smartphone, everything will be visible.  And very good. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone zte blade l3 gray reviews" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1061140.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The first thing that everyone pays attention to when choosing a smartphone is its appearance.  And here it is classic enough for ZTE products.  The rear camera is located in the middle of the upper part of the smartphone, next to it is a flash, and on the other hand is a stereo speaker.  Pleasantly surprises customers the fact that the phone has a matte finish.  It is it that contributes to the fact that the device does not slip in the hands, and it is not so necessary to purchase a cover.  The back cover adjoins the smartphone very tightly, therefore, it does not play or creak when used.  On the bottom touch panel in the middle there is a blue round control ring and two more buttons, the focus of which can be changed independently.  For example, to call up the menu or instantly start the camera.  On the bottom end panel there is a microphone and a micro-usb connector for connecting a charger or cable.  Smartphone ZTE Blade L3 Gray reviews received in appearance the most positive.  Customers like the classic and at the same time unusual design of the device, which is still different from the same budget, but already well-known companies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade l3 gray reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1061139.jpg"></div>

In modern times, a rare person manages for calls only one.  And each has its own reasons for acquiring a dual SIM card.  The format of SIM cards is supported by mini-size.  With this, problems no longer arise.  Cellular operators by default provide SIM cards of different sizes.  They are inserted into the Blade L3 under the back cover, for which you have to pull out the battery.  This is done without much effort, but at the same time the battery holds tight, without flying out by itself.  The antenna of the smartphone is quite strong, the connection catches confidently even in problematic places where the coverage area is not too high quality.  It is noteworthy that the first SIM card slot has a moisture sensor.  The device notifies that a wet SIM card is inserted.  A notification appears in the quick access toolbar.  Wi-Fi also works very high quality, keeps the access point to the last, while this allows the coverage area. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  Naturally, this is the popular and most often used Android.  But his version is not the latest - 4.4.2.  ZTE Blade L3 Gray, reviews of which are still more positive for its price category, you can optionally upgrade to the fifth version of the operating system.  The smartphone will completely pull it.  To update, you just need to run the special ZTE application, which is installed by default on the phone.  The latest firmware version is on the official website.  Visually, the operating system looks standard, there is nothing surprising in it.  But to unlock the screen, you do not have to drag your finger across the display, as many are used to, but hold it for a few seconds in any area.  This is not convenient for everyone, but in general you can get used to it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade l3 reviews" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1061138.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <h2>  Inner memory </h2><p>  It is not so much - 8 GB.  For those who are not enough to store all the important files and information of this volume, there is a slot for a memory card (micro-SD).  Supported up to 32 GB.  However, as practice shows, for standard applications and software, there is enough standard space.  The ZTE Blade L3 8GB, which speaks of fast performance, rarely really requires a memory card.  And the excess cache and garbage that appears when using applications can be cleared.  In this case, no freezes will occur, which is very nice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone zte blade l3 8gb reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1061137.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  RAM </h2><p>  For a budget smartphone it is enough - 1024 MB.  As a result, the device simply ‚Äúflies‚Äù, and the applications work clearly, without freezes and glitches.  Especially pleasing to the owners is the fact that demanding and technically complex games are played without lags.  Even if the settings are not at all minimal.  The ZTE Blade L3 8GB smartphone, which is very positive in terms of performance, is really good.  It can be safely used for games, surfing the Internet and work.  For example, office applications show large and voluminous texts in various formats without problems. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  And here "the dog and is buried".  Despite the fact that the claimed quality of the main rear camera is 8 megapixels, the images are not the coolest.  Autofocus works with some slowdown, so shooting moving objects is problematic.  Quality at the same time "lame."  Color reproduction is also not entirely correct.  The primary colors are a little darker than they should be, and the brightness is lost.  Therefore, it is better to use the camera as an emergency option, when you need to shoot something very urgently.  And then it is advisable to process the image.  The front camera has a resolution of 2 megapixels.  But here, the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot the most outstanding, so it‚Äôs unlikely that you can make a good selfie, even after processing the pictures.  But for communication via video link with friends and family, such quality is quite enough. </p><h2>  Final review </h2><p>  For its value, 6-8 thousand rubles, the smartphone is quite high quality.  As confirmed by the reviews.  ZTE Blade L3 is available in two colors - gray (Gray) and white (White).  At the same time, at the start of sales, it was the first option that was in demand.  The battery capacity (2000 mAh) is not very pleasing to users, but many have already managed to get a spare battery and even a mobile powerbank charger.  Many recommend buying a smartphone only because it fully fulfills the money spent on it, works with a bang, and fails at the most important points.  Even if the device‚Äôs camera is not of the highest quality, if you use it for its intended purpose (calls, SMS, Internet and games), then the device will simply not have a price.  Those who are looking for a budget and reliable option should pay attention to the ZTE Blade L3. </p>
