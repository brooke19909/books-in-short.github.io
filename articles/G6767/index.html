Refrigeration systems, gas, electric stoves, microwave ovens, washing machines, small electrical appliances can not only simplify lives, but also fail, thereby putting the owners in an unpleasant position.  Knowing the causes of the most frequent breakdowns and the rules for operating devices, most malfunctions can be avoided.  It often happens that the refrigerator does not freeze, the reasons may be different.  Most likely, the tightness of the cooling system circuits is broken.  In most cases, the fault lies with the owner, who neglects the rules of operation. </p><h2>  The most common causes of refrigerator breakdown </h2><p>  These may include the following: </p><ol><li>  The manufacturer used low-quality components in the manufacturing process. </li><li>  The user has violated the rules for operating a household appliance. </li></ol><p>  When the refrigerator does not freeze, the cause of the breakdown can be low-quality components, which are more common with domestic or Chinese manufacturers, but the price of such devices is much lower.  In this case, the cooling system cannot be repaired independently. </p>

    <h2>  The refrigerator does not freeze: reasons for improper use </h2><p>  According to the rules of use, cooling appliances must be periodically defrosted.  The whole process in modern refrigerators with a drip system takes three to four hours and, of course, not everyone has the patience for this.  People often try to scrape ice, including with sharp objects. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Although this is strictly prohibited in the operation passport.  Such actions are fraught with damage to the integrity of the cooling system.  A small hole is enough - and all the tightness of the chamber will be broken, which will lead to leakage of freon. </p><h2>  Clogged capillary tube </h2><p>  This is another common reason when the refrigerator freezes badly.  A capillary tube (capillary pipe) is the most important component in the device system of the device, which serves to transfer freon to the cooling circuit.  During operation, this tube may become clogged. </p><h2>  Can I clean the capillary tube? </h2><p>  Attempts to eliminate the blockage on their own are fraught with the appearance of scratches, and the slightest damage is the key to breaking the capillary pipeline.  Such a malfunction cannot be eliminated without calling the wizard.  He has a special <span>hydraulic tool</span> with which he pushes the blockage.  Also, the master can pump nitrogen into the pipe in order to eliminate blockage, but this method is unsafe.  If possible, with the consent of the client, he changes the pipe and downloads freon. </p><h2>  Compressor out of order </h2>

In most modern refrigerators, this part is non-separable, respectively, if it breaks, it must be completely replaced. </p><p>  If the refrigerator does not freeze, the causes of compressor failure can be different.  The main thing is that the device worked without interruption for a very long time and simply burned out.  This can happen when hot products are placed in the refrigerator, the thermostat is triggered and does not allow the compressor to stop until the set temperature in the chamber reaches.  Another reason is that a sufficient layer of ice has formed in the chamber, the gas pressure in the circuit is insufficient, the compressor will constantly work. </p><h2>  Thermostat is out of order </h2><p>  This is the device responsible for the temperature in the chambers.  If the products in the refrigerator have stopped freezing, the usual drops of ice do not appear on the walls, and the compressor is working, then the matter is in the thermostat.  Change it at home will not succeed.  You can buy a thermostat for the refrigerator yourself, but only a qualified specialist should carry out the replacement work. </p>

    <p>  This is an inexpensive part, but installing it requires special knowledge for the correct connection of wires, otherwise the new device may immediately fail.  In addition, the temperature regulator for the refrigerator must be selected not only by type, but also by the brand of the unit, so if there is no confidence in the right choice, it is better to entrust this to the master. </p><p>  In two-compressor devices, it also happens that the freezer does not freeze, and the refrigerator compartment is working properly, the cause of which may also be a breakdown of the temperature regulator. </p><h2>  How to fix a refrigerator at home? </h2><p>  Before proceeding with the repair, it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the technical certificate of the device and the principle of its operation.  The main <span>thing</span> in the refrigerator is <span>the compressor,</span> which makes freon move along the circuit.  Cold is formed on the basis of three components interconnected by a pipeline.  A cold-generating gas functions in the system, which cools the radiator system and transforms it into a liquid state.  Then the gas in this form is returned to the evaporator. </p><p>  After the principle of operation of the device will be clear, you can begin to search for the source of the malfunction.  Of course, if the repair is associated with the replacement of complex parts, you can‚Äôt do without the help of a master, if there is a breakdown in the field of electrical, then you can try to fix the situation yourself. </p><p>  When the refrigerator does not freeze, the causes can be identified by external examination.  First of all, it is necessary to purchase special tools (a universal tester and an <span>indicator screwdriver)</span> and determine the quality of the mains voltage.  The normal indicator is about 220 V, small deviations are permissible.  Next, you should inspect the cord and mains plug for bends or damage (for example, from the teeth of pets). </p>

    <p>  If the cause of the malfunction is this, then repairing refrigerators at home will not be a big problem.  Change the cord completely or remove the damaged area and reconnect the wires, isolating them, you can do it yourself, without the help of a wizard. </p><p>  Another common reason why the refrigerator is broken is that the relay responsible for starting the refrigerator is out of order.  It is located next to the compressor.  During inspection, disconnect the flexible wires and check the control circuits.  This is pretty easy.  To do this, simply close the two wires from the relay and establish whether there is a contact between the wires and the power plug.  If there is contact, then the cord and temperature sensor are working. </p><p>  Sometimes the reason that the refrigerator breaks down can be the breakdown of a small but important part.  For example, a temperature sensor.  To check the likelihood of such a malfunction, you must remove it and disconnect the wiring.  Use a tester to check each wire.  If there is a short circuit, it is necessary to replace the sensor.  As mentioned above, it is better to entrust the replacement to a professional, especially if it is a modern refrigerator. </p>

    <p>  The fact is that the device will work without trip control and this will have to be done manually.  If you carry out such repairs of refrigerators at home, you must remember that this can lead to a quick breakdown of the compressor, which in modern devices in normal condition works no more than 10 minutes per hour.  And most importantly - the <span>temperature sensor</span> should be replaced if it breaks. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If, after a visual inspection, it was not possible to establish the cause of the breakdown of the refrigerator, you must call the wizard or contact a service center.  The cooling system is a rather fragile design, and one wrong move can aggravate the breakdown, which means it will increase the cost of repairs.  Having bought a refrigerator, it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the data sheet and operating rules.  In no case should you scrape the walls of the refrigerator during defrosting and put hot foods in it. </p>
