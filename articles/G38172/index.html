Examples of using solar energy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nowadays, scientists do not forget to mention at least once a month that oil is running out, gas is running out, atomic energy is dangerous, and in general, in two hundred years, humanity will switch to <span>stone axes,</span> as the world economy and production will stand up without fuel.  In contrast to this, there are many articles in the media about the development of technologies for <span>using the energy of</span> air, water, animal and human waste, and other different options.  Some of them are similar to science fiction, others have real technical achievements and are already in full use, such as solar energy. </p><h2>  Solar power </h2><p>  We are used to the fact that our beloved luminary gives us warmth and light, helps to grow crops, heats water in lakes, rivers and seas.  But, besides this, the energy of the sun's rays can be used differently.  Already several decades ago, calculators with a solar battery appeared on the market.  Now you won‚Äôt surprise anyone.  There are ready-made projects: the first houses have already been built on them, which are heated by solar energy and are operated in Russia in winter.  The project provides for backup heating, as in our area the sun can close the clouds for a long time. </p><p>  Each inhabitant can buy solar panels, only the price really bites.  In addition, it is cheaper to get energy and heat in the usual way.  However, in the absence of conventional energy sources, for example, in distant expeditions or in space, solar panels are the main ones.  In Europe, private sector residents place them on the roofs of their own homes and sell excess electricity to their own state.  But Germany is not the sunniest country.  The plus of solar energy is that it is renewable.  Although scientists say that the sun will not always shine, but, compared with human life, our light shone forever. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Solar Powered Aircraft </h2><p>  In our time, they built such an aircraft.  It may not be very fast and maneuverable, but its fuel is worthless, there are no harmful emissions.  <span>Solar panels</span> are located on all surfaces of the wings and the body itself.  On a test flight, the aircraft covered 1541 km from Phoenix to Dallas.  The maximum height was 8,200 meters, and the average speed was 84 km / h. </p>

    <p>  The <span>solar-powered</span> aircraft was piloted by one of its creators, Andre Borsherg.  This flight is one of his next records, earlier he made a journey at 26 o‚Äôclock on the same plane under the name Solar Impulse.  Now the tester is actively making plans to cross the whole of America, and then make a round-the-world flight. </p><p>  The whole team that created the vessel and prepared it for operation, is trying to do everything possible to maximize its work in the media.  After all, the main task of such events is to show the whole world that the energy of sunlight is very promising and can be used to the maximum extent possible by humans. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  Solar Impulse is a glider with a wingspan of 63.4 meters, its weight is 1.5 tons, it has four electric motors with a total capacity of 7 kilowatts.  It is envisaged that the lighting of solar panels may be uneven.  More than four hundred kg are lithium batteries, which are charged in the parking lot.  Any previous solar-powered aircraft flew only due to recharging from the sun, if there were batteries, then they were small. </p><p>  Solar Impulse 2 has now been created, it is much larger than its predecessor, has more solar cells - as many as 17 thousand.  Wingspan - more than 70 meters.  It was made from hydrocarbon fiber to reduce weight.  However, it weighs 2.3 tons.  Thanks to powerful batteries, it can fly for several days and nights at a speed of 50 to 100 km / h. </p>

    <h2>  Prospects for Solar Fuel </h2><p>  There are many examples of the use of solar energy.  The simplest one was shown back in the Soviet film ‚Äú3 + 2‚Äù, where the doctor of physical sciences laid out mirrors in an umbrella and heated the food in a pot with reflected light.  Now science is developing a technology for the use of thermal insulation, which has a surface that accepts solar energy. </p><p>  By the same technology, plants for drying crops and heating homes are already produced and operate.  In order not to make them too large in area, grooves are made in the surface of the heaters, which increase the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe material that receives solar energy. </p><p>  In regions of our planet where harsh winters, most of the energy is spent on heating.  To save energy, passive solar systems are developed that have a large area facing the sun, collect energy and warm the house.  The idea is good, but difficult to implement.  The house must have excellent insulation, it is necessary to regulate ventilation, when using only solar energy, the optimum temperature in the house is reached only by the middle of the day, and in the summer it is too hot. </p>

    <p>  A solar powered airplane is an excellent example of untold opportunities.  A prototype of a passive system is installed on it.  But there are also active ones.  They heat water or air.  Later, they, as coolants, enter the house.  They are easier to control, can be installed on already built houses, but their effectiveness is insufficient for the harsh winters of Russia.  However, in hybrid systems, when combined with conventional energy sources, active solar systems can save up to 60 percent of energy. </p><h2>  Sun car </h2><p>  A solar-powered aircraft is not the only modern transport on this type of energy.  There is a sun car, and not even one.  Every year in Switzerland there is a competition between these machines, it is called the Tour de Sol.  The race lasts six days.  Every day, participants need to overcome 80 to 150 km along the roads of Switzerland and Austria. </p>

    <p>  A few years ago such a sun-car made a trip through Russia.  It turned out that his wheels could not pass on our country roads, and traffic was on highways.  Russia is great, and not always enough sun.  But, despite all the difficulties, the solar car completed its route.  The maximum speed of such vehicles is 170 km / h.  The use of solar energy in the form of a solar vehicle has received yet another positive confirmation.  In Europe, some models have already entered the series. </p><h2>  Solar panels.  Price.  Production </h2><p>  Solar cells, in fact, are photocells that convert solar energy.  In the movie "The Martian" they are clearly shown when the protagonist after the disaster cleans them of dust.  In Russia, they are not popular and are not produced.  The usual minimum private order is formed in the amount of 9 thousand rubles.  The solar panels themselves, the price of which varies depending on the size of the goods, cost from one and a half thousand rubles to 15 thousand. </p><h2>  Use in Russia </h2><p>  In our country, the sun shines regularly, but not very much.  The examples of the use of solar energy described above can be applied in the vastness of our country.  Unfortunately, battery operation will pay off only in the long run.  But if we take into account not only the amount of money, but also the saving of natural resources, then we can confidently say that this technology must be developed and actively used as much as possible. </p>
