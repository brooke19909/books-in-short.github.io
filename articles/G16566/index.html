    <h3>  Khovansky cemetery </h3><p>  Among these necropolises there is also the Khovansky cemetery.  Most Muscovites will most likely tell you how to get to it: nevertheless, this is one of the cemeteries that are still operating.  And many burial places in this ‚Äúcity of the dead‚Äù are curious not only from the point of view of interest in those who found the last shelter here, but also from the perspective of the <span>decoration of graves.</span>  So, if you do not have prejudices against visiting the necropolises, take some time to visit the Khovansky cemetery.  It‚Äôs easy to figure out how to get there without a car.  Buses 500 and 502 of the route will take you to the right place for a very reasonable fee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to the Khovanskoye cemetery" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/314922.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h3>  History </h3><p>  But a little about the history of this place.  Khovansky cemetery is quite young.  It was founded only in the year 72 of the last century.  Today it is divided into two parts - North and West.  The first is older, it has existed since 1978.  The second, called "Western", was founded in 1992.  Currently, the necropolis is considered the largest in the whole of Europe, its area reaches almost two hundred hectares. </p><p>  This cemetery is also known for the church complex, where there is a remarkable church of the Baptist John and a chapel of the famous icon of the Mother of God of Vladimir.  And since the year 97 of the last century, there has been a site in the cemetery where they are buried according to Muslim customs.  It is equipped with everything necessary to carry out the deceased on the last Muslim path according to all Muslim canons. </p><h3>  "Criminal" burials </h3><p>  If you understand how to get to the Khovansky cemetery, visit it at least out of curiosity.  The most scandalous burials here are the graves of <span>criminal authorities.</span>  One of them, nicknamed Sylvester (according to the passport <span>Timofeev S.I.</span> ), died from the explosion in 1994.  The second, buried opposite him, is Ded Hasan (aka Aslan Usoyan), who was shot dead by a sniper last January. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bus hovanskoe cemetery" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/314923.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  But not everything is so odious.  More worthy personalities are buried here.  So, the Khovansky cemetery was also chosen as the resting place of Nina Iskrenko (poetess) and Symbolokov (magician, illusionist).  How to get to their graves, and in what part of the necropolis they are located, the cemetery keeper will tell you.  And they are not the only significant people buried here.  Many directors, poets, composers and journalists, outstanding figures of the Soviet Union and modern Russia rest in the cemetery. </p><p>  Recall that almost 200 hectares is the entire Khovansky cemetery.  How to get it to the right part, it is worth thinking in advance.  On religious days and funeral days, the route is simplified and more diverse.  Then additional express trains are launched, in the role of which is the bus.  The Khovanskoye cemetery is accessible "in parts": express trains 2 and 3 go to the central part (from the Teply Stan metro station and Yugo-Zapadnaya station, respectively), and to the northern one - routes 1 and 4, from the same metro stations. </p>
