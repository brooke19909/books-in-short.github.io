    <p>  Long before oil was found, this "paradise" gained a reputation as a "city of merchants", always welcoming travelers and merchants who arrived in the United Arab Emirates.  <span>Hotels (Dubai)</span> delight with their comfort and diversity, and the streets are clean and safe.  This city has received several times the award "the safest place on the planet." </p><p>  The United Arab Emirates is a dynamically growing global commercial center.  This is the place where international exhibitions and conferences are held.  Its role is difficult to overestimate.  Here every year the Dubai Trade Festival is held with great success.  More than 2 million visitors come to it.  Also, the festival "Summer Surprises" is organized here, where tourists from all over the world are waiting for exhibitions of the latest fashion goods, unimaginable sales, all kinds of cultural and entertainment shows for children and adults, opportunities for individual, group and family vacations.  Therefore, tours to Dubai are in great demand.

    <ul><li>  The central territory of modern Dubai is divided into two areas - <span>these are Bur</span> (southern) and Deira (northern).  In general, each part of this city has a lot of interesting things.  In the old district of Bur, you should see Bastakia.  Here you can see many Arab traditional dwellings with courtyards, wind towers, once replacing air conditioners. </li><li>  It is impossible to visit this city and not look into the Dubai Historical Museum, the insignificant fort Al Fahidi, who managed to visit the palace, the garrison and even the prison.  There are extensive collections of objects of everyday life as the Bedouins of ancient times, and modern residents of Dubai.  The marine and underground parts of this exposition also operate. </li><li>  The pearl of Dubai is the palace of Sheikh Zayed, who was the first ruler of the city.  So that he could observe the ships, his palace, surrounded by wind towers, was built on the seashore. </li><li>  Another attraction is <span>the Jumeirah Mosque.</span>  She is unusually beautiful in the light of special evening illumination.  This building is a striking example of Islamic architecture. </li><li>  Another recognizable antiquity is Burj Nahar - a watchtower guarding the old city.  This building is worth it in the picturesque gardens of Deira.  She is a favorite subject for photographing numerous tourists. </li><li>  Undoubtedly, the Dubai World Trade Center can be called a miracle of modern architecture.  Hundreds of tourists visit the observation deck of this 39-story building every day. </li><li>  Beautiful parks and gardens of the city of Dubai (UAE).  The most significant are <span>Jumeirah Beach</span> Park, Dubai Crixide Park, Mushrif Park, Raz Al Mamzar Park and Safa Park.  The local zoo is rightfully considered the best in the Middle East. </li><li>  Rest in Dubai can be endlessly diversified.  One of the most famous water parks in Asia is the Wonderland amusement park.  Feel free to explore any of the thirty attractions - from a fun carousel for your children to a roller coaster for yourself - and enjoy a carefree pastime. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="   " class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/392683.jpg?1399656451268" title="rest in dubai" width="460"></div></li><li>  The Wonderland Amusement Park includes Splashland Water Park, Spray Land, which has a common ticket.  It allows you to use any rides without restrictions. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="    " class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/392689.jpg?1399656526711" title="united arab emirates dubai" width="410"></div></li><li>  Holidays in Dubai include visits to the ethnographic museums of the emirate.  Near the bay is the "Heritage Village".  In it you can observe the work of craftsmen.  There is also a ‚ÄúDiving Village‚Äù, the inhabitants of which show how pearls were mined in the <span>UAE (United Arab Emirates)</span> in earlier times.  And the Al-Boom Ethnic Museum will introduce guests to the life of Bedouin nomads. </li><li>  In the center of the Hajjar Mountains is a mountain resort, the only one in Dubai - the Hatta.  It is a great place to relax.  Fresh mountain air, clear cool lakes, the ancient picturesque fortress of Hatta Fort, Juma Mosque, the oldest in Arabia - this picturesque place will undoubtedly attract the attention of every tourist. </li></ul><h2>  United Arab Emirates (Dubai) - a paradise for shoppers </h2><p>  This is the correct name.  Dubai proudly bears its title ‚Äúcity-store‚Äù.  The UAE is a free trade zone with a very low import duty.  This allows you to sell imported goods cheaper than in the country of origin.  In various retail outlets (from various shops to noisy markets), you can buy shoes and clothes, audio and video equipment, pink and <span>walnut</span> furniture <span>,</span> jewelry, <span>Persian rugs,</span> cars and much more.  The variety of goods here is very large.  You should not miss a wonderful opportunity to walk through the numerous shopping streets and markets of the city, where in the scattering of shops you can find absolutely everything that can please an experienced shopper.  Almost all stores have air conditioning, which greatly facilitates life in the hot climate of the United Arab Emirates. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An indispensable component of any transaction is bargaining.  This is important when making a purchase.  By bargaining, a persistent tourist will be able to get a tangible discount of 10 to 30 percent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="  " class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/392691.jpg?1399656743600" title="emirates dubai" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The most popular souvenirs are a variety of wooden caskets inlaid with stones, crafts made from ‚Äúsoapstone‚Äù, wonderful national coffee pots (dallas), and antique silver jewelry.  You can also bring home an Arab saber or special curved daggers - khanjars. </p><h2>  Shopping centers </h2><p>  Dubai (UAE) has a considerable number of them: </p><ul><li>  The most famous are the City Center, Al-Huber (Deira).  They operate about 300 stores. </li><li>  No less popular is the Gold Souk ("Gold Market").  It is also visited by many tourists.  Many consider it a global center for retailing gold products and precious stones. </li><li>  Blue Souk is a famous shopping center in Sharjah. </li><li>  Also, many go shopping at Al Fahda - the famous ‚Äúshopping street‚Äù. </li><li>  The Suk Al-Jumaa Market (‚ÄúFriday Bazaar‚Äù) between Sharjah and Fujairah is another popular market place.  Wonderful carpets from all over the East are sold here. </li></ul><h2>  The mode of operation of shopping centers and methods of payment for goods </h2><p>  It is important to know.  Large shopping centers are generally open until ten in the evening, sometimes around the clock.  Department stores, markets, boutiques, and certain stores operate on Fridays - on the official day off in the UAE.  All large and most small trading points accept credit cards.  It is also possible to pay in US dollars.  But we must remember that the United Arab Emirates is an eastern country, the largest discounts can be obtained by paying in cash in local currency. </p><h2>  Dubai shopping festival </h2><p>  Vacationers with experience purchase tours to Dubai in the spring, namely in March-April.  At this time, the Trade Festival is held there, lasting a whole month.  Sales provide unimaginable opportunities for the purchase of all categories of goods. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="    " class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/392684.jpg?1399656932800" title="arab emirates hotels dubai" width="600"></div>  A lot of entertainment programs - shows, lotteries, horse races, as well as bullfighting will not let you get bored in between shopping trips.  At numerous sales, discounts on goods can often reach seventy percent, and on hotel stays - forty;  air carriers often increase their baggage allowance.

    <h2>  Restaurants </h2><p>  There is no person who, having arrived in the United Arab Emirates - Dubai, would remain indifferent to the local cuisine, to its magnificent variety. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="   " class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/392686.jpg?1399657049479" title="dubai arab emirates prices" width="600"></div>  In the UAE, it is not difficult to choose a restaurant - there are a huge number of them for any, most demanding, taste - from chic to simple.  Most of all, of course, are Arab.  Although you can find both Russian and Italian restaurants, there are also Irish pubs.  The quality of products in these institutions is strictly monitored by the Sanitary and Epidemiological Service.  Arabic cuisine has rich traditions, and the number of delicious dishes cannot be counted and is worthy of a separate detailed story.  Everyone here can pick up something of their own free will.  Seafood from the Arabian Gulf and the Indian Ocean is constantly popular among tourists.  They are in great demand.  You will always be served the freshest seafood - perfectly cooked crab, lobster, shrimp, tuna.  Impossible to resist local desserts.  Making coffee is an art, and you should try it in one of the many Arabian cafes.  Prices, as elsewhere, are very different - from affordable $ 8-10 in a hotel to $ 50 or more in a five-star hotel for a regular lunch.  In numerous street restaurants and cafes, this stands, of course, below.  This is a characteristic of the United Arab Emirates (Dubai).  Here you can safely drink tap water, it is completely safe.  Nevertheless, most hotels and restaurants offer visitors mineral water from local producers.

    <h2>  Alcohol </h2><p>  This product has certain restrictions.  The UAE is a Muslim country, therefore, alcohol can be bought almost freely only in hotels, bars and restaurants.  Alcohol is prohibited on open sale.  This is especially true for the United Arab Emirates.  Dubai in this regard is the most democratic city.  For those who do not drink alcohol, there is always a huge selection of very fresh cocktails made from a variety of fruits.  It is allowed to import into the country no more than two liters of alcoholic beverages.  It is important to remember that drinking alcohol in public places, on the streets, beaches, while driving is prohibited.  Violation of this rule can lead to a very large fine, and sometimes to imprisonment. </p><h2>  clothing </h2><p>  In Dubai, local people appreciate modesty in this regard, which is especially true of the fair half.  In the city, tourists should abandon too frank clothes: short skirts, shorts and deeply low-cut dresses;  topless is not allowed to sunbathe, wearing a scarf on the head is welcome. </p><h2>  Behavior </h2><p>  Visitors during Ramadan eat and drink in special restaurants for foreigners or in a hotel.  Also, tourists should remember that in public places it is not supposed to smoke and chew gum.  Noisy entertainment is also prohibited in Ramadan.  In the UAE, they are very clean: for the garbage that the tourist imprudently throws on the street, a fine of 500 dirhams may be imposed. </p><h2>  Dubai (United Arab Emirates): photos </h2><p>  Strictness is present in this regard, as some rules must be observed.  In this country, it is forbidden to photograph the palaces of the sheikhs, any state institutions and, of course, military facilities.  A serious violation is an attempt to film local women. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="   " class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/392677.jpg?1399657245144" title="arab emirates dubai" width="462"></div>
