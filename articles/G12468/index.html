The outfit must be comfortable and original.  In addition, the wardrobe should be fashionable, stylish and emphasize all the advantages of the fair sex. </p><p>  Dress is the basis of any woman‚Äôs wardrobe.  This is her second skin, which perfectly hides nudity, emphasizes the advantages and hides all the flaws of the figure.  Dress is a way of self-expression.  But often in stores it‚Äôs hard enough to choose a comfortable and beautiful dress.  And the prices of modern models bite.  But many needlewomen know a way out of this situation - a dress can be knitted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting dresses for women" class="if uuid-2644219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49181/2644219.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Knitting dresses with</span> needles will create a unique product.  After all, such a dress can not be found anywhere else.  In addition, needlewomen know by choosing the right yarn, you can knit many models designed for each season. </p><h2>  Yarn selection </h2><p>  The main thing in knitting dresses with knitting needles is the choice of yarn.  It is necessary to pay attention not only to its thickness, but also to the composition.  Agree, in a dress of 100% merino in the summer heat it will be quite hot.  In addition, it is necessary to take into account the cut of the future model. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Pay attention to the season.  For a warm winter dress, it is better to choose yarn with a high content of wool.  Merino is great.  Autumn or <span>spring dress is</span> better to knit from wool or cotton.  It all depends on the period for which this outfit.  Of course, for summer options it is better to choose linen, cotton. </li><li>  You should also read reviews about yarn.  Pay attention to the tendency of products from the selected yarn to form spools.  After all, it will be a shame when, after the first wash, unpleasant lumps appear on your favorite outfit. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="theknittingspace.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting dresses" class="if uuid-2644259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49181/2644259.jpg"></div><ul><li>  If you want to knit a tight-fitting dress, make sure that the yarn is elastic.  Otherwise, you will have to additionally tie a rubber band into the product, which will give the product elasticity. </li><li>  Want to knit a warm dress on the floor?  Be sure to choose airy yarn.  After all, the product will be stretched under its own weight.  As a result, instead of a beautiful silhouette, you get an unattractive shapeless hanging product. </li><li>  When choosing a thread, pay attention to its "pricklyness".  Remember, no matter how beautiful the yarn looks, your body will come into contact with it.  And if the thread is pricked, then microcracks and irritations are guaranteed to you.  It is worth remembering that each person has his own skin sensitivity.  Some are pleased with the body of the product made of mohair, while others prick even this type of premium yarn. </li></ul><h2>  Preparatory work </h2><p>  All needlewomen know that before work it is necessary to decide on the future model.  Then choose yarn and tools: knitting needles, needles, hooks and markers.  Once everything is prepared, it is necessary to tie a sample to the selected yarn.  It must contain a pattern that will be on the dress.  It must be measured, washed and dried.  After the measurements are repeated and compared with the previous ones.  So you can find out whether the thread is stretched or "sits down".  So you can definitely do knitting dresses for women of the right size. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The sample will help you correctly calculate the required number of loops that you need to dial on the knitting needles.  Consider several models that can be worn at any time of the year. </p><h2>  Sweater dress </h2><p>  Knitting a dress with knitting needles is a fairly easy process.  Almost every needlewoman can handle this model.  But many people think that beginner girls need to practice small products first.  Once you have successfully completed several projects, you can start knitting dresses with knitting needles.  The most fashionable option for everyday wear is a sweater dress.  It can be both with a stand-up collar, and with a round neckline and a deep neckline.  The length of the product also depends on your wishes: mini or below the knee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting dresses with a description" class="if uuid-2644228" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49181/2644228.jpg"></div><p>  A sweater dress can be knitted in different ways.  For needlewomen who have mastered knitting raglan lines, you can safely proceed to knitting such a dress.  You can start the product both from above and from below.  You can knit such a dress separately, in parts: back, front, sleeves.  After assembly, loops are gathered and the neck is tied. </p><p>  As for the pattern, it all depends on your wishes and skills.  The canvas can be connected as a regular front or wrong side of the surface, and may include braids, tows and arana.  But remember that such dresses should be free.  In no case should such a product fit your figure. </p><p>  Knitting a baby dress with knitting needles will give not only a lot of positive emotions to you, but also your baby.  In addition, in winter, it will protect the child from the cold. </p><h2>  Tunic dress </h2><p>  This is ideal if you want to create a unique thing for the summer.  Knitting a dress with knitting needles of this model should be made of natural yarn, for example cotton, silk or linen.  Want to tie a tunic for a cooler season?  Choose yarn that includes wool. </p><p>  Such models should be light in the shoulders, devoid of volume.  But the waist line can be made in different ways.  The product, like the previous version, can be of different lengths.  For young girls, a mini that will allow you to show off with slender legs is suitable. </p><p>  The patterns for knitting dresses for women of this model can be different.  Tight knitting will allow you to wear such outfits with a biker jacket or high boots.  You can also wear this outfit as a sweater, under pants or jeans.  Many girls love openwork patterns.  These tunics are great for the beach season.  Believe me, in a light tunic of bright color you will look irresistible.  Family Look is very popular today.  He personifies the unity of the whole family.  Therefore, many mothers needlewomen plan to knit a baby dress with knitting needles of the same model as their own. </p><h2>  Sheath Dress </h2><p>  A characteristic feature of this model is a tight-fitting silhouette.  Knitting it is quite simple.  But the dress should be impeccable, in principle, like the figure of his future mistress. </p><div class="photo" data-original="giftofknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting for summer dress" class="if uuid-2644225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49181/2644225.jpg"></div><p>  As for the patterns.  Various types of elastic bands look more spectacular, in the center of the front there are often braids or arana.  Such a dress can also be made with raglan top.  Looks attractive models with a V-neck or with a high rack. </p><h2>  Maxi Dresses </h2><p>  Many needlewomen are afraid to start knitting dresses with knitting needles.  With the description, many models seem simple.  But believe me, you will succeed!  A real winter dress on the floor saves many women in the winter cold.  At the same time, the woman retains her gentle image.  Maxi dresses do not have to be fitted.  Such models are often popular with women with extra pounds. </p><p>  But the models made with lace inserts, a bat sleeve and a circular yoke are ideal for a special occasion.  Pay attention to the bottom of the dress.  The cut can perfectly emphasize the slender legs. </p><h2>  A brief description of the sequence of work </h2><p>  We calculate the required number of loops based on data from a knitted and washed sample.  We knit the dress in parts.  First we knit the back.  We collect the required number of loops and knit 5-10 cm with an elastic band.  After we go to the main pattern.  Often the back is tied with a front or wrong side.  We knit the length of the dress to the armhole.  Here we reduce the loop on the armhole and neck.  We tie the necessary length of the product to the shoulder sections. </p><p>  In the same sequence we knit in front of the product.  Remember, if you include braids or harnesses, they must be correctly positioned.  The neckline on the front of the dress should be deeper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newfashioncraze.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting dresses for women" class="if uuid-2644230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49181/2644230.jpg"></div><p>  Sleeves often also begin to knit with elastic.  After the fabric is knitted with the selected pattern, evenly adding loops.  Having reached the level of the armhole, it is necessary to make reductions on both sides that correspond to those on the back and front of the product.  Gradually, all the loops cut, close. </p><p>  The last step is the assembly of the product.  Use a hook or needle to stitch all the pieces together.  First, shoulder seams are made, sleeves are sewn, and after - side ones. </p><p>  Now, loops from previously shortened ones are gathered on the neck, the neck is tied. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  There is a dress in every wardrobe of a woman.  And not surprising, because this outfit emphasizes the tenderness of the fair sex.  Each needlewoman can create a real, unique masterpiece.  Knit a few dresses that can be worn in any season.  You will always be the center of attention, and for a woman it means a lot. </p>
