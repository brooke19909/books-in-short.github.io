    <p>  To work, you will need tapes, a candle, a lighter, and even better a burner, scissors, a needle with a thread and a gun with glue.  The manufacturing principle is the modular assembly of a flower from individual petals, which are cut from a ribbon and processed over a fire.  I propose to consider how to make flowers from ribbons. </p><ul><li>  Using template <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do it yourself flowers" class="if" height="236" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/164867.jpg" width="236"></div></li></ul><p>  To do this, you need a petal template, it can be made of cardboard or tin.  The template is superimposed on the tape and cut along the contour with scissors or a burner.  The template can be of very different shapes, depending on which flower you want to receive.  After all the petals are ready, their base is bent to the middle and fixed with glue.  As the base, a circle of the desired diameter from the same fabric is taken.  The number of petal blanks depends on the diameter of the circle, first all the modules are laid out along the edge, and then the entire base is filled in a circle.  In the center, a bead is glued as a core. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  From Kansashi Squares <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make flowers from ribbons" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/164865.jpg" width="548"></div></li></ul><p>  This is a very ancient technique, and how to make flowers from ribbons and fabrics was known 400 years ago in Japan, when complex hairstyles with a huge number of hairpins and hairpins came into fashion there.  It was then that <span>flowers from fabric</span> began to adorn the primitive crest. </p><p>  So, to create such colors, the ribbon is cut into squares, this square is folded into a triangle from left to right, towards the lower right corner of the square, then again from the top to the lower left corner, the last time the part is folded in half from left to right. </p><p>  The ends of the triangle, which will be directed to the core, are cut and scorched, then everything depends on the desired shape of the flower: if it is a tall flower, it is left, but if it is tilted or very low, then the lower left corner is cut and scorched. </p><p>  In the same way, 5 more petals are made and stringed on a thread, forming the middle of the flower, after the petals are fastened to the core, a bead or pebble is attached. </p><ul><li>  Twisted tape <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ribbon rose" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/164856.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ul><p>  How to make <span>flowers from ribbons</span> by twisting?  This method is also quite simple.  To make such a flower, a ribbon is taken, at the tip it is twisted into a tube and fixed with glue or thread with a needle, then at each turn of the ribbon you need to form folds that resemble rose petals.  In this way, you can make a flower of any size, and form and sew a leaf from the ribbon of contrasting color to the base of the rose. </p><p>  Inspired by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to make flowers from ribbons, you can make a wonderful decoration for yourself and your loved ones.  In addition, such flowers will be a wonderful decoration for a gift box or decorative pillow.  The main thing is to connect imagination and create beauty. </p>
