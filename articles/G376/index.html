    <p>  Sometimes the tax amount on receipts can be overpriced.  Inspection receives data from BTI late.  Therefore, the figures can be recalculated for no more than the previous three years.  That is, the amount of tax that must be paid in 2015 may include adjustments for 2012-2014.  Penalty on old recalculated figures is not charged.  Do pensioners pay apartment tax?  Not.  They are exempt from paying the fee. </p><h2>  The timing </h2><p>  The payment amount is calculated depending on the number of full months of ownership of the property.  If the apartment was purchased during the year, then the fee is charged from the month of registration of the object for the new owner.  For the period from January of the current year until the moment of sale, the old owner of the property pays the apartment tax.  How to find out a debt to a tenant of a new building?  Such houses are taxed from the next year after their construction.  If the property was inherited - from the month of entry into the right of inheritance.  In case of destruction of the facility, no fee is charged. </p><h2>  How to find out apartment tax online? </h2><p>  Today, utilities and goods can be paid for without leaving home.  This saves a lot of time.  The tax inspectorate also tried to make life easier for Russians, but ran into problems.  Citizens are used to receiving notifications from the inspection by mail.  They distrust new communication methods.  The second problem is that people often do not agree with the amount of payment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Several houses, apartments, etc. can be assigned to one payer. If he has not notified the inspection about the object subject to preferential treatment, the Federal Tax Service employees independently choose it according to the maximum amount of tax.  Federal laws of the capital, St. Petersburg and Sevastopol may provide for additions to the tax calculation procedure.  In particular, local authorities can set a zero rate or increase the base maximum three times.  It should be noted right away that the new scheme will not work in all regions.  In some regions of Russia, the calculation will be carried out according to the inventory value.  This is due to the fact that data on the estimated value are not yet available for all objects. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Bets </h2><p>  How to find out the tax on an apartment?

    <p>  After entering all the details, the payment amount will be displayed on the site.  Here's how to find out apartment tax at. </p><h2>  Features of the calculation for citizens of the capital </h2><p>  The amount of tax for Muscovites is adjusted for increasing the cadastral value of the property.  The formula for calculating: </p><p>  Tax = (K1 * SK - I2 * CH) * 0.2 + I2 * CH, where: </p><ul><li>  K1 = Cadastral value of the property, taking into account the deduction. </li><li>  I2 = <span>Inventory value of real estate.</span> </li><li>  SC - Cadastral value tax rate. </li><li>  CH - Inventory value tax rate. </li></ul><h2>  What is the difference </h2><p>  So, the tax can be calculated according to two schemes: based on the cadastral and inventory values.  In the first case, only the building structure (doors, walls, floors, windows) is taken into account.  Such an assessment is far from the market price of the object.  The cadastral value additionally takes into account such parameters as the location of the structure (in central or "sleeping areas"), transport accessibility, infrastructure, availability of parking, security, number of storeys, etc. The final indicator displays the approximate market value of the object. </p>

    <h2>  Examples </h2><p>  We calculate the apartment tax according to the new scheme.  How to know the debt?  The estimated value of the apartment is adjusted for deduction, and then the resulting value is multiplied by the rate. </p><p>  The apartment is 50 square meters.  m. estimated at the beginning of 2015 at 4000 thousand rubles.  Price per meter - 80 thousand rubles.  The cost of the object, taking into account the deduction: 80 x (50 - 20) = 2.4 million rubles.  The estimated tax amount at a rate of 0.1% is 2400 rubles. </p><p>  In order for the burden on citizens to increase gradually, and not sharply, the law provides for a transitional formula, according to which the tax on the apartment will be calculated until 2020.  How to find out the amount of debt? </p><p>  Tax = (KD - IN) x K + IN, where </p><p>  KD - the amount of tax at the cadastral value. </p><p>  IN - the amount of tax on the inventory value. </p><p>  K is the reduction coefficient. </p><p>  The value of the last indicator will increase.  In 2016, it will be 0.2, in 2017 it will change to 0.4, in 2018 - 0.6, and in 2019 - 0.8. </p><p>  Consider another example. </p><p>  The apartment is 48 square meters.  m. at the beginning of 2015 estimated at a cadastral value of 3.6 million rubles.  Price per meter - 75 thousand rubles.  Estimated costs are: </p><ul><li>  according to the new method, taking into account the deduction of 3600 - (75 x 20) = 2100 million rubles. </li><li>  according to the old estimate - 300 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  Rates in both calculation options are 0.1%.  Calculate the amount of tax: </p><p>  by cadastral value: 2100 √ó 0.1% = 2.1 thousand rubles. </p><p>  inventory cost: 300 * 0.1% = 0.3 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Substitute this data in the formula: </p><p>  ((2.1 - 0.3) √ó 0.2 + 0.3) = 660 rubles. </p><p>  For 2015, the taxpayer will have to pay 660 rubles. </p>
