  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Paper mosaic opens the world of great creativity to children</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Apparently, the art of mosaic began to accompany a person from ancient times, long before the heyday of civilization.  The elements of the first creations in this technique were small animal bones and colorful pebbles.  Accessible and easy to use, their material for making mosaics was sought and found in Sumer and Egypt, Greece and Rome, in Europe and in the East. <br><br>  Being a monumental art, mosaic is reflected in children's art.  At first, the application becomes available to children, the mosaic is more complex, to create it you need perseverance and patience.  Can you use the same source material?  paper with which they worked when creating applications.  But excellent crafts can also be created from tree seeds, husks of seeds, flower petals, sawdust, tinted in different colors. <br><br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Applique mosaic" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11773/140409.jpg" width="302"></div>  It should be noted that for preschoolers and primary school students, a paper mosaic should be simple, with a minimum amount of detail.  In kindergarten, it is better for kids to immediately prepare sets of already cut out pieces in advance.  Indeed, during this period, the technique of working with glue is only mastered by the child, and he wants to see the finished result of his labor as soon as possible. <br><br>  The first lessons in studying the mosaic technique should be the simplest: for example, assemble one large from four small squares.  From simple <span>geometric shapes</span> - a square, a <span>rectangle, a triangle, a</span> rhombus - a mosaic of paper can go on to draw up an ornament.  Moreover, many examples of folk art are based on the use of stylized forms.  At first, a combination of white and red colors is applied, black, green, blue, yellow are gradually added to them.  Increasing the palette, developing imagination, you need to show your child how interesting and colorful a mosaic of colored paper can be. <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Colored paper mosaic" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11773/140405.jpg" width="386"></div>  Finally, we can move on to a more complex multicolor mosaic, which is a drawing composed of small material.  This work will be very close to the products of a large, monumental mosaic. <br><br>  Like the world-famous murals and panels, children's paper mosaic needs an initial sketch.  Many ready-made outline sketches exist on the Internet.  They are available for printing.  Of course, you can draw a sketch yourself: contour thin lines on thick paper or cardboard.  Use either white color for the background, or the tone that should be in the finished picture. <br><br>  Material is prepared for work: multi-colored paper is cut either into squares or into arbitrary pieces.  For convenience, it is better to sort it by color. <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper mosaic" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11773/140406.jpg" width="550"></div>  The glue should not be applied to the pieces themselves, but to the background, where they will be laid out, and only on a small area so that it does not have time to dry during operation.  After applying the glue, you need to gently take a piece of paper with tweezers and attach it to the background in accordance with the sketch.  Continue to work until the entire image is sealed with pieces. <br><br>  To fix the mosaic of paper, you need to put a load on it and dry it.  Now the work can once again be circled along the contour with a black felt-tip pen, glued onto thick cardboard, inserted into a frame and hung on the wall as a normal picture.
