Some time ago, party-goers gathered here to come to visit the legendary Kazantip festival.  Now, the village of Popovka in Crimea is considered one of the best places for families with children.  <span>Hotels, hotels,</span> recreation centers and cottages for vacationers are not counted here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea village popovka" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58043/1919991.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  The village of Popovka is located 28 km from Yevpatoriya.  This place is not crowded, with wide clean beaches, on which there is never a crowd of tourists.  The entrance to the sea is gentle, which is very convenient for children.  From Popovka you can walk to salt lakes with therapeutic mud and arrange a free mud treatment course. </p><p>  But the infrastructure of the village is practically undeveloped and consists of several small shops, bars and a pharmacy.  If you walk to the <span>village of Mirny,</span> you can get to the market, to shops, banks and mail.  The beaches are not equipped either: there are no sun loungers, no changing cabins, no canopies. </p><p>  You can get to the village of Popovka in Crimea by bus or taxi from <span>Simferopol Airport.</span>  By 2018, it is planned to build a road bridge to the Crimea, and in 2019 - a railway.  In the meantime, you can get through the ferry crossing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Kazantip" - a place for children </h2><p>  The authorities of Crimea in 2017 banned the holding of the Kazantip festival.  In its place in Popovka there are many that are reminiscent of the festival of constructions and decorated houses.  Everything here is saturated with the atmosphere of the former country of general happiness. </p><p>  At the site of the festival, the Crimean authorities plan to build a children's center.  And now here is a mini-water park.  The beach there is very convenient for children: the entrance to the water is gentle, and the depth near the shore is only half a meter.  It is covered with fine white sand, at the entrance to the sea you can see beautiful large shells, and the water is unusually blue and crystal clear.  Reviews and photos of the beach in the village of Popovka in Crimea do not convey all its beauty.  In the summer season, there are small bars, a cafe and a shop on the Kazantip site. </p><p>  A large flow of party-tourists, which lasted more than 20 years, favored the construction of a huge number of hotels, cottages and recreation centers.  Consider the 7 best places to stay in the Crimea, in the village of Popovka. </p><h2>  Villa "Harbor" </h2><p>  The hotel is on the first line and is designed for wealthy VIP tourists.  Vacationers are provided with all amenities, from Italian furniture in rooms to sea views.  The hotel itself is located 50 meters from the beach, equipped with sun loungers, awnings and gazebos.  It features a restaurant, pool and free parking.  Villa Gavan offers comfortable rooms with balconies that offer magnificent views of the sea, garden or rose garden. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Popovka village Crimea photo" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58043/1920025.jpg" width="600"></div>
