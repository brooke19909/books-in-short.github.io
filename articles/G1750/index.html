The owner of the estate possessed all power over the peasants, had to take measures to eliminate unrest, discontent, think about the improvement of the village.  State interference in these relationships was considered an exception.  But after the peasant reform, the situation radically changed.  Millions of peasants received personal freedom and civil rights.  They were significantly limited, but nonetheless, of these former serfs, it was necessary to educate citizens of Russia.  The state faced important tasks of restructuring society and governance.  Zemstvo is not at all something new for the history of Russia.  The tsar took the path of reviving the past experience of creating local self-government since the time of Ivan the Terrible and his pernicious reform.  The creation of zemstvos solved two problems at once.  On the one hand, it compensated, though partially, for the loss of power to the nobility.  On the other hand, it shifted the solution of local problems and improvement tasks to the shoulders of representatives of all classes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is a zemstvo? </h2>

Representatives of the nobility and the townspeople, owners of real estate, were chosen by direct vote.  In the peasant curia, three-stage elections were held, which significantly reduced the number of their representatives compared, for example, with the nobles.  Zemstvo activity took place at two levels: administrative (annual <span>zemstvo meetings)</span> and executive (administrations working on an ongoing basis for remuneration). <br><br>

    <h2>  Zemstvo functions </h2><p>  From the very beginning, the zemstvos were entrusted with the economic tasks of local improvement: the creation and maintenance of hospitals, schools, veterinary centers, charity houses, as well as the construction, repair of roads and the like.  Funds for these purposes were obtained in the form of mandatory fees established by the Zemstvo assembly.  That is, on the ground they themselves decided how much money should be collected and what they will go to.  In addition, the zemstvo is the beginning of the formation in Russia of the so-called third estate, or the third element.  These are doctors, teachers, agronomists who played a significant role in the development of the Russian countryside, workers who made a direct contribution to the development of <span>civil society.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="creation of zemstvos" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13600/438122.jpg" width="545"></div></h2><h2>  Zemsky liberal movement </h2><p>  The state, creating elective self-government bodies, immediately made it clear that the zemstvo was not a political authority.  In order to avoid its transformation as such, communications between zemstvos of different provinces were prohibited, not to mention activities at the national level.  Also, from time to time, new censorship bans on reports of local governments were introduced.  Finally, with the beginning of the <span>reactionary policy of</span> Alexander the Third and the suppression of revolutionary populism, the liberal representatives of the nobility through zemstvos began to raise legal and not very political questions.  The main requirement was to adopt a constitution that would guarantee the political and civil rights of Russian citizens.  Among other issues raised by liberals, one can single out the requirements for reducing <span>redemption payments,</span> abolishing the <span>poll tax,</span> creating zemstvos at the level of volosts and at the state level.  The legal forms of struggle were petitions and addresses to the emperor.  Illegally, all-Russian congresses took place, semi-legal circles were organized. </p><h2>  "Zemstvo has lunch" </h2>

One of these masters was the founder of the Association of Wanderers <span>Grigory Grigoryevich Myasoedov.</span>  His paintings primarily depicted the life of peasants.  In his work, Grigory Grigoryevich vividly responded to reform reforms in Russia.  The picture "Zemstvo dines" is a direct confirmation of this.  It depicts the Zemstvo representatives of the peasantry, who, sitting directly on the ground, take quite simple and meager food.  Representatives from the nobility and merchants are not visible, but there is a hint of their special position.  The window shows a footman wiping utensils for a meal of representatives of the upper classes.  The picture is simple, but very thoughtful.  How do peasants feel at joint meetings with "gentlemen"?  Can they raise their voice in defense of their own interests?  Is it easy for them to take time for zemstvo affairs when the household is at home?  By honestly answering these questions, we will understand that local governments were completely influenced by the nobility.
