More than a million tourists from all over the world come here every year.  This coast of the island attracts the opportunity to sunbathe and swim almost the whole year. </p><p>  Most of Phuket's beaches, which can be ranked among the best, are located in the west of the island.  All of them are distinguished by a convenient gentle entrance to the sea and well-developed infrastructure.  The peak season on the island falls between November and April.  It was at this time in Thailand that the most favorable weather for recreation was established.  The sea becomes calm, often there is complete calm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand phuket patong beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2073601.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It must be said that ranking the best beaches in Phuket is not easy.  Therefore, in order to simplify the situation a bit and make it easier for our readers to choose their vacation spot, we decided to divide it into several categories.  First, we will present you a rating of the beaches of Phuket, which are considered the most beautiful. </p><p>  All the beaches of the island are unusually picturesque.  The bright blue sky, crystal clear water, snow-white and golden sands, coupled with exotic vegetation for many tourists coincide with their dreams of an earthly paradise.  Surprisingly, the most beautiful beaches of Phuket (reviews of tourists confirm this) are not very familiar to tourists.  According to experts, one of the most picturesque beaches of the island should include the following. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Patong </h2><p>  In Thailand (Phuket) Patong Beach is recognized not only as one of the most picturesque, but also the most popular.  And here not only foreign tourists, but also the local population like to relax.  Its length is 3.5 kilometers.  The beach is located in the bay, and therefore you can swim here all year long.  Unusual gray sand is small and very soft.  There are practically no ebbs on this beach.  And you can swim here all day.  But there are always a lot of people here. </p><h2>  Three Trang </h2><p>  The rating of Phuket beaches continues hidden from most eyes, despite its proximity to the popular Patong, Tri Trang beach.  A well-groomed coastline is located between two resort areas - Patong and Paradise.  This is a public beach with convenient parking, shower and toilet.  There are many cafes and bars on the shore.  Diving enthusiasts are delighted with the beautiful corals seen in the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rating of Phuket beaches" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2073606.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Karon </h2><p>  This amazing place, included in the ranking of the best beaches in Phuket, is located at a distance of 45 km from the island's airport.  This is the largest beach located in the southwest of the island.  As a rule, tourists get here by minibus or taxi.  Karon is divided into parts, each of which is a small exotic mini-beach.  In the south, Karon is connected to Kata beach, in the north - with Patong. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is interesting that the sand here differs from many other beaches due to the content of a large amount of quartz.  Under his feet he makes a characteristic creak.  Right behind the coastline is the unusually beautiful island of Boo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket's best beaches rating" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2073596.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Kalim </h2><p>  If you travel often and are now planning to visit <span>Phuket,</span> you can see <span>photos of the</span> island's beaches in the brochures of almost all travel agencies.  The quiet beach of Kalim is located next to Paton.  He is relatively underpopulated.  This allows you to enjoy its picturesque landscape and silence.  If you climb the mountains surrounding the beach, you can get to the observation deck, which offers stunning views. </p><h2>  Pansy </h2><p>  It is not easy to get to this closed beach.  Almost on the shore here are built bungalows for vacationers.  The beach is surrounded by cliffs and unusually beautiful vegetation.  It is considered one of the most luxurious places in Phuket. </p><h2>  Phuket beaches: cleanliness rating </h2><p>  Experienced travelers know that it is much easier to find beautiful beaches in Phuket than clean ones.  Although their condition is closely monitored by the country's national bureau.  In the Thailand help desk, you can at any time find out the rating of Phuket beaches by such indicators as infrastructure development, ecology, and safety.  Here you can find out how best to get to the beaches of the island. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The cleanliness of the beach is determined not only by the state of the coastal strip, but also by the water.  Today, several recreational areas are claiming leadership in cleanliness. </p><h2>  Nai harn </h2><p>  The sandy shore of this beach is washed by the waters of the Andaman Sea.  Nai Harn is the perfect place to relax.  Like many other island beaches, Nai Harn is a public beach.  Here you can rent sun loungers and umbrellas for a nominal fee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket beach photos" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2073607.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Surin </h2><p>  This kilometer-long sandy strip is ranked second in the ranking of beaches in Phuket (2017) in terms of cleanliness.  The infrastructure in this recreation area is well developed and relaxation here is a real pleasure. </p><h2>  Relax </h2><p>  Not everyone can appreciate the beauty and well-groomed of this beach.  You can get here only by subscription purchased at the hotel.  The beach is very small, but very picturesque and unusually clean.  It is convenient to swim here not only for adults, but also for children.  The cleanest beaches include Kata Noi, Karon Beach, Kata. </p><h2>  The best white sand beaches </h2><p>  Almost all the beaches of the island are covered with very light sand, but not as snow-white as in the famous Bounty advertisement.  The lightest sands cover the beaches in the west of the island, which are washed by the turquoise waters of the Andaman Sea.  The ranking of Phuket's beaches with the whitest sand includes Nai Harn.  Next to it is a magnificent coral reef.  This place is popular with scuba diving enthusiasts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket beaches reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2073599.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Following Nai Harn, the ranking includes nine beaches of the Similan Islands.  They are less crowded than those listed above, but from this no less beautiful. </p><h2>  Wild beaches </h2><p>  It would be unfair, making a rating of the beaches of Phuket, not to take into account the wild beaches.  They are fully consistent with the name.  Their beauty attracts lovers of secluded relaxation to the picturesque shores. </p><h2>  Laem Sing </h2><p>  Often the beach is called secret.  This is due to the fact that he is lost in the jungle and surrounded by rocks.  You can go down to it by a rope ladder.  There is another way - from the sea.  The coastline here is only one hundred and fifty meters long.  This is one of the most inaccessible places on the island, which is part of the natural national reserve.  Annually, huge groups of turtles come to this shore, which breed here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rating of beaches in Phuket" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2073604.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Freedom </h2><p>  A wild secluded beach that can be reached in fifteen minutes by car from Patong.  Its coast is surrounded by dense jungle, through which it is almost impossible to get through without a guide and machete.  You can get to Freedon by boat.  Its southern part was chosen by connoisseurs of scuba diving. </p><h2>  Yanuy </h2><p>  A very secluded place located in the southern part of Phuket.  It is very beautiful, but it especially affects the underwater world.  That is why lovers of snorkeling tend to get here.  The coastline here is only two hundred meters.  Lying on its soft sand, you can admire the magnificent seascape.  A small island is visible on the horizon. </p><h2>  Banana </h2><p>  According to the inhabitants of Phuket, the best wild beach of the island is Banana.  Small cliffs divide into two parts its coastal strip.  The sea on this beach has a sandy flat bottom, and the shore seems to be covered with white powder.  Coconut trees surround it.  It is an ideal place for divers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beaches of thailand phuket rating" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2073597.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches for families with children </h2><p>  The presented rating of Phuket beaches will be incomplete if we do not take into account places for families with children.  After all, it is important for all families who come to rest with their whole family.  The best beach for families with children is Kamala Beach.  This is a pretty secluded place with a shallow depth of sea, which is ideal for young tourists.  To get to the depth, you need to go from the shore a few tens of meters. </p><p>  Equally important for parents is the fact that there are very rarely big waves here, since the beach is located in a bay that protects the coast from the winds.  The mass season begins here in November and lasts through March inclusive.  Kamala Beach is a very clean beach on which all the conditions for a comfortable stay are created. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rating of Phuket beaches 2017" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2073598.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Often, tourists who come to rest with children try not to leave too far from the airport.  The nearest beaches suitable for families are a ten minute drive from the airport - Naighton and Nai Yang. </p><h2>  Service on the beaches of Phuket </h2><p>  When compiling a rating of Phuket beaches, it is necessary to take into account the level of services provided on them.  They are most diverse on <span>Bang Tao, the beach,</span> where wealthy tourists prefer to relax.  Near Bang Tao, one of the most comfortable and expensive tourist complexes of the country, Laguna Phuket, is built.  It consists of luxury hotels, numerous bars and restaurants, a golf course, and spa.  The level of service here can be called impeccable. </p><p>  Surin has changed significantly in recent years.  The popular beach, created in the style of a Thai village, has been updated beyond recognition.  The services provided here have become better.  This could not but affect the desire of numerous tourists to relax here. </p><p>  Near the beach of Kamala Beach, the most famous <span>Phuket FantaSea</span> amusement park is located not only in Thailand but also in the world <span>.</span>  True, the infrastructure on the beach is practically not developed.  Entertainment and food can only be found in hotels next door to the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket beaches cleanliness rating" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2073602.jpg"></div>

    <p>  One of the leaders in the ranking of beaches with a large number of services, undoubtedly, is Patong.  This is the busiest place on the island.  According to vacationers, this beach lacks only cleanliness.  And the sea here is simply magnificent. </p><h2>  Beach Infrastructure </h2><p>  From the mainland to Phuket, you can get by sea, via three bridges, by helicopter or plane.  The developed infrastructure of the island allows you to find hotels of different levels of comfort and cost for living.  Along with small souvenir shops, very small and huge restaurants on the island there are many shopping centers. </p><p>  All the beaches on the island are connected by a network of roads, but they cannot be reached by public transport.  Most often, tourists use a taxi, although it costs a lot here.  The most suitable way to get around is to rent a motorbike or car. </p><h2>  Ranking of hotels in Phuket with its own beach </h2><p>  It is immediately necessary to make a reservation that, by law, in Phuket there are no private beaches owned by hotels, however, as in the whole of Thailand.  Beaches should be freely available, and hotels do not have the right to buy them.  Therefore, in this article we mean hotels with adjacent coastal areas by their own beach. </p><h2>  Centara Grand </h2><p>  The hotel is located on the first line of Karon Beach.  From it to the beach no more than two minutes.  This is one of the few hotels where you do not need to cross the road to be on the beach.  The hotel staff speaks twelve languages, including Russian.  The island's airport is forty-five minutes from the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rating of Phuket Hotels with Private Beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2073600.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Le Meridien </h2><p>  Another great hotel in Karon, located a little north of the previous hotel.  It has a vast territory and a favorable secluded location.  The hotel is ideal for romantic trips and family vacations with children.  The staff of the hotel speaks Russian.  There are 10 restaurants and bars on site.  One of the indisputable advantages of the hotel is its location: secluded atmosphere, silence. </p><h2>  The shore at kathathani </h2><p>  The hotel is located on the sandy <span>beach of Kata</span> Noi (first line).  He has a very high rating, he is rightfully considered one of the best on the island with its own beach.  The traditional rooms here have replaced villas with magnificent sea views.  The disadvantage of the hotel is the impossibility of settling with children.  It is suitable for a romantic getaway. </p><p>  Despite the rather high prices, all villas are often bought here, so you need to take care of the reservation in advance. </p><h2>  Katatani </h2><p>  The five-star hotel offers its guests a large green area and a sandy beach.  The hotel receives excellent reviews for excellent service and professional staff.  The rooms are always kept in perfect cleanliness: regular cleaning is provided during the day.  Katatani is suitable for both a romantic getaway and for families with children of different ages. </p><p>  For children, there are playgrounds and games rooms, water slides with a pool. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  According to vacationers, there are many beaches on the island of Phuket, which are distinguished by a smooth entry into the sea, soft sand, a gentle warm sea.  Some travelers believe that today Phuket has become too popular a resort, which naturally affects the cost of food and accommodation.  This is one of the most expensive and at the same time popular resorts in Thailand. </p>
