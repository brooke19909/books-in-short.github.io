Mobile phone HTC Desire 600 Dual Sim</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  HTC rarely updates its lineup, not to mention smartphones that support two SIM cards.  Be that as it may, last year the official debut of the modification took place, which is distinguished by a relatively low cost and designed to satisfy the needs of modern consumers - HTC 600 Dual Sim.  Owner reviews mainly characterize the model as a very successful <span>multifunctional device</span> that supports two cards.  Moreover, most of them focus on the nuance that both of them are active constantly.  Many other models from different manufacturers cannot boast of such a feature.  A review of the HTC 600 Dual Sim is presented in more detail later in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc 600 dual sim" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/525034.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The design of the smartphone as a whole can be called quite restrained, strict and typical for this manufacturing company.  The only bright element on its body is the side-by-side signature inscription eat audio.  In the case of a white version of the device, a red stylish rim also stands out.  The placement of the logo under the screen was not entirely understandable, because this space could be used more rationally.  Unlike the trend that is now popular with the standard button layout on devices of this kind, the HTC 600 Dual Sim also puts the power key on top.  As for adjusting the sound, it can be found on the right.  A hole is provided on the upper end for connecting headphones.  At the bottom is a microUSB port, as well as a microphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The case itself is made of plastic combined with an aluminum overlay.  Although the plastic is matte and rough, it still makes the surface slightly unusual and original.  It is very nice to hold the device in your hand.  The weight of the model is 130 grams, while its dimensions are 135 x 67 x 9 millimeters.  The build quality and the rear removable panel, which does not creak at all and does not pay attention to itself, deserve special praise. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  One of the most expensive elements in any smartphone is the screen.  The HTC 600 Dual Sim was no exception.  The display characteristics of this device are largely due to the underlying matrix type Super LCD2.  <span>The screen size</span> is 4.5 inches, while its claimed resolution is 960 x 540 pixels.  The backlight can be adjusted either manually or automatically.  As for pixelation, it is not traced here.  The viewing angles horizontally and vertically are different.  Due to the absence of an air gap, the image is viewed clearly and well, and the colors are transmitted correctly.  Along with this, in the case of functioning opposite the sun, there is not a strong, but still distortion of colors.  Be that as it may, the <span>HD resolution</span> for the HTC 600 Dual Sim could be quite appropriate.  The reviews of many experts are a vivid confirmation of this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Work with two SIM cards </h2><p>  The ability to operate the model simultaneously with two SIM cards is organized quite simply.  The first slot is designed to use a card that will work with 3G networks, while the second slot is used for 2G connections.  The priority mode for transmitting information is set in the menu.  The choice of a suitable SIM card is carried out immediately before a call or sending a message.  At the same time, a separate key is provided for each of them.  It should be noted that the HTC 600 Dual Sim simultaneously uses two radio modules that are independent of each other.  Thanks to this, both cards are constantly available.  Moreover, you can even talk to the two of them at the same time.  This feature is a rarity even for the modern market of smartphones and phones. </p>

    <h2>  Calls </h2><p>  All calls are displayed in a separate section, where they are marked in different colors depending on the type of call (incoming, outgoing, missed).  Since the list is general, the list will be quite long.  The convenience of the virtual keyboard used in the device is associated with the quick search function by both contacts and numbers.  If desired, the user can additionally display data from social networks in one list or remove information unnecessary for him.  For each of the contacts recorded in the memory, a large number of information fields are provided.  All numbers from the phone book can be divided into groups with the assignment of individual pictures and signals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Messaging and Email </h2><p>  No less interesting in the HTC 600 Dual Sim is the message menu, the main feature of which is the ability to scale fonts and create so-called hidden message groups, where "secret" SMS will be stored.  As noted above, the keyboard of this device can be called quite convenient.  Typing messages is pretty easy, thanks to the large screen size.  You can enter text using a function that independently corrects typos and spelling errors. </p>

    <p>  Work with mail in the model is carried out due to two independent applications.  Using the first of them (it works exclusively with the Gmail system), the user creates the corresponding account the first time the smartphone is launched.  In the future, the box is automatically configured.  The second application is designed to collect and send letters through other mail services. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Separate words deserve the characteristics of the device from a technical point of view in the smartphone HTC 600 Dual Sim.  Here is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 processor with four cores.  It operates at a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  The amount of internal memory is 8 GB.  Along with this, it should be noted that almost half of it is reserved for system resources, so it is recommended to buy this model immediately with an additional memory card (drives up to 32 GB are supported).  The device has 1 GB of RAM.  In general, it functions quite smoothly and normally.  If small delays occur, they are associated with voluminous games and switching applications in the menu. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Like many other models from this manufacturer, the HTC 600 Dual Sim is also equipped with a replaceable battery with a capacity of 1860 mAh.  The instruction that comes with the smartphone says that it lasts for 11.1 hours in talk mode and 577 hours in standby.  As practice shows, when operating under standard conditions with two active SIM cards, the device will be able to work without recharging for a maximum of one day.  If you turn on the video with maximum brightness - it will be completely discharged in about five hours.  If desired, you can activate the standby mode, but in this case, the backlight level and the frequency of the processor will decrease.  Moreover, the screen and access to the Internet will be locked. </p>

    <h2>  Photo and video </h2><p>  The main camera of the HTC 600 Dual Sim is equipped with a bright flash, auto focus and is capable of recording videos in HD quality.  Its resolution is 8 megapixels.  The quality of images and recordings, as for devices belonging to this class, can be called quite high.  Among other things, the model is equipped with a special chip, which is an autonomous device, the main purpose of which was the implementation of photographing operations.  Thanks to him, the application starts almost instantly.  In addition to the main one, the device also has an additional <span>front camera</span> with a resolution of 1.6 megapixels, which can be used for video communication and creating so-called selfies. </p><h2>  Music </h2><p>  The standard smartphone player provides the ability to see media data and song covers, as well as create playable lists.  Equalizer is not provided here.  Instead, HTC Desire 600 Dual Sim only offers an option such as Beats Audio, which absolutely does not spoil the sound quality, like in many other models.  Due to it, while listening to music, the settings are selected and changed automatically.  Switching tracks can be done using the widget displayed on the locked screen.  The smartphone boasts loud speakers and great sound when using headphones.  Among other things, there is an application that allows you to listen to music even through Internet radio, as well as determine the names and artists of songs that sound nearby. </p>

    <h2>  Firmware update </h2><p>  In order to save money, it is recommended that in a device such as HTC 600 Dual Sim, the firmware be updated if there is a wireless Internet connection.  You can perform it quite simply, even for an ordinary smartphone user who has never encountered a similar one.  To do this, first go to the settings menu in the "About Phone" section.  It is in it that information about the existing firmware is displayed.  Next, you need to click on the "System Update" button, after which the process of downloading files will begin.  The main two nuances that should be remembered when performing these manipulations are the availability of the necessary amount of free memory, as well as the fact that the device cannot be used (or turned off) while downloading.  After the installation of new files is completed, the smartphone will reboot itself. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  To summarize, first of all, attention should be paid to the fact that the device belongs to a very small group of smartphones that have two full-fledged radio modules.  This fact often becomes decisive in favor of the model and makes it the best solution in its price segment for those people who spend a lot of their time on phone calls.  Of course, some other characteristics of the device are also very good - high performance, a good display and powerful stereo speakers.  The only significant drawback is not the best battery.  Be that as it may, the short duration of his work was the result of the above advantages.  As for the cost of the HTC 600 Dual Sim, the price of a smartphone is an average of 440 US dollars. </p>
