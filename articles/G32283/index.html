    <h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  For starters, let's examine what the structure of the camera‚Äôs delivery set is.  The device is on sale in 2 main modifications - Sony NEX 7 Kit, and also NEX 7 Body.  The difference between the two is that the lens will be included in the package of delivery of the first device.  In a box with a device of the appropriate type, the user, not counting the product itself, will thus find an 18-55 type lens, charger, communication cable, flash.  In general, the set of components is pretty standard. </p><p>  Some elements of the Sony NEX 7 delivery set - the battery, for example, can be considered sufficiently universal.  They can be compatible with other devices of the NEX line.  The corresponding type of components can also include the power supply unit.  Its analogues can easily be found in the catalogs of popular retailers.  The power supply purchased for the NEX 7 device may also be suitable for devices such as Sony NEX 3, 5, 6. It can be noted that in some trim levels the camera is supplemented with useful brochures, as well as a disc with specialized software.  But even if it is not in the box, the corresponding type of program can be downloaded from the Sony website. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  We will study the key characteristics of the Sony NEX 7 camera.

    <p>  In front of the device, apart from the lens, there are 2 built-in microphones, an autofocus backlight element, as well as an infrared signal receiver from the control panel.  The main area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe back of the Sony NEX 7 device is the screen.  Directly above it is the viewfinder, the flash activation button, and also the key with which the device is put into viewing mode.  To the right of the screen is a switch with which the user can control some of the popular functions, such as, for example, focus mode or deactivate auto exposure.  There are several more device controls in the neighborhood, typical for cameras of this type.  On the left side of the case, USB and HDMI ports are installed, as well as a jack for connecting an external microphone.  Moreover, they are all closed with special plastic panels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  In the upper part of the device, everything is fairly standard - here are the function control wheels, a flash and several keys.  At the bottom of the case are connectors for installing the battery and flash memory module, in the same area is the built-in speaker. </p><h2>  Screen and viewfinder </h2><p>  The Sony NEX 7 camera has a 3-inch LCD screen with a resolution of 0.9216 megapixels.  It can be noted that a matrix of a similar type is also used in the younger devices of the NEX line.  The screen provides playback of the highest quality images at the largest viewing angles, allows you to comfortably view content in bright sunlight. </p><p>  In turn, the device‚Äôs viewfinder operates on the basis of an OLED type matrix.  It also provides excellent picture quality in all lighting conditions.  But he has a number of operating features - for example, a sufficiently long image loading during automatic exposure selection, and also not sufficiently quick to respond to a sharp change in the shot frame - a new image is sometimes not too smooth in the viewfinder.  In addition, as some experts note, when shooting in a room in which fluorescent lamps work, there may be a noticeable jitter in the image on the viewfinder display. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The camera is equipped with a 7.7 W / h battery.  This is a fairly modest figure.  Declared by the manufacturer, the battery life of the device is 335 frames.  It should be noted: when measuring the corresponding indicator characterizing the battery life of cameras of this type, in practice, the figure can be significantly higher than stated.  In this sense, the device from Sony was no exception - as experts say, the camera is able to shoot about 520 frames without recharging.  Also, experts positively evaluate the extremely high accuracy of measuring the current battery charge in the camera interfaces - this allows the photographer to effectively plan his work. </p>

    <h2>  Device Features </h2><p>  We‚Äôll explore the most notable features of the Sony NEX 7 camera. </p><p>  First of all, it can be noted that this device gives the photographer the opportunity to use several modes of increasing the dynamic range. </p><p>  Firstly, this can be done through software processing of frames, during which the exposure automatically adjusts to the correlation with the level of environmental illumination.  Secondly, the corresponding option can be applied when using the HDR function, combining 3 frames that have different exposures. </p><p>  The next feature of the operation of the device is the ability to combine 6 frames obtained by automatic shooting.  This option allows you to significantly reduce the noise level in the photo. </p><p>  Another useful option of the camera in question is image correction using the software built into the device‚Äôs interfaces.  Its use can significantly save the photographer‚Äôs time - if the corresponding function is not supported by the device, then similar work is usually carried out on a PC using special graphic editors. </p>

    <p>  Another noteworthy feature of the Sony NEX 7 camera is the combination of panoramic frames.  Sony is traditionally regarded as one of the leading brands in terms of the implementation of such functions - and therefore the content obtained by using this option is of the highest quality. </p><h2>  Features of the practical use of the device </h2><p>  Let us now examine what are the practical nuances of using a camera.  First of all, we note that you can start shooting after about 0.64 after turning on the device.  This indicator is probably not the most outstanding - many competing solutions work more efficiently, but quite acceptable for most scenarios of using the camera in practice. </p><p>  One of the most popular device options is automatic shooting.  As a rule, it is carried out in 3 main modes - when recording files in JPG format with minimal compression, when recording data in RAW format, as well as in combined mode - also with the lowest compression level.  In accordance with the declared characteristics, the Sony NEX 7 camera can provide an automatic shooting speed of about 10 frames per second.  Is this so in practice? </p><p>  As tests performed by experts show, the device as a whole provides the declared speed of automatic shooting.  True, depending on the file format used, the number of frames in one series of automatic photographing will vary.  If the pictures are recorded in <span>JPEG format,</span> then there will be 13 frames in the queue, when using the RAW standard - 12, while using both formats at the same time - 11. </p>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Another parameter that is significant from the point of view of the practical operation of the device is the focusing speed.  The device in question shows excellent results in the process of measuring it.  If you use lenses for Sony NEX 7, operating in the range of 18-55 mm, then it is real to observe the focusing speed in the range of 0.11-0.22 seconds.  Many cameras in more expensive segments are slower.  In turn, if you use a lens with a constant focus, then the corresponding indicator can be even more impressive - in the range of 0.09-0.13 seconds. </p><h2>  Movie Features </h2><p>  The device in question, like many other devices of this class, can shoot video in Full HD format.  At the same time, the user can adjust such parameters as the shutter speed, aperture, sensitivity, white balance, set the necessary focus options.  At the same time, work with the appropriate settings can be carried out directly at the moment when the video is being shot.  The sound during video recording is fixed in stereo format.  It can be recorded using built-in microphones, which, experts say, work very efficiently, and when using external devices.  In addition, the sound module of the camera has such a function as suppressing noise that appears in the environment due to strong winds. </p><h2>  How much does the device cost? </h2><p>  How much does a Sony NEX 7 device cost?  The price of the camera in the Kit modification, that is, the lens that comes with the delivery set, is about 79-81 thousand rubles.  Is this a lot or not?  A review of cameras from competing brands that have similar functions suggests that the cost of the device in question is fully adequate to its capabilities and quality of work.  The photographer, one way or another, will not overpay for the brand - he will acquire a product that is competitive, primarily in terms of functionality and productivity. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Now let‚Äôs study what users say about the Sony NEX 7 camera. Reviews of device owners can be classified into the following main categories: </p><p>  - those that evaluate the appearance of the device, the convenience of managing it; </p><p>  - those that reflect the opinions of users about functionality, about the level of manufacturability of the device; </p><p>  - those that reflect the assessment of the quality of content created using the camera. </p><p>  As for the reviews of the first type, users note that the device fully complies with the main market trends regarding the use by manufacturers of advanced approaches to designing the design of manufactured devices.  The device looks modern, stylish.  Regarding the ease of use of the Sony NEX 7 camera, the reviews of photographers regarding this aspect are also very positive.  There is a high level of ergonomics of the device, the convenience of the location of the main control elements of the device, the sophisticated software interfaces. </p><p>  Regarding the functionality and manufacturability of the device, corresponding assessments are given by users with different experience in practical use of professional equipment for photographing.  Those people who have already tried cameras of other brands, as a rule, are more critical in terms of the functionality and manufacturability of the device in question.  Less experienced users tend to leave more positive reviews regarding these aspects of the device.  But in general, the functionality and level of the camera‚Äôs technology are assessed as fully consistent with current market trends, and in this sense, the device, according to users, is not inferior to its competitors. </p><p>  Another category of reviews is those that reflect opinions regarding the quality of photo-video content created using a camera.  Despite the fact that in this aspect the estimates can be very subjective, photos and videos created using the Sony NEX 7 device are characterized as having exceptionally high quality.  It is adapted not only to meet the needs of amateur users, but also to perform professional tasks that characterize the work of experienced photographers and require the highest quality requirements for photo and video files created using the appropriate type of device. </p>
