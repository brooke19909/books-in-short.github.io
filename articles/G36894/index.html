You can expect everything from the weather, the political situation of a country.  But as for the hotel, here you can be sure: certain standards of the line are the same in the states of Europe, and in Africa, and in Asia.  In this article we will talk about one such <span>hotel in Petrozavodsk</span> - Park Inn.  It belongs to the Park Inn by Radisson network.  Petrozavodsk is a city not very spoiled by the presence of international-class hotels.  Let's put it bluntly: Park Inn is the first and so far the only hotel of its class.  And if you like to travel in comfort, then you simply cannot find the best place to stay in the capital of Karelia.  In this article, after analyzing the reviews of tourists, we made a brief description of this hotel so that travelers or business travelers know what awaits them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Petrozavodsk Park Inn" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1731184.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Petrozavodsk, Park Inn: how to get to the hotel complex </h2><p>  If you arrive in the capital of Karelia from Moscow Domodedovo or from Helsinki, then <span>Besovets airport</span> will meet you <span>.</span>  From it to the Park Inn Hotel - fifteen kilometers.  You first need to get to the city center, and the hotel described by us is located in the heart of Petrozavodsk.  Nearby is the beautiful embankment of Lake Onega.  Within walking distance are the Musical and <span>National Theaters of Petrozavodsk.</span>  If you travel by car, the hotel is six kilometers from the M18 highway, which connects St. Petersburg and Murmansk.  The border with Finland runs a hundred and eighty kilometers from here.  The easiest way to get to the hotel is for those travelers who arrive in the capital of Karelia by train.  The train station is only fifty meters from the entrance to the Park Inn (Petrozavodsk).  The hotel address is Gagarin Square, 1. It‚Äôs hard not to recognize the large, new, modern-style hotel building.  This house also has a patio.  Tourists recommend the following.  If you come in the summer and like to sleep with the windows open, it is better to book rooms that look exactly there.  Views are not very original, but silence is guaranteed to you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Park Inn Petrozavodsk" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1731166.jpg" width="600"></div>

Petrozavodsk is located on the shore of Lake Onega.  This is a very beautiful place, a "calling card" and the pride of the city.  Onega Embankment from the Park Inn Hotel can be reached in leisurely steps in fifteen minutes.  The city did not forget its founder, Peter the Great.  A monument to him is also installed on the Onega embankment.  And in memory of the Battle of the Ice, the city's cathedral is named after Alexander Nevsky.  Tourists should visit the G√ºlling promenade.  Where Culture Park is currently entertaining holidaymakers, the first stone of the workshop was laid around which Petrozavodsk was formed.  In summer, a sailing regatta takes place on the waters of Lake Onega, and in winter the annual Hyperborea festival, where sculptors from all over the world compete to create the best ice statues. </p><h2>  Excursions from Petrozavodsk </h2><p>  At the Park Inn Hotel many tourists stop to make radial trips around the fabulously beautiful Karelia.

A breakfast at the hotel will satisfy even the most sophisticated gourmets. </p>
