    <h2>  Only good </h2><p>  He was born back in 1809, on August 11.  His father was a lieutenant.  Nikolai received an excellent education.  He participated in the war with Turkey, in the suppression of unrest in Poland and other hostilities, for which he received several awards.  After the resignation, being in the position of Governor General, he founded three cities, including Blagoveshchensk and Nikolaevsk-on-Amur.  But only in one of them in our time was a monument erected to Muravyov-Amursky.  Vladivostok is the city in which the monument is located.  The first monument was erected in Khabarovsk in 1891.  What did the governor earn such respect for?  Firstly, by their behavior.  Occupying a high post, the count lived modestly.  This greatly distinguished him from other officials who, holding a similar position, were primarily concerned about their well-being.  Muravyov-Amursky, on the contrary, fought financial crime. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Special merits </h2><p>  At that time, the Far East was sparsely populated.  The Governor-General did everything possible to increase the influx of population into this region.  In addition, Nikolai Nikolaevich was a zealous fighter for the abolition of serfdom.  But his main merit to Russia was that he returned to her the left bank of the Amur.  This happened after the negotiations of Muravyov-Amursky with the Chinese emperor.  They concluded the Aigun Treaty.  Since then, the border with China has not undergone changes on our maps.  <span>Nicholas the First</span> emphasized that thanks to the Governor-General, it was possible to return the territories alienated back in the 17th century, without doing so without war. </p>

    <h2>  Last shelter </h2><p>  No one will doubt that the monument to Muravyov-Amursky has been deservedly erected.  Vladivostok did not immediately become the last refuge of the count.  He died in 1881 in Paris, where he lived the last years.  And he was buried in a family crypt in Montmartre.  So wished his wife Ekaterina Nikolaevna.  But nevertheless, given the count‚Äôs merits to the Fatherland, officials considered it necessary that his remains rest on the land that he had chosen to found the city.  Therefore, in 1991 they were transported to Vladivostok and buried on the slope of the Eaglet Hill.  This place was not chosen by chance.  Indeed, from here you can clearly see the <span>Golden Horn Bay.</span>  It was she who liked the count so much that he decided to found a city here.  A mortgage cross was erected on his grave in 2000. </p>

    <h2>  Back home </h2><p>  I wonder how Muravyov-Amursky ended up in Paris?  It turns out that despite all his merits and recognition by their emperor, disagreements nevertheless arose.  Then, in 1861, Nikolai Nikolaevich left for Paris.  Where he lived twenty years before his death.  The monument to Muravyov-Amursky (Vladivostok) is located in the same square as his grave.  The square, by the way, is named after him, it is located at the intersection of Lazo and Sukhanova streets.  The monument is made of bronze.  It rises four meters high.  The monument to N. N. Muravyov-Amursky was installed in the summer of 2012.  The date of July 2 was not chosen by chance.  After all, this is the birthday of the city of Vladivostok.  The monument is considered to be an architectural landmark of the city.  The monument and the granite sarcophagus above the grave of the Governor General constitute a single memorial complex.  The monument itself depicts Muravyov-Amursky, standing to his full height, dressed in a formal tunic and clutching a scroll in his hand with the signed Aigun treaty.  The sculptor Konstantin Zinich worked on the monument. </p>
