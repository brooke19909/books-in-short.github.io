The construction of the complex is timed to a remarkable date - the first manned flight into space in April 1961 and his landing in the descent capsule of the Vostok spaceship on the field of the Leninsky Way collective farm, which was located here earlier, instead of the planned landing in Kazakhstan.  It was here, south of the city of Engels, that the Uzmorites Rumiya and Anna Takhtarova were the first to find Gagarin after landing.  This is what the Saratov region is really famous for, whose sights are famous all over Russia. </p>

    <p>  The cathedral is considered one of the oldest temples of the Lower Volga.  Initially, in its place in the years 74‚Äì75 of the 17th century, the Trinity Church was erected from wood with the blessing of the Bishop of Astrakhan Parthenius.  Ten years later, another fire destroyed it to the ground.  In 1712, history repeated itself.  After that, it was decided to build a completely new church, which stood almost without damage until the 20th century. </p><p>  One of the most ancient and idolizing masterpieces of the temple is the miraculous image of the Savior.  His appearance in the temple, according to legend, is associated with the archers, who built Saratov in its original form.  They transferred it from the Trinity-Sergius Monastery. </p><h2>  Automobile bridge </h2><p>  In order to see the above objects, it is necessary to cross the Volga River, and this is possible only through the "double-humped" automobile bridge, which is one of the main symbols of Saratov and deservedly included in the list of attractions of the Saratov region.  At the time of its construction in 1965, a 2800-meter-long bridge was the longest in Europe.  The crossing allowed connecting the left and right banks, on which the center of the region and the second largest city in the region, Engels, are located.  The construction of the bridge was experimental and was carried out by a cheap sleepless method.  On the everyday life of its construction, the feature film "The Bridge Is Built" was shot.  This is most famous for the Saratov region, the sights and memorable places of which many want to see. </p>
