    <h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  Tsar Peter actively participated in the creation and editing of this law, the basis of which is borrowed from the list of ranks of the Prussian, French, Danish and Swedish kingdoms.  Peter, having personally made amendments to the draft draft, signed it in 1721, but before publishing he ordered this law to be submitted for consideration by the Senate. </p>

    <p>  The content of the “Table of Ranks” of tsarist Russia, except for the Senate, was also considered in the Admiralty and Military Colleges, where a number of comments were made on how to place ranks, salary salaries, and the introduction of ancient Russian ranks into the table and about the elimination of the paragraph on fines for taking a place that was higher than the corresponding rank in the church.  All of these items were, however, left without further consideration in the law “Table of Ranks” (Russian Empire).  Members of the Senate Bruce and Golovkin, as well as Dmitriev-Mamonov and Matyushkin, major generals, took part in drafting the final version. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Table of grades": how they served the state in tsarist Russia </h2>

    <p>  January 24, 1722 the king approved the document.  All ranks were now divided into the following three types: state, military, and court.  They were also included in 14 different classes. </p><p>  The “Table of Ranks” in tsarist Russia numbered a total of 263 posts, but then some were abolished from it, and completely disappeared at the end of the 18th century. </p><h2>  Hereditary nobility </h2><p>  The 14th grade (Fendrick, and later, from 1730, the ensign) gave the person the right to hereditary nobility, which in the civil service was acquired upon reaching the eighth grade (the rank of college assessor), and the 14th (i.e. the college registrar) granted the right only to the nobility of its bearer. </p><p>  The hereditary nobility according to the Manifesto, published on June 11, 1845, was acquired together with production in the 8th grade (which corresponded to the staff officer rank).  Born before their fathers received it, children represented a special category.  They were called chief officer children.  Moreover, one of them could be granted hereditary nobility at the request of his father. </p><h2>  Further Changes to the Rankings </h2>

A number of civilian posts turned into the names of civilian ranks, regardless of the real duties of their representatives. </p><h2>  Abolished Names </h2><p>  For example, the names <span>"college assessor", "college</span> secretary", "state councilor", "college counselor" first meant a position that was performed by a council member with a decisive and deliberative vote, the board secretary, and also the president of the "state" board.  The president of the court was called the "court counselor."  In 1726, the aforementioned courts were abolished, and the name of the rank remained until 1917. </p><p>  The “Table of Ranks” in tsarist Russia made it possible for talented people, representatives of the lower classes, to advance, including to receive the nobility. </p><h2>  Division of ranks </h2><p>  The ranks were divided into <span>headquarters officers, chief officers</span> (up to grade 9, that is, the rank of titular adviser / captain inclusive) and generals.  The ranks of the first two classes (the highest generals) stood out especially.  They were entitled to their appeal: for chief officers - “your nobleness”, headquarters officers should be called “your high nobility”, generals - “your excellency”, and representatives of the first two classes - <span>“your</span> excellency <span>”.</span> </p><p>  The ranks of the 5th grade (state adviser / brigadier) stood apart, not being ranked either as general or officer, they were supposed to appeal as follows - "Your Highness." </p><p>  The ranks, although not separately specified, were given exclusively to men.  Wives entered a rank corresponding to their husbands, and unmarried girls were considered several ranks lower than their fathers.  A rule was also introduced, according to which a fine was imposed for claiming places and honors above his rank during official meetings and public celebrations, which was equal to the man’s two-month salary, of which 2/3 of the money should have been received by the scammer.  The same penalty was imposed for the assignment of a lower rank person to his place.  Livery, crew, lifestyle - everything should be in accordance with the rank. </p><h2>  Preference for military ranks by Peter I </h2>

    <p>  Peter I, emphasizing in everything his preference over the state military, did not want to establish for those in the civil service the corresponding ranks of the first class.  But, succumbing to Osterman’s persuasion, he equated the rank of chancellor (head of a certain diplomatic department) with considerations of diplomatic prestige. </p><p>  The rank of Privy Councilor of Class I was established only subsequently.  Peter's preference was also expressed in the fact that if in the army with the rank of grade 14 hereditary nobility was achieved, then in the public service - only with the rank of college assessor (grade 8, headquarters officer rank).  Since 1856, for this it was necessary to obtain a general rank, that is, to become a real state adviser. </p><p>  The rather low rank (not even the general rank) that the president of the "state" collegium, that is, the minister, in European terms was indicative in this respect. </p><p>  Subsequently, the ministers received the ranks of Privy Councilor and Actual Privy Councilor. </p><h2>  Influence on the nobility and society </h2>

    <p>  With the introduction of this law, the ancient ranks (devious, boyars) were not formally abolished, but their assignments have since ceased.  The “Table of Ranks” had a great influence on the historical fate of the nobility, as well as on the official schedule.  Only personal merit became the only regulator of official position.  The breed, "fatherly honor" has lost all meaning in this regard.  This is the main historical significance of such a document as the “Table of Ranks” in tsarist Russia. </p><p>  The <span>military</span> was separated from the court and <span>civil service</span> .  The acquisition of the nobility by the award of the monarch, a personal achievement was legalized.  This generally influenced the democratization of the nobility, the consolidation of its service character, as well as the division of this class into new groups - personal and local. </p><p>  The rank of lower class in military service (14th grade, Fendrick, and later, from 1730 - ensign) immediately granted the right to acquire the nobility for all descendants.  Later, in the Manifesto of 1845, only 8th grade began to give it, and in the civil service - 5th. </p>
