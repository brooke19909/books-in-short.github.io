    <p>  Since the city was founded by the Greeks, everything in it reminds of a bygone era.  In gastronomic traditions, the influence of Greek cooks is especially strong.  Local taverns serve fish and seafood dishes.  Young wine is served, and to it - cheese slices and salads from fresh vegetables. </p><p>  The lion's share of eateries is family business.  They are cozy and bright.  In the evenings, live music is played.  From the street terraces a bewitching view of the endless expanse of the sea opens.  The arbors covered by a vine are buried in flowers. </p><p>  The service in Side is leisurely.  The waiters are friendly and courteous.  Life at the resort flows slowly and measuredly. </p><h2>  First impression </h2>

    <p>  Some tourists complain that the beach is not in the sole use of the hotel, so you had to pay for sunbeds.  Employees of rental offices took 150 rubles each.  This point is contrary to official accommodation information. </p><p>  According to the Russians who come to the hotel to swim in the sea, the complex is designed for a different audience.  Our compatriots in it began to be accepted relatively recently.  For the residents of Germany, all conditions have been created to slowly drink beer by the pool, eating it with fried sausages. </p><p>  The road to the beach, if you do not use a free bus, takes about thirty minutes.  The path runs along a dusty highway.  The first flight towards the sea at 10:00, the second at 10:30, the last at 11:00.  Back vacationers are brought at 14:30 and 15:30.  The time is very inconvenient.  You have to go on foot or skip lunch. </p><p>  Someone on the way to Selge Hotel 3 * (all-inclusive meals in it ends at 14:00) is refreshing under a cold water tap in the city cemetery.  Passing cars do not stop.  Taxi drivers ask for 500 rubles.  The attitude towards Russian-speaking travelers is different than towards Europeans. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  If you want to get enough sleep at night and relax in silence, take a room whose windows face the street.  In those rooms from which the pool is visible, screams, drunken speech, loud exclamations, children's laughter, crying and other sounds are always heard.  If the restaurant doesn‚Äôt like the food, local shops will come to the rescue.  Supermarkets within walking distance.  Lukum is better to buy in the city center.  It's cheaper there.  For five packs they take 300 rubles, for seven - 400 rubles.  Sellers are not traded by the sea and are clearly overpricing. </p><p>  Since sun loungers are paid, it is better to sunbathe not on the hotel beach, but in the recreation areas of neighboring hotels.  For a set of two sun loungers and a large umbrella, they ask 450 rubles.  Sightseeing trips are advised not to book with a guide or reception staff, but in a bureau located a little further from tourist recreation. </p><h2>  Neighborhood </h2><p>  The nearest restaurants are Serenade, Miami, Bardo, Saffron.  Local chefs prepare traditional Turkish dishes, desserts according to Italian recipes, pizza, lasagna, pasta with various vegetable and meat sauces. </p><p>  Side Museum is a short drive away.  Here are the remains of architectural complexes erected by ancient Greek architects.  The procedures in the bathing center ‚ÄúSultan Hamam‚Äù are in great demand. </p><p>  Hotel guests have the opportunity to visit the bistro and bars of the neighboring hotels "Lotus", "Side Star", "Angora", "Sun Club Side". </p>
