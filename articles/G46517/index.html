For income taxed at different tax rates, the deductions are not applicable. </p><h2>  Calculation Period </h2><p>  The tax period for a standard tax deduction is considered to be a month.  The tax base for a citizen income tax may be reduced monthly by the amount of this deduction. </p><h2>  Deduction recipient </h2><p>  Individuals whose income is taxed at an income rate of thirteen percent may receive a deduction for this tax.  If there is no official earnings, no deduction is provided. </p><p>  The right is declarative in nature.  To apply for a fiscal deduction, you need to apply for a standard tax deduction.  It is not necessary to require a statement from an employee on an annual basis.  Standard deductions can be provided from year to year on the basis of a single application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax deduction for medical staff." class="if uuid-2297190" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2297190.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of Deductions </h2><p>  The Tax Code of Russia contains standard tax deductions of the following types: </p><ul><li>  on the taxpayer (citizens who meet certain conditions); </li><li>  on children of the taxpayer. </li></ul><p>  Standard deductions are provided to the citizen after a personal statement about the desire to receive fiscal benefits to the tax agent (employer) or to the inspection and the presentation of supporting documents.  There is no legalized standard application for a standard tax deduction. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Employee deduction </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wsj.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Application for deduction." class="if uuid-2297220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2297220.jpg"></div><p>  The standard tax deductions for personal income tax on a taxpayer have a number of features: </p><ul><li>  The right to a standard deduction for an employee does not have any restrictions either in monetary size or in the limit of the received income of a taxpayer citizen. </li><li>  If an individual works for several employers at once, then he can submit an application for a deduction only at one place of professional activity.  An employer is not required to check if the taxpayer is working elsewhere.  In order to avoid misunderstandings, a citizen must include in his application a clause confirming that the applicant is notified that the deduction can be provided only by one employer, and undertakes to immediately inform the employer's accounting department in case of applying for a deduction to another agent. </li><li>  The deduction has the right to accept not only the employer with whom the employee works under an employment contract, but also another tax agent (individual entrepreneur, notary, lawyer who has established a law office, a separate division of a foreign company in Russia). </li><li>  With respect to income from the sale of property, agents do not provide standard tax deductions. </li><li>  If the employee has periods of non-receipt of labor income, then the right, according to the law, to the tax deduction is not canceled, and the deduction is accumulated.  Standard tax deductions cannot be used for years and cannot be summarized.  Accumulation is only for the calendar year.  If at the end of the year due to the transfer of fiscal benefits, the employee formed an excessively paid amount on the tax on his income, then you can return it yourself by contacting the tax office. </li><li>  If a citizen has the right to claim two deductions (in the amount of five hundred rubles and in the amount of three thousand), then a deduction is provided with a maximum amount (three thousand rubles). </li><li>  If a citizen claims the deduction as a taxpayer belonging to a certain category and to a deduction for his child (s), then he is granted both deductions (for the taxpayer and for the child). </li></ul><p>  Documents provided to the employer to confirm the legal right to a standard deduction for the employee: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Employee application for standard income tax deduction. </li><li>  Documentation of the legal right to deduction (medical certificate, social examination document, certificate of a Hero of Russia or the USSR, certificate of a combatant or war veteran). </li></ul><p>  If the taxpayer decided to contact the IFTS at the place of registration with the declaration of form 3-NDFL, then he must attach to it a statement of income for the year according to form 2-NDFL, confirming the deduction of documents and a written statement addressed to the head of the tax office according to the sample. </p><h2>  Standard tax deduction of three thousand rubles </h2><div class="photo" data-original="reinventors.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nuclear weapon test." class="if uuid-2297177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2297177.jpg"></div><p>  The following categories of taxpayers are entitled to a fiscal deduction in the amount of three thousand rubles for each month of the tax period: </p><ul><li>  Participants, liquidators of the consequences of the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the industrial site "MAYAK", including those who suffered from radiation sickness and other specific diseases. </li><li>  Military personnel and civilians involved in the construction of the Shelter. </li><li>  Testers of nuclear weapons (including underground, underwater), military radioactive substances. </li><li>  Participants in the assembly of nuclear charges. </li><li>  Disabled WWII. </li><li>  Disabled I and II groups from among the military personnel. </li><li>  Disabled persons equated for security with military personnel. </li></ul><h2>  A deduction of five hundred rubles </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax deduction for military personnel." class="if uuid-2297169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2297169.jpg"></div><p>  A tax deduction of five hundred rubles for each month of the tax period is provided to the following groups of citizens: </p><ul><li>  Heroes of the USSR and Russia. </li><li>  Persons designated by the Order of Glory of three degrees. </li><li>  Participants of the Second World War. </li><li>  Disabled people of the first and second groups and disabled since childhood. </li><li>  Persons who are residents of besieged Leningrad during the Second World War were in the city from September 8, 1941 to January 27, 1944. </li><li>  Prisoners of concentration camps during the Second World War. </li><li>  People who donate their bone marrow to save the lives of others. </li><li>  Persons who became ill and suffered radiation sickness as a result of the Chernobyl accident, PA "Mayak". </li><li>  People evacuated from the territories of the defeat after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the Mayak production facility. </li><li>  Participants who performed an international duty with decisions of public authorities in the Republic of Afghanistan. </li><li>  Persons who took part in hostilities by decisions of the authorities in Russia. </li><li>  Parents of military personnel who died in the defense of the country. </li><li>  Spouses of the deceased servicemen until their re-entry into a registered marriage. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="businessadvice.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deduction to disabled persons of the first and second group." class="if uuid-2297183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2297183.jpg"></div><h2>  Standard tax deduction per child </h2><p>  A fiscal deduction is granted to parents, including adoptive parents and guardians.
