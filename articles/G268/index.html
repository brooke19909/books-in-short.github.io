Indeed, the more information about a place of interest you collect, the less will be the risk of experiencing unpleasant surprise when you arrive on a long-awaited vacation.  Therefore, travelers not only study the official description of the hotels and listen to the advice of managers from travel agencies, but also try to get acquainted with the reviews of those who have already visited this or that hotel.

Just note that almost all travelers were satisfied with their choice of place of residence.  They believe that the hotel is fully consistent with its value.  But we will understand everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lotus bay beach resort 4 hurghada" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/997897.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, according to them, the rooms here are quite spacious, well furnished, with a fresh renovation.  Since the hotel is an "old-timer", there is no new furniture and appliances here.  However, everything is in normal working condition.  If some kind of breakdown occurs, then after contacting the reception it will be quickly eliminated.  The only thing, some guests complained about the fact that standard rooms have no safes.  Therefore, valuable things have to be left in storage in the safe at the reception.  However, this did not become a serious problem for tourists.  As for the cleaning, judging by the reviews of our compatriots, they carry out it every day and quite qualitatively.  Also regularly change linen and towels. </p><p>  I liked the guests and the hotel grounds.  So, tourists found it big enough, pretty, well-groomed and clean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="egypt lotus bay beach resort 4" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/997896.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  When it comes to this issue, the opinions of travelers are often divided.  The Lotus Bay Beach Resort 4 * hotel, reviews of which we are considering, was no exception to the rule.  So, some tourists argue that the choice of dishes here is not diverse.  However, most of our compatriots disagree with this opinion.  According to them, the food here, of course, does not claim to be at the level of a five-star hotel, but the quality of cooking and their variety deserve all praise.  By the way, people who used to relax in four-star hotels claim that they didn‚Äôt have to eat so tasty, for which they were not lazy to thank the local cooks. </p><p>  As for the menu, visitors to the restaurant could always taste perfectly prepared dishes of fish, meat, poultry, snacks, salads, soups, fruits, vegetables and sweets.  Many tourists in their comments greatly praise the liver and pastries served here. </p><h2>  Restaurants, bars </h2><p>  According to some tourists, the main hotel restaurant looks more like an ordinary cafe.  However, this did not become a problem, because the main thing is the quality of the served dishes.  And the hotel has no problems with this item.  Also, our compatriots respond positively to the work of waiters and bartenders.  According to them, they were always friendly, attentive and served visitors well. </p><p>  Experienced travelers advise vacationers in the Lotus Bay Beach Resort 4 * (Hurghada), if possible, come for lunch and dinner at the very opening of the restaurant or a little later.  The fact is that the most delicious dishes and desserts are very quickly taken apart.  And if you come to the restaurant shortly before the end of lunch or dinner, then you may not get something tasty.  This does not apply to breakfast, as in the morning the food reserves are constantly replenished on the tables until the end of the meal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel lotus bay beach resort 4 [" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/997895.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Since almost all tourists stay in Egypt mainly to have a great time on the Red Sea, this point is very important in the process of choosing a hotel in this country.  As for the Lotus Bay Beach Resort, according to our compatriots, the hotel offers its guests all the conditions for a great beach holiday.  So, from residential buildings to the sea, you can literally walk in a couple of minutes.  The beach here is very large, sandy.  According to tourists, it is perfectly cleaned, so that you will not find any butts and debris in the sand.  Entering shallow water.  The bottom near the shore is sandy, and then corals are found underfoot.  Therefore, despite the fact that many vacationers went barefoot into the water, they still advise getting special shoes so as not to get hurt. </p><p>  Near the coast there is a coral reef.  According to travelers, the marine life here is not as diverse as, for example, in Sharm El Sheikh, however, armed with a snorkeling mask, you can watch funny underwater inhabitants - shrimp, moray eels, small fish, squid, crab and etc. </p><p>  Many hotel guests also note that despite the fact that there is a yacht parking nearby, the water here is very clean.  A big plus is the fact that the beach is located in the bay.  Therefore, strong winds here, as on most of the Red Sea coast, do not happen. </p><p>  However, in their reviews, tourists note one drawback of the beach.  So, according to them, the number of sunbeds on it is clearly insufficient.  In this regard, many guests are forced to get up at 6 o‚Äôclock in the morning and go to the beach to occupy the sun loungers.  Travelers hope that the administration of Lotus Bay Beach Resort will heed this comment and equip the beach with a sufficient number of sunbeds, especially since there is enough space for this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lotus bay beach resort 4 safaga" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/997894.jpg" width="485"></div>

    <h2>  Staff </h2><p>  In the comments of our compatriots, there are few complaints about the employees of the four-star Lotus Bay Beach Resort hotel.  So, according to tourists, the hotel staff as a whole are very friendly, welcoming, always happy to help.  Particularly pleased with the fact that many employees here speak Russian.
