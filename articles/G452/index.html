Numerous stresses accompanying the usual everyday life, lack of sleep and chronic fatigue extremely negatively affect a person‚Äôs well-being and his performance.  Do not forget that most Russians live far from the sea.  That is why it is important to take a vacation at least once a year, turn off the phone and go away.  What your vacation will be, it's up to you to decide for yourself, but hardly anyone will give up the opportunity to fully enjoy a beach holiday.  Only at sea we can escape from the daily routine, relax, relax, forget about all the turmoil of life and difficulties.  In summer, all directions are open for tourists and vacationers, you can even relax on the sea without leaving the country.  But what about those who went on vacation in the late fall or winter?  Of course, you can go to hot Asian countries or fly over the ocean and visit the sunny Dominican Republic.  But sometimes there may not be money for such expensive trips.  That is why we propose to pay attention to the budget alternative - Tunisia.  All the necessary conditions for a truly paradise holiday are created here. </p>

    <h2>  Resort Features </h2><p>  So, Tunisia is most often chosen for themselves by beach lovers.  The country is famous for its wide sandy beaches, warm gentle sea and the ideal <span>climate</span> for relaxation <span>.</span>  <span>Tunisia is</span> open to visitors even in winter, when most of the available resorts cannot boast of warmth and sun.  Here lovers of history and ancient culture, left to descendants from their ancestors, will also like it.  Gorgeous beaches with fine sand, majestic palm trees, pine groves and orange gardens, fabulous bays buried in verdure, unspoiled nature - all this is Tunisia.  The season here lasts from May to October, but even if you decide to come here in the winter, you will not regret it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  We decide on the hotel </h2><p>  Tunisia is famous for its excellent service, chic hotels on the first coastline, so there will be no problems with choosing a hotel for tourists.  Most hotels and guest houses are located along the coast, on the first coastline.  Tunisia hotels are endowed with spacious adjacent territory and can offer vacationers all the necessary entertainment.  One of the rather popular hotels among Russian tourists is the Smartline Hammamet Regency 4 * hotel.  How suitable is it for a beach holiday?  Why did you manage to fall in love with the Russians? </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Smartline Hammamet Regency 4 * (Tunisia)" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/1497531.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  So, I want to start the review of the hotel with the location of Smartline Hammamet Regency 4 *.  Reviews of real vacationers tell that the hotel boasts the advantage of its geographical position, occupying the southern part of the famous resort - Hammamet.  The city center is only 5 km away and the nearest airport is 44 km away.  This is the southernmost point of not only the resort, but also the country, so the season here lasts a little longer.  At the same time, tourists do not suffer from terrifying heat and heat even in the summer, at the height of the season.  And all - largely thanks to the fresh breeze and vegetation. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  If we talk about hotels in Tunisia, then the assessment of rooms must be approached more carefully and demanding.  The fact is that most vacationers do not leave the boundaries and territory of the hotel, relax, get enough sleep and enjoy the warmth.  So, by local standards, the Smartline Hammamet Regency 4 * hotel (Tunisia) is small - only 190 rooms in the building.  That is, you will not see individual bungalows and small houses on the coast.  Potential vacationers are invited to choose a room from two categories: Standard and Suite Junior.  Check-in is quick enough - the staff works quickly and tries to resettle tired tourists as soon as possible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Depending on the selected room category in the Smartline Hammamet Regency 4 * hotel, tourists can count on a balcony or terrace, which offers stunning views of the local beauty and the coast - a great opportunity to spend evenings enjoying the beauty of the sunsets.  Each room has a private bathroom with a selection of cosmetics and a hairdryer.  It is quite spacious and comfortable. </p><p>  Modern climatic equipment is responsible for maintaining a comfortable microclimate in the room.  If you read almost any review of the Smartline Hammamet Regency Hotel, you will surely find information about satellite TV and a telephone in your room.  Many tourists believe that TV on vacation is an impermissible luxury and a completely unnecessary thing.  But, believe me, for sure you will want to watch your favorite show, series or movie before going to bed.  The phone is primarily intended for communication with the hotel staff, but if necessary, you can call your relatives or friends, of course, for an additional fee. </p><p>  Tunisia, as a Muslim state, is considered a country with a high level of security.  There is practically no theft, however, the presence of a safe in the room for storing valuables, money and documents will delight all tourists.  Using it is included in the price of the hotel at the Smartline Hammamet Regency 4 * hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The rooms in the hotel are spacious and bright, there is not much furniture, but all of it is convenient and comfortable to use.  All plumbing in the bathroom is in good condition, problems and interruptions in the supply of hot water are not noticed. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  As noted earlier, Tunisia hotels boast a vast and well-maintained territory.  If you read any tourist reviews of the Smartline Hammamet Regency Hotel, you will surely find a mention of the area.  The hotel is read the greenest in Hammamet, it is literally immersed in the greenery of chic plants.  Just imagine: all this is in the middle of the desert!  That is why many tourists call the hotel an oasis, a paradise for spending their holidays. </p>

    <p>  If you get tired of the scorching sun, you can always move under a shady tree, sit by the pool. </p><h2>  Entertainment and sports </h2><p>  On the territory of the Smartline Hammamet Regency 4 * hotel (Tunisia) there are 2 huge outdoor pools, one of them is for children.  This is a favorite place for vacationers and tourists who are placed on comfortable sunbeds, take refreshing cocktails and juices from the bar and spend the whole day there.  If you plan your trip in winter, when the water in the sea becomes cool, you can swim in the indoor heated pool.  It is a worthy alternative to seawater. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has enough sports fields: tennis court, soccer field, basketball, volleyball and even golf.  That is why this option is increasingly chosen for their holidays by sports boys and girls who, in principle, cannot even imagine a beach holiday passive. </p><h2>  Animation </h2><p>  For the organization of leisure of vacationers are responsible animators.  These are young, creative and active guys who certainly will not let tourists get bored.  All lovers of chants can have fun in karaoke, take part in the show program.  Water aerobics is a favorite entertainment for the fair sex, who even on vacation do not want to lose their physical shape.  Classes are held in a very positive form, leaving vivid and extremely positive impressions. </p>

    <p>  So, if you read the reviews of tourists about the Smartline Hammamet Regency 4 * hotel, you can understand that food is not its strongest side.  For Tunisia, the food here is quite monotonous: already on the third day of stay at the hotel, tourists can accurately predict the nearest menu.  For breakfast, you can often try porridge, cereal with milk or yogurt, cottage cheese, pancakes, fruits.  For lunch and dinner, several types of meat, fish, side dishes and soups are served.  For breakfast, lunch and dinner, it is better to come at the very beginning.  Tables, of course, are replenished, but fruits and sweets scatter in the first hour.  If you arrive 30-40 minutes before the end of the meal, you will be content with what previous tourists will leave you.  Of course, in a hot country I want to see more fresh fruits, saturated with vitamins and minerals.  But, unfortunately, they are served in limited quantities here, it is often possible to meet unripe fruits.  But no one will be left hungry for sure. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  If you value first-class service and quality of room service, Smartline Hammamet Regency 4 * hotel is definitely suitable for you.  Reviews confirm daily room cleaning.  Towels are also changed daily, bed linen every 2-3 days.  In general, the room is maintained in perfect cleanliness, the staff does not interrupt the rest of tourists, is cleaned at a time when they are absent.  Tipping is optional, but none of the staff will refuse.  For a few dollars, traditional swan figurines will be laid out on your bed, shoes will be cleaned and room decorated with fresh flowers. </p><p>  Modern tourists can not imagine their lives even on vacation without the Internet.  So, throughout the Smartline Hammamet Regency 4 * hotel and even in the rooms, wireless Internet is available.  The only thing vacationers will be able to get a password from it upon checking into the room for a fee. </p>

    <p>  Continuing the topic of additional services, I want to talk about the most interesting offers from Smartline Hammamet Regency 4 *.  Reviews of tourists note that the rooms have an excellent minibar, which can be used around the clock.  At the reception, all tourists will be able to use the shuttle service to the nearest hotel, which will appeal to those vacationers who arrived in Hammamet on their own, that is, without an escort of a tourist operator.  For an additional fee, the friendly staff will put things in order: wash and iron them. </p><p>  Most tourists spend their holidays on the beach without leaving the hotel, but if you want to take an excursion, take a walk around the city, you can always contact the staff: they will give you a detailed map of the resort showing all its attractions, as well as suggest which agency is better book an excursion. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  If you are looking for the perfect place for a beach holiday on the coast, pay attention to Hammamet.  Smartline Hammamet Regency 4 * boasts its own sandy beach.  Fine white sand, crystal clear sea water - what else does a modern tourist need for a paradise holiday.  The beach is equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas, hiding from the direct rays of the scorching sun.  Here you can rent a rental of sports equipment, a yacht, do water sports under the guidance of experienced instructors. </p>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  No review will be complete and objective without a correlation of the quality of the services provided and living conditions with the cost.  The <span>Hotel Hammamet</span> Regency 4 * was no exception.  Prices for a daily stay in a standard double room start at 3500 rubles.  Of course, if a tourist wants a room with a balcony or terrace facing the coast, you will have to pay a little. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">So, the Smartline Hammamet Regency 4 * hotel (Tunisia, Hammamet) is a good option for those tourists who want to spend their holidays on the coast.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">It has everything you need to relax: a gorgeous sandy beach, a warm and clear sea, comfortable rooms, and plenty of entertainment on site.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">And, of course, all this is combined with excellent service and affordable prices.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">That is why we recommend taking a closer look at the hotel.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Moreover, even during the season, some tour operators offer tours at incredibly low prices.</span></span></span> </p>
