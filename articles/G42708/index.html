Recently, real estate has been increasingly seen with decoration, as it is most in demand among buyers.  To live in the capital, to have access to all objects of its infrastructure, to develop in the chosen direction - for the sake of this, many are sent to Moscow.  But the main obstacle to the way is housing, or rather, its absence. </p><p>  It is not rational to rent an apartment, because every month you will give a large sum of money for housing that will never belong to you.  And buying an apartment in Moscow is an impermissible luxury for most families.  Another thing is to buy a new building with decoration (from the developer) in the Moscow Region.  This is a great offer: you can save on a purchase without losing access to all infrastructure facilities.  However, there are many possible options.  But how to make the right choice?  It was for such doubting buyers that we prepared our objective review of the best new buildings and residential complexes of the Moscow Region. </p><h2>  LCD "Southern Vidnoe" </h2><p>  <span>Dreaming of your own apartment near Moscow?</span>  <span>Pay attention to the LCD "South Vidnoe".</span>  <span>We are convinced that everyone has the right to their own housing, which will become not only a quiet family nest, but also an opportunity to realize their creative potential, get a huge dog and, finally, heal exactly as he wants.</span>  <span>The project of the <span>residential complex</span> provides for the consistent construction of 14 seventeen-story houses, each of them will be painted in its own color.</span>  <span>Such a bright, rainbow-colored, uplifting complex was offered by the developer to all potential buyers.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
