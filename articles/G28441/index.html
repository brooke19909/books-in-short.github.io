Often, companies resort to less transparent and honest ways to get extra profit.  One of them is connecting to the number of so-called subscriptions.  What it is, how it works, and why the subscriber tries to refuse subscriptions (MTS, Beeline, Megafon - this applies to any operator), we will tell in this article. </p>

    <h2>  Why subscription? </h2><p>  To begin with, we describe the model by which the content gets into the user's phone as a whole.  Obviously, each of us has a smartphone at hand for most of the time.  This is natural - a person thus prefers to stay in touch.  Moreover, we often look at the screen of our device in order to know if they have missed something important.  The psychology of the so-called ‚Äúsubscriptions‚Äù is built on this - information that ‚Äúmay interest the subscriber‚Äù is displayed on the phone screen.  It relates to the provision of content, which, moreover, is paid. </p><p>  Realizing that all this costs money, but does not represent any interest for him, the subscriber is looking for how to unsubscribe from subscriptions.  MTS today is one of the most intrusive operators in this regard.  Therefore, by his example, we will analyze how everything works. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Mobile content </h2><p>  You ask: ‚ÄúAnd what do they offer the user in these very subscriptions?  What should he pay money for? ‚Äù  We answer: we are talking about various mobile services, mainly for entertainment purposes.  For example, a subscription to the service ‚ÄúHoroscopes‚Äù or ‚ÄúWeather forecast‚Äù;  access to the ‚ÄúJokes‚Äù or ‚ÄúVideo‚Äù portal - all this can occur on the MTS subscriber‚Äôs screen at any time.  Moreover, the technology for outputting these messages is such that to cancel the service, you must click the appropriate button.  Thus, it is highly likely that the client accidentally clicks on an advertising message, which will lead to withdrawals and display forecasts, anecdotes, and so on. </p><p>  That is, we can say this: the operator understands that all these services do not carry special value for the subscriber, but, using a special form for displaying these messages, relies on random clicks and the user's ignorance of the rules for providing these services. </p><h2>  Leader of Subscriptions </h2><p>  As already noted, one of the most persistent operators is MTS.  Most of all, subscribers are looking for information on how to unsubscribe from MTS subscriptions for the reason that the company really ‚Äúheaps‚Äù the phones of its subscribers with unnecessary notifications about some music hits on their paid portal or about the ability to watch video on a paid basis.  There can be quite a lot of offers, but there is only one result - the subscriber is debited, after which he receives this service, which, given the prevalence of the Internet and the ability to watch any video or forecast for free, costs nothing.  However, MTS has subscription rates. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Cost of services </h2><p>  In fact, the prices that the operator works with vary depending on the content that is provided to the subscriber.  If you read the reviews of people who were thus deceived, then the operator charged them 17 rubles a day for working with some kind of subscription.  True, there are situations when they talk about 200 rubles that were shot per day.  That is, to find out how much this or that subscription will cost, you can only read the conditions for its provision.  And everything, again, depends on the service you work with. </p><p>  For example, MTS paid subscriptions are services provided by MTS-Info, as well as the i-Free.com portal and the 0770 service. Each of these providers offers some horoscopes, jokes, and more.  When the subscriber agrees to subscribe via pop-up messages, the subscription is activated, and funds are debited from the mobile account. </p>

    <h2>  Disadvantages of Subscriptions </h2><p>  What is an advantage for content providers among ordinary subscribers is considered a significant drawback - the user is not properly informed that he has a daily charge-off due to some kind of subscription.  A person can notice that money is being withdrawn from him only after he checks the balance several times, remembering how much was there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It turns out that the operator "transfers" a person to the basis of regular withdrawals from the account without the knowledge of the subscriber.  And it makes money on it. </p><h2>  Annoying subscribers </h2>

    <p>  Obviously, how indignant people are looking for how to unsubscribe from MTS subscriptions, the fact that money regularly disappears from their account.  This is annoying, because you definitely understand that you did not order any services.  The operator insists that you were provided with paid jokes.  To the question: ‚ÄúWhy do I need jokes?‚Äù  the company replies that the subscriber has subscribed. </p><p>  The fact that the service was imposed due to carelessness and constant push messages to a smartphone is of no interest to anyone.  Therefore, in order not to lose your money in vain, we tell you how to refuse MTS subscriptions and be calm at your mobile expense. </p><h2>  How to find out connected services? </h2><p>  And the first thing you should do is check on which subscriptions you are currently subscribed to.  Only in this way can you be sure that you have disabled everything.  In turn, the management of MTS subscriptions is carried out in several ways.  We will cover all of them in this chapter. </p>

    <p>  So, the first option is to use a special team.  To find out what you are subscribed to, dial * 152 * 2 #.  This is the easiest way to check your MTS subscriptions.  You can also call 152 from the phone connected to this operator, and then select button 2 in the voice menu. </p><p>  Another option is through the site.  How to check MTS subscriptions in this way is indicated on the official portal of the company.  Just go to your personal account and select the "My Subscriptions" section.  Right on the same page you will see a list of services for which you pay your money. </p><h2>  How to manage subscriptions? </h2><p>  It should be noted that MTS subscription management can be carried out in the same ways by which you can check what you are specifically subscribed to.  And in menu 152, and in the personal account, the operator allows the subscriber to independently disable one or another option.  This is the answer to the question "How to remove subscriptions to MTS?"  The procedure is extremely simple and does not require anything special.  But it allows you to completely turn off all subscriptions or unsubscribe them one at a time, managing individually. </p><h2>  USSD commands </h2><p>  With how to find out MTS subscriptions, we figured out.  Problems with this should not arise.  All that is required of you is to make a call or access the Internet. </p>

    <p>  There is another mechanism for working with subscriptions - these are digital commands sent from your phone.  Of course, they won‚Äôt solve the problem of how to find out subscriptions on MTS - for this you need to go to the information menu.  But you can disable a service by simply typing a combination of numbers.  Here is a short list of possible subscriptions and the commands with which they are disconnected: horoscope - * 111 * 4752 #, jokes - the same combination, only instead of 4752 - 4753;  news - 4756, weather forecast - 4751 and so on.  These commands will disable MTS-Info services. </p><p>  And there are other service providers.  For example, this is menu 0770. Their list shows approximately the same opportunities as MTS: a love horoscope (to disable, you must send STLG to 770655), exchange rates (send STKV), business horoscope (STDG), music (STOP on 771160), adult video (STOP on 771202). </p><h2>  If all else fails </h2><p>  Customer reviews indicate that there are situations when nothing helps, and money continues to disappear.  How to remove MTS subscriptions in this case?  You must contact the office of the company or the contact center.  To do this, you can call the number 0890 allocated for such cases (from a mobile device) or <span>landline</span> 8 800 250 0890. After dialing the number, you will be connected to a specialist competent in this matter.  He needs to be explained that you do not know how to unsubscribe from MTS subscriptions, but would really like to do it.  Most likely, they will help you figure out what exactly is connected as an additional subscription to your number, after which an employee of the company will offer to turn off this option.  If he does, then consider that you have completed the task. </p><p>  The results can be seen later, when funds no longer disappear from the account.  You can also check if there are still any services in your room in your personal account. </p><p>  To get rid of the pop-up messages that offer to sign up for the service (we talked about them at the beginning of the article), ask the operator to activate the "Content Blocking" service.  It is free, but quite effective for hiding advertising messages. </p>
