  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Duke de Guise, nicknamed Tagged or Chopped: biography, personal life</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The second half of the 16th century in France was an era of brutal and bloody religious clashes between Catholics and Huguenots.  Henry I de Guise proved to be one of the most zealous enemies of the Protestant faith - the offspring of a noble French family, the son of the hero Francois of Lorraine killed in the battles with Protestants.  The scar left on Henry‚Äôs face after a serious wound received as a result of hitting a Huguenot with a spear became the reason for his nickname.  Subsequently, it was called none other than Labeled or Chopped.  Under these names, the Duke de Guise - an active participant and inspirer of the events of Bartholomew‚Äôs Night, who until the last breath remained a convinced Catholic, - and went down in French history. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.museeprotestant.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Peer france" class="if uuid-2710579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53750/2710579.jpg"></div><h2>  Origin </h2><p>  The founder of the influential noble family de Guise was a prominent military figure Claude Lorraine - grandfather of Henry.  He was the second offspring of Rene II, Duke of Lorraine, and therefore, not being the firstborn, he did not have the right to claim the duchy.  Moreover, his descendants could not consider it possible for themselves to occupy the French throne. </p><p>  However, the Lorraine legists, obsessed with motives of a religious and political nature, sought to prove the exact opposite, and therefore composed a false genealogy.  According to this document, the heir to Claude Lorraine could be proclaimed a monarch, as he was supposedly a descendant of the Carolingian - the imperial and royal dynasty, which had a huge influence in the state of the Franks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It was this pedigree that subsequently became one of the reasons for the murder of Heinrich Chopped, who also bore the title of Prince de Joinville. </p><h2>  Early military career </h2><p>  Henry was born in December, the last day of 1550.  He received his first baptism of fire at the age of 13, becoming one of the participants in the battle with the Huguenots during the siege of Orleans.  It was there that his father was killed.  And his eldest offspring (namely, Henry was one) automatically became a peer of France, having received this title of hereditary estate of the feudal lords. </p><p>  Three years later, he fought with the Turks, then distinguished himself in the battles of Zharnak.  All this helped de Guiseau to be considered a courageous warrior in Paris, and also contributed to the creation of his unquestioned authority among the Catholic population of France. </p><h2>  Bartholomew's Night </h2><p>  In what capital the events of Bartholomew‚Äôs Night took place, everyone knows well from the novel by Dumas the father ‚ÄúQueen Margot‚Äù.  The bloody skirmish in Paris began with the marriage of the Protestant leader - King of Navarre Heinrich - to Margarita Valois, sister of the French king. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theravenreport.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In which capital did the events of Bartholomew's Night take place" class="if uuid-2710479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53750/2710479.jpg"></div><p>  At first it seemed that this marriage would be a pretext for a truce between Protestants and Catholics.  However, for the Huguenots, the wedding was just a trap for Catherine de Medici and her son, King Charles.  Appearing at the celebration, as well as already in the capital, the followers of the Protestant faith in the amount of several tens of thousands of people were most cruelly and treacherously killed on the night of August 24, 1572. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Heinrich de Guise is not considered the organizer of the bloody events.  But he was their direct and zealous participant.  Including the murder of Gaspard Coligny - the admiral, a prominent statesman, a brilliant leader of the Huguenots - he also took over, explaining this with revenge for his father.  However, with all his hatred of the Protestants, on that unfortunate night, the Duke de Guise somehow helped to save two dozen other Gentiles, including sheltering his Protestant grandmother from death.  Some felt that the cunning duke had done all this just in case, in order to have an excuse. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Henry I de Guise" class="if uuid-2710501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53750/2710501.jpg"></div><h2>  Victories on the Love Front </h2><p>  Despite the scar on his face that crossed his entire cheek and seemed very deep, Heinrich de Guise was known as a great handsome man and received enviable attention from the ladies.  He possessed impressive shoulders, strong muscles, had a two-meter growth, thick blond hair, blue eyes and regular, nice features.  In addition, he was known as a fearless skillful warrior and a talented military leader.  All this simply could not help contributing to his victories on the love front.  Including Henry is credited with a connection with Margarita of Navarre - a brilliant, incredibly beautiful and very educated woman of that time, nee a princess from the family of Valois. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Connection with Margarita </h2><p>  While the events of Bartholomew‚Äôs Night took place in the capital, such as the wedding night of King of Navarre, it was not difficult to guess.  Soon the Protestant leader was forced to flee.  And although the wife helped in everything to her husband, their union became more a political deal, not a love affair.  Henry of Navarre (Bourbon) was not at all famous for his Puritan disposition and had lovers.  And therefore, the heiress of the clan Valois soon became interested in the Duke de Guise.  Although according to the version of Dumas the father, the mentioned connection began much earlier.  It is even possible that Heinrich the Sword laid on his love affair with the French princess and other hopes, believing that this would help him become king. </p><h2>  Holy League </h2><p>  Henry III of Valois - a man who was quite liberal towards Protestants, who also did not want to spend money on the war, but who was more eager to use the money from the treasury for balls and other entertainments - becoming king instead of Carl's deceased brother in February 1575, almost immediately He made significant concessions to the Huguenots, which caused extreme discontent of the Catholic population, as well as hatred of a high-ranking Paris nobility. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fracademic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Duke de Guise Tagged: personal life" class="if uuid-2710453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53750/2710453.jpg"></div><p>  In order to oppose the monarch‚Äôs policies, about a year after the accession of Henry III to the throne, an organization called the Holy League appeared.  Anna Nemurskaya, the mother of the Duke de Guise, is considered her main organizer.  However, the king made a subtle political move and proclaimed himself the head of the League, thereby protecting himself from it. </p><h2>  War of the Three Henry </h2><p>  In the following years, the political situation in France grew tense, the struggle for power between the leaders of various groups continued in full swing.  These fierce feuds only fanned a religious war between adherents of two Christian creeds, which was already serious. </p><p>  The Duke de Guise of the Swordsman used the League, over which he gained full control over time, to increase his influence.  For the same reason, he teamed up with dad and entered into an alliance with the Spaniards.  The fierce desire of opponents for power only fueled the death of Fran√ßois Alansonsky - the main heir to Henry III and the contender for the French throne, which occurred in 1584. </p><p>  This confrontation is called in history the war of the three Heinrichs.  The first of these was the king himself, the second was Guise.  And the third was Heinrich of Navarre - the future French king.  This fact itself already indicates that it should be considered the winner in this confrontation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": - ,, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Duke de Guise" class="if uuid-2710418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53750/2710418.jpg"></div><h2>  Conspiracy Against Existing Power </h2><p>  In these years, Henry de Guise achieved incredible power.  He was even called in a whisper the king of Paris.  In all of his endeavors, his family helped the Marked One.  It was rumored that, feeling their support, and also using the help of other influential figures, the rebellious duke had plotted against the king.  According to the plan, he was to be tonsured as a monk by a relative of the conspiratorial family Marie de Montpensier.  And the Duke de Guise with all his heart tried to take the throne in the near future of the overthrown, as was supposed, monarch. </p><p>  These events are most colorful described in the novel by Dumas.  However, accurate historical evidence that the plot did indeed take place did not exist. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fr.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marie de Montpensier and Duke de Guise" class="if uuid-2710613" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53750/2710613.jpg"></div><h2>  Death of the Marked </h2><p>  Whether the Duke de Guise, nicknamed the Marked One, wanted to take the French throne in a criminal manner and whether he was plotting against the king, is unknown.  Be that as it may, for Henry III, with all his influence growing every day, he became an extremely dangerous opponent.  Moreover, the enemies of the house of Valois from year to year became more and more.  Henry III was constantly assassinated, and there was no number of political conspiracies against him.  That is why the assassination of the Duke de Guise was very beneficial for the king.  It was committed in Blois in December 1588. </p><p>  Many supporters warned the Tagged about the impending assassination attempt, but he was too brave and presumptuous to heed the warnings.  Among those sympathizing with him was a certain Charlotte de Noirmoutier, with whom he was in secret communication.  She tried to prevent unhappiness, but could not break the frivolous carelessness of her lover. </p><p>  After the murder of the Swordman, a note was found in his pocket testifying that Henry de Guise was trying to inflate the civil war in France and asked for money from his criminal patrons.  However, it is believed that this incriminating evidence was thrown on purpose to justify the vile act of Henry III. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": Paul Delaroche,, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prince de Joinville" class="if uuid-2710527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53750/2710527.jpg"></div><h2>  Heinrich the Marked Family </h2><p>  The personal life of the Duke de Guise of the Sword is considered very busy, with many women he was in love.  But he was married to Catherine of Cleves, who, incidentally, was the cousin of the King of Navarre.  And from her he had fourteen children. </p><p>  Of the other family members, his younger brother Louis de Lorren, who received the rank of cardinal in 1578, who wholeheartedly devoted to the cause of Henry the Sword, as well as his closest associate, should be especially mentioned.  A day after the eldest brother was most treacherously killed by the daggers of the royal guards, the youngest was also arrested and starved to death in a cruel confinement. </p>
