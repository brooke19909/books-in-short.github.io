    <h2>  General requirements for clothes for babies </h2><p>  But at work, do not forget about the special requirements that must be observed, because this requires knitting for children up to a year.  You will knit or crochet, it does not matter.  It is important that finished products have the following qualities: </p><p>  - convenience; </p><p>  - naturalness; </p><p>  - softness; </p><p>  - lack of small, poorly fixed parts; </p><p>  - neat and soft seams. </p><p>  Here, perhaps, are all the basic requirements that must be observed when <span>knitting for children</span> (1 year).  Knitting needles make things softer and more delicate, but if tight knitting is necessary, you can use the hook.  And now in more detail about each of the conditions. </p><p>  As for convenience, this property of clothes is simply necessary for the baby.  What does it consist of?  Clothing for babies up to a year should have a comfortable style that will allow you to easily and quickly put it on a baby.  And one more thing: it is best if things for young children are made of natural and soft materials.  They should not be tough and scratchy.  The absence of large decorative elements is also welcome.  Since the baby spends most of his time lying and sitting for up to a year, tough and large jewelry can interfere with it and even injure him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you want to decorate <span>knitted clothes for newborns with</span> various sequins, beads, ribbons and so on, you need to carefully and reliably fix them.  This is done so that the baby could not tear off the jewelry and take it in his mouth.  It is very dangerous! </p><p>  Now you know that knitting for children up to a year with knitting needles or crochet must meet a number of mandatory conditions.  Their observance will provide comfort and safety to your baby. </p><h2>  Knitting for children with a description: elegant envelope for walking and sleeping </h2><p>  One of the <span>most necessary things for a</span> small child is an envelope for sleeping and walking.  There are different styles.  But the most popular is the sleeveless model.  For girls, you can make an openwork version, as in the photo below, for boys - solid or embossed with viscous.  The main thing is that the yarn is natural and soft. </p>

Usually no more than two skeins are left for an age of 0 to 3 months.  Buy in advance 2 matching pieces of color matching buttons.  You can tie the lace yourself, or you can use a satin ribbon 1-2 cm wide instead.

    <h2>  Backrest description </h2><p>  We start knitting from the back of the envelope.  To do this, you need to dial about 100 loops on knitting needles No. 2.  You need to navigate to the desired width of the bottom of the envelope.  Next, we knit in a straight line with the selected openwork pattern.  Any one will do.  The main thing is that you like him.  Having knitted 20 cm, you can make several decreases along the edges of the canvas.  For example, this way: reduce 2 loops from each edge through a row 3 times.  This will be enough.  3-4 cm to the edge of the armhole, go to the usual facial surface.  Next, we carry out cutouts of the armhole, performing reductions.  First 2 loops, in the next front row 3 loops, and through the row one more on both sides.  Now you can continue knitting to the neckline.  When cutting, close the middle 15-20 stitches and knit the shoulders separately.  For 3-4 rows before the end of knitting, make button loops on each strap.  Having reached the desired height and width, close all the loops.  The back is ready. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Tie the front of the envelope the same way.  The only difference from the back will be the neckline depth and shoulder length. </p><h2>  Assembly and decoration of the envelope </h2><p>  When both halves are ready, you can begin to assemble the envelope.  To do this, we fold both parts face to face and sew the side seams and the bottom of the product.  Sew buttons on the straps of the shelves.  Do not forget that you need to do this with strong threads, carefully fixing them on the envelope.  After the assembly work is completed, the decoration line is suitable.  The armholes, neck and straps of the product must be tied with a hook.  A pattern in the ‚Äúshell‚Äù technique or just a shuttlecock frill will look very good.  That's all, the elegant envelope for walking is ready! </p><p>  Knitting for children up to a year with knitting also involves the manufacture of comfortable hats.  We will consider one of the options below. </p><h2>  We knit a simple hat </h2><p>  Simple does not mean ordinary.  This model is easy to implement and looks very impressive.  It's all about the classic form and unusual decoration.  So, to knit such a hat for a little fashionista, you will need only one skein of white yarn and the remains of any other.  Better if it will be a bright contrasting shade. </p>

It can be circular, and straight, and even hosiery.  So, first you need to take measurements from the head of the child.  We measure the girth and determine the number of loops.  It will directly depend on the chosen yarn, the number of knitting needles and, of course, the size of the cap.  In our version, this is half-woolen yarn and knitting needles No. 3. The age of the child is 5-7 months. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

    <p>  We collect 50-60 loops on knitting needles and knit an elastic band.  Its height is about 3-4 cm. Next, go to the <span>front surface.</span>  Thus, we continue knitting to the required height.  In our case, it is 12-15 cm. Do not forget to change the yarn to a different color in the 7th row after the elastic.  They need to complete 3-4 rows, and then knit again with the main shade.  Next, you need to perform uniform reductions.  In four places, through an equal number of loops through a row, we make one decrease, knitting two loops together.  And so we continue until 4 loops remain on the knitting needles.  Through them we pass a small piece of yarn and tighten it well.  The remaining ends of the thread are fixed on the wrong side.  The hat is ready, it remains to complete the decoration. </p><p>  A bow for a hat can be knitted, or you can crochet.  Or maybe it will not be a bow, but a flower.  In general, it all depends on your imagination.  If you decide to exactly repeat the option in the photo, then you need to dial 15-20 loops on straight knitting needles, then continue knitting with a <span>garter stitch.</span>  In each front row, it is necessary to perform a decrease - one on each side.  Having connected 4 rows, continue work without decrease.  After 3 rows, we make increases corresponding to the previous decreases - one loop in each front row 4 times.  Having reached the initial number of loops, we finish knitting. </p><p>  Now you need to fix the bow on the cap.  For this, threads of the same color as the bow are suitable.  Having decided on the place of attachment, with the help of a thick needle and thread we fasten the bow in the center.  The finished mount should resemble a knot.  Try to securely fasten the bow, but do not overdo it.  Otherwise, you can ruin the appearance of the cap. </p><p>  Knitting hats for children is not fraught with any difficulties.  Even an inexperienced needlewoman will cope with the implementation of the model described above. </p><h2>  Other options for <span>knitted clothing</span> for children up to a year </h2><p>  There are many more necessary things for your crumbs.  One of these is a blouse with a smell.  When dressing a small child (who does not like this process), you always try to do it faster.  So, the fastener on children's clothes should be simple and convenient.  Here is such a blouse, as in the photo, - just the perfect option for clothes for newborns.  Try to knit this one, and you will appreciate the convenience of its style. </p>

Unlike the trousers from the store, they are very soft and comfortable.  Linking these is also pretty easy.  Yes, and a lot of yarn is not needed.

These trousers look very original and will suit clothes of any color. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Children's panties with straps" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17517/366841.jpg?1396806456540" width="600"></div>  The first photo shows an example of ordinary gaiters, and the second - the same, only with straps.  Of course, the second option is more comfortable to wear, since the straps do not allow trousers to slide down.  Which one you will knit, decide for yourself.
