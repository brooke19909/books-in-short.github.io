    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Hotel Astoria (Vladivostok) receives mostly positive reviews from tourists, but there are also negative aspects to living here.  It will be useful to familiarize yourself with them, and start with the pros: </p><ul><li>  Responsive and pleasant staff who try to respond quickly to any requests. </li><li>  Very tasty cuisine in the restaurant, a wide range of dishes for breakfast, even red caviar and red fish are served. </li><li>  The food in the restaurant is prepared, so to speak, literally in front of visitors. </li><li>  Meals can be delivered directly to your room, and even with an additional discount. </li><li>  The restaurant offers live music in the evenings. </li><li>  With the price / quality ratio, the latter wins. </li><li>  At the reception, apples are provided free of charge. </li><li>  Great location - near the center and the bus stop, but not located near the road, so no noise from the street. </li><li>  Beautiful interior decoration of rooms, bathroom and hall, bright, comfortable and spacious rooms. </li><li>  Cleaning is done every day, so the rooms are always clean. </li><li>  A lot of "home" accessories - a bathrobe, slippers, hygiene products, a kettle, so you can take much less things with you on a trip. </li><li>  Hotel services are very thought out and really work. </li></ul><p>  And now about the minuses that the Astoria Hotel (Vladivostok) has, according to the guests: </p><ul><li>  Poor soundproofing in rooms, especially in the bathroom. </li><li>  The ugly view from the windows is towards garages and a construction site. </li><li>  The hotel does not return ten percent of the cost of living to the client‚Äôs account under the "Hotel" program. </li><li>  Old mattresses with bulging springs on the beds. </li><li>  The refrigerator is very noisy and the toilet water is flushed. </li><li>  Sockets are in places that are not convenient for charging a laptop or phone. </li><li>  The prices in the restaurant are overpriced. </li><li>  Parking is often filled with cars of restaurant visitors, so hotel guests are not enough space. </li><li>  Hot water is supplied from the water heater, which is why its quantity is limited. </li></ul>
