After all, students graduate from institutes and leave hostels, some couples, unfortunately, get divorced and have to exchange apartments, lovers get married and want to live separately from their parents, families have children, and they, in turn, grow up over time, graduate from the institute, too. looking for their own home.  So it turns out the "cycle of apartments in nature."  Another thing is that only a few can afford luxury housing, and not everyone can afford a full-fledged "odnushka".  In this case, the drawing room attracts attention.  What is this, we will try to tell in this article. </p>

    <h2>  Where did the guestrooms come from? </h2><p>  Hotel-type apartments (KGTshki) were actively built in the Soviet Union in the 1960-1970s.  They were intended for production workers, and often built with their help.  The apartment at that time was considered a "transitional stage" between the hostel and the full-length apartment.  It was assumed that single workers or young couples without children had enough room in 9-17 square meters.  m. For their meals were intended dining rooms, which were often located on the ground floor of the same house.  And the Soviet citizen had to wash himself in public baths.  And by the time the family grows, the workers had to get a more spacious apartment.  With this point of view, the features of the layout of the rooms are connected.  But in the 90s, many industries were closed, housing ceased to be built in sufficient quantities, and the desired square meters became possible to acquire only on a commercial basis.  That’s why there are still so many people living in apartments called “gostinka”.  What it is? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What do the living rooms look like? </h2><p>  The prototype of Soviet hotel-type apartments became popular in the 20-30s.  last century in America, the so-called studio apartments.  They only differed in a slightly larger area, unlike our housing.  So, KGT is a dwelling resembling a one-room apartment, but much smaller in size, with a combined bathroom (however, sometimes only with a toilet) and a tiny kitchenette or even without it.  In addition, the living room is the building itself, where similar apartments are located.  It usually has from 5 to 16 floors, mostly without balconies.  As a rule, there is one entrance, on both sides of the stairs are apartments.  They can be from 10 to 50 on one floor, on both sides of a long corridor. </p>

    <h2>  Apartment room </h2><p>  Design features depend on the type of housing.  There are only two of them: room and apartment.  The first option is a room with a tiny entrance hall and a bathroom, in which there is a toilet and a <span>sitting bathtub.</span>  Although the latter may not be at all.  There is no space for a kitchen.  Sometimes there is a small nook without a window, which can be adapted for cooking.

    <h2>  Advantage of such housing </h2><p>  Despite the very small area, the guest rooms are in stable demand in the real estate market.  And the reason for this is a rather low price, compared with the same "odnushka".  It is only natural that yesterday’s students or young families cannot immediately afford to buy a full-length apartment, but KGT is much more democratic, and if necessary, mortgage lending to help.  Of course, often, when a realtor offers to look at a guest room, buyers refuse, considering such housing as something like a dormitory room or <span>communal apartment.</span>  However, this opinion is not correct, because, in fact, the living room is a separate, isolated housing, only a smaller area.  And quite often you can find an improved layout, and quite interesting variations on a theme from talented hosts. </p><h2>  How to equip a small car? </h2><p>  The design of the guest rooms is, of course, a complicated matter, but quite possible.  The main thing in this process is the zoning of space, the separation of the kitchen from the bedroom.  Decorative plasterboard partitions, glass structures or home decoration can help with this.  For example, on the border of the kitchen and the recreation area, you can put a rectangular dining table or bar.  Then the hostess will not have to interrupt the conversation with the guests during a meal change.  The role of the partition can also play a rack, computer desk or sofa.  Transformer furniture is ideal for such an apartment as a living room.  The photo clearly demonstrates the benefits of this solution. </p>
