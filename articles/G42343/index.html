The resort has long been popular among visitors to the country, because it is the most democratic on the entire coast.  In order to relax comfortably and enjoy basking in the sea water, it is important to choose a good hotel.  Reviews of former hotel guests will give objective information about accommodation and pastime. </p><h2>  General hotel experience </h2><p>  The full name of the hotel is Club Konakli Family Resort 5 *.  The number of stars is not fully supported by facts.  This is a delightful hotel that is full of coziness, charm and comfort.  Here you can safely relax away from city life.  But you should not expect the most luxurious service.  ‚ÄúFamily Resort‚Äù has its drawbacks, as some tourists note in their reviews.  But more on that later. </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  The hotel complex consists of five six-story buildings and four three-story villas.  When you see these buildings in front of you, you immediately notice their magnificent design.  All interiors are luxurious, made in the Ottoman style, which makes an unforgettable impression on everyone.  Importantly, the boarding house was built in 2008, and renovated in 2014.  From that moment, modern comforts and French architecture have been perfectly combined at Club Konakli Family.  For the convenience of guests in the buildings there are operating elevators. </p>

    <p>  The hotel area is approximately ten thousand square meters.  They have restaurants, bars, water slides, pools, a spa and much more.  In a word, you definitely won‚Äôt be bored here.  Everyone can find something to their liking.  What is noteworthy, the hotel has facilities for people with disabilities.  But the administration imposes a strict taboo on pets.  ‚ÄúFamily Resort‚Äù, despite its name, positions itself as a hotel complex exclusively for adults.  Therefore, there are practically no small and noisy children.  Mostly people come here to rest, as the practice of guests shows, Russians, Europeans and Turks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The location of the boarding house </h2><p>  Club Konakli Family Resort is located in the small but pretty village of Konakli (hence, by the way, the name of the hotel).  It is about a hundred kilometers away from the airport.  You can take public transport, but you will have to ride it for at least an hour and a half.  Therefore, as a rule, vacationers prefer to get to it by ordering a transfer for a fee.  In this case, the road takes no more than an hour. </p><p>  The location at the hotel complex is not the most ideal, but visitors like it.  Within walking distance there are supermarkets, ATMs, restaurants, cafes, bars and a night club.  Five kilometers away there is a wonderful relaxation area and Ulash beach.  But mostly attractions and entertainment are about ten kilometers from the hotel.  This is Cleopatra's beach, <span>amusement park, water park,</span> Damlatas cave, Alanya fortress and archaeological museum.  Also, guests enjoy visiting Ataturk Square, Red Tower, Alarakhan Fortress, the residence of the Governor, Alania Oba Stadium and the Dim River. </p><h2>  Hotel Rooms </h2><p>  The hotel has about two hundred and twenty rooms with a gorgeous view of the courtyard and the sea.  Most guests like it.  All rooms at Club Konakli Resort Motel have a beautiful Ottoman design and are equipped with high-quality modern furniture, a refrigerator, air conditioning, a bathroom and a flat-screen TV. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  Guests note that check-in begins no earlier than two in the afternoon.  They ask to free the apartments in the morning before twelve o'clock.  Although the hotel is positioned as a place of rest for adults, but upon request, the administration can provide a free cot for babies up to two years and an extra bed for children up to six years.  But they will give only one thing.  If guests come with pets, the hotel freely refuses to check in, since no animals are acceptable here. </p><p>  When canceling or changing the room reservation parameters, personnel must be warned at least two days in advance.  If this is done later or not at all, then a fine will be levied on such customers - the full amount that was paid earlier.  Pension Club Konakli periodically changes the rules of accommodation and cancellation.  Therefore, they must be checked with the staff before their arrival and purchase of tickets. </p><h2>  Catering in the hotel complex </h2><p>  Meals take place in the main restaurant according to the "buffet" system.  He works from seven in the morning until eleven in the evening.  Freshly squeezed juices for breakfast, local alcoholic and soft drinks are also served.  Ice cream is only served at seven in the evening.  For a fee, you can try real Turkish coffee and other imported drinks. </p><p>  The other restaurant has a great opportunity to taste traditional Ottoman cuisine.  His visit once a week is already included in the price of the permit, but must be recorded in advance.  If guests have a special diet, chefs are happy to offer a diet menu, but they are asked to inform about such things in advance.  A la Carte Restaurant offers a variety of delicacies, and four caf√©-bars, which are located both by the pool and on the beach, provide drinks. </p>

    <p>  Regarding food, reviews from the Club Konakli Family Resort Hotel are still negative.  Some guests note that the food is not very good.  The dishes are too simple, and the portions are very small, which does not at all correspond to a five-star hotel.  There is practically no meat on the menu, and there is no grill at all.  Sometimes guests are not happy with the quality of snacks and desserts.  In general, these shortcomings do not overshadow the stay in the boarding house of those who travel to Turkey for a different vacation, and not because of food. </p><h2>  The work of bars and restaurants </h2><p>  The main restaurant is open all day (from 7:30 to 00:30).  It offers its guests breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner and late dinner.  The Turkish restaurant receives visitors from seven to nine in the evening.  It can be eaten free once a week when staying at the Club Konakli Family Resort for at least seven nights and a preliminary reservation. </p><p>  Snacks can be enjoyed in the bars during the day.  One of them is in the main restaurant.  Open from twelve to two days and from seven to nine in the evening.  The Lobby and Garden bars are served from ten in the morning until eleven in the evening.  They also offer drinks right on the beach from ten in the morning until five in the evening. </p><h2>  Hotel Services </h2><p>  There is a public parking on site at Family Resort, which is provided free of charge to guests.  You can rent a car or bike.  By the way, the territory is guarded around the clock.  Using any service is not difficult, because the hotel complex staff speaks several languages ‚Äã‚Äã(including Russian).  At the reception you can exchange currencies, order a paid transfer around the city or to the airport.  Club Konakli Family Hotel residents can also use the services of a corridor doorman, dry cleaning, laundry, hairdresser, and medical professionals.  In addition, on the territory there is a point with commercial services, a kiosk with magazines, newspapers and souvenirs. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Pools </h2><p>  Directly in front of the buildings there is a large outdoor pool (four hundred square meters).  He works from seven in the morning until seven in the evening.  The second pool is indoor, but already smaller - 145 square meters.  Some vacationers did not like that they were unheated.  In non-hot weather and in the evening, swimming in them is no longer so comfortable.  But towels, umbrellas and deckchairs Club Konakli provided free of charge. </p><p>  A huge advantage of this hotel is the fact that it boasts a small water park.  It consists of three water slides, which, although not very winding, but they add variety to the bathing process.  As a rule, the water park works for guests twice a day for an hour and a half. </p><h2>  Rest in a hotel complex </h2><p>  On the rest in the Club Konakli Family hotel itself, reviews are found both positive and negative.  You can completely regain your strength in a Turkish bath.  For a certain amount, you can soak up the sauna, jacuzzi or enjoy a relaxing massage.  Connoisseurs of virtual reality can spend time playing computer games. </p><p>  It is worth noting a beautifully decorated hammam and a small but well-groomed orange garden with a picturesque landscape.  There, in blooming greenery, is a snack bar.  By the way, the lawn is always maintained in great shape.  On the territory there is a small playground with swings and slides.  Singing lovers can try their hand at Turkish karaoke. </p><p>  The hotel has an animation team, but not all vacationers are happy with it.  This is due to the fact that they very unobtrusively offer games and recreational activities.  It seems that people simply do not want to work and delight hotel guests.  Therefore, vacationers prefer to spend time in the Club Konakli Resort in the Spa-salon, which will help to relax and put your body in order for an additional fee. </p><h2>  Rest for sports lovers </h2>

    <p>  Aerobics, water aerobics, a gym or a fitness club will help guests stay fit.  For fans of tennis on the territory of the court set with all the amenities and concrete pavement.  Guests can also play darts and bocce.  And all this will be free if you book a room at the Family Resort. </p><p>  For an additional fee, the administration will offer other entertainment.  These are billiards, volleyball and various water sports.  Also, vacationers will have to fork out for the electric lighting of the tennis court if they want to enjoy the game not only during the day, but also at night, when there are fewer people who want it. </p><h2>  Beach of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Club Konakli in Turkey has its own beach, almost a hundred meters long.  It is located about two hundred and fifty meters from the building.  If you walk, the road will take about ten minutes.  For some guests, this seems too long, so they are unhappy with such a remoteness of the sea.  On the other hand, this is a great opportunity to enjoy a bit of the picturesque views of the resort of Konakli, without being tired of walking.  Guests who do not like to walk can always get to the beach by service bus. </p><p>  The entrance to the sea is pebbles, sand and a pier.  Many hotel guests note that the descent into the water is bad, rocky and uncomfortable.  Entrance from the pontoon almost everywhere immediately to a deep place.  But this is a common occurrence for all the beaches of Konakli.  For this reason, rest at Family Resort is not suitable for children and is positioned as a hotel for adults.  You can also go on foot to the shared beach, but tourists also leave negative reviews about it. </p><p>  On the coastal territory, Club Konakli 5 * guests are offered free sun loungers, mattresses and umbrellas.  For the use of beach towels, they are asked to leave a deposit, which is later returned if things are brought in good condition.  A lifeguard is working on the shore, there is a changing room and a shower.  There is a bar right on the beach that offers fresh juices, cold drinks and light snacks. </p>

    <h2>  Useful recommendations vacationers </h2><p>  Almost all travelers recommend going to the Turkish coast to the resort town of Konakli from May to September.  During this period, climatic conditions and the sea will be the most favorable for a vacation.  You don‚Äôt have to do a visa, just one passport is enough.  In order not to overshadow your vacation in the Club Konakli hotel complex, you need to understand that the country is Muslim.  Therefore, it is better not to walk in bathing suits outside the beach, otherwise judgmental and gaze cannot be avoided.  It is advisable to take dollars with you in advance so as not to use a disadvantageous exchange. </p><p>  In general, the Family Resort Hotel leaves a positive impression on tourists.  It is safe here, there is a Russian-speaking staff and the ability to book your favorite room online is convenient.  This is a great option to relax in nice rooms with a luxurious design.  Suitable for those who do not mind taking a little walk to the beach and who do not need culinary delights.  In addition to the kitchen and the location of the beach, this hotel fully meets the requirements of a five-star vacation. </p>
