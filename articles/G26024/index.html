They are out of fashion, bored or look too trivial.  Just throwing out once your favorite outfits is a pity.  There is only one way out - to decorate the dress with your own hands.  How to breathe new life into the product using improvised means?  Interesting ideas are considered in the article. </p><h2>  How to decorate a dress with your own hands lace </h2><p>  For many years, lace has not left fashionable pedestals.  Designers do not get tired of experimenting with it.  Decorate the dress with your own hands with lace is a great idea.  It is very easy to bring to life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="patterneasy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorate the dress with lace" class="if uuid-3079715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38228/3079715.jpg"></div><p>  The easiest way to revitalize your outfit is to sheathe a lace neckline, sleeve edges or hem.  Lace of contrasting colors will look spectacular on dark matter.  To transform a light dress, it is better to prefer dark lace. </p><p>  Girls who prefer a more complex solution can make a lace insert on the product.  A small area should be cut on the sides or on the back.  Then, from the wrong side, the selected openwork material is sewn.  If the stitches look sloppy, you can hide them under a lace or satin ribbon. </p><h2>  Beads, rhinestones </h2><p>  Do you need to decorate the dress for the New Year with your own hands?  An outfit decorated with beads will help to look festive and elegant.  For example, you can sew it on the neckline.  In this case, it is recommended to use large beads, as well as sew it with a wide strip.  A beaded collar is another original solution.  First you need to draw the shape of the collar, and then sheathe its surface in a dense row.  Instead of beads, you can use bugles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ladyzest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY dress decoration" class="if uuid-3079726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38228/3079726.jpg"></div><p>  Rhinestones can also come to the rescue if you need to prepare for the New Year's party.  To reduce the time of work, you can purchase ready-made applications from them in the store.  A thin strip of glue is located on the back side.

Similarly, you can decorate the shoulders. </p><h2>  Stylish Tips </h2><p>  Caution is required when decorating a colored multi-colored dress.  If such a product is decorated with a large number of all kinds of beads, rhinestones, stones and ribbons, then the result may be too colorful, provocative.  Those who love an abundance of brilliance, it is better to experiment with plain wardrobe elements. </p><p>  With the help of lace, you can not only enrich your image.
