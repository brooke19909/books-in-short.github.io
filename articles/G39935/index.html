A huge number of travelers seek to enter the territory rich in natural and man-made sights. </p><p>  It is not for nothing that the Veneto region in Italy is called the true treasury of the country.  Gathering all the best for tourists, the fertile region is able to satisfy the dreams of vacationers. </p><h2>  Hospitable Italy </h2><p>  All tourists from different parts of the globe are hospitably welcomed by Italy, striking in its beauty.  For many years, Veneto has been number one in attendance.  The translation of the name of the region - ‚Äúcolor gamut‚Äù - is significant and perfectly describes the appearance of the region.  The picturesque nature and unique architectural monuments will remain in the memory of travelers for a long time. </p><h2>  Oldest area </h2><p>  The name of the region comes from the tribe of Venets inhabiting the territory of the Adriatic coast.  It is believed that the founder of the region was the Roman emperor Augustus, who devoted much time to civil engineering. </p><p>  After the fall of the once great empire, the main pearl arose - Venice, which became a small but powerful republic, with which the history of the region is closely connected. </p><h2>  Seven Provinces of Veneto </h2><p>  Possessing rich culture and history, it is not in vain that Italy is a unique mecca for tourists.  Veneto is an ancient region, consisting of seven provinces, featuring a wide variety of attractions.  On the map of the region you can find a huge number of interesting places for guests of the country that can surprise even the most demanding tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The capital of the region is a beauty on the water </h2><p>  It is no exaggeration to say that the bulk of the guests rush to Italy only to visit the city, which is sung by musicians and artists, which has real magic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="veneto verona" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1369241.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The capital of the Veneto region - Venice - for good reason is considered an open-air museum.  The <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãon the water that</span> deserves special attention falls in love at first sight.  Of course, its main attraction is the transport links through the canals.  Walking along the water arteries on gondolas is incredibly popular among tourists who admire the ceremonial facades of ancient buildings facing the water surface. </p><p>  The city of bridges and romance captivates with an atmosphere of peace and tranquility.  Here everyone will find entertainment to their taste, and those who came to the traditional carnival are very impressed by what they saw as a phantasmagoria. </p><h2>  Amazing Verona </h2><p>  Another attraction of Veneto is Verona, whose fame was brought by Shakespeare's brilliant play about young lovers.  The events described in the work are reminiscent of two houses erected in the XII - XIII centuries.  And although no one proved that there really were two warring Italian families, the architectural masterpieces in which Capulet and Montecchi lived were considered symbols of love and fidelity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Juliet's House </h2><p>  Now the interior of those times when tragic events took place is recreated in the Juliet's House, and a bronze sculpture of a beautiful woman in love is installed in the courtyard.  Open to visitors, the Casa di Giulietta Museum is famous for its legendary balcony, from which the lady listened to the sweet speeches of her lover. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="veneto venice" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1369239.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are always crowds of tourists leaving Vandal graffiti and touching the polished Juliet statue.  There is a legend that everyone who touched the statue will be happy in love, and each guest tries to verify this from their own experience. </p><h2>  Restaurant, not museum </h2><p>  But with the house where Romeo allegedly lived, everything is much worse.  The city authorities several times offered to buy the old building from the owner, but the owner did not want to sell the building, but made a restaurant out of it.  Therefore, you can go to a local attraction, but only then, to eat. </p><h2>  Padua and its special atmosphere </h2><p>  No less beautiful is the province of Padova, which houses the oldest university in the country and a large number of architectural monuments.  Its capital is a small city of scientists, which will help you plunge into a special atmosphere saturated with ancient history.  Preserving several centuries old frescoes made by the great Giotto and the relics of St. Antonio, Padua captivates and gives vivid impressions to travelers. </p><h2>  Caring for the cultural heritage of Vicenza </h2><p>  The province of Vicenza is simply made for a great vacation.  The hospitable region, famous for its luxurious hotels and pensions with mud baths, provides a unique opportunity to improve your health. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="province of veneto italy" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1369233.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Wine region </h2><p>  It is impossible not to mention that the Veneto region in Italy has been holding the palm for many years in terms of production of fine wines.  The region, which presented the world with many legendary products, won the love of all connoisseurs of a sparkling drink. </p><p>  For example, red wine with the aroma of herbs and cherries ‚Äî valpolicella ‚Äî is made from corvin grapes. </p><p>  But Italians consider Amarone a unique phenomenon.  Only here a delicious drink made from dried grapes is born.  The wines on sale five years after the harvest have an unusual taste with notes of chocolate, dried fruit and coffee. </p><h2>  Kitchen Features </h2><p>  Continuing the conversation about the national features of local cuisine, it must be emphasized that at all times the eternal and always young Italy was famous for its culinary traditions.  Veneto is a true gourmet paradise.  All tourists note amazingly delicious food, the basis of which is seafood.  Restaurant chefs bake fish and shellfish, grill shrimp and sea bass. </p><p>  One of the main delicacies is carpaccio with olive oil.  Interestingly, the recipe for thinly chopped raw meat was invented in Venice.  Risotto is a national treat, and gourmets try its most varied types. </p>
