  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Spring carp fishing</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Carp is one of the <span>largest fish,</span> giving the name to the whole family.  Among fishing enthusiasts, spring fishing is very common.  Among the trophies caught using this simple device, fairly large specimens come across. </p><p>  Among fish of the cyprinid family, this fish stands out not only for its size, but also for its excellent taste, because due to the abundance of blood, carp meat tastes like beef.  Most often, carp is not caught for consumption, but out of sporting interest.  After all, hunting for carp is a very interesting occupation, it is not just fishing, but a competition on an equal footing, and without any compromises.  This fish is keen and careful.  It often floats to the top, so you should approach the place of carp bait very carefully, sneak, and not at full height.  And if there is no natural protection on the shore, for example, bushes, then it is necessary to do an artificial disguise. </p><p>  Carp can be caught both on live bait, for example, insect larvae or <span>earthworm,</span> and on vegetable, for example, corn, beans or peas.  Legumes, although similar to the natural food of carp, are considered an additional bait.  Carp fishing for peas brings a quick and stable result, but still only used from time to time.  Peas are prepared for packing in several ways.  It is first soaked and then poured into a nylon bag, poured with a small amount of water and cooked over low heat with various flavorings, such as bay leaves or dill seeds, but you can do without them.  Some people prefer to cook peas in the oven in a glass jar filled with water and covered with an iron lid.  As soon as the water evaporates and the peas turn slightly brown, the bait is ready. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For bottom fishing of this fish there are special tackle: a box, cattails.  It is very common to catch carp on a spring.  The spring is a tackle made of 1.8-2 mm thick <span>steel wire</span> , rolled into a spring with a diameter of 15 centimeters.  The resulting spring must be rolled up with a donut with a diameter of approximately 45 millimeters.  Six leads from a fishing line that can withstand a load of up to twenty kilograms are tied to a bagel.  The leash length should be 6-8 centimeters.  No need to use too small hooks.  Since the spring is quite heavy, an additional sinker is not used.  The spring can be thrown far enough, 60 meters from the coast. </p><p>  Spring carp fishing is used only in such reservoirs where the current is weak or none at all.  The bait is prepared as follows.  In the middle of the bagel, a bait is pressed from a thick porridge prepared in advance into which three hooks are stuck.  From above, the bagel is also covered with porridge and the remaining three hooks are carefully hidden.  Instead of porridge, you can use boiled dough or cake.  To know that there was a bite, small bells are tied to the end of the rod.  For the smell, a little sunflower oil is sometimes added. </p><p>  Spring carp fishing is usually used at night.  Once on the hook, the fish always fiercely resists in the first minute, so you don‚Äôt need to drag it by force to prevent the carp from breaking.  He is allowed to take a walk so that he is tired, and then, without much effort, they bring him to the shore and pull him out with the help of a sucker. </p><p>  In the past, carp was very popular in our country <span>.</span>  <span>Makukha</span> is a cake that is obtained from sunflower after squeezing the oil.  Usually they take a piece of cake the size of a matchbox and stick four hooks into the corners.  A sinker sinker is driven into the center of the flies and thrown into the water.  With this method of fishing, hooks are often spotted by the gills and severely injure the fish, therefore this method of fishing is considered barbaric and is prohibited in the West.  Now in the West, a more humane way of <span>catching carp for boilies</span> is spreading more and more <span>.</span>  This method is increasingly being used in our country, gradually replacing the old fishing methods. </p><p>  Sometimes carp are caught on completely artificial baits, such as polystyrene or cork. <br>  What makes carp swallow them is not entirely clear.  Maybe this fish is too curious?  Whatever it was, but still catching carp on artificial baits is ineffective.  In general, experienced fishermen have a lot of tricks in working with baits with the help of which they manage to catch a large carp. </p>
