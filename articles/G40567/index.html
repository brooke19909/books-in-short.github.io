    <h2>  Semenovsky parade ground </h2><p>  In the 18-19th centuries, in the area where Pioneer Square is located, three <span>regiments were</span> stationed <span>: Semenovsky,</span> Moscow and Jaegers.  After the barracks development, a free territory of 26 hectares was formed here, which was later used as a parade ground.  The northern and eastern borders of this parade ground were the modern Zagorodny Prospect and Zvenigorodskaya Street, respectively.  To date, two barracks buildings have been preserved, located on Ruzovskaya street under nos. 10 and 12. After some time, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe parade ground has significantly decreased, and after the Vvedensky canal was dug, new borders of this territory appeared - the Vvedensky and Obvodny canals . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  District History </h2><p>  What else can you tell from the history of the area where Pioneer Square is now located?  At the end of the war of 1812, the western territory of the Semenovsky regiment was settled by petty officials, merchants, and artisans.  And in the eastern territories of the Semenovsky regiment, there are the University and the Noble boarding house, in which M. I. Glinka and I. S. Turgenev once studied.  In 1836-1837, a passenger road was laid from Semenovsky Square, which connected Petersburg and Tsarskoye Selo, and also led to the city of Pavlovsk.  And at the beginning of the 19th century, the Congress House of the Moscow part was erected here, the construction of which was carried out in the style of classicism.  Currently, you can see the partially preserved facade of the building.  It is located on Zagorodny Avenue at number 37. </p><h2>  Blood sprinkled earth </h2><p>  The area where Pioneer Square is now located has been the site of political executions since the mid-19th century.  So, in 1842, a whole group of revolutionary democrats, the so-called Petrashevists, was brought here.  F.M.Dostoevsky was also in it.  The group knew that they had brought her to death, and was already ready for it, but at the last moment the death penalty was replaced by hard labor.  The last execution took place in 1881, when five people were hanged here who were preparing the assassination attempt on Alexander II. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__b38"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__b38"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__2-vn-module__b38"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__3-vn-module__b38"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__4-vn-module__b38"></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Parade ground </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, many new buildings appeared on the territory where Pioneer Square is located, including the Countess M. A. Stenbock-Fermor apartment building, built in the Art Nouveau style, the large residential building of the Rossiya Insurance Company and the building of the male gymnasium , and now the school of G. K. Shtemberg, which is built in the style of neoclassicism.  In the same period, a hippodrome was opened on the parade ground.  In addition, a printing house was built between Semyonovsky Square and Zvenigorodskaya Street, where books and albums were issued, subsequently awarded with high awards at international exhibitions.  As a result, almost the entire Semenovsky parade ground was built up.  During the Great Patriotic War, the hippodrome was destroyed.  The wasteland stood until the beginning of the 50s, and then a park appeared here, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã11 hectares.  In the same years, Marata Street, leading to Poddelstvo Lane, was extended through a former parade ground.  At the place of their intersection there was a landscaped area, which was later called Pionerskaya. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the pioneer square" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/357611.jpg?1395424089812" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Modern Pionerskaya Square (St. Petersburg) </h2><p>  The reconstruction of the square was planned for 2006.  According to the project, all concrete slabs were to be replaced here, a unique fountain complex was built.  However, funding was never realized during that period.  In 2014, it is planned to carry out major repairs in the garden of the <span>Theater of Young Spectators</span> , which includes the replacement of concrete slabs in its plan.  Currently, meetings are held on the square, fairs, celebrations of city holidays and much more. </p><h2>  Fair </h2><p>  One of the annual large-scale events of St. Petersburg is the <span>Christmas Market</span> on Pioneer Square, which until this year was held on Ostrovsky Square.  In 2014, it was already the eighth.  It was attended by 15 countries and 10 regions of Russia.  Among the guests of this event were Spain, Germany, Great Britain and the USA.  Trading areas were filled with gifts, souvenirs, all kinds of treats, goods of craftsmen and craftsmen.  In addition, this year the blacksmiths, together with representatives of the governing bodies, made good luck horseshoes, the money from the sale of which is planned to be used for charity.  The fair was visited by more than 1000 orphans who left their wishes to Santa Claus.  For pensioners, a separate entertainment program called ‚ÄúWe are always young in soul‚Äù is provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fair at the pioneer square" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/357608.jpg?1395424125227" width="600"></div>

In the New Year's Eve, here you can buy a Christmas tree, both natural and artificial. </p><h2>  Ice rink </h2><p>  In 2014, the festive market was supplemented with a new entertainment arena - an ice rink on Pioneer Square, the house of Santa <span>Claus, a sports</span> area and a children's amusement area.  The greatest attention of visitors is attracted by an ice rink located in the open air.  It is made on an aluminum basis, therefore it is able to withstand any cold and temperature changes.  For a comfortable and safe ride, the thickness of the ice and its surface are regularly checked. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="skating rink on pioneer square" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/357616.jpg?1395424160378" width="600"></div>  Skate rental is available near the rink.  In the winter season of 2014 for children under the age of 16 years, admission is free.

    <h2>  Metro </h2><p>  The easiest way to get to such a historic place as Pioneer Square is the metro.  Near the square in 2008, the Zvenigorodskaya station was opened, which is part of the Frunze-Primorsky line.  It is located between the Obvodny Canal and Sadovaya stations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer Square metro" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/357609.jpg?1395424199562" width="600"></div>  Initially, it was involved without direct access to the surface.  To connect with the rest of the lines, a transitional corridor was constructed connecting the Pushkinskaya and Zvenigorodskaya stations.  Its lobby was opened in 2009.  It is built into the five-story shopping center, which is located directly above the metro.  Ascent and descent is carried out by four escalators.  The decoration of the station itself is dedicated to the Semenovsky regiment, since its barracks were located in the area where there is now access to the surface.  The walls are faced with <span>dark green marble,</span> and the floor is paved with green granite.  The Zvenigorodskaya station is a transfer hub: on it you can go to the Kirov-Vyborg line. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer square" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/357610.jpg?1395424247543" width="585"></div>  The platform of the central hall is slightly raised.  A staircase leads from it above the paths, leading to three short corridors, at the end of which there is a small hall.  From it there is a tunnel to the Pushkinskaya station.
