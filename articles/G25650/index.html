It appeared as part of the Moscow subway routes back in the 60s of the XX century.  The Moscow Metro is an amazing place in the capital, in fact, a completely different underground city, in which its laws reign.  Many of its stations can rightfully be considered historical and artistic monuments.  How to get to the Bagrationovskaya metro station and what is around?  Let's talk about it. </p>

    <h2>  Bagrationovskaya in the constellation of other stations </h2><p>  If you carefully consider the Moscow metro scheme, you can easily understand how easier it is to get to the Bagrationovskaya metro station.  The station is located on the <span>Filevskaya line</span> between the Fili and Filevsky Park stations.  And the location is not accidental.  It is closely connected with historical events that occurred on these lands in 1812.  We will talk about these points below.  From neighboring branches - blue and black - you can get blue at the interchange nodes "Kievskaya" - "Kutuzovskaya" and "Kuntsevskaya" - "Business Center".  One of the ends of the line is located right in the heart of Moscow - near the Kremlin.  This is the station "Arbat". </p>

    <h2>  Events of the far days </h2><p>  Well, now about the events related to the area where the Bagrationovskaya metro station is located.  The area used to be called the same as the neighboring station - "Fili", flowing here in the old days, the river Filke.  On the bank of this river there was a village called Fili, which was part of the lands belonging to the representatives of the princely, and from the XVI century - the royal family of the Rurikovich.  Later it passed into the possession of a relative of the wife of Peter I Natalia Kirillovna Naryshkina Lev Naryshkin, who came from an ancient boyar clan.  Passed as a royal gift. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Naryshkin put a lot of effort and money into new lands: he built a bridge, built a church, a palace, and turned the surrounding area into a beautiful park.  Well, the village was moved a bit.  It was here that in one of the wooden peasant huts, the famous Council at Fili gathered, where the fateful decision was made to leave Moscow and a large-scale retreat.  But the strange "moving" from one place to another at a time did not cost.  The village was moved a second time.  They did not touch only the memorial hut, in which a branch of the historical museum dedicated to the Battle of Borodino and the Council at Fili will open a few centuries later. </p>

    <h2>  Named after him </h2><p>  Bagrationovskaya metro station is named after the famous Russian commander of the beginning of the 19th century, Peter Ivanovich Bagration, a native of Georgia, whose formation as a warrior and military leader took place under A.V. Suvorov.  And he showed himself most vividly with another commander - M.I. Kutuzov. </p>

    <p>  A major military leader, a participant in the Russian-Turkish war, the wars with Napoleon, in 1812 Bagration led the 2nd Western Army, which he successfully led to the place of reunification with the army of another commander, Mikhail Bogdanovich Barclay de Tolly.  He was mortally wounded in the battle of Borodino and later his remains were transferred from his hometown to the <span>Borodino field.</span>  However, Pyotr Ivanovich Bagration was not a member of the historical Military Council.  Probably, his name was immortalized in the name of the station as the name of a hero who gave his life for the fatherland in the events of that war. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And after the Filet, that is, through the station from the Bagrationovskaya metro station, the station is named after Kutuzov, the commander-in-chief of the Russian army in the Patriotic War with Napoleon Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov.  The pavilion goes to the junction of the avenue of the same name with the street, the name of which is immortalized the name of another commander of the same events, M. B. Barclay de Tolly.  An interesting coincidence: the armies of Bagration and Barclay de Tolly converged near Smolensk, as did the two Moscow highways. </p><h2>  The history of the creation of the metro station "Bagrationovskaya" </h2><p>  The station was opened in 1961, so this point of the Moscow metro is quite old.  "Bagrationovskaya" refers to the ground type, which is not in other cities of Russia.  It has two platforms, covered with translucent canopies on marble columns.  The station has no solid walls - just a fragment in the center of the platform.  As for the decor, it is practically absent, excluding several images with views of Moscow. </p>

    <p>  One of the station's rail branches leads to a depot located in Fili, and another one leads to a dead end.  The platform has not been repaired for a long time, so it was decided to close it from July 1 of the current year until the end of work. </p><h2>  Bagrationovskaya and the sights of Moscow </h2><p>  The terrain around the Bagrationovskaya metro station is changing rapidly.  But historical and cultural attractions and beautiful views of Filevsky park of culture and rest are maintained in decent condition. </p>
