  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Filevskaya line of the Moscow metro</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For a long time, the Filevskaya line was the main transport artery in the west of the capital.  However, several years ago, part of it was given to the Arbat-Pokrov branch, continued to the north-west.  So is there a need for the development of the land Filevskaya line? </p><h2>  Construction history </h2><p>  This branch has a fourth number and a beautiful blue color.  Almost all of it is shallow or even ground.  Initially, it was closely connected with the Arbat-Pokrov branch, but after the opening of the Kursk station, this radius became completely independent. </p><p>  It was the Filevskaya line station that suffered the most during the Great Patriotic War.  The reason for this was a shallow laying.  As a result, most of the stations did not tolerate enemy airstrikes.  So, part of the Arbatskaya-Smolenskaya line (Filevskaya line) was destroyed, and the metro bridge across the Moscow River was seriously damaged.  It is not surprising that immediately after the war the construction of the deep-laying radius began, duplicating the old one, and the surviving tunnels began to be used to store cars. </p>

    <p>  However, in 1955, it was decided to restore movement on this branch, as well as extend it further to the west.  Filevskaya received a second life.  In the future, she also played a role in the construction of the infrastructure of the business center on the banks of the Moscow River.  In order to increase the speed and reduce the cost of the project, a mini-metro line was brought to this area, originating from the Kievskaya station of the Filevskaya line.  So it is still too early to discard this line. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Current state </h2><p>  Now Filevskaya line is a total of 13 stations in two sections.  One of them, connecting at both ends in Arbat-Pokrovskaya, goes west - to Kuntsevo and Fili.  The other, starting from <span>the Kievskaya metro station</span> (Filevskaya line), is a small section that captures the <span>Moscow City</span> business <span>center.</span>  This radius is vital because it involves an important area in the transport network.  In the future, it is planned that this ‚Äúappendix‚Äù will be included in the new branch, so that the availability of the business center will become even higher. </p><p>  Some parts of the line under consideration are in disrepair and need urgent repair, but so far the city authorities are taking half measures and are discussing the possible complete closure of the branch for major repairs. </p>

    <h2>  Stations </h2><p>  In the context of the Moscow Metro, the Filevskaya pale blue branch is considered quite short.  She has only 13 stations with two radii: </p><ul><li>  "Alexander Garden".  It has transitions to the <span>‚ÄúLenin Library‚Äù</span> and ‚ÄúArbat‚Äù, and through one of them also to ‚ÄúBorovitskaya‚Äù.  This largest interchange hub is located in the very center of the capital and daily receives hundreds of thousands of passengers.  In the immediate vicinity of the stations are located Kremlin, Red and <span>Manezhnaya Square.</span> </li><li>  "Arbat" (Filevskaya line).  One of the most unclaimed stations (a little more than 12 thousand people a day), since most passengers prefer the neighboring branch, which has convenient crossings.  The ground lobby - one of the metro symbols - has the shape of a five-pointed star.  It is located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beginning of the Old and <span>New Arbat.</span> </li><li>  "Smolenskaya".  It is located almost flush with the submarine of the same name.  It is located at the intersection of the Arbat and the Garden Ring. </li><li>  Station "Kiev" Filevskaya line.  It is located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe station of the same name, has a transition to the Koltsevaya and Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya branches.  Trains depart from here in two directions - west to Kuntsevo and to Moscow City. </li><li>  "Exhibition".  It is located between the business part of the city and Expocenter.  In the future, after the construction of the Third Interchange Circuit, it will have a transition to the Business Center station. </li><li>  "International".  It is located in the central core of the Moscow City MIBC and, as planned, will eventually become part of a major interchange hub. </li><li>  "Student".  Located in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKievskaya street, at the moment it is practically isolated from the ground-based public transport network. </li><li>  Kutuzovskaya.  It is located under the avenue of the same name, on which it is named. </li><li>  Fili.  Located near Bagrationovsky passage.  The platform is located at the junction of the tunnel and the land section. </li><li>  Bagrationovskaya.  In the immediate vicinity of the station, the popular shopping centers Gorbushka and Gorbushkin Dvor operate. </li><li>  "Filevsky Park".  It is located in Minsk Street, named after the nearby green massif. </li><li>  "Pioneer".  It is located on the site of the old village of Mazilovo, by which they wanted to name it in the project. </li><li>  "Kuntsevskaya".  The terminal station with the transition to the Arbat-Pokrov branch.  Located in the area of <span>Rublevskoe highway.</span> </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kiev filev line" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10699/1056538.jpg" width="499"></div></h2><h2>  Nuclear submarine duplication </h2><p>  Not only guests of the capital, but also Muscovites themselves are often confused, because the Filevskaya and Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya branches partially duplicate each other not only in the direction, but also in the name of the stations.  If you go out on the wrong one, you can get lost, although the ground lobby is usually also located close to each other. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It may seem that the Filevskaya line is not needed at all, however (even if compared to some other branches this line is not too busy) it still serves a noticeable passenger flow, and therefore cannot be closed completely. </p>

    <h2>  Reconstruction </h2><p>  Since 2014, the metro management began talking about the need for urgent repair of some sections of the branch.  Since some stations of the Filevskaya line are located on the ground, they are severely affected by temperature extremes, precipitation, and other factors.  At the moment, some parts are in extremely poor condition, so there are even plans to temporarily close the entire branch (radius Kiev-Kuntsevskaya) in order to carry out major repairs.  True, this could turn into a transport accident in the west of Moscow, so this option will be resorted to only as a last resort. </p>

    <h2>  Development prospects </h2><p>  Extension of the branch to the east of the capital is impossible, and there is no particular need for this, according to authorities.  Nevertheless, the Filevskaya line has not yet exhausted its capabilities. </p><p>  Along with the problem of large-scale repairs (with the closure of stations or without similar measures), the change in the trajectory of the entire branch is also being discussed.  Perhaps Filevskaya will become an important part of the Solntsevsky radius or the Third Interchange Circuit. </p>
