    <p>  Such gadgets allow you to transmit sound waves through the bone structure of the skull to the inner ear directly, that is, bypassing air and other conductors.  This technology was developed several centuries ago.  The most striking example is the famous musical figure of those times - Beethoven, who took her into service when he started having hearing problems. </p><p>  Bone-conduction headphones do not block the inner ear and allow you to fully perceive the outside world, in our case, music and the other person on the other end of the wire. </p><p>  This technology is especially in demand in the sports field, allowing the owner to control the world around him and respond in a timely manner, for example, to warning signals of cars or communicate with the right people without losing concentration.  In addition, headphones with bone conduction are enviable among drivers and employees of large offices due to the specifics of these works.  In general, in all places where you need a clear distribution between external noise and the desired audio information. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the market of mobile gadgets you can find a lot of such devices, but not all of them are of proper quality and properly assembled.  Therefore, we will try to identify a list of the most sensible bone conduction headphones.  User reviews, expert opinions, as well as advantages and disadvantages of models will be considered in this article. </p><h2>  Aftershokz bluez 2 </h2><p>  This model can be called something in between the budget products of the brand and the premium class.  The Bluez 2 model is a bit more modest than the acclaimed AfterShokz Trekz Titanium headphones with bone conduction, but it is also much cheaper, not inferior, or even surpassed similar gadgets in this segment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bone conduction headphones" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/1722342.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In general, the AfterShokz brand is a kind of benchmark for other manufacturers, producing exclusively high-quality devices since 2001.  It is the products of this company that began to identify the concept of "bone conduction = sport", despite the fact that the scope of this technology is much wider. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  BlueSh Series AfterShokz headphones with bone-conduction sound work in the frequency range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz with a speaker sensitivity of 100 dB.  The gadget is easily fixed on the back of the head and does not interfere.  Even during intense training, the device does not slip and is practically not felt, all the more it weighs only 41 grams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bone conduction headphones reviews" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/1722343.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Bluez 2 is a bluetooth-powered, <span>wireless</span> , bone-conduction headphone <em></em>  <em>-</em> protocol version 2.1.  The range of communication with the receiver varies within 10 meters, which is very good for this kind of gadgets.  On one charge in intensive mode, the device will easily work up to 6 hours, and in standby mode it can be up to ten days.  The lithium-ion battery charges in two hours from a standard 220 V outlet. </p><p>  Owners speak very warmly about the model.  They appreciated the ergonomics of the gadget, high-quality sound output, a sensitive microphone and a nice looking appearance.  Some users complain about a modest battery life, but something needs to be sacrificed for the sake of ergonomics. </p><h2>  Damson headbones </h2><p>  Damson's bone conduction headphones, and the entire headset of this brand, are strictly divided into two categories - sports and for the hearing impaired.  The sports model will easily survive rain, snow and sweating.  A wireless gadget works according to the Bluetooth protocol version 3.0 at a distance of 10 meters and is mounted on the cheekbones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aftershokz bone conduction headphones" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/1722344.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is a convenient control panel on the case, which is responsible for working with the main functionality.  In addition, the model is equipped with voice dialing support, which for some athletes is a critical factor when buying this kind of equipment. </p><h2>  Gadget Features </h2><p>  <span>The frequency range</span> ranges from 50 Hz to 20 kHz, and the sound at the output is quite acceptable.  For ‚Äúheavy‚Äù compositions, the model may not be so well suited, but for pop music and classical tracks, that's it. </p><p>  The gadget is equipped with a 320 mAh battery, so we can say that the battery life of the device is approximately at a level slightly above average (8-10 hours). </p><p>  Owners mostly respond positively about the model.  Here we see a very affordable price tag, good sound, good battery life and attractive appearance.  Some users complain about ergonomics, or rather, the weight of the device, but otherwise the battery would run out in a matter of hours. </p><h2>  Beasun </h2><p>  Beasun bone conduction headphones can only be purchased on sites in the Middle Kingdom.  But despite the occasional problems with delivery times or completeness, the purchase is worth it.  The model turned out to be surprisingly high quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bone conduction wireless headphones" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/1722345.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, the gadget has a prefabricated design, which is very convenient for those who play sports on the way to work or somewhere else.  Headphones fit perfectly in your pocket or purse.  On sale you can find models of different colors - from classic black to ‚Äúfunny‚Äù tones, so there are plenty to choose from. </p><h2>  Gadget features </h2><p>  Also, the headphones have a noise reduction function, which is an indispensable attribute for urban gadgets.  The frequency range ranges from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, and the maximum sound sensitivity is in the region of 120 dB. </p><p>  The gadget operates on the Bluetooth protocol of the third version in a radius of 10-15 meters.  The battery life is up to 8 hours of talk time and up to 6 hours of listening to music, which is very good.  The kit comes with a convenient cloth cover and special ear plugs. </p><p>  Owners leave mostly positive reviews about these headphones.  Users appreciated the good sound, a variety of colors, ergonomics of the model, as well as rich equipment.  Some even complain about the lack of English in the manual, but for this kind of gadget it is not so critical. </p><h2>  YJKgroup </h2><p>  Surprisingly, the company, which produces rubber gloves and diving flippers, seriously took up the field of headphones.  Bone-conduction wireless gadget models were cleanly copied from the successful AfterShokz series. </p><p>  Naturally, the price tag for the device, as well as the characteristics corresponding to, that is, slightly lower and slightly worse.  But despite the frank plagiarism, YJKgroup models are in enviable demand among athletes, as they say, in the middle hand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aftershokz trekz titanuim bone conduction headphones" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1722414.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The maximum sensitivity of the speakers is within 40 dB, which is a little compared with previous models, but this is more or less enough for a normal, not very noisy street.  The frequency range ranges from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. </p><p>  The battery life is also not impressive, as is the battery capacity - 6 hours of talk / 220 mAh.  But this is noticeably higher than other less successful fakes. </p><p>  Owners speak rather warmly about the company's models.  Here the main calculation is mainly for a low price tag, but even despite the quite affordable price, the model boasts acceptable characteristics for an ordinary sports fan.  In addition, you rarely come across sensible fakes from the Middle Kingdom, which are the models from YJKgroup. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  As a result, we can say that most of the models that are presented on the Chinese market, to one degree or another, copy the so-called standard - AfterShokz brand.  But this point is not without objective reasons, because any design of a sports gadget with bone conduction is very closed, that is, here we see almost the only mounting option - cheekbones, which, in turn, rigidly dictates the shape of the headband. </p><p>  The difference can only be in the location of the controls and the presence of some additional brackets or other similar "chips". </p>
