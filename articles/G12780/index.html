Actually, roughly speaking, civil strife - this is the hostile relationship between relatives within the family, the contention of its close members. </p><h2>  Common sense </h2><p>  Now this concept is used in a wider context - direct and figurative.  Civil strife is not only a family feud.  Still - significant disagreements on various issues between any people, a swarm between political and <span>public figures,</span> groups, regions, even countries.  The concept is also used in relation to management personnel or several related companies, for example, civil strife of directors or enterprises.  In a sense, the <span>civil war</span> between the population of Russia of the 20th century is also a feud, when a brother rebelled against his brother, his son killed his father. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="feud is" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/697162.jpg" width="444"></div>

    <h2>  Princely feuds </h2><p>  In the historical context, the concept is usually used in relation to wars for power and territory between relatives-princes in the era of Kievan Rus.  The main time period of these historical wars fell on the tenth-eleventh centuries. </p><h2>  Causes </h2><p>  The main reason can be distinguished: in the territories subject to princes, in those years there was no single state, no general centralization of power.  According to historical data, there was also no tradition to transfer power to the eldest of sons.  And since the <span>great princes</span> left behind many heirs and sons, civil strife was the most common way out of the existing situation in the struggle for power.  We can say that at a certain stage in the history of Russia (about the 13th century), rulers simply doomed the heirs to endless enmity.  However, even after gaining power, for example, in one of the <span>big cities, the</span> heirs also sought to gain control in Kiev itself.  And civil strife is a struggle for the redistribution of territories, the desire of some princes, on the contrary, is less dependent on the Kiev authorities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="princely feuds" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/697161.jpg" width="435"></div>

    <h2>  Classification </h2><p>  In the history of Russia, it is customary to distinguish several stages of such enmity.  The first dates back to the 10th century, when there was a feud between the sons of Svyatoslav.  The second (beginning of the 11th century) is the struggle for supremacy between the sons of Prince Vladimir.  And at the end of the 11th century, the sons of Yaroslav made attempts to redistribute the inheritance.  All these endless wars were bloody enough, and, in fact, led to the mass death of the Russian people - ordinary peasants, townspeople, combatants, as well as heirs, who were less fortunate in the redistribution of territories and power. </p>
