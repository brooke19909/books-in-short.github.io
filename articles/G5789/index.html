    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  The hotel complex, built in the traditional Arabic style, was opened ten years ago, in 2006.  The last restoration was carried out in 2010, so everything inside is beautiful and modern. </p><p>  And there is Golden Tulip Khatt Springs Resort SPA in Ras Al Khaimah.  This emirate is located in the northern part of the UAE.  This region is of particular interest to tourists.  It is here that tours are organized that are focused not only on beach vacations, but also on acquaintance with cultural attractions.  After all, it is here that the ancient city of Julfar with watchtowers and forts is located. </p><p>  The hotel is urban, it is located at the foot of the majestic Mount Hajar.  It takes about 30 minutes to go to the sea, but a free bus belonging to the hotel takes everyone there.  By the way, even from the hotel there are routes to the most popular shopping centers in Ras al-Khaimah.  Dubai Airport is about 50 minutes away. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is in the hotel? </h2><p>  On the territory of the Golden Tulip Khatt Springs Resort SPA Wi-Fi is provided, but for 60 dirhams per day (about 1000 rubles at the current rate).  There is free parking near the hotel.  In the lobby, guests can see the 24-hour reception, currency exchange, a tour desk (ticket sales are also available) and luggage storage.  Concierge services are also available. </p><p>  The hotel also has a laundry with dry cleaning, where they still clean shoes, iron clothes and can even compress trousers.  There are conditions for business travelers - one conference room (with a capacity for 60-70 people), a meeting room and a business center.  There are also several shops on the territory (among them souvenir and food) and car rental. </p><p>  In addition to free trips to the beach and the shopping center, the hotel provides a shuttle service to / from the airport, VIP services, non-smoking rooms, apartments for tourists with disabilities, as well as food, drinks, packed lunches and fresh newspapers. </p><p>  I am glad that the staff speaks nine different languages.  To be more precise, he speaks Arabic, Azerbaijani, German, English, French, Filipino, Hindi, Urdu and even Russian. </p>

    <h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  There are several ways to have fun at Golden Tulip Khatt Springs Resort SPA.  It features a year-round outdoor pool and a sun terrace.  There are also hot springs, which are known as onsen.  An indoor pool is also available, as is a modern gym.  By the way, while adults have fun, their children can play on the playground.  Baby sitting will be organized - professional educators work here, who can be hired for an additional fee. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Golden Tulip Khatt Springs Resort SPA 4 * hotel, the photo of which is provided above, has its own SPA center with a thermal pool, a sauna, an ice grotto, and another 14 treatment and massage rooms.  You can also do yoga or meditation here.  Ayurvedic treatments are also very popular here.  However, a full list of services offered by the SPA center is available upon arrival. </p><h2>  The hot springs </h2><p>  This is the main advantage of the Golden Tulip Khatt Springs Resort SPA.  The reviews left by people who rested here confirm this fact. </p><p>  A separate complex was erected above the hot springs, to which you need to go down the stairs with a canopy from the sun.  Or along the ring road.  Polite staff greets in the building, offering to sign up in a customer book.  There you need to indicate the number of the room in which the guests live, the number of people and time.  Then they give out towels and offer treatments. </p><p>  The complex has been operating since 7 am, and at this time there are no visitors.  So if you want silence and absolute solitude, you can come directly to the opening. </p><p>  The room is divided into female and male zones.  The pool is located under a canopy, outside, and steps lead to it.  And around - a picturesque area with flowering vegetation and palm trees, where you can walk.  The water in the bath is about 40-45 degrees.  On the contrary, you can see the clock, so you can monitor the time.  After all, everyone knows - in order for this procedure to be beneficial, you need to start from 5 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Standards for two </h2><p>  Golden Tulip Khatt Springs Resort SPA 4 * has rooms of various categories.  But the most economical option, as, however, is everywhere, here are considered standards designed for two tourists.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthese rooms is not bad - 35 square meters.  m. Inside there is a large 2-double bed, there is a TV with satellite and cable channels, a telephone, two safes (one for a laptop), air conditioning, as well as ironing facilities and even a trouser press.  However, this is not all. </p><p>  The room is equipped with a work desk and a seating area, a wardrobe, a dining area, a refrigerator, a minibar, an electric kettle and a plumbing unit.  The latter also has everything you need - a shower (hydromassage, by the way), a bathtub, a hairdryer, slippers and bathrobes for each guest, hygiene kits.  By the way, they are pretty good.  The kits contain shampoos, shower gels, body lotions, cotton buds, hair caps, as well as a ‚Äútooth‚Äù set (with paste and brushes).  Glasses, coffee, tea, sugar and water are attached to the kettle.  All supplies are regularly replenished by the maid during cleaning. </p><p>  The standard cost (without discounts) of a weekly stay in these apartments is 40 thousand rubles.  If you order full board, the price will increase to 60 thousand rubles.  During periods of discounts, you can save half.  The most ‚Äúbudgetary‚Äù rest time is autumn and winter.  You can also save if you book a room as close as possible (by date) to the arrival. </p><h2>  Superior rooms </h2><p>  Apartments of this category also have the Golden Tulip Khatt Springs Resort SPA.  Improved standards are distinguished by a larger area (40 sq. M), as well as the ability to choose beds.  There is an option with both two standard, separate, and one large, for 2 guests.  In terms of other conditions and amenities - the same standards. </p><p>  But the price is different.  The standard cost of a weekly stay in superior rooms is 52 thousand rubles.  If you take the full board, you will have to pay a little less than 80 thousand rubles. </p><p>  By the way, it is worth noting that all prices are excluding tourist tax and room service tax.  This is 10 percent of the total amount, paid separately during the stay. </p>

    <h2>  Deluxe </h2><p>  And these rooms can also be booked at Golden Tulip Khatt Springs Resort SPA (UAE).  They, as you might guess, are the most expensive here. </p><p>  The deluxe area is 45 square meters.  m. Inside a cozy bedroom has a huge bed for two people.  In addition to all the amenities listed above, there is also a coffee maker.  Otherwise, there are no differences from the standards.  Excluding price.  62 thousand rubles  - standard weekly rate for two people.  If you need a full board, you will have to pay 90 thousand rubles. </p><p>  By the way, it is interesting that for guests with a small child who has paid at least 5 days of stay in the standard, superior apartments are provided as a compliment.  Naturally, for free.  Do guests have two children?  So they will be provided with deluxe. </p><p>  And on arrival, the newlyweds are greeted with a cake, a vase of fresh fruit and a certificate for visiting a private area in the pool. </p><h2>  Worth knowing </h2><p>  Hotel Golden Tulip Khatt Springs Resort SPA 4 * (United Arab Emirates) begins to register guests at 15:00.  Departure lasts until noon.  It is worth knowing that you can live here with children, and those who are not 6 years old are accommodated for free (but if there are no more than two of them).  For older, you need to pay 150 dirh per night (about 2550 rubles).  Exactly the same as for extra adult guests.  Incidentally, an extra bed can be added to the room. </p><p>  Upon check-in, you will need to confirm your identity.  The hotel accepts an identity card from a UAE citizen or from a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council.  But, of course, it is very unlikely that residents of foreign countries have this, because they just need the original passport. </p><p>  It‚Äôs also worth knowing that the price of apartments with full board or HB (breakfast + dinner) includes two more tickets to the local Ice Land water park. </p>

    <h2>  Staff </h2><p>  People leaving feedback about spending time at Golden Tulip Khatt Springs Resort SPA often notice the work of the hotel staff.  The staff here is highly qualified, faithfully performing all their duties, trying to please the guests as much as possible. </p><p>  Guests assure - if you need something, you just have to ask.  For example, sockets in rooms are European.  But if you ask at the reception, then immediately a specialist will come who will solve this issue, and the connector will fit the guests' devices.  Tourists also say that from the restaurant they took with them what they call ‚Äúlittle things‚Äù - fruits, sandwiches, a bottle of some drink, no one makes any comments.  The waiters in the establishments are also good - polite and efficient, the dishes are brought with heat from the heat.  Orders, in general, do not delay.  But bartenders know a large number of cocktail recipes - you just have to ask, and everything will be done.  So the level of service is decent. </p><h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Hotel Golden Tulip Khatt Springs Resort SPA 4 * reviews receive mostly positive.  Many aesthetes like architecture and design - the complex looks like a fortress of medieval times with towers.  Pretty original.  And everything looks exquisite inside. </p><p>  If you decide to take all inclusive, you will not have to regret it.  The cuisine is delicious and varied, the bar is full, with expensive drinks.  And the staff is nice.  Mostly Malaysians work at the hotel, but they speak excellent English and other previously mentioned languages. </p><p>  If guests relax in the winter, then for the Christmas dinner (he settles here), guests are invited to a Russian-language postcard for the festival.  Although in the UAE, the seventh of January is a normal day. </p><p>  True, there is one small minus.  Golden Tulip Khatt Springs Resort SPA, photo of which is provided above, is considered by UAE citizens as a good sanatorium.  So from Thursday to Saturday a lot of Arabs come to the hotel - starting from the companies of young people and ending with large families.  So for a while the hotel turns into a noisy place. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Budget, but full of impressions, relaxation in a cozy and comfortable place - that's what the Golden Tulip Khatt Springs Resort SPA 4 * hotel is ideally suited for.  UAE, Ras al-Khaimah is a rather expensive resort, but this hotel pleases with reasonable prices.  A great option for people who want to improve their health, since most of them go here for the sources mentioned earlier.  But for those people who want to relax with their children or get to know the local flavor, the hotel is unlikely to be suitable, since everything necessary for this is far away. </p>
