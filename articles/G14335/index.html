  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hotels in India - all you wanted to know about them.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  India is a country that can be visited endlessly.  It is multifaceted, and in its different areas you will come across a different lifestyle, well-being, climate and culture.  Be prepared for the fact that the resorts of India have different services and pricing.  Before you go on a trip to this country, read online reviews of hotels in India, as it is very important to choose the right place to stay.  Adequately evaluate your financial capabilities, because in this country there are offers for any wallet. </p><p>  Hotels in India, which have a category of 5 stars, are entire palaces on the ocean.  Here you will find well-trained staff, magnificent interiors and architectural forms, luxurious rooms, lots of additional services and clean beaches.  Such hotels are usually part of international chains.  But hotels that have a lower category, as a rule, belong to local families and Indian companies.  Four-star hotels also provide guests with a wide range of services, offer excellent service and various interesting programs to improve the mind and body. </p><p>  Hotels in India that have 3 stars require careful attention to their choice.  This is due to the fact that their compliance with the category depends on the location.  If you go to one of the popular resorts in the country, you will find in these hotels quite decent service and cleanliness.  But going to a three-star hotel in central India can run into very poor conditions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are also 2-star hotels in this country.  They differ from others in Spartan conditions and almost complete lack of cleanliness.  It is believed that these options are chosen mainly by young people. </p><p>  Now let's talk about which hotels in India are the most popular.  From the highest category, you can immediately call Goa Marriott Resort 5 *, which is located in Goa.  This is an extra class hotel.  Its Chinese restaurant is considered the best in the resort.  And this hotel is known not only for its high level of service and a wide range of services, but also for its professional diving school.  Around it boils the tourist life of Goa. </p><p>  The Fortune Select Regina is very conveniently located.  Guests are offered 102 comfortable rooms that are equipped with all necessary furniture.  There is a business center, laundry, parking, an outdoor pool, a beauty salon and many more interesting and useful things.  For those who want to enjoy delicious food, there are two restaurants, including <span>Indian cuisine,</span> as well as a grill bar. </p><p>  A more economical option is the Rococco &amp; Ashvem 3 * hotel, which is located next to the secluded and clean <span>beach of North Goa.</span>  Tourists will be able to watch dolphins swimming close to the shore.  Another three star popular hotel is Sonesta Inn.  It is a calm, beautiful place with interesting architecture and a very convenient location.  Fifty-five rooms are equipped with modern furniture and look elegant and stylish.  Local activities include a jacuzzi, fitness center, outdoor pool and Turkish bath.  There is an outdoor cafe, a bar and a disco bar. </p><p>  In addition to a beach holiday, India can also offer guests ski resorts.  For example, Auli is famous for the best slopes in Asia and the longest <span>cable car</span> (4 km).  The resort of Dayara-Bugayal offers stunning views of the Himalayas.  And Kufri is the oldest ski resort, which however does not affect the quality of service.  All these places to relax are united by the fact that they have good hotels with carefully thought-out interiors and excellent staff. </p><p>  You will definitely like India and will subsequently beckon you to touch its mysterious world once again.  And hotels in India, for sure, will leave only good impressions. </p>
