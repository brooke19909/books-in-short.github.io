What is iCloud and how to use it</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There was a time when cloud storage was just a high-tech term used by industry insiders.  Now everything is different, and each user can access such services.  They are designed to make your life easier by significantly expanding the memory size of your device using digital tools.  Where is the cloud in the iPhone and how to use it? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lynda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cloud storage" class="if uuid-2885150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2885150.jpg"></div><h2>  What is cloud storage? </h2><p>  The name "cloud storage" is associated with information floating in the air, but this is not so in practice.  When you store something in the "cloud", this data is on a remote server.  This is contrary to saving directly to your device.  Then these servers can be remotely accessible to users.  Typically, these servers are owned and operated by the hosting company that supports them. </p><p>  So why is it called a ‚Äúcloud‚Äù?  The origins of this phrase are traced from the first days of the Internet.  Then, cloud drawings were used to represent the telephone company that provided Internet access.  This term has recently been carried over to the modern era.  Where is the cloud in the iPhone and why is it needed? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why is it useful to use cloud storage? </h2><p>  There are several good reasons to use cloud storage.  For example, Apple likes to charge extra for increasing device memory.  The problem is that modern devices continue to consume more and more storage space.  Despite this, Apple is not going to reduce the cost of iPhone models by 256 GB, so an alternative is needed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onlinebuymobile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to save to the cloud on an iPhone" class="if uuid-2885153" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2885153.jpg"></div><p>  That is the cloud storage.  Remote servers can store a ton of photos, videos and other data at a reasonable price.  In addition, you rarely have to take additional steps to access them. </p><p>  Cloud storage also makes it easy to transfer data between multiple devices.  Imagine a simple process of copying photos from your phone to a PC without a cloud.  You will have to deal with wires or the cumbersome process of sending files by email.  Synchronizing your iPhone with the cloud avoids this. </p><p>  However, one of the most often forgotten benefits of cloud storage is the backup options that it offers.  Ideally, you should make a copy of each important file that you have on the server.  This will allow you not to worry about the risks of losing information. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, the best reason for using cloud storage is relatively simple: this is the future.  People may one day live in an era when the cloud will become the dominant method of data storage.  Therefore, it is best to familiarize yourself with this now. </p><h2>  How hard is it to use cloud storage? </h2><p>  With the right service, cloud storage is incredibly easy to use.  Most modern devices give you the ability to immediately save to the cloud.  From there, access to your data is as simple as through the built-in media. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.backblaze.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is icloud" class="if uuid-2885152" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2885152.jpg"></div><p>  The main obstacle when working with cloud storage is data management.  It is possible to enter the cloud from an iPhone, but this requires a third-party browser.  In addition, it is difficult to have information in several places.  Fortunately, most cloud services make it easy to automatically back up data and manage your files. </p><h2>  How much cloud storage do you need? </h2><p>  It depends a lot on your needs.  If you are a business owner, you need as much as you can get, because the cloud is best for you to create copies.  Based on your needs, this may mean subscribing to a service that allows you to store terabytes.  Since you can always enter the cloud from an iPhone, on a paid basis you get the ability to reserve any information. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, such storage space may not be necessary for everyone.  If you are a mobile user who just wants to back up some photos and videos, think of a service that allows you to store about half of the space available on your mobile device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.backblaze.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find photos in the cloud in iphone" class="if uuid-2885155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2885155.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, look at how much space your photos and videos occupy, and get the service that you practically need.  Just keep in mind that your needs can grow. </p><h2>  What is iCloud? </h2><p>  iCloud Drive is Apple's document and file management solution for iOS and Mac.  If you have an icloud account, you can use this repository.  Subscription prices range from free to $ 19.99 per month, depending on your volume needs.  First of all, you will need to complete the setup process and get started with iCloud Drive. </p><h2>  How to enable iCloud Drive manually on iPhone </h2><p>  What is iCloud in practice and how to connect it?  When you upgrade iOS from the old version, you will need to indicate whether you want to update iCloud Drive.  If you answered yes, you no longer need to do anything.  But if you chose ‚Äúno,‚Äù you can turn on iCloud Drive with just a few taps by following these steps: </p><ol><li>  Launch the Settings app on your iPhone running iOS 8 or higher. </li><li>  Click on iCloud. </li><li>  Click on iCloud Drive. </li><li>  Enable the option for cloud storage. </li></ol><p>  You may receive a pop-up warning if you have other iOS and OS X devices that are not currently using iCloud Drive.  Remember that they must all be updated to ensure compatibility between them.  So just repeat this process on each of them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to enter icloud cloud from iphone" class="if uuid-2885174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2885174.jpg"></div><h2>  How to choose an iCloud Drive subscription plan </h2><p>  By default, iCloud Drive comes with 5 GB of free space.  This is the same amount that you previously received for backups.  Where is the cloud in the iPhone?  In new versions, it is accessed through the Files application. </p><p>  If you feel that this is not enough, you can subscribe to more GB.  Or, if you already pay for an iCloud subscription, you can change it to fit your current needs. </p><p>  This process is performed as follows: </p><ol><li>  Launch the Settings app on your iPhone. </li><li>  Click on iCloud. </li><li>  Next, click "Storage." </li><li>  Click Change Storage Plan. </li><li>  Choose the tariff that best suits your needs. </li><li>  Click "Buy" in the upper right corner. </li><li>  Log in to your iCloud account to complete the purchase. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Your storage will change immediately and you will see the selected subscription. </p><h2>  How to use iCloud Drive on your iPhone </h2><p>  The great thing about iCloud Drive for iOS is that it always works.  You do not need to do anything or customize.  As soon as you log in to your iCloud Drive account, any cloud storage application will give you options for opening and saving documents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.makeuseof.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone sync with the cloud" class="if uuid-2885162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2885162.jpg"></div><p>  One of the best features of iCloud Drive is how it works in conjunction with Mac and Windows.  Saving any documents in the cloud makes them instantly available for any service that supports it in iOS, and vice versa.  Where is the cloud in the iPhone?  You can find all files, documents and folders in the iCloud Drive app. </p><p>  In order to access the full version of the Iclaud website, you will need to use any browser except Safari.  There is no mobile version of this resource, but the process of working with online storage is very simple.  So you can process data from multiple accounts at the same time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="developer.apple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cloud iphone sign" class="if uuid-2885140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2885140.jpg"></div><h2>  How to move files in the cloud on iPhone </h2><p>  iCloud Drive is now stored in Files for iOS 11. It opens up many possibilities for storing and organizing files on the device.  You no longer need to stick to application-based folders to organize content ‚Äî you can handle everything in ‚ÄúFiles,‚Äù such as Dropbox or Box.  How to work in it?  How to find a photo in the cloud in an iPhone and copy it? </p><ol><li>  Launch the Files application </li><li>  Click Browse at the bottom of the screen. </li><li>  Click iCloud Manager in the Locations section. </li><li>  Click on a folder to open it. </li><li>  Then - ‚ÄúSelect‚Äù in the upper right corner of the screen. </li><li>  Click on the files you want to move. </li><li>  Click Move at the bottom of the screen. </li><li>  Click the folder to select the destination for the files. </li><li>  Select "Move" in the upper right corner of the screen. </li></ol><h2>  How to delete files in the cloud on iPhone? </h2><p>  If you find that you are running out of space or simply have accumulated a lot of unnecessary information, you can easily delete unnecessary files.  Doing this is as easy as saving to the cloud on an iPhone.  This is done as follows. </p><ol><li>  Launch the Files app </li><li>  Click Browse at the bottom of the screen. </li><li>  Select ‚ÄúiCloud Manager‚Äù in the ‚ÄúLocations‚Äù section. </li><li>  Click on a folder to open it. </li><li>  Then - ‚ÄúSelect‚Äù in the upper right corner of the screen. </li><li>  Select the files you want to delete. </li><li>  Click "Delete" in the lower right corner. </li></ol><p>  It is worth noting that when deleting there is no confirmation of the operation.  Deleting files only marks them previously.  They can be restored in the Files application. </p><h2>  How to enable or disable cellular data to synchronize files? </h2><p>  If you have accumulated a large number of documents in the cloud, and you have a limited tariff for storing information, you can prevent the application from using mobile data transfer.  To do this, you don‚Äôt even have to follow the steps to enter the iCloud cloud from an iPhone.  How it's done: </p><ol><li>  Launch the Settings app. </li><li>  Click on ‚ÄúData Transfer‚Äù. </li><li>  In the Mobile Data section, scroll down the page until you find the Files application. </li><li>  Press the ‚ÄúOn / Off‚Äù switch to disable the use of functionality. </li></ol><p>  This will allow you to make sure that iCould Drive is not used to store various information. </p>
