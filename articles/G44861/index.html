    <p>  Vacationers get an unforgettable experience of communication and <span>swimming with dolphins</span> in the marine park Dolphin Island.  There are always a lot of visitors to the dolphinarium who came to rest in Whala Bavaro 3 *.  A photo of dolphins allows you to permanently keep in your memory pleasant moments from swimming with huge good-natured animals. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  According to tourists, all the shortcomings of the hotel are balanced by its advantages and low cost of living.  They note that in general a pleasant experience leaves accommodation in Whala Bavaro 3 *.  Guest reviews more emphasize the positive aspects of the hotel, surrounded by well-groomed pretty territory.  Its restaurants serve delicious food, ripe fruit that has been poured in juice.  Drinking water from coolers is allowed to be drawn without restriction.  The bars offer a healing drink "Mamahuana." </p><p>  The bright and spacious apartments are carefully cleaned by friendly staff, which cannot be looked at without a reciprocal smile.  True, if something goes wrong in the room, it is useless to go to the receptionist with complaints.  He politely promises to send a master, but in reality he won‚Äôt do anything.  It‚Äôs easier to catch an employee in a blue shirt with the inscription Maintenance on the hotel‚Äôs territory, bring him to your room and explain what needs to be fixed.  The wizard will quickly fix the problem. </p><p>  Entertainment facilities and shops are within walking distance.  In two "Russian" supermarkets, prices are fixed.  Tourists buy rum, coffee, cocoa, bottles with Mamahuana (or a dry mix for making a healthy drink), vanilla, and other worthy goods in rubles. </p>
