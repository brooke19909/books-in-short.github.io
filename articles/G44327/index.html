Located on the island of the same name and being its capital, it attracts the attention of tourists with magnificent beaches, luxury hotels, a variety of natural and man-made monuments.  The ancient city seems to have been created for those who cannot stand silence and tranquility, but prefer an active holiday with a lot of entertainment.  Guests of Greece admit that life here is in full swing day and night, and an exciting journey turns into a memorable holiday. </p><h2>  History tour </h2><p>  Rhodes is an old city whose history began before our era in 408.  The village became an ally of the Roman Empire, more than 200 years it was owned by the Knights-Johnnites, who dreamed of the Christianization of the East and oppressed the Orthodox Church in Greece.  It is believed that the city owes it to them what it looks like now. </p><p>  In the sixteenth century, the well-fortified Rhodes fell under the control of the Turks, and the knights fled to Malta, where they organized their order.  For almost four hundred years, the indigenous population was under the yoke of the invaders, but the Rhodes had many privileges, which favorably affected the high standard of living. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, Italian troops appeared in the city, who won the war against the Turks.  The conquerors had a significant impact on the appearance of the entire island as a whole, built new buildings and restored ancient monuments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rhodes old town history" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1413751.jpg" width="600"></div>

Rhodes became part of Greece only a few years after the end of German occupation. </p><h2>  Treasure chest in which different eras intertwined </h2><p>  The capital of the picturesque island is rich in interesting places for tourists, but many give the palm to the old part of the city, protected by UNESCO.  It is not for nothing that the locals consider the Old City to be a true treasury that stores architectural pearls.  Rhodes, preserving the appearance and spirit of the medieval port, is a truly unique corner in which religions, cultures and peoples intersect. </p><p>  In the village founded several centuries ago, different eras intertwine, a trace of which is left on local attractions.  The historical part of the city, without a doubt, can be called an open-air museum.  Everyone who came to learn something new is given a wonderful opportunity to explore the narrow streets and get acquainted with the unusual cultural monuments, which are famous for Rhodes (Old Town). </p><p>  Sights built several centuries ago are perfectly preserved, and tourists are transferred to the distant past, as if by time machine. </p><h2>  City walls </h2><p>  The first thing that visitors to the city see is the impressive walls that protected the inhabitants from the enemy.  A masterpiece of military architecture was erected by skilled craftsmen in several stages.  The stone walls that everyone can walk on today are decorated with knightly coats of arms, and in the summer, local authorities arrange light and musical performances at the foot of the ancient landmark that tell of the affairs of bygone days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rhodes old town" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1413730.jpg" width="600"></div>

The old city is a well-preserved example of the fortification architecture of the Middle Ages, and the fortress walls stretching for four kilometers are the best evidence of this. </p><h2>  Antique monuments </h2><p>  Of course, the most ancient monuments in the capital of the island belong to the ancient Greek period, unfortunately, they are in a ruined state.  For example, from the famous temple of Aphrodite there is only one foundation left, in some places you can see traces of ancient defensive structures and the ruins of a Roman shipyard. </p><h2>  Byzantine ruins </h2><p>  From the Orthodox churches erected during the reign of Byzantium, only ruins remained, and mosques that were remade from Christian churches by the Turks who captured the Old City survived in good condition.  Rhodes is famous for the ancient church of St. Spyridon - a snow-white building with an Ottoman minaret. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rhodes old town attractions" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1413738.jpg" width="331"></div>

    <p>  In addition, tourists can explore in the north-east of the resort several high towers that appeared in the Byzantine period.  As guests of the city note, the monumental fortifications look rude in comparison with those that remained of the Knights of <span>Malta.</span> </p><h2>  Monuments of the period of hospitaliers </h2><p>  For several centuries, it stores the ancient history that manifests itself in every building, Greek Rhodes.  The old city, the photo of which will not leave indifferent any tourist, will surprise with the main attraction located on the Knights Street.  The Palace of the Grand Masters, reminiscent of a mini-fortress, impresses with its impressive size and luxurious decoration.  During the time of Turkish rule, it was destroyed, and only in 1939 the magnificent building was restored by Italians. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rhodes old town photo" class="if" height="229" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1413748.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Now there is a museum, the exhibits of which will tell about the distant past of the country, and under the palace, according to archaeologists, there is an <span>ancient temple,</span> erected in honor of Helios. </p><h2>  Ottoman architecture </h2><p>  Historians are convinced that the period of Turkish rule left a huge mark on the architecture of Rhodes.  The buildings erected at this time determine the appearance of the historical part of the city.  The mosque of Suleiman, built on the site of the destroyed Orthodox church, is considered the most beautiful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rhodes old town" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1413720.jpg" width="352"></div>

    <p>  The restored building with pink walls is in harmony with the general atmosphere of the Old Town.  Seven mosque domes of different sizes rise above the pearl of Greece, and the clock tower located next to the religious building allows everyone to look down at the mosque. </p><h2>  Time travel </h2><p>  According to tourists, the Old Town is a unique example of how different cultures and even eras coexist in a small area.  Rhodes, which succeeded several ‚Äúmasters‚Äù who left their mark on culture and architecture, is one of the most interesting settlements. </p><p>  You can wander around the historical part of the island‚Äôs capital for hours, enjoying the amazing beauty of one of Europe‚Äôs oldest settlements. </p><p>  The old city, which without exaggeration can be called the miniature history of Rhodes, cannot be bypassed in one day.  The UNESCO World Heritage Site, filled with sights, is always waiting for new guests who wish to take an exciting journey through time.  Therefore, tourists dream of staying in a cultural object of world significance not for one day, but to spend at least a week here. </p><h2>  Comfort and convenience for travelers </h2><p>  Rhodes, which has long developed a tourist infrastructure, offers excellent conditions for accommodating its guests.  It is better to book numerous hotels in the Old Town of Rhodes in advance, as there may not be any comfortable rooms in the high season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in the old town of Rhodes" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1413762.jpg" width="600"></div>
