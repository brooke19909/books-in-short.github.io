    <p>  For fans of extreme sports this summer opened a unique amusement park - rope routes laid along trees with swinging swings and vines.  This is a real test for those who want to test themselves for strength and courage.  The length of the tracks is 400 meters, of varying difficulty.  You can get a dose of adrenaline on the troll (downhill), the height of which is 15 m. </p><p>  Children are allowed at least 120 cm. To pass it is not at all necessary to have special knowledge - introductory instruction is carried out on the spot, and the test subject is provided with protective climbing equipment.  While climbing tourists put on safety belts. </p><h2>  Hotel through the eyes of tourists: reviews </h2><p>  Most of the guests who spent their weekend in this cozy place were satisfied: the cleanliness both in the rooms and on the territory made a pleasant impression.  People expressed special thanks to the attentive and courteous staff.  There were no complaints about nutrition.  The excellent menu and homely atmosphere make the pastime unforgettable at the Alol Hotel. </p><p>  The recreation center is distinguished by hospitality and friendliness.  True, some noted that it used to be quieter and calmer here than today.  More and more often young companies come here who love to listen to loud music and dance, and this prevents those who want privacy and peace.  The administration suppresses this kind of entertainment and keeps order. </p>
