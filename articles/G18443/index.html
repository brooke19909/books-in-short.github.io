Geometrically true lines and traditional Arabic patterns, arches and figured arches, fountains beating from the marble floor - all this is Sheraton Sharjah Beach Resort &amp; SPA 5 *, one of a kind and completely exclusive. </p>

    <p>  The menu of restaurants and the quality of food are extremely positively evaluated.  However, the Arab country imposes its specificity on the rules of conduct and requires a certain dress code when visiting public places.  If, according to the guests, in Turkey you can go for dinner in shorts, then it is recommended if not a suit, then at least trousers and a shirt, and ladies - cocktail dresses. </p><p>  To summarize, I want to say that the Sheraton Sharjah Beach Resort &amp; SPA 5 * hotel is a magical Arabian fairy tale that will stay with you forever. </p>
