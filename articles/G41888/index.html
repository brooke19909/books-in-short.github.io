But despite the short period of its existence, it has already managed to win praise from tourists.  What did vacationers like at this hotel so much?  Do two stars rightfully adorn its facade?  This will tell us the tourists themselves.  In this article we have analyzed and summarized reviews about this hotel. </p><p>  To begin with, we can only say that both independent travelers and groups stop there, including from abroad.  And this already means something and testifies only to the high rating of the new hotel among tour operators. </p>

    <h2>  Location, how to get </h2><p>  Here is the address of the Anatol Hotel (2 * hotel): Russia, Adler / Hosta, ul.  Stanislavsky, 10. This is the Krasnodar Territory.  Adler is a territorial unit of the all-Russian resort of Sochi.  "Anatole" (hotel) is located on the fourth line from the sea, on the embankment of the Mzymta river.  The host is located near the Olympic Park and the center of Adler.  This arrangement allows hotel guests to join the cultural life of the resort. </p><p>  Close to the Aquarium of Sochi Discovery Ward Aquarium, dolphinarium, amusement parks.  For shopaholics in the immediate vicinity stands the shopping center "Mandarin".  Around the hotel, a hungry tourist will find many fast-feet, cafes and restaurants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Arriving at <span>the Sochi airport</span> or at the train station in Adler, do not rush to taxi drivers.  And if you use the services of a private carriage, then check with the driver that you need ‚ÄúAnatole‚Äù exactly in Khost, on Stanilavsky, because in Sochi there is another hotel under this name (on Kurortny Prospect).  Four kilometers from the <span>Adler station</span> to the hotel we need, seven from the airport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adler City" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1509038.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  "Anatole" - 2 * hotel (Adler), which opened its doors to its first guests last year.  It consists of one four-story building.  At the fifth level there is an attic, where guests are also accommodated.  The territory of the hotel is small.  In fact, the building is surrounded on both sides by neighboring houses.  The hotel overlooks the embankment of the Mzymty River from the courtyard.  It is better to book rooms from this side - no noise, no din, only peaceful murmur of water.  The patio is very small. </p><p>  A flower bed in the form of the letter "A" ("Anatole"), a palm tree, a tree, a pair of bushes - that‚Äôs all.  Half of the courtyard is a covered terrace, which houses a cafe.  The kitchen and bar are located elsewhere.  And on the terrace you can relax on the chairs by the table.  Reviews claim that such a small area is typical of a two-star city hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anatole Hotel 2 Sochi" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1509047.jpg" width="600"></div>

They are designed for comfortable accommodation of two guests.  When filling out an application for booking a room in the Anatol Hotel (2 * Hotel, Adler), you should indicate how many beds you want to see in the bedroom - one wide or two separate.  On the ground floor there are small rooms - eighteen square meters.  They do not provide additional space for the third guest.  For such companies or families, there are more spacious standard rooms of 20 square meters.  m. As a rule, balconies adjoin them. </p><p>  Vacationers in 2016 claim that during the winter the owners completed the attic.  Standard rooms are also located there.  But they do not have a balcony, and since there is no elevator in the building, they cost a little less.  The most expensive room category is two-room deluxe.  Their total area is thirty-two square meters, they consist of a bedroom and a living room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anatole Hotel 2 hosts" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1509039.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Filling of rooms in the hotel "Anatole" (hotel 2 *, Hosta) </h2><p>  Tourists liked that the hotel rooms are new, they still smell of fresh furniture.  The hosts are constantly improving the rooms.  This year, small safes appeared in the cabinets.  The filling of the rooms is consistent with the rank of the hotel.  The rooms of the Anatol complex (2 * hotel, Adler) include a flat-screen TV, a split system with an individual remote control, and a refrigerator.  From furniture - beds, a mirror, a curbstone, a wardrobe.  The bathroom has a shower, hairdryer.  Liquid soap is added as needed.  Hairdryers have already appeared in bathrooms this year.  Reviews note quite spacious balconies.  They overlook the river.  Those guests who do not have a balcony in their rooms can dry their bathing suits in the courtyard - the ropes are specially stretched along the fence for this purpose.  They clean the rooms every day.  But bed linen is changed once a week. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The first guests of the Anatol Hotel were forced to look for a cafe outside the hotel.  Fortunately, the city of Adler is large, and the catering points in the district are visibly invisible.  But now the rules at the hotel have changed.  ‚ÄúAnatole‚Äù began to position itself as a B&amp;W.  Since 2016, breakfast has been included in the room rate.  The cafe is located in the basement of the hotel.  But guests prefer, if the weather permits, to have breakfast on the terrace under a canopy in the courtyard. </p><p>  The time for eating is the most suitable - from eight to ten.  Every day they suggest choosing: coffee or tea, porridge, casserole or sausage with fried eggs, a sandwich and a bun.  But it is worth remembering: to eat, you need to go down to the dining room, give the waitress a room number and tell you that you will have breakfast on the veranda.  If you just sit down at a table in the courtyard, no one will serve you.  Lunch and dinner in Adler is not a problem.  There are many cafes near the beach.  There are eateries in the shopping center "Mandarin". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anatol hotel 2 adler reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1509041.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Services, service, special rules </h2><p>  The Anatol Hotel (2 * Hotel, Sochi) does not accept children who are not yet four years old.  Maybe this is discrimination by age, but the neighbors will be spared from crying at night and screaming, <span>no light or dawn.</span>  Wi-Fi in the hotel is present, but for a fee and only near the reception, which, by the way, works around the clock.  But on each floor in the public domain there is an iron with an ironing board. </p><p>  The owners of the hotel promise that vacationers of the 2017 season will be able to use another service - a swimming pool, which they will install instead of a flower bed.  Most likely, this will affect the increase in the cost of rooms in the Anatol Hotel (2 * hotel).  Prices in the sixteenth year were from one thousand three hundred and fifty rubles per person per night.  And if the third guest shares an extra bed, he would spend a night in a hotel and breakfast only a thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anatole hotel 2 russia adler" class="if" height="236" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1509036.jpg" width="380"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The Anatol Hotel has two exits: a front door leading to the city of Adler, and from the patio.  Passing through the gate, you can find yourself on the Mzymta embankment.  If you go along the stream of the river, then after a quarter of an hour (if not in a hurry) you can see the shopping center "Mandarin".  This chic complex, where you can not only buy, but also have fun, has its own pebble beach.  There is a free toilet, and sun loungers cost three hundred rubles a day. </p><p>  Higher beach service at the Royal Fish Restaurant.  There, sunbeds cost three hundred and fifty rubles, but they are given a towel.  The beach itself is clean, consists of pebbles and gray sand.  A mountain river flowing into the sea does not lower the water temperature too much, but there are almost no jellyfish. </p><p>  You can visit another good beach.  To do this, go out through the front doors, cross the bridge over the river and go down to the sea.  It‚Äôs more lively: there are shops, a cinema, all kinds of entertainment. </p><h2>  "Anatole" (2 * hotel, Adler): guest reviews </h2><p>  Tourists praised the location of the hotel.  Next to it on the right side there is a store, and on the left - a budget dining room.  However, the place is quiet.  Tourists liked the friendly staff who are trying to please in everything.  The hosts in every way care about the comfort of their guests. </p><p>  The distance to the beach seems excessive only for the first time.  Then you get used to it and overcome these eight hundred meters quickly.  Vacationers liked the lack of noise in the hotel.  Reviews are advised to book rooms facing the patio, then both silence and comfort will be provided.  It is hoped that next season, Anatole will turn into a three-star hotel. </p>
