The actors in this film were selected very well and, judging by the reviews of numerous critics, they coped well with the tasks assigned to them.  This is confirmed by the fact that the film received several prestigious awards and prizes for the performance of male roles.  Also in 2004, the American casting award for the best casting was received precisely by the film ‚ÄúHitler: The Devil‚Äôs Rise‚Äù, the actors and roles in which are truly perfectly selected. </p><h2>  A brief plot and the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe film </h2><p>  This film can be classified as mini-series, as it consists of 2 parts, the duration of which is 2 hours.  Judging by the name, it is obvious that the tape was shot in the genre of autobiography and talks about the life path of the most odious man of the last century - Adolf Hitler.  The very personality of this person is very difficult and it seems impossible to many to understand its nature. </p>

A television film entitled ‚ÄúHitler: The Ascent of the Devil‚Äù (the actors in which, of course, faced a very difficult task to play odious historical figures, the attitude to which is very ambiguous), shows the history of the formation of the F√ºhrer from a young boy, a youth with maximalist views, to a nationalist psychopath and tyrant politics.  At the same time, the cinema reflects the history of Germany at that time, the First and Second World Wars, the position of the political elite and ordinary people at that time.

Initially, Hitler appears in front of the viewer in the image of a 10-year-old boy.  This hero lives with his mother and stepfather, whom he does not love too much.  Mother is sure that her son has the ability to draw and sees in him the future artist.  The stepfather, apparently, does not too much favor his arrogant stepson, teaches his life and tries to educate.  Largely because of this, after the death of his stepfather, little Adolf does not grieve at all. </p><p>  Hitler matured as a teenager on the screen is embodied by another actor - Simon Sullivan.  He shows the image of a guy who is looking for his place in life.  His hero fails to become an artist.  He submits an application to the Vienna Academy of Arts, but receives a refusal, because they believe that the guy does not have enough talent.  It was during this period that Adolf was fascinated by anti-Semitic theories, which, he thinks, help to find those responsible for all his failures.  Then he goes to the First World War, and the loss of Germany becomes for him a real shock. </p><h2>  Robert Carlyle reviews </h2><p>  In the film "Hitler: the Ascent of the Devil", the actors were able to smoothly show the formation of the already adult and established personality of Adolf.  It gradually ripens the idea that the history of the German loss must be rewritten without fail and his country should rise above all others.  Adult Hitler with all the complexities of his character is played by the third actor - Robert Carlisle.  Despite the fact that in the mini-series ‚ÄúHitler: The Devil‚Äôs Rise‚Äù the actors coped with their roles without exception, it was Carlyne‚Äôs acting work that the critics praised as the most laudatory reviews. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Many note that the actor did a tremendous job in order to make his image look as realistic as possible.  He worked on facial expressions, gestures and the manner of speaking a real prototype of his image.  It was he who, a year after the film was released, in 2004, was nominated for the well-known international satellite prize for Best Actor in a mini-series. </p><h2>  Hitler: The Rise of the Devil: movie actors </h2><p>  In addition to Adolf himself, in the film, of course, there are other, secondary characters, but their images are shown and played no less vividly.  For example, actor Peter Otul was nominated for an Amy Award for Best Supporting Actor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hitler movie the devil's climb actors and roles" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1467023.jpg" width="315"></div>

    <p>  In the film, he perfectly played the role of Paul von Hindenburg.  His character is president and it was with his filing in 1933 that Hitler became chancellor. </p><h2>  Female performers </h2><p>  Naturally, in the film, in addition to male roles, there are also female ones.  The role of Adolf's mother, Clara, was performed by American actress Stockard Channing.  The image of Helen - the wife of General <span>Erich Ludendorff</span> - turned out to be very interesting <span>.</span>  According to the plot, Hitler was often entering the general‚Äôs house and began to have warm feelings for his wife.  A little later, when Adolf attempted suicide, it was Helen who saved his life. </p><p>  The image of Eva Brown, the world-famous lover of Hitler, turned out to be interesting and very deep. </p>

    <p>  The film perfectly shows her inner experiences, her love for the Fuhrer and her inability to fully reconcile with her fate.  The role of this woman in the film was perfectly played by Zoe Telford. </p>
