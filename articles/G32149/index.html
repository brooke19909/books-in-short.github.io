But very few people know that wonderful beaches, a hot tropical climate, unusually beautiful nature and exotic cultural attractions exist in South Korea. </p><p>  Jeju Island was not in vain entered by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.  Extinct volcanoes, pearl waterfalls, beaches, the azure sea and the original culture of local residents have long attracted tourists from Japan, China and mainland Korea.  And in 2011, Jeju (this is its official name) fell into the seven of the new natural wonders of the world. </p><p>  In this article we will tell Russian discoverers how to get to the island, where to settle and what to see.  We will reinforce our description with photographs and reviews of those tourists who have already managed to visit there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nature.new7wonders.com" data-author=": nature.new7wonders, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jeju Island" class="if uuid-2558435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2558435.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is the island </h2><p>  The Republic of Korea occupies the south of the peninsula of the same name.  If you look at the map, its end seems to be outstanding fringe in the sea due to the rugged coastline and the abundance of small islands.  But Jeju (Korea) is much south. </p><p>  Closest to it is the mainland province of Jeollanamdo (in the northeast).  Jeju from all sides is washed by the waters of the Korean Strait of the Pacific Ocean.  From the east you can get to it from Japan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Why is Jeju often called Jeju?  The ending "-do" in Korean means both an island and a province.  They are written in different hieroglyphs, but are phonetically heard the same way.  Both options apply to Jeju.  After all, the island is also an autonomous province with a special status. </p><p>  Jeju has its own capital.  And she's called Jeju-si.  In general, the island had many names: Toi, Chukho, Thammora, Somna and others.  And on European maps he was listed as Quelpart. </p><p>  Now it is the largest island in Korea, as well as the smallest province in the country.  Jeju is also unique in that it has the highest point of the entire state.  This is the Hallasan volcano (1950 meters above sea level). </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="33.4996213" data-lng="126.53118840000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/6/3/0/4630.png"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Jeju is located far south of mainland Korea.  Therefore, the island climate is very different from the weather in the rest of the country.  It lies in the field of action of tropical monsoons.  But the north wind can bring a weakened breath of Siberian cold to the island. </p><p>  Winter in Jeju is extremely mild.  And the summer is very hot.  The beach season on the island opens in early June, as the waters in the Korea Strait heat slowly. </p><p>  It is best to come to Jeju in August or September.  Then dry, calm and clear weather is established.  And the sea temperature at the end of summer reaches +26 degrees.  Very good here and in the first half of autumn.  And those who can‚Äôt stand the heat will be comfortable on Jeju until the end of November. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the high beach season, prices increase.  To protect yourself from heavy rains in the summertime, reviews recommend choosing the western tip of the island for relaxation. </p><h2>  How to get to Jeju (Korea) </h2><p>  Interestingly, in order to get to the island, more precisely, an autonomous province with a special status, a Russian does not need a visa.  But this rule is respected provided that you arrive on Jeju Island by direct flight (for example, from Vladivostok) or on board a sea cruise ship. </p><p>  Most tourists get here with a change at Seoul International Airport.  In order to visit the Republic of Korea, citizens of the Russian Federation will need a visa.  But getting it is extremely easy.  From <span>Seoul Airport,</span> the island can be reached by Asian Air or Korean Air.  There are several flights per day.  The flight time from the mainland to the island lasts about half an hour. </p><p>  The question of how to get to Jeju Xi, the provincial capital, as well as popular resorts, is also easily resolved.  You will see bus stops right at the airport exit.  Routes number 500, 200 and 100 follow to different areas of Jeju-Xi. But do not rush to spend money on travel. </p><p>  If you booked a hotel in the island's capital, you are entitled to a free shuttle bus shuttle.  There is a direct route No. 600 from the airport to Chungmun Resort.  The interval between flights is a quarter of an hour, and the journey time is about thirty minutes.  From Jeju Xi Bus Station, you can get to other coastal <span>resorts of the island.</span>  The whole journey will take about an hour. </p><div class="photo" data-original="my.asiatatler.com" data-author=": my.asiatatler, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jeju Island Korea" class="if uuid-2558453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2558453.jpg"></div><h2>  Amazing jeju </h2><p>  Even the inhabitants of mainland Korea, once on the island, are surprised at the local exotic.  After all, Jeju lies far from the continent.  The appearance of local residents is very different from other Koreans.  And they speak a language incomprehensible to the mainland population. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, matriarchy reigns on the island.  Men here from time immemorial have been doing housework and raising children.  And the earners in the family are women.  The most ancient craft on Jeju Island (Korea) was the collection of mollusks from great depths. </p><p>  This is now the majority of women engaged in from the age of 15 and to a very old age.  Diving grandmothers are another attraction on the island.  Many tourists wait specially when their boats moor to the shore to take colorful photos and buy something from the catch. </p><p>  You can watch the divers in their work from a small submarine, which stands near the uninhabited rock Munson, which is a place of abundant catch.  Now many women run the tourism business. </p><div class="photo" data-original="edition.cnn.com" data-author=": JUNG YEON-JE, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jeju Travel Reviews" class="if uuid-2558475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2558475.jpg"></div><h2>  Resorts </h2><p>  Jeju is an island of volcanic origin.  Scientists have discovered that it was formed 780 thousand years ago as a result of several eruptions.  In the center of the island, which has the shape of an almost regular oval, the Hallasan volcano rises.  But tourists should not be afraid of eruptions. </p><p>  The last time Hallasan woke up 25 thousand years ago.  Most likely, the first people on Jeju (as well as flora and fauna) appeared during the last glaciation, when the level of the World Ocean dropped and land ‚Äúcorridors‚Äù from the <span>Korean Peninsula</span> and Japan appeared. </p><p>  But then the existence in isolation led to the fact that the population of the island appeared original customs and culture.  Jeju is home to many endemic animals and plants.  The island has been considered a tourist paradise for Koreans, as well as residents of Japan, for decades. </p><p>  Gradually, Jeju acquired a specialization - holding wedding ceremonies and organizing a honeymoon.  This was facilitated by the presence of small uninhabited islets off its coast. </p><p>  If you arrived in Jeju in the summer, it is best to choose the West Bank resorts - Halim and Chunmun.  Very nice beaches are located south of the city of Sonsana.  The sights of the island can be found throughout its territory.  Especially popular is Love Land, an amusement park for lovers (people under 18 are not allowed to enter). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.autonews.com" data-author=": Hans Greimel, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jeju sea" class="if uuid-2558497" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2558497.jpg"></div><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Despite the fact that it is an island of volcanic origin and is composed of basalt (solidified lava), its coast is not solid rocks that abruptly break off into the sea.  Jeju's beaches seemed to have come off the picture. </p><p>  Sandy and with small pebbles, they are surrounded by a wall of succulent subtropical greenery.  The most popular beaches in Seogwipo and Chunmun, because there you can not only sunbathe and swim, but also engage in active types of water recreation: diving, spearfishing, windsurfing. </p><p>  In the vicinity of Sonsan, the beaches of Xinyang and Pioseon should be noted.  Amazing photographs can be taken on Chongbang Beach (the south coast), where the only waterfall in all of Asia is located, overthrowing directly into the sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="livingnomads.com" data-author=": livingnomads, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches Jeju" class="if uuid-2558514" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2558514.jpg"></div><h2>  Jeju: where to stay? </h2><p>  Hotels on the island adhere to their specialization.  Those who arrange romantic wedding ceremonies and organize a honeymoon do not settle for people under 18 years of age. </p><p>  But there are hotels specializing in children's vacations.  Groups of students from mainland Korea come here.  There are hotels designed for active youth and those tourists who are more interested in sightseeing holidays. </p><p>  In Jeju, which is famous as a resort island, prices "bite."  A standard number in the Five, such as Mason Glad Zheyu or Ramada Plaza, costs from five to seven thousand rubles.  Hotels with four stars are available from 4300 rubles.  ("Howard Johnson", "Rake" and others). </p><p>  A room in a 3 * hotel is already available from 2800 rubles.  Small hotels, such as Zheju SeoulTourist and Golden Park, offer accommodation for 2200 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.akkys.net" data-author=": akkys, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jeju Hotels" class="if uuid-2558542" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2558542.jpg"></div><h2>  What to bring as a souvenir </h2><p>  Jeju (Korea) is often compared to Easter Island.  And not only because of isolation and identity.  Throughout Jeju, stone idols can be seen.  Some of them reach a height of three meters.  But unlike the formidable <span>idols of Easter Island,</span> gazed staring at the ocean, Jeju's Tolkharubans are pretty-looking, smiling old men. </p><p>  Sculptures carved from solidified lava are the hallmark of this place.  They are depicted on all postcards and guidebooks on the island.  Tolkharubany - a kind of lara, protecting the house from evil spirits. </p><p>  Since the development of tourism, the prudent islanders began to produce stone sculptures for sale - both large, about a meter, and tiny, which can be worn as a keychain.  Therefore, the answer to the question of what to bring from Jeju is unambiguous: of course, Tolharubana. </p><h2>  Island Attractions </h2><p>  Even if you are not in good shape, you still need to climb the Hallasan volcano to see the unique <span>turquoise Lake</span> Bennocktam in the crater.  And the national park around the mountain is on the UNESCO list.  Jeju (Korea) is also rich in other natural attractions. </p><p>  This is the Andok valley, and the already mentioned Cheongbang waterfall, and eight landscapes of the Udo island, and the Manjangul cave, and the Sangumburi crater, and the peak of Sunrise.  Among the man-made beauties, the parks Yomiji and Tamm-Moksokvon should be noted.  Tourists recommend visiting one of the two ethnographic villages - Sonip or Jeju, where you can get acquainted with the matriarchal life of the islanders. </p><p>  To see all the significant buildings of our planet, go to the miniature park.  And of course, all lovers should visit Love Land, where at every step you will find manifestations of sexuality in different forms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="windingridgelane.blogspot.com" data-author=": windingridgelane, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jeju outdoor activities" class="if uuid-2558557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2558557.jpg"></div><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  Jeju Island is a haven for a curious tourist.  Here you can visit the museums: </p><ul><li>  tea (it is in the building in the form of a cup); </li><li>  teddy bears; </li><li>  movie; </li><li>  sex; </li><li>  ethnography; </li><li>  rock monastery of Sanbaggulsa. </li></ul><p>  And in the Hennyo Museum you can delve into the life of divers for pearls and clams. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In Jeju's reviews, tourists characterize it as an eternally bubbling resort.  Whenever you come, you will certainly catch folklore holidays, festivals, hang gliding competitions, exhibitions of chrysanthemums or orchids and the like. </p><p>  It is also recommended to come with children.  They will be delighted with all sorts of elephant shows and laser shows. </p>
