Of course, in the head of a creative needlewoman there are a lot of ideas that I want to translate into reality as soon as possible.  But if skill is not enough, disappointment quickly comes.  What to do if, for example, such questions can drive into a dead end: how to knit the front loop with a slope to the left or what is a <span>garter stitch?</span>  Then I want to give up this difficult task and no longer pick up the knitting needles.  That is why you need to start from the very beginning, from the basics.  Having mastered simple things, you can start knitting entire products without fear of mistakes. </p><p>  <span>Knitting is</span> based on the front and <span>back loops, the</span> alternation of which creates beautiful paintings.  So we‚Äôll start with them and learn <span>how to knit the</span> front and back loops. </p>

    <h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  Any knit with knitting needles begins with a set of loops.  This is a separate issue, since there are a great many types of knitting for different types of knitting: for elastic, for the <span>front surface,</span> for the wrong side, for a tight edge, or, conversely, for loose and elastic.  If you read about knitting the front and back loops, then you are already familiar with the set. </p><p>  Before you understand how to knit facial loops, let's talk a little about the density of knitting.  First you need to choose the right tools.  The size of the spokes affects a lot.  It happens that due to improperly selected knitting needles, the loops do not ‚Äúfit‚Äù into the canvas, the pattern looks either too tight, or loose and shapeless.  Much depends on how tight the master knits.  Each has its own individual style: someone loves a dense canvas and knits tight enough, while someone is more comfortable knitting more freely.  When choosing knitting needles, this individual feature must also be taken into account.  If the craftswoman knits tightly, and also the knitting needles are smaller than those recommended for the chosen yarn, then the product will be tightened, tough and unpleasant to wear.  And if the needlewoman works freely, when knitting with even thicker knitting needles, the product will not at all keep its shape, and after washing it will stretch at all. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Base loops </h2><p>  In order to learn, it is not enough to know how to knit facial loops.  In addition to just the front and back loops, there are several more species whose names must be recognized.  All of them are derived from the base. </p><ul><li>  Edging.  These are the loops that start and end the canvas in a rectangular shape.  Thanks to them, the product does not extend on the sides.  At the beginning of each row, the <span>edge loop</span> is removed unbind, and at the end it always fits on the wrong side. </li><li>  Crossed.  Such loops are often found in Asian patterns.  The product, connected by crossed front loops, looks original, and the structure is dense and elastic. </li><li>  Decreasing.  These are the loops that result from knitting two or three loops together to make the canvas narrower.  This is useful when knitting raglan sleeves, sweaters, dresses and other products. </li><li>  Surplus.  These can be crochets, which participate in openwork patterns, or loops, which are needed to add the width of the canvas.  They are knitted in several ways, for example, from the broach of the previous row or by knitting two loops from one. </li><li>  Elongated.  This is a kind of filmed loops.  They are used for knitting original and warm products. </li><li>  English  These loops are connected by a special English method, when the spoke is inserted not in the loop located on the spoke, but in its middle.  A product made in this way is very airy, and the canvas is embossed. </li></ul>

To answer this question, you need to know how the loops are arranged.  They all have a front and back wall.  The front is the one in front of the spoke, the rear is behind.  At the bottom between them is a broach. </p><p>  The front loop fits with what wall the previous one is to us.  To perform knitting for the front wall, we introduce the knitting needle from left to right, pull the thread and lower the loop from the knitting needle. </p><p>  To knit behind the back wall, we introduce a spoke from right to left and in the same way we extend the working thread. </p><h2>  Facial crossed </h2><p>  How to knit <span>a crossed front loop?</span>  As described earlier, Asian craftswomen like this method very much; they are often found in the schemes of Japanese and Chinese needlework magazines.  What is the essence of a crossed eyelet?  Its base crosses over, as if it were turned in the other direction. </p><p>  To knit a crossed loop, enter the knitting needle behind the back wall from right to left.  If the next row will be knitted with the wrong side, then in the next front row, the needle will need to be inserted behind the front wall from left to right. </p><h2>  Wrong loop </h2><p>  The purl loops in the front surface make up all even rows.  We hold the working thread in front of the working canvas.  We introduce the knitting needle from right to left, grab the yarn and pull it to the side ‚Äúaway from you‚Äù. </p><p>  The back loops are also crossed.  In order to bind them, you also need to place the yarn in front of the working canvas, and the knitting needle must be inserted from left to right, grab the thread in a ‚Äútop to bottom‚Äù movement and pull it. </p>

    <h2>  Two oblique facial </h2><p>  How to knit the front loop with a slope to the left?  And what might it be for?  In some products, you need to reduce the loops so that a beautiful neat pigtail with an inclination in one direction or another is formed.  Also it is necessary for many openwork ornaments.  In them, the crochets alternate with two loops knitted together. </p><p>  The tilt can be to the right or to the left.  Tilt to the left side is also called a broach.  In some schemes, it is so designated.  How to knit a facial loop broach? </p><p>  To do this, remove the first loop on the right knitting needle, knit the second on the front, and now use the left knitting needle to put on the removed loop on the knitted one.  There is another way: flip the first loop so that the back wall becomes the front, and now knit both loops on the back wall. </p>

    <p>  And if the slope should be to the right side, then you need to enter the spoke from left to right, first into the second, then into the first loop and knit them together for the front wall. </p><p>  Now that you know how to knit facial loops together, you can safely take on the implementation of simple openwork patterns. </p><h2>  Three loops together </h2><p>  Often in the schemes there is such a designation as "knit three facial together."  Most often, to make the canvas look beautiful, you need to knit three front ones so that the middle one is on top.  How do 3 facial loops knit?  3 loops will fall beautifully, if you first change the first and second places (for this we remove them on the right knitting needle, introducing it first into the second, then into the first loop, and in this twisted position we return it back to the left knitting needle).  And now we knit all three loops of the front for the back wall. </p>
