    <h2>  Holiday <span>Garden Resort Hotel 5 *</span> (Turkey): reviews of Russian travelers </h2><p>  Many modern tourists are very attentive to the process of choosing a hotel in a particular country in the world.  They are not only interested in the official description of the hotel and listen to the advice of managers from travel agencies, but also try to get acquainted with the reviews of those who have already had a chance to stop in a place of interest to them recently.  But today we decided to save you time and effort and suggest studying the generalized comments of our compatriots who spent their holidays at the five-star Turkish hotel Holiday Garden Resort.  Just note that most travelers, judging by their reviews, did not regret their choice at all.  On the contrary, they declare that the hotel is quite consistent with the category and cost of living.  But let's figure it out in order. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holiday garden resort hotel 5 turkey" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/986028.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  Since the hotel has recently been renovated by the rooms offered by it at the Holiday <span>Garden Resort Hotel 5 *</span> (Okurcalar), most of the guests were satisfied.  So, according to them, the apartments here are not very spacious, but there is enough space for comfortable accommodation.  The rooms have everything you need - comfortable furniture, working appliances, refrigerator, air conditioning, a bathroom with a hairdryer.  True, some guests complained that the hairdryers work very poorly.  The contents of the minibar, as well as stocks of soap, shampoos and shower gels, the maids replenish as necessary.  Each room has a safe.  You can use it for an additional fee.  It will cost you $ 2 a day. </p><p>  When checking in, as some tourists note in their comments, you can offer the reception administrator $ 20-30 if you want to get a room with a sea view.  In addition, a number of travelers claim that if you arrive at the hotel early in the morning, you will not be accommodated in the room before two in the afternoon.  Although they wear a bracelet, you can go for breakfast or lunch, and go to the pool or the beach.  However, if you offer the administrator some reward, then most likely you will be able to enter the apartment almost immediately after arrival. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holiday garden resort hotel 5 okurcalar" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/986029.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory, location </h2><p>  As for the territory of the Holiday Garden Resort Hotel 5 * hotel, reviews of which we are now considering, then most travelers found it very well-groomed and pleasantly decorated.  Many were pleased with the fact that the hotel has several shops where you can buy everything you need, for example, a beach towel or bathing shoes.  After all, the hotel is located at some distance from the center, and therefore, there are no outlets in walking distance.  However, many guests went to Alanya several times during their vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey hotel holiday garden resort hotel 5" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/986032.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Restaurants, bars </h2><p>  As for the food at the Holiday Garden Hotel, the opinions of tourists on this issue were divided.  In fairness, it is worth noting that a similar situation is characteristic not only for the hotel in question, but also for many others.  As for the Holiday Garden Resort, some of the guests say that the choice of dishes seemed insufficient to them.  In addition, they say that cooks abuse hot spices here, and therefore the food offered in the restaurant is not everyone's taste.  In addition, some guests advise the administration to think about organizing a children's menu, since not all kids are happy to eat their food.  Another part of vacationers claim that they were quite satisfied with the food at the hotel.  According to them, there is always a large selection of dishes - from meat, poultry and fish to salads, snacks, sweets, fresh fruits.  Several times a week, guests are offered ice cream.  In addition, you can always eat fast food.  So it‚Äôs simply impossible to stay hungry here. </p><p>  As for drinks, most of our compatriots agree that their quality in the hotel is pretty good.  In addition, many praise the work of bartenders who do their job well, without creating queues and dooming tourists to wait. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel holiday garden resort hotel 5" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/986030.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  For many tourists planning a vacation in Turkey, this issue is very important in the process of choosing a hotel.  As for the Holiday Garden Resort Hotel 5 * we are considering, here, according to our compatriots, you can fully enjoy the azure sea and the warm sun.  First of all, many were pleased with the fact that the hotel‚Äôs own beach is literally a couple of minutes walk from the main building.  Therefore, you do not have to go to the sea in the heat and come back.  The beach here is small, but there will be enough space for everyone who wants to soak up the sun and swim in the sea.  The beach itself is sand and gravel.  When entering the water there are large stones.  Therefore, guests are advised to take with them from home or buy on-site special shoes for swimming.  In addition, tourists warn that the depth begins a few meters from the coast.  In this regard, parents need to carefully monitor their children frolic at the water's edge.  In their comments, some travelers complained about people annoying them on the beach, offering trips to shops of gold and fur products.  However, this situation is quite relevant for other places where tourists relax. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holiday garden resort hotel 5 turkey reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/986031.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Judging by their comments, many tourists preferred to spend most of their time not on the beach, but on the pool terrace in the hotel complex.  According to them, the pools here are clean and comfortable.  There are bars nearby where you can enjoy your favorite drink, as well as fast food snacks throughout the day.  A number of travelers in their reviews express dissatisfaction with the fact that sunbeds by the pools are not enough for everyone who wants to stay here.  Therefore, some hotel guests were forced to get up at six in the morning to occupy a deck chair.  Otherwise, they would not have been able to count until the evening to sit on a sunbed by the pool. </p><p>  As for the animation, most people who commented on their stay at the Holiday Garden Resort Hotel 5 * (Turkey) rated its level as satisfactory.  So, according to them, sometimes animators organized fun activities and entertainments, but for the most part, our compatriots did not have a desire to take part in this.  It is possible that the reason for this was the fact that for the most part the hotel contingent consists of residents of Poland and Germany, while tourists from Russia and other CIS countries are few.  In this regard, the animation is mainly designed for people who speak Polish, German and English. </p><p>  As for the smallest tourists, a mini club is open for them throughout the day.  In the evenings there is a disco for children, as well as an entertainment show and a disco for adults. </p>
