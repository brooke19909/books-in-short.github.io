    <h2>  Travel Comments on Beach Vacations and Activities </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, despite the fact that two hotels use the beach here at once, there are no problems with sunbeds and umbrellas, since the beach is quite large and wide, as a result of which there is enough space for everyone.  It is located directly next to the hotel complex.  You can enter the sea here both from the pier (immediately deep), and from the shore (in this case, after a few meters, corals begin to meet at the bottom, so it is advisable to swim in special shoes).  Experienced travelers are advised to everyone staying at Serenity Makadi Beach (Hurghada) to be sure to bring along or buy a mask on the spot.  Indeed, in coastal waters there is a mass of very different marine animals, which is very interesting to watch. </p><p>  As for entertainment, you will not have to miss the hotel.  So, here you can play golf, tennis, volleyball, boccia, visit the gym and have a good time at one of several pools (some of them are filled with salt water, there is also a heated pool).  In addition, you can go to the water park at a neighboring hotel (for a fee). </p><p>  As for the animation in Serenity Makadi Beach (Hurghada), then, according to most tourists, it is rather weak.  In general, this hotel is more suitable for people who want to spend a relaxing vacation on the shores of the beautiful sea.  If you crave noisy entertainments and adventures, then it is better to find another option for accommodation. </p>
