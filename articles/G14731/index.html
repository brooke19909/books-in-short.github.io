    <h2>  Hotel Pomegranate Wellness Spa Hotel 5 *: negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, even a hotel with a high level of service is not immune from flaws and other shortcomings.  If we talk about such a resort complex as the Pomegranate Wellness Spa Hotel Nea Potidea, then the following negative comments should be noted: </p><ul><li>  the products in the dining room are not very fresh (for breakfast, what can be left from the evening); </li><li>  the hotel has very poor sound insulation, and given the huge number of children who like to make noise in the corridors, you are unlikely to relax in your room; </li><li>  not enough fresh vegetables on the menu; </li><li>  not very high-quality cosmetics in the bathroom; </li><li>  animation team is weak; </li><li>  there are very few rooms with sea views, and their prices are simply cosmic; </li><li>  there is no iron in the room and there is no possibility to take it from the maid or at the reception (the only way out is paid ironing in the laundry room); </li><li>  drinking water in the room can only be obtained at an additional cost; </li><li>  the descent from the hotel to the beach is very steep and traumatic; </li><li>  at the entrance to the sea - slippery stone slabs, which is very inconvenient and unsafe; </li><li>  after 23:00 you will find almost no entertainment at the hotel; </li><li>  in the rooms located near the restaurant, round the clock there is noise from the ventilation pipe; </li><li>  there is practically no place for walking on the territory; </li><li>  if you like to go to bed early, then you will be disturbed by a disco and animation program, which is accompanied by loud music until late at night; </li><li>  very weak Internet both in the room and throughout the territory (moreover, this applies not only to free, but also to paid services); </li><li>  in the shower the drain works very poorly; </li><li>  the mattress on the bed is too soft and not very comfortable for sleeping; </li><li>  double beds are very small; </li><li>  there are no shops or any other outlets nearby (and the one that works on the territory is quite expensive). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The Pomegranate Wellness Spa Hotel 5 * resort just makes a grand impression on most travelers.  This institution can be proud not only of Nea Potidea, but also the whole of Greece.  A huge spa center deserves special attention.  Tourists are used to the fact that such objects provide only an insignificant list of cosmetic services.  Here you will also find several therapeutic zones, as well as the opportunity to consult with a specialist in order to draw up an individual wellness program.  It is worth noting that analogues to this spa can not be found in any hotel in Greece.  Naturally, this affects prices (the most popular procedures cost an average of 100-200 euros per session). </p><p>  Another "feature" of this hotel can be considered room design.  Entering your apartment, you will immediately notice that the designers did a good job on their project.  The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. </p><p>  Food also deserves special attention.  The selection of dishes included in the buffet menu is simply huge.  Given that the hotels are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the main emphasis is on fish dishes.  Nevertheless, guests can hear complaints that the products are not very fresh. </p><p> If we talk about the negative aspects, then this, of course, is a small area where there are practically no places for walking.  Also, guests complain about too steep descent to the sea.  On the beach itself, there were some shortcomings.  If you do not swim well, then, most likely, entering the sea on slippery slabs will not be very pleasant for you.  And, of course, it is striking that the prices for all hotel services are greatly overstated with an eye on its five-star status. </p>
