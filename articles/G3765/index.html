  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the Motorola S200 mobile phone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Once upon a time, Motorola phones were popular.  They were equipped with black and white small screens.  To dial a number or text, a mechanical keyboard was used.  Such phones, of course, will no longer attract the attention of a modern user.  However, once such features were new. </p><p>  The hero of today's review is just such a simple Motorola S200 phone.  In a way, this is a legend.  Surprisingly, even now, if you insert a SIM card into it, it will work.  Such a quality deserves to be nostalgic today. </p><h2>  Appearance Features </h2><p>  Motorola C200, the photo of which is in the article, is a typical monoblock.  Electronic circuits and other parts are enclosed in a plastic case.  It is oval in shape.  The manufacturer completely abandoned the corners.  On the one hand, it looks somewhat comedic, but one cannot help but notice that it is this form that makes the phone convenient to use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.buyingtips.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="motorola c200" class="if uuid-2611662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2611662.jpg"></div><p>  The front panel is clearly divided into two blocks that combine the control keys.  The apparatus is given originality by a two-color solution - a combination of dark and light shades.  The elements located on the front side are all standard: a mechanical keyboard, which will be discussed a little later, the company logo, screen, speaker and microphone.  Of course, we are not talking about any camera in this model.  The ‚ÄúMotorola C200‚Äù phone case is nice to the touch.  Comfortably lies in a hand.  Material and assembly are of high quality.  Even if accidentally dropped, cracks do not form on the body. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Screen and menu </h2><p>  The display is one of the main elements in a mobile phone.  It is on its characteristics that many buyers are guided.  So, which screen is installed in the <span>Motorola C200?</span>  Graphic type display, small size.  Able to display a picture in resolution 98 √ó 64 px.  Many will say that few, but no complaints about the image.  All information is displayed clearly.  There is a backlight.  It is LED, quite bright.  Four lines of text are placed on the screen.  Also, two service lines are constantly displayed on it: at the bottom with the designation of soft keys, at the top - with the signal level of the network and battery.  In standby mode, the time and current date are displayed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobiles-prices.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Motorola S200 photo" class="if uuid-2611840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2611840.jpg"></div><p>  There is no need for instructions for Motorola C200.  The menu is so simple that even children can deal with it.  Application icons are displayed on the desktop.  In total, 8 pieces are placed on the screen.  If you select one, a symbol appears below.  Each menu item is programmed with a specific number.  This allows you to quickly find any function.  You can also use shortcuts.  They are created for quick access to applications.  You can save up to nine shortcuts.  The menu consists of standard applications: phone book, messages, settings, and so on.  Even games are installed on the device.  There are three of them, but they are the simplest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Motorola C200: battery </h2><p>  In order for the phone to be independent of the outlet, the manufacturer installed a lithium-ion battery in it.  Its resource is 550 milliamps per hour.  Given the weak functionality, the battery provides standby time of 120 hours. If you continuously talk on the phone, you will need to put it on charge after 6 hours.  In the combined mode, you can safely count on 3-4 days of work without recharging. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gsmliberty.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Motorola C200 phone" class="if uuid-2611818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2611818.jpg"></div><h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  As mentioned above, Motorola C200 is equipped with a mechanical keyboard.  On the control panel, soft keys and a two-position joystick are combined into one block of the original form.  The buttons for receiving and resetting the call are isolated from the others.  Use them conveniently.  The digital block is made in the same style as the whole phone.  All keys are located separately from each other, have an oval shape.  Small in size.  When dialing a number, you can touch the neighboring one, since the distance between them is small. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imei24.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Motorola C200 instruction" class="if uuid-2611847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2611847.jpg"></div><h2>  Impressions </h2><p>  By and large, Motorola S200 is a high-quality and convenient phone.  Of course, at the moment its functionality is very outdated.  But as regards communication, it is at its best.  The reception quality is high, the subscriber is heard perfectly, there is no interference in the dynamics.  The volume margin is enough for a comfortable conversation even in noisy places.  Externally, the phone is very similar to its predecessor.  But updates are still present.  For example, the manufacturer improved the menu, eliminated all software crashes, so the device turned out to be quite simple and balanced.  With its functionality, both a child and an elderly person can easily figure it out.  What else is required from a simple ‚Äúdialer‚Äù ?! </p>
