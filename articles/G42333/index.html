  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Contributions to the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Until the beginning of 2002, contributions to the <span>Pension Fund</span> in our country were part of the single tax levied on the population.  And then Law No. 167-F3 appeared, the essence of which is that now this type of pension contributions is paid as an independent individual payment. </p><p>  In more detail, the effect of the law means the following: a person pays <span>social tax,</span> which is the same for everyone, and payments for compulsory insurance of his future pension, which imply the existence of a funded as well as an insurance part.  Based on this, the share of the social tax, which was previously credited to the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation, now goes to the federal budget and is allocated only part of the basic rate of the labor pension. </p><p>  Today, the law clearly defines that contributions to mandatory pension insurance are paid by payers on a reimbursable basis.  Their main purpose is to ensure the rights of citizens to the future payment of pensions, on average equal to the amount of contributions recorded on their personal accounts. </p><p>  Thus, pension payments differ from taxes in their retribution and repayment.  Upon receipt of <span>the Pension Fund</span> in the <span>budget,</span> they are recalculated individually and recorded on individual accounts that are open for each person insured in the FIU.  At the same time, the part that is recorded on the individual account creates the amount of insurance payment, and it can be paid in the event of an insurance event.  The size of the future pension does not depend on this.  In this case, the law takes into account contributions to the Pension Fund made by a person for all his labor activities. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Individual entrepreneurs</span> also make payments to the Pension Fund and are mandatory policyholders on two grounds, which are prescribed in the relevant Law in Article 6: </p><p>  - as persons who make payments to other citizens; </p><p>  - as <span>individual entrepreneurs.</span> </p><p>  Since individual entrepreneurship refers to two types of policyholders at the same time, they make contributions to the Pension Fund separately for each category.  Each citizen who has entered into an employment contract is insured and registered <span>with the</span> <span>Pension Fund of the Russian Federation.</span>  Therefore, according to the current law No. 167-F3, article 28, he must timely and in full pay payments to the Pension Fund, which are fixed, in accordance with the same legislative act.  Thus, the payment is considered mandatory and does not depend on the tax system. </p><p>  The fact that individual entrepreneurs were classified as mandatory pensioners gives the right to implement the principle of providing pensions to all citizens, regardless of their social affiliation and work.  Contributions to the Pension Fund provide everyone with the right to a future retirement pension.  In addition to all of the above, entrepreneurs after <span>retirement</span> or due to old age or disability can continue their activities as an entrepreneur.  An annual recalculation of the pension insurance part is provided for them, taking into <span>account the individual</span> contributions paid by them to their <span>personal account</span> .  This allows you to increase the size of the received pension. </p><p>  Individual entrepreneurs who are already retired are not exempted from fixed payments for the maintenance of the funded and insurance parts of the retirement pension.  That is, the law provides that a citizen who is an individual entrepreneur is obliged to pay payments under any circumstances - regardless of whether he has reached retirement age or not. </p><p>  The terms of payment of pension contributions and the procedure governing them are determined by the Russian government, and Decree No. 148 of 2003 is used.  Their size is considered by dividing the insurance value by 12. In this regard, if the monthly payment is not higher than the fixed payment, its payment is charged at a minimum amount. </p>
