    <p>  It is easiest to get here on your own by taxi.  You can catch it at the St. Petersburg bus station, the schedule allows you to leave in the early morning, afternoon and evening.  Buses also come here.  Tourists can take them next to the Avtovo metro station.  You can get to the complex in just 20-25 minutes, if you do not accidentally get into a traffic jam.  The amount of travel is standard, and buses run every 5-10 minutes.  From "Avtovo" to the palace can be reached by tram.  True, the travel time will significantly increase and will be about 1 hour.  You will need to get to the final tram route number 36. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  <span>The park complex is one of the oldest buildings in St. Petersburg.</span>  <span>Peter I, who chose a place located in the delta of two rivers, as his future residence, had a hand at its base.</span>  <span>In 1709, he ordered preparations for the construction of a new palace complex, which, according to his plans, was to surpass the beauty of the French Versailles in his plans.</span>  <span>However, the preparation of a future project was delayed.</span>  <span>At first, Italian architect Sebastian</span> <span>Cipriani</span> <span>was involved in its development</span> <span>, but his plan was too complicated and expensive.</span>  <span>By 1715, he was replaced by the French architect Jean-Baptiste</span> <span>Leblond</span> <span>.</span>  <span>However, he died in 1719, not having time to complete the project.</span>  <span>He was replaced by Italian Nicolo</span> <span>Mikelli</span> <span>, who completed the <span>architectural plan.</span></span>  <span>The Konstantinovsky Palace was officially founded on May 22, 1720.</span> </p>
