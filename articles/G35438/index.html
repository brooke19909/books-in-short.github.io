Who is he this Telyakovsky?  The Primorsky Territory received many names during the first mapping on the map, made in 1862-1863 during the expedition of V. M. Babkin, or during hydrographic work carried out in these places in 1891-1894.  The expedition was led by lieutenant P.A. Mikhelson.  And Lieutenant Alexander Alexandrovich Telyakovsky (1869-1896) was a member of the unit engaged in <span>topographic surveying</span> in the party of the lieutenant of the corps of naval navigators Michelson. </p>

    <h2>  Named after the discoverers </h2><p>  <span>The Gamow Peninsula,</span> on the eastern part of which the Telyakovsky Bay is located, got its name in honor of D. I. Gamov, the midshipman of the crew of the frigate "Pallas", who discovered this peninsula in 1854.  This expedition is described in detail in the work of the same name by I. A. Goncharov, who took part in the expedition of the frigate "Pallas" sent with a diplomatic mission to Japan in 1852-1855. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="telyakovsky bay coastal region" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/977482.jpg" width="600"></div>  Then the ship proceeded to the Russian shores, opening bays, capes, islands along the way.  The names of the expedition participants, who somehow showed themselves in the description of an object, were assigned to him.  This applies to the beauty of the peninsula, the main pearl of which, and the whole of Primorye as a whole, is the Telyakovsky Bay.

A small-sized bay has a rather large depth - 38 meters.  The water in it is so clean that the bottom is visible from the coastal hills.  The bay, deepening into the eastern part of the Gamow Peninsula, has mostly rocky and steep banks, at the foot of which fragments of rocks and boulders are scattered.  And towards the top of the peninsula there is a hollow between the hills of Mount Tumannaya, the slopes of which are indented with ravines.  Three streams running along them flow into the bay.  The Telyakovka River flows into the northeastern part of the bay. </p><h2>  Deep, but you can moor </h2><p>  Telyakovsky Bay is protected by two capes from the winds and does not freeze for the winter, although drifting ice comes here.  This happens mainly from January to March.  The bottom of the bay is sandy-stone.  There are two small rocky islands in the bay: one on the north side, the other on the southwest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="telyakovsky bay photo" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/977484.jpg" width="600"></div>  On the shores of the bay, the sea is deeper than in the center, and therefore the anchor places are right here, at a depth of 25 meters, and the soil here is sandy.  Can small vessels moor closer to shore?  at the top of the bay, where the depth is 10-12 meters.

The main attraction of the bay's beauty is the languishing Heart Island.  The name is more than exciting.  It is necessary to stipulate that this bay is the southernmost of the <span>Far Eastern marine reserves,</span> or rather, one part of it belongs to the <span>Far Eastern</span> Geological Museum, where tourists have no access, and the other is open for visiting.  Fortunately for romantically minded visitors, the pilgrimage site, the languishing Heart Island, is not located in a nature reserve.  The island is small, not more than one hundred meters in length, and coastal - it is only 30 meters from the western part of the land. </p><h2>  Corner taking a soul </h2><p>  Shallow strait that can be wade.  The only trouble lurking for romantics is black sea urchins, the thorns of which, breaking off, remain in the skin and can cause the formation of purulent wounds.  You just have to be careful or drive to the islet by boat from the sea.  The goal of the pilgrims is located on the eastern slope, farthest from the coast.  In a small natural origin, a stone has been resting for 100 years, a shape resembling a heart. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Telyakovsky Bay how to get there" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/977485.jpg" width="600"></div>  Moreover, according to the testimony of those who have visited it, it is covered with many veins.  Heart, and only.  At high tide, this natural attraction makes sounds similar to heartbeats.  There is a belief that, by touching it, you can revive faded love or guaranteed to meet a new one.  This islet from afar resembles Bonaparte's headdress and therefore has another, less romantic name - Napoleon's Cap.  A wonderful piece of land is famous for thickets of wild rose hips and relic groves, consisting of grave pines that grow only on the Gamow Peninsula.

In addition, it is believed that they have a miraculous healing power: it is worth hugging the trunk and standing as little as all the bad leaves the soul, and it is filled with goodness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the telyakovsky bay" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/977487.jpg" width="600"></div>  Along with evil, diseases also go away.  This plant is a variety of Manchu relict pine.  According to legend, this tree was planted on the grave of the deceased warrior, and it absorbed the strength and nobility of the hero.  A very beautiful legend.  Other names for this endemic (inherent only to this place) are funeral and multi-flowered.  In late spring and early summer, when the large pink and white flowers of Schlippenbach's rhododendron and spiky point open and carpet the slopes of the mountains, the bay resembles a fairy tale.

    <h2>  First victim </h2><p>  Telyakovsky Bay (Primorsky Territory) was widely known to residents of this region only.  She was attracted by the extraordinary beauty of the surrounding places, silence and clear sea.  But in August 2011, she sadly became famous outside of Primorye.  This month, the water in the bay warms up the most and sharks come here.  This was no secret to anyone, but predators, 4 species of which live here permanently, never touched people.  On August 17, a cannibal shark attacked a 25-year-old man (Denis Udovenko), a resident of Vladivostok, who had come here to rest.  In the hospital, both arms were amputated for the man, his legs and body were also damaged. </p><h2>  There are more dangers </h2><p>  Several trawlers went in search of the cannibal, fearing that the shark would return to the site of the first attack.  Therefore, Telyakovsky Bay was especially protected.  The shark repeated the attack on August 18, but much to the north, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Zheltukhin island.  Here, a 16-year-old youth was seriously injured in the lower extremities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to telyakovsky bay" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/977488.jpg" width="600"></div>  In Primorye, there are several species of sharks that live here permanently, and in the summer, up to 12 species of these predators swim here behind migratory schools of fish, among them killers such as mako and white shark.  As a result of hunting in August, the Ministry of Emergency Situations caught two two-meter fish in bottom seines.

    <h2>  Maybe lucky </h2><p>  Among vacationers, explanatory work is carried out all the time both about the ban on visiting the reserve, the conditional border of which passes through the territory of Telyakovsky Bay, and about the danger of swimming and diving.  But the carelessness and disobedience of relaxing vacationers are shocking: according to the testimonies of the guards and rescuers, they "climb and climb" both in the reserve and in the ocean.  And the bottom in the bay is incredibly beautiful.  In addition, along the entire coast at different depths there are parts of the Vladimir steamer that sank here in 1897, crashed into Cape Gamova.  This disaster did not overshadow the bay, which is famous for its extraordinary aura, since none of the crew and passengers were injured (the bow of the ship crashed into the shore) and they were all saved two days later. </p><h2>  Unknown Beauty </h2><p>  The pearl of Primorye - Telyakovsky Bay, the photo of which is attached, is really unusually beautiful, and it is a pity that this amazing region is located so far not only from the European part of Russia, but also from the Urals. </p><p>  But in the public domain there are selections of amazingly beautiful photographs taken by people in love with this land.  Naturally, for those who heard the name of the bay for the first time, at least in connection with the attack of the cannibal shark, the question arises: where is Telyakovsky Bay?  It was noted above that it is located in the east of the Gamow Peninsula, southern Primorye. </p><h2>  Transport is just a car </h2><p>  In the bay itself, only a wild vacation with tents is possible, but a 16-minute drive (5.5 km) is Vityaz Bay, located on the western shore of the Gamow Peninsula.  Here, as in the village of Andreevka, located on the shore of Trinity Bay, there are many recreation centers for every taste.  The village of Andreevka is connected to <span>Vityaz Bay by the</span> only road.  The distance is 10 km, travel time is approximately 30 minutes.  There is a road along the west coast of the peninsula.  Wild tourists and vacationers in these villages are the main visitors to such a gift of nature as Telyakovsky Bay.  How to get to it from nearby settlements?  Or by car, or by sea. </p><p>  In the first case, they travel along a dirt road from the village of Vityaz, from where, in addition to this, there are three more primers - to the lighthouse (Cape Gamova), to Astafyev Bay, famous for white sand, and to Cape Schulz.  There are no other ways.  Access by car is only possible to the coastal edge, and further along the bay Telyakovsky move only on foot.  It is more comfortable to travel by sea, and the views of the coast are incredibly beautiful from this side. </p><h2>  How to get from large Far Eastern cities? </h2><p>  How to get to Telyakovsky bay from Vladivostok?  From the stop "Factory" Zarya "" to Andreevka - 220 km, you need to go through Razdolnoye to turn to Slavyanka.  From Vladivostok, by ferry from berth No. 36 to Slavyanka, then to Andreevka.  You can take bus number 521, which goes to the center of Andreevka.  From Khabarovsk they go to Krasino, after Ussuriysk - to Andreevka.  And from this village, as was said above, to the village of Vityaz along a road that leaves much to be desired, and then to the Telyakovsky Bay.  In the villages of Vityaz and Andreevka there are a lot of modern, well-equipped recreation centers that meet all modern requirements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="telyakovsky bay coastal region rest" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/977489.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Telyakovsky Bay (Primorsky Territory) can only provide rest to hardy lovers of wild and inaccessible nature: few will agree to travel hard and live without basic amenities.  True, it should be noted that the impressions received in this unusual place make the vacation unforgettable. </p><h2>  Complete opposite </h2><p>  At the beginning of the article it was indicated that in the Primorsky Territory with this name there are two bays.  The second bay of Telyakovsky (Shkotovsky district) is located in the upper part of the <span>Ussuri Bay.</span>  The distance from Vladivostok to the village of Shkotovo is 62 km, travel time is a little over an hour.  From this village you need to get on a bad road to the former garrison, belonging to the abandoned airport "Quay".  In one of the abandoned five-story buildings, people still live here and there.  The impression is not joyful, and the bay nearby is the exact opposite of that located in the Khasan region: the beach is dirty, the sea is heavily overgrown with algae.  Desolation reigns everywhere. </p>
