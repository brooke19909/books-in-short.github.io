Often travelers, having visited Goa, begin to make up their minds about the mysterious and multifaceted India based on this short tourist experience.  But do not rush, as often happens, the most famous state of Goa is completely different from the rest in the country. </p><p>  Goa is divided into South and North.  But the differences between them are not only geographical.  These two areas of the same resort are strikingly different from each other.  South Goa is a favorite resort for wealthy tourists from Europe, prosperous Hindus and holiday lovers in the Bounty style.  The advantages of the South in the form of paradise beaches, serene tropical landscapes are clear to everyone, but the prices in the South are relatively high and not only by Indian standards.  Students from Europe and Asia are happy to come to the relatively budgetary north of Goa, lovers of new experiences against the background of wild exotic, crazy shopping in the Indian style and club nightly courage. </p>

    <p>  For travel to other villages, it is best to order a taxi.  You can bargain with taxi drivers, you even need to, because they knowingly and very deliberately raise prices for tourists.  For locals, a taxi ride of up to 10 km rarely costs more than 500 rupees. </p><p>  You can also get to Kolva or other not so distant villages on a rented bike or bike. </p><p>  Driving a rented car is only possible for very experienced drivers.  For trips to the big cities of mainland India, it is better to buy package sightseeing tours and join in tourist groups. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  What excursions you can diversify your leisure time in Betalbatim </h2><p>  You will not find great cultural attractions that are popular among tourists in Goa.  But there are plenty of interesting places and picturesque natural beauties in the state, and they leave few people indifferent. </p><p>  Along the coast of Betalbatim, dolphin colonies often swim.  Local fishermen can book boat excursions along the coast to see the habitats of these cute, cheerful animals.  And an attentive tourist can watch the ‚Äúschools‚Äù of swimming dolphins right on the beach. </p><p>  For those who like to stare at the beauty of the underwater world, in the south of Goa there are several diving centers.  The closest thing to Coconut Grove The Goan Beach Retreat 4 * is Bogmalo Bay, where you can dive and look at corals, wildlife and how these underwater creatures inhabit sunken sailboats.  The price of diving without training, including equipment rental is 2.5 thousand rupees per one. </p><p>  Shopping lovers are best off to North Goa, where there are many large shopping centers, the most famous of which is Ajuna.  In Colva or Betalbatim you can buy only tourist trifles or local products, and even at very illogical prices. </p><p>  If the soul really asks for a cultural program, you can visit Old Goa, it was the capital of India in ancient times, when the country was a <span>colony of Portugal.</span>  The city is not without colonial chic and European comfort.  The architecture of the old city is very remarkable, there are many beautiful and majestic temple complexes. </p><p>  An excursion to the Dudhsagar Falls is an expensive pleasure, because you can go to it only in jeeps, accompanied by a reliable guide.  But if the vacation budget allows you to view the waterfall, it is included in the top of the most beautiful in the world.  Also a bonus during a trip to the waterfall you can visit a large plantation of spices, see how vanilla, cinnamon, different types of peppers, pineapple, papaya, cashews, etc. grow. </p><p>  The natural beauties of Goa leave no one indifferent, but if you want refined impressions from seeing the breathtaking wild flora and fauna, you can look into the Kotigao nature reserve.  There you can meet exotic birds, wild boars, monkeys, panthers, elephants, etc. Elephant rides are a popular tourist divorce, as camel rides in Egypt.  To agree or not to agree to such an exotic but risky adventure is a matter of taste for everyone.  But you need to know the price of the service and the route in advance. </p><h2>  Infrastructure on the territory of the hotel complex </h2><p>  The territory of Coconut Grove Beach Resort 4 * is very large, green and well-groomed.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe complex is 2200 square meters.  It is surrounded by a large tropical garden and pine groves.  On the territory there is a parking lot, two outdoor pools with sunbeds and umbrellas, a cocktail bar, a restaurant, a conference room, shops, a bike rental service. </p>

    <h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Coconut Grove 4 * hotel offers guests full or partial board meals. </p><p>  Breakfast is served in buffet style.  <span>Continental breakfasts</span> include soups, vegetables, fruits, egg dishes, cereals, cereals, pancakes, desserts, pastries, drinks, etc. </p><p>  Guests can order lunch on the menu.  Tourists in the reviews indicated that the dinners are fresh, tasty and inexpensive, even in comparison with the shekas on the beach.  But the dishes on the menu are prepared slowly. </p><p>  Dinners are also served buffet style.  Tourists are not advised to go to the restaurant of the Coconut Grove 4 * hotel, reviews about it are different.  Firstly, for those who simply come to eat, and do not eat on board, the prices are an order of magnitude higher, and even some changes in the waiters do not disdain to count inattentive white tourists. </p><p>  You can also eat in numerous shekels on the beach or on the road to Colva.  You can ask the tour operator about establishments with a normal reputation.  Indians sometimes have a fad about Russian incomes.  They like to palm off the price tag 15-20% higher, so in a cafe it is better to immediately contact the waiters in English. </p><p>  Fish and seafood are advised to order everything together, they are fresh there, and Indian cooks know how to handle them.  Also, those who do not want to put out the fire in the nasopharynx for the next three hours after dinner should warn the waiters that they don‚Äôt need to pepper dishes at all.  Spicy spices they still put, but it will be at least somehow edible. </p>

    <p>  Tourists spoke well about the establishments on the beach of Majorda or advised to go to restaurants at large hotels in Colva (Radisson, Holiday inn). </p><p>  Even in Kolva you can buy fruits, spices, cakes, drinks, etc. </p><h2>  Paid and free service at the hotel </h2><p>  The Coconut Grove 4 * hotel in Goa has Wi-Fi, but it is paid and very slow, like everywhere else in the resort.  This area is not intended for tourists who are mortally worried about high-speed Wi-Fi, white cuffs at waiters, high-speed elevators, asphalt washed with shampoo (there is generally no asphalt there).  For business travelers there is a conference room (for a fee). </p><p>  The hotel has currency exchange, bicycle rental and luggage room. </p><p>  Laundry service is paid extra. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has a massage room and a small spa, their visit is paid.  Ayurvedic massage, which is practiced in India, in the south of Goa and in Coconut Grove 4 * differs from the usual therapeutic or preventive massage.  The price for 1 session is less than 900 rupees, it‚Äôs definitely worth a try, it doesn‚Äôt help some at all, but it gives others just infant ecstasy. </p><p>  For the convenience of guests with children, an extra cot is placed in the room upon request, the restaurant has highchairs and a menu for babies.  Another small pool is suitable for bathing children.  The entrance to the sea is gentle and convenient for young tourists.  But Goa is not a perfect place to relax with the kids.  You will not find any special entertainments at the resorts, there is no similarity to mini-clubs in hotels.  But schoolchildren or children from five years old may be interested in this exotic place.  They can already appreciate the trip to the reserve, chat with animals, appreciate the beauty of the underwater world of the region.  And the ocean, such as in Goa, gives puppy delight to all tourists, regardless of age, gender and education. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  Betalbatima Beach is 250 meters from Coconut Grove 4 *.  If Blue Goals were awarded the best beaches in Goa, Betalbatim Beach would have received 10 awards.  Because it is more difficult to find a picturesque, more beautiful and more convenient beach.  It‚Äôs hard to even imagine something prettier. </p><p>  Sand on the beach is very fine, light.  The sand structure on the coast is unique; it is completely different from that on the beaches of Turkey or Egypt.  The sand is not so flying.  And, according to tourists, it crunches underfoot, like snow.  It is convenient to run on such sand and you can take long walks. </p><p>  In addition, the sand is so light that it seems almost white under the bright sun.  The entrance to the sea is gentle and even.  Ideal for children and inexperienced swimmers. </p><p>  On such sand you can relax quite comfortably without a deck chair, just on a towel or beach rug.  He is very nice and supple, warm, but not hot. </p>

    <p>  Sunbeds and umbrellas on the beach at Coconut Grove The Goan Beach Retreat 4 * paid.  But coastal shakes and cafes put up their sun loungers, and clients of these cafes themselves can accommodate for free.  Freshly squeezed juices, cocktails or bottled drinks can be bought on the beach calmly.  But before ordering food, you should still intuitively evaluate the attitude of Shek staff to hygiene. </p><p>  There are no special entertainments, water slides, attractions and other things on the beach, but there is a lot of free space and tranquility.  You can drive to Kolva or Majorda, where the beaches are more comfortable and lined with kiosks and cafes and all kinds of entertainments.  But they are often crowded and noisy. </p><h2>  Reviews on Coconut Grove Beach Resort 4 * </h2><p>  Quiet resorts such as Betalbatim in the south of Goa rarely get into the sales tops at travel agencies.  Leading tour operators do not take pride of place in the booklets, and very few organize advertising tours to such calm, quiet areas.  Therefore, often travel agents cannot provide their customers with comprehensive, up-to-date information on small hotels in such remote southern resorts. </p>

    <p>  But you can collect bit by bit information about the hotel by reading the reviews of tourists.  Reviews about Coconut Grove 4 * in Goa are mostly positive.  Satisfied tourists note the courtesy and courtesy of the staff.  The hotel staff knows how to communicate with guests, they are unobtrusive, but conscientious.  The room cleaning is very thorough, the towels are clean, the equipment works.  Fresh flowers are periodically brought to the rooms, small gifts are made to the newlyweds or those who have a birthday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Coconut Grove The Goan Beach Retreat 4" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1901760.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The food in the hotel restaurant is also, according to guests, quality and fresh.  There are all categories of dishes, including national, diet and vegetarian.  Food is prepared in a designated glass-paneled building so guests can watch the process.  But some tourists noted that the Indian waiters are rather slow. </p><p>  There were no categorically negative reviews about the Coconut Grove Beach Resort 4 * hotel in South Goa.  Some tourists were partially unhappy because of the sluggishness of the waiters, equipment breakdowns in the rooms, but they also noted that after contacting the reception they quickly repaired everything.  Guests who lived on the first floors also noted that a lot of living creatures and insects crawled into the room. </p><p>  Tourists are also advised to carry insect repellents, powerful sunscreens, hats and lights, as it gets dark there very early. </p>
