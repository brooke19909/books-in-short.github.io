    <h2>  Gzhel temples </h2><p>  Gzhel is an amazing city, and it is impossible to describe without telling about its temples.  They create a unique and special atmosphere of the province belonging to the suburbs.  All churches were built in just 50 years, but they are a great demonstration of different periods of the development of Russian architecture in the middle of the XIX and beginning of the last century. </p><p>  In this area, before the advent of the century before last, no churches were built of stone or brick.  An exception is the Assumption Church of the village of Gzhel.  The surrounding area is unusually rich in forests, neither local architects preferred to erect religious buildings made of wood.  But they, unfortunately, have not survived to our days.  However, there are brick churches dating from the years 1859-1910.  They are a peculiar feature of the immediate vicinity of Gzhel and herself. </p><p>  Since the mid-twentieth century, red-brick churches in most Russian corners began to imitate famous examples of ancient Russia.  Gzhel (city) was no exception.  Temples with five chapters gained wide popularity.  Religious buildings of this time adopted the complexity of the decoration of the XVII century.  The creators of the Church <span>of St. George</span> in the village.  Ignatievo tried to work in accordance with the above principle.  Naturally, the decor is in many ways inferior to the selected prototypes, but local architects did everything in their power so that the temple would become elegant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gzhel city what to see" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/732942.jpg" width="448"></div>

The first mention of this village dates back to 1744.  Then the settlement was part of the Gzhel Palace volost.  And since the XIX century, Rechitsa has become part of the Specific Department. </p><p>  The church was erected in 1859 thanks to funds donated by merchants, ordinary citizens and industrialists.  The building was built according to the usual project of the architect Ton.  According to the idea, the main dome should have been surrounded by four corners with small domes erected on them.  But there was not enough money to implement such an idea, and the church acquired its modern look. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúKunai well‚Äù </h2><p>  This is another unsurpassed place of Gzhel land.  If you go to Gzhel (city) by train and stop on a platform called ‚Äú55 km‚Äù, and then return a little towards the capital, then on the left side of the railway you can see one of the many sources of spring water.  Summer residents regularly come here for water. </p><p>  Today, little is known about the Kunai Well.  Before the revolution, a bathhouse was organized in its place.  Many people suffering from various diseases tried to heal in it.  But the largest number were children, since the source water had a particularly beneficial effect on children's health. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gzhel city attractions" class="if" height="232" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/732941.jpg" width="300"></div>
