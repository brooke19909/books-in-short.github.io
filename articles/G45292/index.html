    <h2>  Base </h2><p>  Peter is <span>a city</span> that used to be a small fortress.  In the XVIII century, the construction of each settlement began with the citadel: it was necessary to create reliable fortifications from enemies.  According to legend, Peter I himself laid the first stone in May 1703, on Hare Island, located near the Gulf of Finland.  Peter is a city built on human bones.  At least that is what many historians say. </p><p>  For the construction of a new city, civilian workers were involved.  They worked mainly to drain the swamps.  Many foreign engineers came to Russia to supervise the construction of the structures.  However, most of the work was done by masons from all over Russia.  Peter I from time to time issued various decrees that contributed to the accelerated process of building the city.  So, he forbade the use of stone in the construction of any structures throughout the country.  It is difficult for a modern person to imagine how hard the labor of the workers of the 18th century was.  Of course, there was no necessary equipment then, and Peter I strove to build a new city as quickly as possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  First residents </h2><p>  Peter is a city which in the first half of the 18th century was inhabited mainly by soldiers and sailors.  They were necessary to protect the territory.

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  We will talk about the Soviet period in the history of the city later.  First, it is worth saying what was done in imperial times.  Peter is a city that is often called the cultural capital.  And it is no coincidence.  There are a huge number of historical monuments, unique attractions.  Peter is a city that combines wonderfully Russian and Western culture.  The first palaces, which later became the property of culture, began to appear in the first half of the 18th century.  Then the famous palaces were built.  These buildings were designed by I. Matarnovi, D. Trezin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The history of the Hermitage begins in 1764.  The name of the attraction has French roots.  "Hermitage" in translation from the language of Walter means "the hermit's hut."  It exists for more than 250 years.  Over its long history, the Hermitage has become one of the most famous <span>museums in the world.</span>  Every year, tourists from all over the world visit it. </p><p>  In 1825, an event occurred on Senate Square in St. Petersburg that affected the course of Russian history.  Here the Decembrist uprising took place, which served as an impetus in the abolition of serfdom.  There are many significant dates in the history of St. Petersburg.  It is impossible to tell about all cultural and historical monuments within the framework of one article - a lot of documentary works are devoted to this topic.  We will tell briefly about the impact that the February Revolution had on the status of the city. </p>

    <h2>  Petrograd </h2><p>  Peter lost the status of the capital after the revolution.  However, it was renamed before.  The First World War had a strong influence on the fate of the city.  By 1914, anti-German sentiment was so strong that Nicholas I decided to rename the city.  So the capital of the Russian Empire became Petrograd.  In 1917, there were problems with the supply, there were lines in grocery stores.  In February, Nicholas II abdicated.  The formation of the Provisional Government began.  Already in November 1917, power passed to the Bolsheviks.  The Russian Soviet Republic was created. </p>

    <h2>  Leningrad </h2><p>  Peter lost the status of capital in March 1918.  After the death of Lenin was renamed Leningrad.  After the revolution, the population of the city decreased significantly.  In 1920, a little more than seven hundred thousand people lived here.  Moreover, the majority of the population from workers' settlements moved closer to the center.  In the twenties, housing construction began in Leningrad. </p><p>  In the first decade of the existence of the Soviet region, Krestovsky and Elagin islands were equipped.  In 1930, construction began on the Kirov stadium.  And soon new administrative units were allocated.  In 1937, a master plan of Leningrad was developed, which provided for its development in the south.  In 1932, Pulkovo Airport was opened. </p>

    <h2>  St. Petersburg during the Second World War </h2><p>  More than a quarter century ago, the city was returned to its former name.  However, what he had in Soviet times will never be forgotten.  The most tragic pages in the history of St. Petersburg fell on the period when it was called Leningrad. </p><p>  The capture of the city on the Neva by the German command would achieve important strategic goals.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  Master the economic base of the USSR. </li><li>  Capture the Baltic Navy. </li><li>  To consolidate dominance in the Baltic Sea. </li></ul><p>  The official beginning of the siege of Leningrad is September 8, 1941.  It was on that day that the land connection with the city was interrupted.  The inhabitants of Leningrad could not leave him.  The railway connection was also interrupted.  In addition to the indigenous people, about three hundred thousand refugees from the Baltic states and neighboring regions lived in the city.  This significantly complicated the situation. </p><p>  In October 1941, famine began in Leningrad.  First, he expressed himself in cases of loss of consciousness on the street, then in the mass depletion of citizens.  Food supplies could only be delivered to the city by air.  Movement through Lake Ladoga was carried out only when severe frosts occurred.  The complete blockade of Leningrad was broken in 1944.  Many of the emaciated residents who were taken out of the city could not be saved. </p>

    <h2>  The return of the historical name </h2><p>  Peter ceased to be called Leningrad in official documents in 1991.  Then a referendum was held, and it turned out that more than half of the inhabitants believe that their historical city needs to be returned.  In the nineties and the beginning of the two thousandths in St. Petersburg, many historical monuments were installed and restored.  Including the <span>Konstantinovsky Palace</span> and the Savior on Spilled Blood.  In May 1991, the first church service for almost the entire Soviet period was held in Kazan Cathedral. </p><p>  Today, more than five million people live in the cultural capital.  It is the second largest city in the country and the fourth in Europe. </p>
