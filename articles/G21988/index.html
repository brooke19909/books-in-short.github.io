A child knitters must find in the wardrobe a knitted dress for a girl for any season.  Particularly attractive outfits with a combination of beautiful patterns and the use of various tools. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted dress for girls knitting" class="if uuid-2573298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2573298.jpg"></div><h2>  What yarn to use </h2><p>  Knitted dresses can be worn at any time: be it summer time or winter cold.  It all depends on the yarn chosen for knitting and its composition.  So that the child does not feel uncomfortable when wearing a dress made of yarn, it is necessary to choose high-quality and natural skeins of thread, which are characterized by softness, tenderness of wool, do not aggravate the outfit, do not irritate the skin and do not leave spots on the child's body.  Manufacturers from different countries offer special yarn for knitting children's clothes. </p><p>  The bulk of the yarn is high-quality synthetics.  Also on sale is cotton blended with silk or viscose threads, and delicate alpaca wool, which is part of warm skeins of yarn.  Often, wool threads interfere with acrylic yarn and silk.  This fact gives the knitted dress for the girl softness, tenderness and comfort.  Products from such threads are hypoallergenic and cause a pleasant sensation.  Also an important criterion is the lack of stiffness during movement and coolness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted dress for girls" class="if uuid-2573299" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2573299.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitting tools </h2><p>  Before you start knitting a dress for a girl with knitting needles, you should decide on the size, as well as select the appropriate tools for the selected yarn.  The size of the knitting needles or hook depends on the width of the thread in the skein.  The thicker it is, the larger the number of the working tool.  The numbers of knitting needles and hooks are recommended by the manufacturers themselves and are indicated on the label of the yarn.  To create some products, circular knitting needles are used.  If a crocheted dress for the girl is created, then the hem, skirts and coquette are often formed in a circle.  When using an openwork pattern, knitters are advised to take a smaller tool than recommended by yarn manufacturers.  This avoids the strong stretching of the crochets, which can spoil the appearance of the main fabric of the dress. </p><p>  Also in the process of knitting, auxiliary materials are used.  For example, markers that indicate areas of raglans or loops of patterns, small needles to support loops when forming braids and plaits.  And also special blunt needles for stitching finished parts.  Some tools are also used for crocheting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crocheted girl dress" class="if uuid-2573297" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2573297.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of models </h2><p>  An important point is the correct choice of style of knitted dresses for girls.  The product from the selected yarn should correspond to the weather, the characteristics of the child’s figure, as well as be attractive and unique. </p><p>  Based on weather conditions, we can agree that the models of crocheted dresses for girls can be with sleeves of different lengths: from strapless to detail on the wrist. </p><p>  Knitting methods can also be different: to be formed as separate elements sewn during assembly, as well as knitted from the bottom of the coquette.  Many dresses are created from individual elements sewn at the end of the work.  Some styles are knitted using circular knitting needles with a set of loops that define the lower edge of the model.  There are dresses created with a yoke or the formation of ragged lines.  There are models of a straight cut, trapezoidal shape or having a wide circular hem. </p><p>  Fashion designers offer a wide variety of styles of knitted dresses for children.  Having studied the sequence of work and choosing original patterns, you can create your own model of the dress, which will emphasize the individuality of the girl. </p>
