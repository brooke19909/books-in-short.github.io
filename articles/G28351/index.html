    <h2>  City infrastructure near the hotel </h2><p>  Prague has long been loved by many tourists.  Prague Center Superior 3 * is actually located in a very good location.  In the immediate vicinity of it is the restaurant "Legend".  Here you can, if you wish, order delicious dishes for a very reasonable fee.  Also, this restaurant offers just a huge selection of beers. </p><p>  Opposite the metro, next to the hotel, there is also an inexpensive, but very convenient cafe.  If you wish, you can have a good breakfast or lunch here.  Unfortunately, there are no too large shopping centers in the immediate vicinity of the hotel.  However, nearby there are several ordinary stores of different specializations.  You can make purchases in a large supermarket in the central square. </p><h2>  Prague Attractions </h2><p>  As already mentioned, in the immediate vicinity of the hotel there are many interesting places in historical and cultural terms.  The most popular tourist attractions in this part of Prague are: </p><ol><li>  Charles Square.  Here you can see just a huge number of ancient churches. </li><li>  Temple of St. Stephen.  This Gothic-style Catholic church was built in the mid-14th century.  The interior of this temple is rather modest.  And this is not about the poverty of the parish.  The ancient architect conceived this design specifically so that believers could focus on fellowship with God.  It is the scarcity of decoration that creates a special atmosphere in this temple, and also gives it a completely unique flavor. </li><li>  Summer Palace of Count Michna.  This building was built in 1720.  The baroque palace is decorated.  In this ancient building costumed performances are often held, at which guests have the opportunity, in addition to all the delicacies offered, to taste the famous Becherovka drink. </li><li>  Dancing House.  This unusual modern building, built in the style of deconstructivism, has for several years invariably attracted the attention of guests of Prague.  This multi-storey building is an architectural metaphor for a dancing couple. </li></ol>
