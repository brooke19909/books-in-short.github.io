It‚Äôs easy enough, and the result will please the soul and raise self-esteem and decorate any image, especially in spring.  Textile flowers are in trend, they are used in clothes, hats, as brooches and appliqu√©s, on belts and hair accessories.  A necklace made of textile flowers looks especially sophisticated, such jewelry is easy to create with your own hands, just desire is enough. </p><h2>  Chiffon fantasies </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.beadandcord.com" data-author=":  Liliman, "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric flowers" class="if uuid-2392474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2392474.jpg"></div><p>  So, let's take a step-by-step look at how to make flowers from fabric, and what you need for this.  The easiest way to make a flower is from chiffon or similar synthetic material.  Why is composition important?  Because the edges of the flower and the petals must melt, bending in the form of bizarre waves, which will create an effect similar to living plants.  If the edge of the fabric when melted is painted black (it all depends on the composition of the fabric) - this is not a reason to abandon creativity.  Such flowers in finished form look especially vintage, be sure to experiment!  It is necessary to take pieces of chiffon, cut from five to ten circles of different diameters. </p><p>  By the way, this does not have to be circles, but for example templates with four leaves.  The magnitude and volume of the flower depends on the number and size of the blanks.  Above the burning candle we melt the edges of each circle, the workpiece bends and takes the shape of a bowl.  This point requires caution, so as not to get a burn, you can use tweezers.  Next, we add the resulting petals according to the ‚Äúnesting doll principle‚Äù from the smallest to the largest.  At this stage, you can experiment with the location of the petals: it is not necessary that they are exactly in the center of each other, perhaps with a shift in details the flower will look more magnificent and interesting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="the process of making peony from chiffon" class="if uuid-2398962" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2398962.jpg"></div><p>  In the center of the flower, you can sew several large beads or a lot of small beads.  If embroidery with beads is not your hobby, there is an option: pour a little transparent glue in the middle of the bud and sprinkle it with thick beads or sequins.  When the glue dries, the excess elements will crumble, and the result will be no worse than the previous one.  Everything is quite simple and effective. </p><h2>  How to make flowers from fabric? </h2><p>  The next option, as in the previous example, begins with cutting round blanks.  The main difference is that all circles should be the same size.  Such flowers can be made from knitwear, denim, linen, chintz, lace, felt, the main thing is that at the edges the fabric does not crumble strongly.  For one flower, at least 4 mugs and one circle of the same size, but from something more dense in the color of the blanks (felt, foamiran, leather, cardboard) will be needed.  A larger number of blanks will be more difficult to arrange on the basis, but it will look more interesting and magnificent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric flowers" class="if uuid-2399019" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2399019.jpg"></div><p>  So, visually divide the base into four parts.  Using a glue gun or a needle with a thread, we attach a quadruple blank folded four times to each sector.  In the process of fixing the petals, you can deform the workpiece, experiment.  Sew beads, rhinestones, beads or even a brooch in the center of the flower, as your imagination suggests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Textile dahlia </h2><p>  And now let's try to consider a diagram of how to make a dahlia flower from fabric.  We need a strip of fabric, about 30 cm long and 10-15 cm wide. We cut the edges of the fabric in the form of denticles, then we sew stitches along the uncut edge with a needle and thread, as shown in the picture.  We tighten the flower into a bud, fix it in this position.  Dahlia is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.marthastewart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric dahlia" class="if uuid-2392470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2392470.jpg"></div><p>  In the same way, with a different edge pattern and fabrics of different composition, you can make many different colors for decorating clothes and accessories.  Who knows how to make flowers from fabric, undoubtedly win in a variety of products, using their needlework skills. </p><h2>  Rose made of fabric using the technique of "snail" </h2><p>  The rose flower made of fabric by the ‚Äúsnail‚Äù method looks spectacular.  To make such a flower, we need a strip of fabric 30 cm long. It is most comfortable to work with this knitwear in this technique, when the experience appears and the skill is worked out, it will be possible to make flowers from any material.  We twist a strip of fabric in the form of a cord, then we fix each circle with a glue gun, we fix the circles from the center to the edge.  A scattering of such flowers of various sizes looks amazing.  In this technique, necklaces are made of textile flowers with the addition of rhinestones, beads, feathers and other decorative elements.  This is a godsend for the boho style, which is rapidly gaining popularity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric flowers using the &quot;snail&quot; technique" class="if uuid-2398990" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2398990.jpg"></div><h2>  Fabric tulip - simple and original </h2><p>  And the last mini workshop: making a textile tulip.  Such tulips love to group, seven or more pieces - this is a chic bouquet that will decorate your own interior, and as a gift it will be simply gorgeous.  You will have to work on such a creation, you won‚Äôt need special sewing skills, just basic needle and thread skills.  For the bud, you will need three identical almond-shaped blanks with a truncated base on one side.  The fabric can be either plain or polka dots, a small check, a flower.  For the stalk, a strip of green fabric measuring 20 cm by 4 cm. Also, a blank of a tulip leaf is needed a little less in length than a leg.  You can insert a cocktail tube, a wooden stick or wire into the base of the stem of a future tulip.  Below is a photo of how to make a flower from a fabric to visually represent this process. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="textile tulip, pattern" class="if uuid-2398963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2398963.jpg"></div><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  How to make a flower right? </p><ol><li>  Sew the blank for the stem, folding it in length twice, at a distance of 0.3 cm from the edge. </li><li>  <span>Unscrew the stem with a thin, long object, such as a knitting needle or a ballpoint pen.</span> </li><li>  <span>Sew three blanks for the bud in stages in such a way that a triangular tulip bud is obtained (leave the area unstitched for turning the flower below).</span> </li><li>  <span>Unscrew the bud, fill it tightly with a synthetic winterizer.</span> </li><li>  <span>Insert the base into the stem to give it rigidity and flexibility.</span> </li><li>  <span>Connect the stem and bud with a thread and a needle, if the connection is not quite neat, you can tie a small bow from a narrow ribbon under the bud.</span> </li><li>  <span>Sew a tulip leaf, focusing on the length of the stem, securing it with glue around the stem.</span> </li></ol><p>  Making a bouquet, you can not make leaves for each tulip, as it looks great with a minimum amount of "greenery". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.elephantinmyhandbag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric tulips" class="if uuid-2392508" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2392508.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, we examined the most simple and original options, how to make a <span>flower from a fabric with your own hands</span> with a photo and a description of the process itself.
