It is a walking and transportation system that connects Sumskaya Street (the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Park Cinema and the FED factory) with the Pavlovo Pole microdistrict.  The path passes through <span>the Gorky</span> and Sarzhin yar <span>park</span> . </p><h2>  The history of the cableway </h2><p>  In the late 1960s, the city began to develop rapidly; several production and research organizations were opened in the north of Kharkov.  Of course, there was a need to create a quick and convenient transport for transporting passengers from Sumskaya Street to Pavlovskaya Polye.  As a result, taking into account the tracing, it was decided to create a cable car. </p>

    <p>  The cable car was launched in the early 70s of the XX century.  Immediately after commissioning, it was used not only as a walking system, but also as a transport system.  Derevyanko Street was not yet stretched to Sokolniki, and the metro station, as such, on Pavlovsky Pole did not exist.  Thus, with the help of the movement of the cableway in Kharkov, a large number of workers in the shortest possible time got to KhAZ and FED from Pavlov Field to work.  For this category of people there were travel and discount tickets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to the indigenous inhabitants of the city, university students also used this cableway in addition to factory workers.  For the simple reason that it was more convenient and quicker for them to get from dormitories located on Pavlovy Pole to educational institutions using a cable car than on any other form of transport.  In addition, such a trip to school was not only unusual and exciting, but also cheap. </p><p>  In the summer of 2012, the cable car was reconstructed and overhauled: 3 km of cable, moving parts were replaced, cabs were painted and repaired.  The attraction resumed its work from the beginning of August. </p><p>  Another global reconstruction of the cableway occurred in the spring of 2014.  For the first time for the existence of the attraction, cabs were exchanged for new ones, identical to those used in Yalta.  New cabins were made in the Dnieper.  They are 20% heavier than the previous ones, made of fiberglass, in red, yellow, blue and green.  The Park station was also updated. </p><h2>  Cableway in Kharkov </h2><p>  The length of the cable car route between the two landing stations "Gorky Park" and "Pavlovo Pole" totals about 1385 meters.  During the movement, double cabins pass over the Sarzhyn Yar, from where you can see a colorful panorama opening onto one of the oldest districts of the city and the source of mineral table water ‚ÄúKharkiv No. 1‚Äù.  On the slopes of the Yar is the Botanical Garden. </p>

    <p>  The Pavlovo Pole landing station is a project of the architect I. Popov, and the mosaic panel is decorated by V. Savenkov. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The highest point of the Kharkov cableway is 26 meters.  For the entire duration of the journey, the cable car cabin passes 18 towers of various heights - dropping to 8 meters and rising to 26. The carrying capacity of any cab is 160 kg, a total of 124 double cabs on the road.  However, as an exception, three people can fit in the cabin, provided that their combined weight does not exceed 160 kg. </p><h2>  Operating mode of the cableway in Kharkov </h2><p>  The cable car can be visited on all days except Mondays.  From Tuesday to Friday from 11.00 to 20.00.  On weekends and holidays, the attraction is open from 10.00 to 21.00.  During strong winds and heavy rains, the movement of the cable car stops. </p><p>  In time, the one-way route takes 18 minutes, during which passengers can enjoy a picturesque view of the green areas of the park.  The price of the cableway in Kharkov as of September is 30 hryvnias.  Payment takes place locally. </p>

    <p>  Children under 14 years old are allowed to attend the ride only accompanied by adults.  Children up to 110 cm tall can use the attraction for free. </p><h2>  How to get to the Kharkov cable car? </h2><p>  The initial landing station of the Kharkov cableway called Gorpark is located in the Gorky Park, which is located on Sumskaya Street, near the Park cinema.  The next Pavlovo Pole station is at the junction of 23 August Street and Otakar Yarosh Street (Botanical Garden district). </p><h2>  Interesting information about the cable car </h2><p>  About 10 years ago during the advertising campaign of the Beeline mobile operator, a large number of cabins were painted in a horizontal strip of yellow-black color (which resembled a Beeline bee in appearance).  On the rest of the booths, an image of various objects with the corresponding color was applied.  Such booths lasted for 3 years. </p>

    <p>  In April 2016, the cable car was damaged.  The evacuation of passengers stuck over a swamp took 3 hours, since it was impossible to bring stairs to hard-to-reach places. </p><p>  And a year ago, in September 2016, according to the version of the British popular newspaper The Guardian, the Kharkov cable car was on the list of 10 best lifts around the world. </p>
