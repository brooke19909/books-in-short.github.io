He himself is part of a complex of hotels standing in a luxurious park by the sea in the resort town of Sousse.  Two other hotels, united by a common territory, are ‚ÄúMarhaba‚Äù and ‚ÄúClub‚Äù.  "Neptune" is a building located on the seashore itself.  The nearest airport to the hotel is Monastir.  There are twenty kilometers to it.  Enfida is located away.  To get from there to Sousse, you need to overcome fifty kilometers.  The rooms in this building are simpler, and the building is older than the two neighboring hotels.  But the sea is splashing right at your feet, and the price does not bite at all.  Therefore, the hotel is quite popular with tourists, and many try to come here several times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marhaba resort bloc neptune 4" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/681191.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sousse hotels - brief description </h2><p>  This city is considered the most boisterous and democratic resort of Tunisia.  Its population in the holiday season increases to almost a million people.  Here is the largest number of hotels that stretch along the sea for twenty kilometers.  Tourist areas are mainly located in the suburbs.  The first hotels that began to be built in the eighties are located closer to the center of Sousse.  Therefore, they are not as pretentious as those located in such tourist places as El Kantaoui.  And the sea there may not be very clean, But the hotels of this city are liked, first of all, by young people.  There are many restaurants, bars and nightclubs that will satisfy any request.  With housing in Sousse, you can not particularly strain.  The most budget hotels are ‚Äúkopecks‚Äù, without special services and frills.  "Treshki" provides pools, "all inclusive", and thalassotherapy centers - however, without sea water.  And already the Quartet are better hotels with a beautiful territory, a very diverse diet and a lot of bonuses.  As a rule, these are multi-storey hotels that stand on the sea or in a park.  These ‚Äúfours‚Äù include Marhaba Neptune 4. It belongs to the famous Tunisian network of ‚ÄúMarhaba‚Äù.  There are several hotels in this chain in Sousse, and they tend to occupy high places in the ranking.  Of the "fives" the network "El-Muradi" is famous, and of the "three rubles" - "Marabu". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Accommodation at the Marhaba Resort Bloc Neptune 4 can be found for every taste.  There are rooms budget, standard, suites.  Many of them have sea views.  Yes, this is not surprising if it is at hand.  In the room - all amenities, wi-fi.  On the balcony you can breathe the sea air without leaving the room.  The bathroom has a hairdryer, <span>shower gels</span> and shampoo.  The furniture is not new, but it looks nice and neat.  The rooms are very nice, clean, bright.  Case numbers are located so that none of them have a bad view.  The rooms have televisions - not the latest model, but they catch Russian channels.  You do not need to rent them, unlike the neighboring buildings.  If you come to swim and have fun, rather than sitting in the room, then you will be delighted.  But it‚Äôs nice to be in the room itself - great views, the smell and noise of the sea, good beds, and most importantly, you can‚Äôt hear the noise of neighbors.  The hotel was renovated in 2008 and 2013, but who gets what numbers is a lottery.  By the way, if there are any malfunctions in the rooms, you will have to go to the reception in the main building of the whole complex.  Neptune has no such services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marhaba neptune 4" class="if" height="293" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/681189.jpg" width="440"></div>
