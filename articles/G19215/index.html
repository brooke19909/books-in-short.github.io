He was only 28 years old, but he managed to take part in two Chechen battles, where he demonstrated military skill, courage and courage.  Being seriously wounded, he continued to fulfill his duties of transmitting important data, on the basis of which the commanders made adjustments to aimed fire. </p><h2>  Training weekdays </h2><p>  The years of life of Viktor Romanov: 1972 - 2000. The hero of Russia was born on May 15 in the Sverdlovsk region, in the village of Sosva.  He studied there and graduated from high school.  The father thought that his son, like him, would choose medicine, but the young man preferred the career of a military officer. </p><p>  In 1989, Romanov Victor came to enter the Tbilisi Artillery School, where he was registered until 1991, until he was dismissed due to the fact that the USSR ceased to exist.  Many cadets from the former republics that were part of the Union transferred to the Kolomensk educational institution. </p><p>  So Romanov in 1991 extended his studies in Kolomenskoye.  Victor devoted all his time to classes.  He sought to learn everything that a military officer should know.  Teachers have repeatedly noted the diligence and responsibility of the young cadet.  Victor successfully mastered knowledge and quickly acquired everything necessary. </p><h2>  Military service in the artillery regiment </h2><p>  In 1993, study ended.  Military service began in Pskov, where Viktor Viktorovich Romanov was appointed platoon commander of a self-propelled artillery battery. </p><p>  In the period from 1991 to 1994, the Chechen Republic became completely independent of the Russian Federation, so the President and the Government of the Russian Federation decided to restore order with the help of military force.  Thus began the first Chechen war. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.soldati-russian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chechen War" class="if uuid-3200456" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106514/3200456.jpg"></div><p>  Since November 20, 1994, Romanov Viktor took part in it in conjunction with other units.  The main goal of the military was to restore constitutional order.  The largest and most serious operation in which Romanov participated was the storming of the city of Grozny on New Year's Eve.  Wounded in the Chechen war, in February he was hospitalized.  On this his trip ended.  For the courage and courage that Viktor Viktorovich Romanov showed in the battle, he received the award of the Order of Courage, as well as the 1st degree medal ‚ÄúFor Military Valor‚Äù. </p><h2>  The storming of Grozny </h2><p>  On September 20, 1999, the second Chechen company began.  The reason for her was an attempt by the fighters Basayev and Khattab to conduct a military operation in the Dagestan Republic. </p><p>  In late September, Russian troops entered the territory of Chechnya. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="At war" class="if uuid-3200452" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106514/3200452.jpg"></div><p>  On December 26, 1999, the assault on Grozny began, which ended on February 6, 2000. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The captain went on a business trip to Chechnya in early February.  Even then, he took part in several skirmishes with militants. </p><p>  Events preceding the feat of Captain Romanov took place on February 29 in the Argun Gorge.  There, the pressure of the militants was restrained by the 6th company of the 104th paratrooper regiment.  Romanov expressed a desire to become a fire controller.  In the battle with the militants, he not only prepared urgently, but also sent the data to adjust the shooting to the headquarters, and also directed artillery fire on himself.  Along with the transfer of materials, he scribbled out of automatic weapons.  Even after Romanov lost his legs from a mine explosion and was wounded in the stomach by a fragment, he continued to continue to make adjustments to the fire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="varlamov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Place of war" class="if uuid-3200457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106514/3200457.jpg"></div><h2>  Hero's feat </h2><p>  According to the stories of Alexander Suponinsky, Victor, being wounded, helped other paratroopers as best he could: he said encouraging words, filled horns with cartridges and threw them to the defending soldiers. </p><p>  When there were three of them, Romanov ordered the remaining two to leave.  Thanks to this, they were able to survive. </p><p>  On March 1, 2000, at 5 in the morning of the guard, the captain was killed by a sniper shot.  Early in the morning, the militants rushed into battle, hoping to finish off the remaining wounded paratroopers.  The forces were unequal, and all Russian soldiers died in this shootout.  The militants usually abused the bodies, but Romanov was not touched, perhaps because he was lying on his stomach and his face was not visible.  When doctors examined the body, they found a large number of injuries and wounds. </p><p>  The most bloody battle took place in the Argun Gorge.  It killed 84 paratroopers. </p><h2>  Posthumous glory </h2><p>  The captain Romanov‚Äôs guard was buried at home.  In memory of him and his feat, a street and a school in the village of Sosva were named.  The educational institution created a museum of military glory. </p><p>  By presidential decree, Viktor Viktorovich Romanov, as well as twenty of his comrades, was awarded the title of Hero of Russia posthumously. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oblgazeta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Opening of the monument to the hero" class="if uuid-3200444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106514/3200444.jpg"></div><p>  The memory of the heroes will always live in the hearts of citizens and in the history of the country.  In the homeland of Romanov, Victor is still remembered.  On the 15th anniversary of his death at school No. 1, where he once studied, a rally was held devoted to those terrible military events and the feat of brave Russian children.  The guys fired white balls into the blue sky, which became a symbol of memory of the Pskov paratroopers who died in a foreign land in the exercise of their direct duties. </p>
