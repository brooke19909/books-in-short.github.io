Rest, beaches, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This article is for those who are going to go on vacation to <span>Cyprus (Limassol).</span>  Reviews about this city, its tourist infrastructure, beaches, hotels and the most popular excursions will not only broaden your horizons, but also give, hopefully, useful information for independent travelers.  We will also try to talk about how to spend time on the island with maximum benefit.  Unlike other resorts in Cyprus, Limassol, as a rule, satisfies all categories of tourists.  Here they find what they need, and restless youth, and calm and romantic natures, and families with small children.  This resort is considered democratic, but it is also full of hotels for very, very demanding customers.  In addition, on this territory it is convenient for those who come to Cyprus not only for the sea and the beach.  Beautiful roads and a well-developed public transport network make it possible to fully enjoy the rich culture of this Mediterranean country. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus limassol reviews" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/441441.jpg" width="550"></div></h2><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Where is the city of <span>Limassol located?</span>  <span>Cyprus, the</span> map of which is presented below, shows us that it is located on the south coast of the island, between Larnaca and Paphos.  From both cities to Limassol, approximately seventy kilometers.  This location makes the resort very convenient for those tourists who cannot sit still and who want to see as many attractions as possible.  All interesting excursions can be completed in one day.  Limassol on the map of Cyprus is designated as the second largest city after the <span>capital of Nicosia.</span>  And it is true.  The population here, by our standards, is small - only 200 thousand people.  And the size of the settlement is not impressive: there are only three avenues parallel to each other and one promenade stretching along the coast.  But tourists who have been here do not call Limassol the outback.  On the contrary, it enjoys fame as the business capital of the country, because it is an offshore zone.  Here are the main trading port, offices of various international companies.  In addition, as tourists notice, this city is the most Russian-speaking.  Several thousand immigrants from the republics of the former USSR received Cyprus citizenship and now live in Limassol. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The local port also accepts passenger ships.  From the Israeli cities of Ashdod and Haifa, from Beirut, from the Greek islands of Crete and Rhodes, ferries leave for Limassol (Cyprus).  The map shows that travel by sea should not be too long and tiring.  But Limassol has not yet acquired its own airport.  All flights arrive in the neighboring cities of Larnaca and Paphos.  Tourists are met by an army of taxi drivers.  But reviews are advised not to give in to promises and use buses or a minibus.  It will cost ten times cheaper, and the trip time is the same - about 45 minutes.  When taking a bus, you need to be careful: there are express trains from the New Amorosa, Intercity Bases and Alepa companies - they do not stop in the villages.  But the routes 612 and 613, leaving Paphos, follow through Timi, Ktima and Geroskipou. </p>

    <h2>  When to come </h2><p>  Experienced tourists were divided in their opinion on which month the best weather in Cyprus is.  Limassol is located in the south of the island, and from the north it is protected by the Troodos mountain range.  Due to this circumstance, the entire coast to the west and east of the city is called the Cyprus Riviera.  The tourist season is interrupted only for the winter.  And since the city has a lot of entertainment (including water parks), in Limassol there are a lot of tourists in the early spring and late autumn.  Many travelers claim that May is the best time to visit Cyprus.  This month there is little rain, and the temperature is comfortable for northerners - you can combine sunbathing and excursions.  But the sea is still cold - only +20 ¬∞ .  But in May, a flower festival takes place.  June is also dry and not as hot as it is customary to think: +24 ... + 27 ¬∞ .  The sea warms up to 24, but it also happens that a cold current comes.  In June, the Russian-Cypriot Festival, the festival of Neptune and the Shakespeare Days are held in Limassol.  July and August are hot but humid.  Temperature: +29 - air, and +27 - water.  Most reviews claim that September is the most comfortable holiday.  Limassol at this time celebrates the Young Wine Festival, which, by the way, is excellent in this part of Cyprus.  But October is a continuation of the velvet season.  Water and air are equal in temperature - 25 degrees Celsius, but the probability of precipitation is high.  This month, the Lemesia sports competition and the International Cinema Festival are held. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  The hotel base of the city is very diverse.  It allows you to comfortably accommodate at the resort and students, and a more respectable audience.  Experienced tourists warn those who are going to come to Cyprus (Limassol) for the first time: prices here are higher than in Turkey or Egypt, but definitely lower than Greek, Spanish and Italian.  Party youth are usually housed in hostels or two-star hotels in the city center.  The outskirts of the resort attract lovers of privacy and comfort.  In satellite villages, <span>hotels with a private beach, boutique hotels</span> and spa complexes are not uncommon.  Usually breakfast is included in the price.  But if you wish, when booking a hotel, you can order a <span>guesthouse (full</span> or half).  There is where to eat in Limassol: fish taverns, snack bars and restaurants are found at every step.  Tourists were divided on whether to consider the fact that Limassol is the most Russian-speaking city on the island, plus or minus.  The ability to communicate with staff in their native language is, of course, the indisputable advantage of the resort.  But coexistence with compatriots? </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  This is the main asset and visiting card of the Cyprus Riviera and the city of Limassol.  The photo, however, cannot convey this completely.  The narrow coastline and the look of dirty gray sand scare away some potential vacationers.  But in vain.  Experienced tourists claim that this sand is special, healing.  It was formed from powdered coral chips.  This sand is even added to scrubs and cosmetic masks.  At times, small pebbles are found.  The coastline is narrow, but do not worry - the city stretches along the sea for 15 kilometers, so there is enough space for everyone under the sun.  Entrance to the beaches is absolutely free, but you will have to pay for using the ammunition.  The best infrastructure in the city is Dasoudi.  It is located just east of the city center.  For lovers of privacy, reviews recommend Ladies Mile. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  Antiquity and the Middle Ages, European and Turkish influence - all this is the island of Cyprus.  The city of Limassol, surrounded by antiquities - witnesses of ancient times deep - is relatively young.  It was founded "only something" in the XI century.  <span>The medieval city of</span> Lemesos (the so-called Limassol then) was exactly in the middle between the ancient Greek policies Amathus and Kourion.  It is authentically known that the marriage of King Crusader Richard the Lionheart with the Princess of Navarre Berengaria took place here.  The church, in which the wedding took place in 1191, was not preserved.  In its place, the Knights Templar built a castle and reconstructed it many times until they chose the island of Malta as the capital for their monastic order.  However, they left behind the tradition of making Commandaria wine, which many highly recommend trying.  The castle was reconstructed under the subsequent rulers: Lusignans, Venetians, Turks.  Now it houses the Museum of the Middle Ages. </p>

    <h2>  City Tours </h2><p>  Kolossi Castle is the ‚ÄúMast-Sea No. 1‚Äù, which should be visited by everyone who is relaxing in the resort of Limassol.  A photo of this medieval stronghold flaunts on postcards, magnets, t-shirts and other souvenir products.  Less well-known is Ayia Napa - the church in which the saint that Christ who was walking on Golgotha ‚Äã‚Äãwas kept is the veil that was stored as a miraculous relic of Veronica's plates.  They say that it is precisely this that still preserves His appearance.  KEO winery may not be as "postcard" as the Kolossi castle, but no less famous.  After all, it is there that the tradition of making the glorious Templar wine Commandaria is stored and developed.  Tourists visiting Limassol are advised to take bicycle tours of the city.  Everywhere there is a rental station for this convenient two-wheeled vehicle. </p><h2>  Excursions in the vicinity </h2><p>  What historical sights do you need to visit for those who want to get to know Cyprus better?  Limassol (tours in this direction are very popular among our tourists) allows you to get acquainted with the monuments of antiquity.  The ancient Amathus and Kourion, or rather, their ruins, have long entered the city limits.  Reviews also recommend visiting the temple of Apollo of Hylate with the remains of Paphos and Curium gates.  And in the Troodos mountains in the pine groves, <span>medieval monasteries</span> are hiding from prying eyes <span>.</span>  Tourists leave very favorable reviews about the "real Cypriot village" Pissouri.  In addition to the original color, it also boasts an excellent beach. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment and shopping </h2><p>  Well, suppose you are tired of the antiquities that overflow Cyprus.  Limassol, reviews of which will tell you how to have fun, will not let you get bored.  Fashionistas will surely appreciate all the charm of relaxation in the offshore zone.  Brand clothes, shoes and accessories can be bought at boutiques on Makarius Street.  Another trade artery runs perpendicular to Kolossi Castle throughout the old city.  ‚ÄúCommandaria‚Äù and other wines can be purchased at the KEO factory (after excursions and tastings), as well as in various distilleries of the city and its environs.  Children will certainly be interested in visiting the amusement park, the only menagerie on the island and a donkey reserve, which is located in the village of Wuni (half an hour from the city).  Well, for a good rest with the whole family, reviews are advised to visit one of the three water parks. </p><h2>  Restaurants and discos </h2><p>  Of all the cities on the island of Cyprus, Limassol is called the most affordable price.  Maybe that's why all the youth of Western and Central Europe flock here?  Because of it, Limassol is also called the "city that never sleeps."  Many discos, bars and nightclubs are concentrated on Galatex Street and its surroundings.  Another center of nightlife is the Potamos Yermasoyias area.  Restaurants are scattered throughout the town, and the question of where to eat is not for tourists.  Reviews often mention the huge portions that are usually served, and recommend taking one for two.  Each meat or fish dish will certainly be served with a side dish. </p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  What is recommended by people who traveled all over Cyprus?  Limassol - reviews from tourists repeatedly mention this - is the cheapest city on the island.  But you can make the rest in it even more budgetary, if you know little secrets.  To visit the water parks - the central Water Mania, standing in the midst of the citrus grove Fasouri Wanermania and Wet`n Wild with a huge selection of slides - use advertising flyers.  They will give you a tangible discount.  The same rule applies for entering nightclubs.  Many are advised to rent a car.  The roads on the island are wonderful, and gasoline is cheaper than in Russia.  So you can travel around the whole island and visit the Governor's beach (buses do not go there).  This place is interesting with crystal clear water, black sand and white stones.  Go to it for a quarter of an hour. </p>
