Therefore, competition with many well-known brands has increasingly become less famous companies.  So, the new <span>ZTE V5</span> Pro smartphone, the review of which we will present to you, may well compete with such "giants" as the Samsung Galaxy, iPhone and LG. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte v5 pro review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1005969.jpg" width="504"></div>

    <h2>  A few words about the brand </h2><p>  Naturally, before describing the ZTE V5 Pro, you need to talk a little about the manufacturer.  Chinese, by the way.  Not everything that has been done in the Middle Kingdom is of poor quality.  And this is stubbornly proved by various fairly large companies.  ZTE is no exception.  The company was founded a long time ago, but only recently entered the Russian market.  And by the way, she even managed to become an official sponsor of the Comedy Battle program on the famous entertainment channel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte v5 pro reviews" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1005970.jpg" width="600"></div>

It can not be attributed to very expensive devices, however, he fulfills his funds more than enough.  One of the most important ‚Äúchips‚Äù of this budget smartphone is the presence of a fingerprint scanner.  That is, the owner can set it as a means to unlock the screen, thereby protecting all information from prying eyes.  The ZTE V5 Pro smartphone also has another ‚Äútrick‚Äù, which is support for memory cards up to 128 GB in size.  Thus, the phone can become a whole center for work, entertainment and data storage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte v5 pro n939st reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1005971.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Since about 80% of owners like to be photographed on a smartphone, the quality of pictures and a camera for many is one of the most important criteria.  It is worth saying that the ZTE V5 Pro, which we are reviewing, lives up to expectations.  So, the <span>front camera</span> here is as much as 5 megapixels, which is enough for high-quality selfies.  And of course, for conversations with video calling in popular applications.  ZTE V5 Pro, the main camera with as much as 13 megapixels, is suitable for shooting the most important moments in life.  And in the dark too!  The camera, by the way, is very good: Exmor RS with five lenses, which allows you to create high-quality macro shots.  NeoVision 5 software is rated by professionals as budget-friendly but decent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte v5 pro" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1012676.jpg" width="600"></div>

And here, too, the ZTE V5 Pro, the review of which we present to you, did not disappoint.  The internal memory is 16 GB, of which about 14.5 GB are available to the user.  If you wish, you can expand the memory using Micro SD. </p><h2>  RAM </h2><p>  This is also an important moment in modern smartphones.  The V5 Pro has 2 GB of RAM.  And this is quite enough for the work of many applications and games without ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù and ‚Äúglitches‚Äù.  And of course, multitasking is supported without problems.  For modern smartphones that combine a mobile phone and a PDA, it is very important to provide the user with access to all the desired applications and functions.  And 2 GB of RAM is enough for this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte v5 3 pro" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1012675.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Not only random access memory provides normal and fast phone performance.  The processor plays an important role in this.  ZTE V5 Pro, whose characteristics for a budget smartphone remain quite high, is equipped with a powerful and high-speed Snapdragon 615 processor. It has eight active cores, which allow you to use the capabilities and functionality of the gadget to 100%.  Such characteristics are worth the money. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  This is just the scourge of modern devices!  Many manufacturing companies, having started their gadgets with various "tricks", save on the battery by installing weak and not very high-quality batteries.  But the ZTE V5 Pro, reviews of which will be a little later, does not belong to this category!  He has a sufficiently powerful 3000 mAh battery, which is enough for games, applications, calls, and SMS.  And what else does a modern person need to be mobile and always in touch? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone zte v5 pro" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1005974.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  What can not but rejoice the freshly baked owners of this smartphone?  Of course, the latest operating system is Android 5.1.  She has even more features that open to the user.  On some sites, you can download various versions of firmware.  However, the average Russian is not too necessary.  The only thing you should pay attention to when buying from Chinese sellers on the trading floors is the availability of third-party software on the smartphone.  Some of the programs may be infected with viruses, which in the future will cause a lot of problems.  As an option - immediately reset to factory settings, and then pump the gadget as you wish.  Another way to avoid problems using your smartphone is to purchase from trusted sellers in Russia.  For the implementation of the ZTE V5 Pro, whose review we are conducting, in the near future Megafon, Beeline, and MTS will take up. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  This is perhaps the most important part.  The ZTE V5 Pro screen size is 5.5 inches with IPS-matrix!  This is an infinitely beautiful and stylish phablet (a smartphone whose size is in the range from the average smart to a tablet computer).  The responsiveness and sensitivity of the sensor can compete with even the most non-budget gadgets.  The screen size allows you to use a smartphone as a phone or tablet.  For example, to watch movies or videos.  The display resolution is 1920 √ó 1080. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte v5 pro specifications" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1005975.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Communication standards </h2><p>  Since Russian operators are not standing still, developing the quality and signal of communication, it is important that the smartphone supports these communication formats.  Otherwise, what's the point of acquiring a device that makes it difficult or even impossible to talk or surf the Internet.  Moreover, the latter has become an integral part of the life of modern man.  ZTE V5 Pro, reviews of which will be presented in detail below, supports several formats: 2G, 3G, 4G.  Naturally, they can work fully only if this is supported by the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãa particular operator. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Since in addition to functionality, the appearance of a modern device is also important, it is worth considering it carefully.  This model has an aluminum case with plastic inserts, with a non-removable battery type.  On the side of the device is a dual slot for two SIM cards or a SIM card and an SD card, at the discretion of the owner.  This is already a standard layout, since the internal memory of the device is quite voluminous.  Extension is required only in individual cases.  In addition to the slot on the side of the other side, there is a volume rocker and a power button.  The charger connector is located on the bottom, which is very convenient if the smartphone is in a case.  Headphones or a wired headset are connected from above, the 3.5 mm output allows you to choose any convenient model.  Moreover, headphones are not included in the package.  The fingerprint sensor is located on the back cover under the camera‚Äôs eye.  Not the most convenient location, however, the phablet has its own advantage in size, so the finger usually hits exactly the sensor. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  It is quite standard for modern gadgets: the device itself, a charger and a USB cable.  Headset not provided.  But the instruction is present.  If you purchase the device from Chinese sellers, then it will be in Chinese, from Russian sellers - in Russian as well.  The box is made of high-quality dense cardboard, so you can safely order a smartphone in an online store, it should come intact.  Especially if the seller additionally isolates the device from the battle with something. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the device is quite new (autumn 2015), it already has its followers.  So, the ZTE V5 Pro model (N939ST), the reviews about which are very positive, really liked the Russians.  Many users rate the performance and functionality of a smartphone as five out of five possible.  Some are confused only by a fingerprint scanner, which, in their opinion, works in 80% of cases.  In the rest you have to enter a pattern to unlock the device.  The quality of communication is also rated at the highest level.  Most users like the camera.  The pictures are very saturated and beautiful, without too much noise and separately expressed pixels.  The size of the device also does not cause any discontent.  In the male hand the phablet lies especially conveniently, in the female at first it seems like a ‚Äúshovel", but over time both the owner and those around her get used to such an unusual large device. </p><h2>  Opinions of professionals </h2><p>  Some experts have already taken the time to evaluate the ZTE V5 Pro (N939ST).  Their reviews are also generally positive.  So, some professionals believe that phablets have a great future in general, and ZTE has every chance to become a leader in the production of such gadgets.  The quality of a particular model was evaluated according to several criteria: performance, camera, appearance, screen quality.  In all respects, the device is excellent.  At least in its price segment.  The <span>fingerprint scanner</span> did not raise any questions <span>,</span> since its performance depends on many factors.  So, at low body temperature (for example, in cold weather), the sensor may simply not recognize the fingerprint.  And this is normal.  Brand original iPhones have the same algorithm. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  At the start of Chinese sales, the phablet costs about $ 170.  Today in Russian stores it is offered at a cost of 10 thousand rubles to 13.5.  This is a very real price for such a fashionable and convenient gadget.  Shipping costs are not included in this review.  Accessories prices vary by manufacturer. </p><h2>  Brief summary </h2><p>  For all categories, it is recommended to pay attention to the ZTE V5 Pro phablet, which has very good functionality and high performance.  Some owners have already managed to drop the smartphone a couple of times on the floor, after which its quality remains the same.  That is, performance has not been affected, and this is the most important thing.  By the way, it‚Äôs not so difficult to pick up accessories for a smartphone, as it is for this model, as well as universal ones.  Many manufacturers keep up with the times, creating covers and covers for such non-standard sizes.  The smartphone itself comes in two colors: golden and silver.  Bright or monochrome shades are not provided, but you can always pick up a beautiful back cover that will be to your liking. </p>
