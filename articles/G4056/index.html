It is located in the picturesque and colorful river valley, which has the same name.  This area is surrounded on all sides by mighty forests.  The Caucasus Mountains originate here.  Near the village itself, they are still quite small and rise above the valley by only four hundred meters.  You can get to Sukko from the famous resort of Anapa in just 15-20 minutes.  This path is 14 kilometers, which must be overcome by driving along a mountain winding road. </p><h2>  Great place to stay </h2><p>  Despite the fact that <span>the Sukko Valley</span> is located near Anapa, it differs from the famous resort with a more humid and less windy climate, as well as a cooler summer.  The area is famous for its healing pine trees and juniper thickets, which saturate the air not only with divine aromas, but also with useful active substances.  However, not only this attracts a huge number of tourists here.  The atmosphere of Sukko is also useful for the merger of sea and mountain air masses. </p>

    <p>  This is an amazing resort, offering its guests the most diverse vacation.  Travelers can stroll along the quiet palm alleys, visit a fun and noisy cafe or sunbathe on one of the pebble beaches of the valley.  All this, of course, will bring true pleasure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 2016, a Ferris wheel was erected in the center of the village.  This attraction immediately attracted the attention of vacationers.  Those who come to Sukko like taking a photo of the village and the beach (2016).  Guest reviews of the resort suggest that, rising up, they were able to view most of the coast. </p><p>  For the accommodation of vacationers, the village offers many hotels.  There are also guest houses in Sukko.  They are usually located in the private sector, from which to the sea only ten minutes on foot. </p><h2>  Coastal Feature </h2><p>  Throughout the <span>Anapa region</span> you cannot find pebble beaches, except in the Sukko Valley.  Of course, lying on a warm sand is always more comfortable.  However, pebble beaches have their advantages.  The first of them is clean and clear water, which pleases vacationers with its blue even in the midst of the summer season.  And this is noted by many tourists who visited the beach in Sukko.  Photos, reviews of vacationers (made under the pictures against the background of blue sea waves) confirm this positive side of the pebbles. </p>

    <p>  In addition, beaches strewn with small pebbles polished by a wave are often called natural SPA salons.  Here, vacationers warm their body on pebbles, enjoying the sound of the surf.  Women who visited Sukko beach, reviews about such procedures leave, as a rule, positive.  However, they advise taking a towel with them so that the rest is more comfortable and the pebbles do not stain the swimsuit.  Men prefer to sit directly on the stones, which allows them to warm up the muscles as much as possible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Not only adults, but also children are happy to visit the beach in Sukko.  Reviews of parents note that their children remain clean all day, even building castles on the coast from pebbles or laying out mosaics from it. </p><p>  Sukko beaches are very healthy.  When a person walks on them, he simultaneously gives himself a foot massage.  This healing procedure allows you to cure many diseases, even such complex ones as bronchial asthma and epilepsy, headaches and flat feet.  Well, one who simply lies on a pebble warmed by the sun receives a positive massage effect on the blood and lymph vessels of the skin. </p><h2>  Sea in Succo </h2><p>  Anyone who has already gone on vacation to Anapa knows that in this resort it is impossible to find deep water near the coastal zone.  Here, the sea is shallow and also very warm.  Guests at the resort say that on a hot day in Anapa, you should not look for coolness in the water. </p><p>  Absolutely the opposite gets in Sukko vacation reviews.  The beaches in this area are more suitable for adults.  Just a few meters from the coastline - and the bottom is already impossible to feel.  This causes a less intense heating of the water.  In Sukko, the sea temperature is two degrees lower than in Anapa.  It is very nice on hot days. </p><h2>  If you choose a vacation spot </h2><p>  Those who have not yet decided where to go during their summer vacation should pay attention to the Sukko Valley.  This is practically the only place on the entire Black Sea coast of Russia where you can breathe healthy and clean air saturated with essential oils of pine, thuja, fir and juniper, as well as iodine ions.  The valley, which is formed by the slopes of the Semisama and Navagir ranges, covered with greenery of the forest, also impresses with its splendor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The landscape revealing to the view from the sea cannot but arouse admiration.  This is the area framed by steep cliffs, reaching 50 meters in some places.  Climbing one of them, many vacationers take pictures of Sukko, a photo of the village and the beach.  The reviews of those who visited these foothills indicate that the view that has opened to the eye literally amazes travelers with its beauty. </p><p>  Scientists have established that in ancient times a giant landslide occurred in the Sukko Valley.  As a result, a cape was formed, which you can admire from a height.  It is the only one on the entire Black Sea coast with such an origin.  Today, the Sukko Valley is a natural monument, where you can see relic plants that have come down to us from the preglacial period.  What else is remarkable for this area?  Only here nature lovers can stroll along the grove of <span>swamp cypresses</span> listed in the Red Book. </p><h2>  The location of the beaches </h2><p>  Holidays near Anapa are usually chosen by those travelers who are attracted to the clear sea and the opportunity to sunbathe under the warm rays of the summer sun.  What vacationers choose a beach in Sukko?  Guest reviews of the village suggest that there are completely different sections of the coastal zone.  Some places near the sea are constantly full of people.  There are many vacationers who sunbathe and swim.  In such areas, music rattles, entertainment shows are held.  But there are other sites that the beach can offer its guests in Sukko. </p>

    <p>  The central beach, owned by the local municipality, is the largest in the valley.  There is a superbly developed infrastructure, and cleanliness is maintained at the highest level.  One of the most characteristic advantages of the Central Beach lies in the juniper thickets surrounding it, which give vacationers a wonderful aroma.

    <p>  During the tourist season, cafes open on this territory and the rental of sun loungers starts.  There are trash bins and changing cabins. </p><p>  In the central part of the Varvarovskaya Slit beach, catamarans and jet skis are rented.  And anyone who wants to spend time away from the hustle and bustle can move to the right.  This part of the beach is strewn with boulders, but gives a calm atmosphere.  Tourists with tents like to stop at this site, paying a small fee for their parking. </p>
