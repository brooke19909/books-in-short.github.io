    <h2>  Everyone can take a selfie </h2><p>  Recently, the question of how to photograph yourself beautifully has become very relevant.  Not a single beautiful woman comes out without a mobile phone; the gadgets are taken with them on any vacation or to an event.  Mobile phones are equipped with cameras, and some models have two.  At the same time, the front camera is specially designed so that the girl can take a beautiful picture of herself.  How to do this will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Hand position </h2><p>  Hands are a part of the body that is undeservedly deprived of attention when creating a selfie.  However, the pictures can be given a certain mood if you experiment a little with the position of one hand on the body or face.  Also, do not forget that in the frame there should not be unfolded palms.  Hands should be removed only from the side.  Improper free hand positioning can degrade the photo.  After all, hands convey stiffness, tension.  If you want, you can pick up some object - for example, a toy or a flower. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Head turn </h2><p>  Those girls who are considering how beautiful it is to take pictures of themselves should remember: a skillfully created selfie should be indistinguishable from a photograph taken by a friend or girlfriend.  No one will guess that this is a self-portrait, and not the work of a professional photo artist.  First of all, you need to choose the right angle.  And one of the most profitable options is a head turned half a turn.  So you can visually reduce the face, emphasize sharp cheekbones.  If you try to act "like a passport", then the result is unlikely to please.  The camera can demonstrate even those disadvantages that will be invisible from other angles. </p><p>  Since it is beautiful to photograph the face itself - this is the easiest task for selfie lovers, here to get a good selfie it is enough to follow the simplest rules.  Sometimes you can turn your head even a few millimeters to the side.  This will be imperceptible, but significantly affect the perception of photography. </p><p>  Many girls are interested in how beautifully to photograph themselves at home.  In any situation, when creating a selfie, it is important to adhere to the main rule: the eyes should be expressed as clearly as possible, and other parts of the body should not be distorted.  To do this, you either need to turn your head sideways, or slightly raise your chin.  Sometimes when creating a selfie, the nose is too enlarged.  This can be avoided by holding the camera a little on top. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Photo standing </h2><p>  By following these simple rules, you can solve the problem of how to photograph yourself beautifully at home.  Selfie poses, as well as for ordinary photography, can be very different - standing, lying, sitting, with emphasis on any surface.  One of the most popular poses is standing.  The only feature of creating a selfie in the ‚Äústanding‚Äù position (as in most other poses) is that you need to stand in front of the mirror to execute them.  Those who would like to take a selfie in this position should remember: this should not be a stand-by position.  Try to keep all your muscles in a relaxed position, but keep your back straight.  If you do not want to appear older, you should avoid leaning forward towards the camera.  If you get too close to the lens, then flaws in the photo may become noticeable. </p><p>  One of the most popular standing poses is called The Triumph.  For its implementation, it is worth bending the arm above the head and bending one leg.  The chest should be as tight as possible and slightly inclined forward.  Another pose that is popular with all lovers of selfie, is called "Supermodel."  For its execution, you need to lean on a tree, a car or the wall of the house and cross your legs.  A free hand can lie on a wall or play with hair.  To make the photo in a standing position turned out beautiful, it is best to concentrate the entire weight of the body on one leg, while simulating a calm walk. </p>

    <h2>  How beautiful to photograph the legs?  Take a photo of the legs </h2><p>  The first thing to remember when creating such a photo is about beautiful shoes.  It should be as suitable as possible for skin color.  Visually lengthen legs with beige shoes.  Also, before taking a photo, you can use a bronzer - a tool that will give the legs a shine and a beautiful shade.  Another way to visually lengthen your legs is to stand on tiptoe. </p><p>  For many girls who like to take selfies, the question of how to photograph their legs beautifully while lying down is relevant.  To make the photo really aesthetic, you should use the previous tips - white skin is unlikely to be attractive on selfies.  If you don‚Äôt have a bronzer on hand, you can solve the problem by simply wearing beige tights.  You should not choose tights with a high content of lycra - because then your legs will shine unnaturally in the photo.  It is worth remembering that a photograph of the feet in shoes will always look much more aesthetically pleasing than without shoes or boots.  In addition to the bronzer, you can apply a little body oil or cream with pearly particles to the legs. </p>

    <h2>  Take a photo of yourself sideways </h2><p>  We examined how beautiful it is to photograph yourself from different angles.  There was one more pose - sideways.  Of course, for many it will not be the most convenient, but it is quite possible to make a beautiful photograph using a mirror.  On such a selfie, the figure always looks slimmer, fat folds, as a rule, are almost invisible, the girl seems taller. </p><p>  However, from this angle, special attention should be paid to clothing.  It should be sized.  After all, if the clothes are tight, it will be difficult to move.  If things are too big, baggy - this will add weight. </p><p>  To take a good selfie, you need to stand sideways to the mirror and try to bend your back in the shape of the English letter S. It is better to put your free hand on your hips or waist area.  In this position, body weight should be distributed only on one leg, and the second should be as relaxed as possible.  Also, if you have long beautiful hair, you can demonstrate it on a selfie.  To do this, throw the mop on its side and bow its head slightly. </p>

    <h2>  Selfie in a dress </h2><p>  Such photos always turn out to be very feminine and beautiful.  It does not matter how long or the dress is in color, the pictures will be filled with positive energy.  When creating such a selfie, it is worth remembering that clothing should be combined with the external environment.  For example, if you have an evening dress on, then taking pictures in the background of the kitchen will not be entirely appropriate.  You need to stand straight, put your free hand on the waist or take away the hem of the dress with it.  If using a selfie you need to demonstrate a figure, then you should prefer a tight-fitting dress and stand sideways to the mirror. </p>

    <h2>  What is better to avoid </h2><p>  Consider a few rules, without which it is impossible to photograph yourself beautifully.  As soon as some ladies forget about these elementary principles, their photos come out not as aesthetic as it could be. </p><ul><li>  Firstly, you should not build ‚Äúbow lips‚Äù - this looks unnatural and can be unpleasant for many visitors to the page on social networks. </li><li>  Also, girls should not take pictures from low points - it is better to keep the camera higher.  Low-angle shots are more suitable for guys. </li><li>  Also, do not retouch photos using blue, purple, red and other shades.  As a rule, this is done using special plugins.  But all these colors used to be used by professional photographers as parodies of classic works. </li><li>  Since it is almost impossible to take a picture of herself beautifully on a phone in a dark room, it‚Äôs worth choosing more illuminated places for a selfie.  Avoid taking selfies in any dark rooms or dark places on the street.  Whatever the quality of the cameras, in dark places they can ruin photos. </li></ul>
