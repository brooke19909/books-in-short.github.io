The reviews of everyone who visited there indicate unsurpassed natural beauties, such as <span>azure-colored</span> water <span>,</span> snow-white sand, sunsets and sunrises that cannot be described. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Kurlevskie quarry is not a natural lake, as some tourists believe.  They were formed as a result of the extraction of powdered lime located there, which is known as drywall.  The quarries left after excavation were filled with underground waters, and now they have become a great place for recreation and fishing.  By the way, it is these soil streams that are the source of the Oredezh River. </p>

And it is located in the Volosovsky district, about 80 km from St. Petersburg.  If you have never heard of a reservoir under the name of K√ºrlevsky quarry, this does not mean that you do not know anything about this place, perhaps you know it under a different name - Lake Donzo.  This <span>water body</span> belongs to the Russian part of the Narva river basin of the Baltic region.  The pond area is small and is only 0.7 km <sup>2</sup> .

After all, if you live in St. Petersburg, then you will have to travel long enough to get into the Kurlevsky quarry.  "How to get to this place?"  - One of the most common questions for those who have not yet been to this lake.  It is immediately worth noting that you can only get to it by road.  It is necessary to move from St. Petersburg along the highway, which goes in a south-westerly direction. </p>

Immediately after this city you can turn towards Elizavetino.  Having passed the specified settlement, you need to start searching for a place called Fifth Mountain.  But there is another way, through the Kiev highway.  On it, travelers reach the village of Vyra and turn towards Zamostya to the right.  Having passed it, you can start to look, where there will be a turn to the pond of the Kurlevsky quarry.  How to get there, every motorist will be able to figure out the road signs and prompts of local residents, but it is better, of course, to take a navigator on the road.  The turn to the pond is right behind the bridge, which is thrown across the Oredezh River.

But according to the reviews of travelers who have been there, the Kurlevsky Quarry Pond is an amazing natural reserve.  Absolutely clear water, a beach with white shores, an abundance of greenery on the shore, boulders of interesting shapes and various sizes attract the eyes of even experienced vacationers.

    <p>  The depth of the pond is small, it does not exceed 4 meters.  This is one of the main reasons why fishermen love the K√ºrlevsky quarry so much.  Their reviews suggest that it is precisely the shallow depth, combined with clear water and rich vegetation at the bottom, that makes catching the local inhabitants amazing. </p><h2>  Travelers opinion </h2><p>  Is it worth it to talk about all the advantages of this conservation area, if everyone who has visited here wants to return?  Ordinary vacationers do not get tired of admiring nature, not only from the shore, but also from the middle of the pond, swimming there on an air mattress.  At the same time, they have a magnificent view of the rich underwater world of this place. </p>

Fans of avifauna are delighted with the arriving birds, among which there are river ducks, gulls, field moons, quail, nuthatch, kingfishers and many others.  They can be found everywhere in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe source of the Oredezh River, where the Kurlevsky quarry is located.

They are mainly concentrated in places where underground keys come out. </p><h2>  Swimming in the lake </h2><p>  Some vacationers say that the water in the pond is cool enough, which is natural for these northern latitudes.  Others, on the contrary, argue that, due to its shallow depth, the pond warms up well on fine days.  In favor of the latter is also evidenced by the fact that this is the place chosen by many families with children who are actively splashing in the lake.  Also, many vacationers talk not only about the transparency of water, but also about a flat day, without silt deposits.  True, at times the level of the pond rises, and to enter the reservoir you need to go not along the pleasant sand, but along the clay.  Its particles rise and the water becomes cloudy in a matter of seconds.  But they settle just as quickly. </p><h2>  Pond fishing </h2>

Every fisherman can hope to catch perch, roach or pike.  True, fishing on the lake has its own characteristics.  Transparent water allows not only the fisherman to see the future catch, but also aquatic inhabitants can notice the hunter and leave.  That is why experienced people try to throw spinning rods away.  This allows you to go unnoticed on a pond with clear water called the K√ºrlevsky quarry.  Fishing, as a rule, is not bad here, but finding large individuals is quite difficult.

    <p>  All vacationers say that at any time of the year locals put nets on the pond.  But visitors go for live bait.  At the same time, they should be prepared that the weight of local representatives of the underwater world is on average within 300 grams.  Roach, according to experienced fishermen, pecks well at maggots.  The main thing is to choose the right place for fishing. </p><h2>  Underwater life </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the K√ºrlevsky quarry is interesting for those who engage in another type of fishing.  Underwater hunters ride it.  First of all, transparent water attracts them.  But experienced catchers do not like these places, but they are ideal for training beginners.  It is there that you can comprehend all the basics of such an activity.  By the way, experienced underwater hunters say that this is just the perfect place to figure out whether the newcomer will delay this business.  An interesting lake for divers.  Under water, a new world opens up with an abundance of interesting vegetation and many small fish. </p><h2>  Beach holiday </h2>

In order not to amuse yourself with vain expectations, it is important to understand that travelers are divided into two groups.  Some speak of littered shores and an inconvenient access to a pond.  Others are quite happy with the <span>environmental situation</span> on land.  If the former talk about crowds of vacationers who don‚Äôt even think about cleaning up their trash, the latter indicate that there are very few people on this remote lake.

    <p>  But travel on a <span>dirt road,</span> which is getting worse from year to year, no one likes.  Also, about 20 meters from the water, there is a moat that cannot be crossed by car.  Many precisely because of this cannot be located near their car.  True, if you drive along it a little, you can find a move.  The coastal zone of the pond is quite large, it allows large groups of campers to accommodate themselves together with tents. </p><h2>  Nature conservation facility </h2>

It is designed to take care of the Donzo tract with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã950 hectares in order to preserve the sources of underground artesian waters, Oredezh trout and meadows, which still have rare plant species.  By the way, 4 species of them are listed in the Red Book, compiled under the RSFSR, and another 38 are protected in the Leningrad Region.  One of the few places where you can still find them is the territory on which the Kurlevsky Quarry Pond is located <strong>.</strong>

But you can collect various mushrooms and berries, conduct excursions and various research works. </p>
