    <p>  <span>The natural zones of</span> Eurasia are characterized by clearly defined geographical delimitation.  On this continent, all existing zones are represented, ranging from equatorial forests to Arctic deserts.  Each of them has some features, including unique flora and fauna. </p><p>  <span>Natural areas of</span> Eurasia: a table of locations: </p><ol><li>  Equatorial forests - located on the Pacific islands. </li><li>  Monsoon forests - located in the eastern part of the mainland. </li><li>  Hardwood forests in the Mediterranean. </li><li>  Deserts and semi-deserts - Arabia. </li><li>  The shrouds are the coasts of Hindustan and Indochina. </li><li>  Altitudinal zonation is expressed in the Himalayas. </li><li>  <span>Coniferous forests</span> (taiga) - these natural zones of Eurasia stretch from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific Ocean. </li><li>  Arctic deserts - the coast of the Arctic Ocean. </li></ol><p>  Unfortunately, in the European part of the continent there were practically no primeval forests - for many years they underwent massive deforestation, which also affected the number of animal populations.  Some species are considered endangered and are under state protection.  Today in Europe there are artificial plantings. </p><p>  Eurasia: natural areas and their characteristics </p><p>  Arctic deserts stretch along the entire coast of the Arctic Ocean.  The living conditions here are quite severe.  Seals, polar bears and some species of birds live in these territories.  As for the flora, it is mainly represented by mosses, lichens and polar poppy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The taiga zone extends from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean.  Since the climatic conditions here vary from west to east, the diversity of species also changes.  For example, in the western part of Siberia, the following trees are considered the main trees: <span>cedar pine</span> and fir; Korean cedar is found on the Pacific coast.  In addition, taiga is inhabited by animals such as lynxes, moose, sable, martens, ermine and <span>brown bears.</span> </p><p>  As for mixed and broad-leaved forests, they are practically gone.  In Europe, secondary plantations appeared in their place, and arable lands were created in Asia.  However, this zone is characterized by oak maple, hornbeam, elm, and beech. </p><p>  Steppes are nothing more than huge spaces with grassy vegetation.  Unfortunately, they were preserved in their original form only on the territory of nature reserves - only there you can study natural landscapes.  The rest of the territory was allotted for agriculture.  Representatives of rodents live in this zone. </p><p>  Deserts and semi-deserts - these natural zones of Eurasia are located mainly in the central part of the mainland (for example, the Gobi Desert).  The conditions in these areas are far from optimal - low rainfall, cold winters and hot summers.  Interestingly, there are places with the so-called quicksand.  As for the vegetation, here it is represented by hodgepodge, wormwood, sedge sand and saxaul.  This area is inhabited by rodents, some ungulates and representatives of reptiles. </p><p>  The zone of hard-leaved forests and shrubs is located in the subtropical zone, or rather, in its western part.  In the preserved forests you can observe bamboo thickets, as well as magnolia, camphor and laurel.  But wild animals at one time were almost completely exterminated.  Hyenas, foxes and antelopes still live only in the highlands of Western Asia. </p><p>  Savannahs - these natural zones of Eurasia are represented mainly on the coasts of Indochina and Hindustan.  The fauna here is very rich - tigers, elephants, buffalos, rhinos, deer, antelopes, monkeys.  These territories are mainly planted with <span>herbaceous plants,</span> but there are also real groves from Indian <span>banana, palm trees,</span> acacias.  There are also valuable species, for example, lard and teak, from which expensive, rare varieties of wood are obtained. </p>
