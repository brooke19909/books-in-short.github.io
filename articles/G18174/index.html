Associated with this is their rather high cost.  In 2013, the company decided to divide its course into two lineups - One and Desire.  If the first of them includes more expensive and presentable modifications, then the second includes budget devices.  This article will focus on a simple smartphone HTC Desire 200. Reviews of most owners of the model in a few words characterize it as a small device with a proprietary shell from a renowned manufacturing company. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 200" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/550275.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  There are only two color options for the device - with white or with a black body.  The first option (HTC Desire 200 White) has an elegant glossy finish, so it is more popular among buyers.  As for the black version, its case is matte, so the device is considered more practical.  At the bottom of the front are three touch-sensitive main control keys.  It should be noted that this solution is uncharacteristic for the company, since most of its devices now use two keys.  Moreover, their backlighting is also absent here.  On the front of the device there is a metal insert above the screen, which is characteristic only for flagship modifications. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The HTC Desire 200 removable back cover has a slightly corrugated surface, so it does not collect traces and does not get dirty during use.  A hole for the camera is provided in its upper part, and a speaker to the left.  Below you can see the company logo.  At the very bottom is a strap mount, and at the very top is a not-so-comfortable flat power button and headphone jack. </p><p>  To install or replace a SIM card, you must remove the battery, which blocks access to the corresponding slot.  As for the connector for additional memory, it is located on the side. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 200 white" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/550279.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  The phone is small in size.  In particular, the dimensions of the device in height, width and thickness are 108x61x12 mm, respectively, and the weight is exactly 100 grams.  All ends are made even and flat, so that the user's fingers firmly abut against the side faces during a conversation.  Due to its compact size, you can easily control the device with even one hand.  Thus, the HTC Desire 200 can be called ergonomic, slightly plump and quite comfortable for use in everyday life. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The device uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor MSM7227A, operating at a frequency of 1 GHz.  The model has 512 MB of RAM and 4 GB of stationary memory.  If necessary, the size of the second indicator can be increased by installing additional media with a capacity of up to 64 GB. </p><p>  The Adreno 200 graphics used in the model cannot be attributed to the strengths of HTC Desire 200. User reviews of the device call it very weak.  Moreover, many of them complain about the already outdated version of the software, the update of which, most likely, will not happen. </p><p>  As for performance, the model quickly responds to all requests, however, when working with large applications, jerks are typical for it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 200 phone" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/550281.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  Due to the compact size of the device, the display is not very large either.  In particular, <span>the screen size</span> is 3.5 inches, and its resolution is 320x480 pixels.  When using a smartphone in bright sun, the picture on the monitor fades.  On the other hand, as for the device from the budget segment, the viewing angles here are pretty good.  The HTC Desire 200 display is characterized by very mediocre color quality.  More specifically, the shades are not transmitted very correctly, while inexpensive devices from other manufacturers in this regard have better characteristics.  Moreover, due to the low pixel density, the displayed image is grainy.  The screen is covered with a protective glass, which can be quite easily cleaned from fingerprints. </p><h2>  Calls and Messages </h2><p>  The general list shows absolutely all numbers from the SIM card, device memory, and social networks.  When recording a new contact, a large number of fields are opened before the user to fill out various information.  All existing subscribers can be divided into groups, and also assign pictures and melodies to each of them.  All types of calls fall into the call log in one list, which can be divided into categories to simplify navigation.  A convenient virtual keyboard provides the ability to quickly search both by numbers and by letters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 200 reviews" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/550280.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The HTC Desire 200 allows you to send messages directly from your call log or phone book.  In addition, the user independently configures the fonts, and the device supports the restoration and archiving of data, sorting messages, as well as searching among them.  Despite the modest screen settings, the keyboard is very comfortable.  It is highly sensitive, so erroneous clicks are almost uncharacteristic for it. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The model is equipped with a 5 megapixel module.  The camera does not have a flash and auto focus, so there can be no talk of high quality images.  It is so low that we can safely say that there is no camera in the device at all.  Depending on the position in the hand, the HTC Desire 200 smartphone independently chooses the shooting orientation.  As for the video, it is performed with a resolution of 640x480 pixels, which is unlikely to surprise anyone in our time. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The battery used is a removable battery, the capacity of which is 1230 mAh.  Given the rather modest parameters of the device monitor, this indicator is quite enough.  More specifically, the device in phone mode can be used intensively throughout the day, while with continuous playback of videos it will last about five hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 200 price" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/550277.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  To summarize, one should focus on the fact that the model on the market now costs much more than many similar devices.  Speaking specifically about the cost of HTC Desire 200, the price of the device in our country now is about 5.5 thousand rubles.  For the money you can buy more powerful smartphones.  However, one should not forget that the brand, shell and design play an important role in choosing such devices. </p>
