But finally he got a worthy competitor - Samsung Galaxy S8.  And despite the fact that the iPhone 8 has already been released, the 7th version of the smartphone is still relevant.  So which is better: iPhone 7 or Samsung S8?  This question is often asked by buyers.  Consider both smartphones and try to answer this question below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 7 or samsung s8" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19509/2020377.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Unlike the iPhone 7, the Samsung S8 started selling six months later.  Therefore, the novelty from the Korean manufacturer should be more technological.  Is it really? </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Both smartphones are very beautiful and concise.  But when <span>comparing the Iphone</span> 7 and Samsung Galaxy S8, you can find serious differences.  Let's see which ones, because many choose their smartphone, relying only on its appearance. </p><p>  The lack of a front bezel and Infinity display underline the design of the Samsung smartphone.  Outwardly, the Samsung S8 attracts the most attention.  iPhone 7 in its appearance is very similar to the previous version of the smartphone from the same company, so it does not look so modern.  <span>Samsung Galaxy S8</span> has a screen with a resolution of 6.7 inches.  However, due to the lack of framework, it does not seem too bulky.  The back of the smartphone is made of glass and has a metal border.  This solution visually makes the device more luxurious.  Samsung began to release smartphones with a glass back surface 2 years ago.  However, thanks to a change in the color scheme, the new model does not look outdated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Who will win the fight "iPhone 7 vs Samsung S8"?  We continue to understand further.  Both devices are protected from moisture under the case, but there are nuances.  Samsung can be kept in water for up to 30 minutes, while the depth should be no more than 1.5 meters.  The iPhone can be under water without incident for no longer than 15 minutes, with a depth of not more than 1 meter.  As you can see, Samsung is more reliable in this regard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="comparing iphone 7 and samsung galaxy s8" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19509/2020379.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Headphones </h2><p>  What could be more important than headphones for music lovers ?!  And the quality of the headphones and sound is also a very important aspect when choosing a smartphone. </p><p>  Almost immediately after the release of the iPhone 7, many began to resent the lack of a headphone jack.  The company made this decision in order to make the smartphone thinner, and there was more space inside.  Thanks to this move, it was possible to place more useful components inside the device.  It also allowed to further protect the smartphone from moisture inside it.  However, because of this, the headphones on the iPhone 7 are now wireless, which is not very convenient.  At any time, they can fall out and get lost.  The sound of the headphones has not changed.  Their body remained the same. </p><p>  Not all users liked this solution, and they prefer to use wired headphones.  Especially for such owners of the smartphone, the company supplies with the device a special adapter that connects to the charging connector, and from the other end to the headphones.  In this way, you can listen to music using ordinary headphones, as well as connect the AUX-wire, which is also popular. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, in the future, many smartphones will be just that, but now this is superfluous, the audience was not ready for this.  Samsung did not dare to do this, and the Galaxy S8 has a headphone jack.  This was done not in vain, because most users use them. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The Infinity display and lack of frame in the S8 emphasize image quality, which is significantly better than the iPhone.  <span>Samsung Galaxy S8</span> has a display with curved edges and a resolution of 2960 x 1440. The display size is 5.8 inches.  It is convenient to use a smartphone by launching several applications on the screen at once, but at the same time, all this can be controlled with one hand, which is quite convenient.  The Samsung Galaxy S8 display is made using Super AMOLED technology and rated by the reputable company DisplayMate as the best display ever installed on smartphones.  The display can be configured according to standard parameters, but it also has Dolby Vision technology. </p>

    <p>  iPhone 7 is equipped with a Retina display made using IPS LCD technology.  The smartphone has a screen size of 4.7 inches and a resolution of 1334 x 750. It quite colorfully conveys the picture and has good viewing angles.  DisplayMate noted that the iPhone 7 display is one of the best among LCDs.  But despite this, the fact that the Samsung S8 is better remains. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  AMOLED displays used to be worse than LCDs.  However, Samsung did a great job and achieved a different result.  Now Apple is working on the development of an AMOLED display for the next version of its smartphone. </p><p>  The only advantage of the iPhone 7 display is 3D Touch technology.  Thanks to it, it becomes much more convenient for the user to use a smartphone.  It determines the level of pressure on the screen and, depending on this, reacts differently to pressing. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Samsung Galaxy S8 hides a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset under its body. The octa-core processor runs at 2.35 GHz.  The graphics processor here is Adreno 540. It runs on big.LITTLE technology, which made it possible to achieve high performance and long-term performance of the smartphone without recharging. </p><p>  The iPhone 7 has a quad-core Apple A10 Fusion chip.  Two of them operate at high frequency, and the rest - at low.  This was done so that the performance of the smartphone and its duration without recharging increase. </p><p>  The iPhone 7 undoubtedly wins in this matter. The Apple A10 chip is much more productive than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. It has practically no equal competitors.  However, Apple has always installed productive chips in their smartphones that do not consume much energy. </p><p>  Almost all modern smartphones reduce performance after a certain period of time.  On the iPhone 7, this is much slower than on the Samsung Galaxy S8. </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  A very important characteristic when choosing a smartphone is memory.  And here, too, you can find a significant difference between these smartphones.  After all, the RAM on the iPhone 7 is only 2 GB, while the Galaxy S8 it is 4 GB.  However, due to the smaller screen size and features of iOS, the iPhone in some cases works even ‚Äúfaster‚Äù than Samsung.  The thing is that Android consumes more resources. </p><p>  In multitasking mode, the S8 feels better and copes with it without any problems.  The iPhone 7 has some minor issues. </p><p>  iPhone 7 is available for purchase with versions 32, 64, 128 and 256 GB of memory.  Samsung Galaxy S8 is only with a version of 64 GB.  Such a decision on the part of the company is not entirely clear, because some users will have too much such space, while others will not have enough. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Continuing the comparison of the iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S8, we will discuss the rear camera.  Both the first and second devices have 12 megapixels.  However, this is their only similarity.  <span>The iPhone 7 camera has</span> been developed for a long time and is equipped with an optical stabilizer, and each pixel has a size of 1.22 microns.  Samsung has the same camera as on the previous model - S7.  It is made using Dual Pixel technology, and the pixel size is 1.4 microns. </p><p>  The camera shoots the <span>Samsung Galaxy S8</span> smartphone better than the iPhone 7, only in low light.  It is designed in such a way that when shooting a video it combines 3 pictures in a row pretty quickly, while eliminating noise and drawing all the elements in more detail. </p><p>  The cameras of both smartphones shoot video in 4K resolution.  At the moment, it is the highest.  It's hard enough to decide who will win the battle of the iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S8.  Their cameras transmit all the paints and small details when viewing photos taken on these devices. </p><p>  The front camera of the iPhone 7 has 7 megapixels.  It is created using Retina Flash technology.  Thanks to this, it shoots well in low light conditions.  Samsung S8 has an 8 megapixel camera with autofocus.  Thanks to this, the selfies on this unit turn out to be more detailed, but in poor lighting conditions it is better not to take pictures. </p>

    <h2>  Customization </h2><p>  Samsung Galaxy S8 has the function of changing the location of the buttons in the navigation bar.  Also here you can change the background color.  You can also customize Always On Display.  But even after such convenient innovations, some owners of this smartphone are outraged by the impossibility of reassigning the Bixby button for other processes.  It's strange to hear this, because on previous devices from Samsung, this has never happened.  Why then be indignant?  After all, the company could do without the introduction of such a function. </p><h2>  Sensors </h2><p>  Both smartphones have a fingerprint scanner, an accelerometer and other sensors.  However, the Samsung S8 also has a face recognition function, as well as an eye shell scanner.  The company began installing the scanner on previous devices and all this time was engaged in its improvement.  Face recognition is not yet fully developed, as some users were able to deceive this feature.  The Galaxy S8 also has a heartbeat sensor, but no application has yet been found for it.  These features are not in the iPhone 7. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The battery capacity of these devices is very different.  The Galaxy S8, it is 3000 mAh, and the iPhone 7 - 1960 mAh.  In this case, Samsung should have a longer battery life, but this is not the case.  The iPhone 7 has a smaller screen, which means that the smartphone consumes less power.  Also, the iOS platform is not energy intensive.  Therefore, it is difficult to say which device will last longer without recharging. </p><p>  Although in some cases the S8 discharges faster, it can be quickly charged.  The smartphone fully recharges the battery capacity in just 60 minutes.  It can be charged both from the wire and without it.  Moreover, the time of full charge does not differ from this factor.  The iPhone 7 cannot boast such a fast charge, since its factory wire is only 5V. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that both smartphones <strong> </strong>  - <strong> </strong>  Samsung Galaxy S8 and Iphone 7 - non-removable batteries.  Therefore, in the event of a breakdown, an independent replacement will not work.  To do this, you will have to contact the service center. </p>

    <h2>  Cost </h2><p>  So, one of the main issues of choice is the cost of smartphones.  Samsung Galaxy S8 is offered with only 64 GB of memory, so its cost is $ 724.  iPhone 7 comes with various memory options, which is why its price depends on the number of gigabytes.  The cheapest option is the iPhone 7 with 32 GB of memory.  Its cost is 649 dollars.  The version with 128 GB of memory will cost the buyer as much as $ 749.  The most expensive option is the version with 256 GB of memory, which costs $ 849. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  It is rather difficult to choose one of these two smartphones.  The iPhone 7 and Samsung S8 have both advantages and disadvantages.  Galaxy S8 looks very solid, it can increase the amount of memory, and it also has cameras with excellent shooting quality.  The iPhone 7 works more smoothly and consumes less power.  It is also protected from viruses and hacking.  Perhaps that is why many famous people choose products from Apple. </p><p>  The iPhone 7 Plus and Samsung S8 Plus also have some differences.  Iphone photos at night are clean, even moving objects come out crisp.  Samsung has problems with this, the pictures are blurry and blurry.  The Galaxy S8 Plus distorts the corners of the frames.  Also, in addition to the camera, there are differences in the size of the display, compared to the Samsung S8, the Iphone 7 has a smaller screen.  The differences in these smartphones do not end there.  There are differences in the RAM of smartphones: Samsung has it more by 1 GB.  The battery, compared to the Iphone 7, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is 600 mAh more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="than samsung galaxy s8 better than iphone 7" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19509/2020380.jpg"></div>
