A bouquet of gerberas, large flowers, looks very impressive, such a bouquet will impress no less if you make it from beads.  Flowers from beads (gerberas in particular) are not only a beautiful decoration of the room for themselves, but also a very successful gift. </p><p>  At first glance, it might seem that the production of this large flower is very complicated, but in fact weaving is not only easy, but also fast.  And most importantly - the process is very exciting. </p><p>  Taking the living flower as an example, we got an excellent master class on weaving gerbera from beads for beginners.  The article also presents a way to simplify the weaving task. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cambridgeflorist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to weave a gerbera from beads?" class="if uuid-2698454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2698454.jpg"></div><h2>  Gerbera Bead </h2><p>  Gerberas - bright large flowers, a bouquet of them looks gorgeous.  A variety of colors will allow you to create flowers of incredible shades.  Let's try to make a gerbera from beads delicate, peach.  To do this, you will need: </p><ul><li>  peach colored beads; </li><li>  light pink or white beads; </li><li>  frosted orange beads; </li><li>  black or brown beads; </li><li>  green beads; </li><li>  round grid of diameters of 3 cm; </li><li>  green floral thread; </li><li>  a thick rod of wire 25-30 cm; </li><li>  wire; </li><li>  fishing line; </li><li>  needle for weaving from beads. </li></ul><p>  Be patient, a simple workshop takes time and perseverance, but rest assured, you will get something amazing. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gerbera Bead" class="if uuid-2698448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2698448.jpg"></div><h2>  Core </h2><p>  Bead gerbera weaving begins at the core.  A stable basis for this will serve as a round grid. </p><p>  Find the center on the grid, arm yourself with a needle and dark beads and embroider a small circle 1 cm in diameter.  Sew each hole with a needle and fishing line, attaching one bead. </p><p>  When the circle is ready, pass the needle through one bead from the edge of the circle, bringing the needle to the front side.  Pass one bead, pass the needle through the adjacent sewn bead, located in the extreme row. </p><p>  Thus, in a circle, sew the entire extreme row, you will get a second tier. </p><p>  Further, around the middle, in one row, three brown and one orange bead should be sewn. </p><p>  The next row extends to the previous one, so you need to pass the needle through two brown beads and bring it up, pick up two orange beads and 7 peach, the main one.  Bring the needle to the wrong side through the hole in the circle in which weaving begins.  So in a circle the whole row is stitched. </p><p>  The next row is similar to the previous one, only the needle is removed through a nearby empty hole, 5 beads of orange and peach are dialed.  To return the needle to the wrong side, the needle is passed in the opposite direction through the first three orange beads.  So complete the whole circle. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The middle of the gerbera is ready, it can be put aside and begin to weave the petals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pretty trinity" class="if uuid-2698450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2698450.jpg"></div><h2>  Upper petal </h2><p>  Petals will be woven with French weaving, on the axis.  To do this, step back 15 cm from the edge of the wire, fold it together and twist the loop, making a few turns.  On the axis, collect 10 peach-colored beads.  On the second end of the wire, type 2 more beads and attach to the axis, twisting the end with it once.  Make another row with the same number of beads on the second side.  In the next row, add a few more beads so that they completely envelop the previous one.  Once twisting the wire around the axis, fasten the row and do the same on the opposite side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Petal weaving pattern" class="if uuid-2701041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2701041.jpg"></div><p>  Fix wire segments, twist several times and set aside.  This is the top petal, such for one gerbera needs 24 pieces.  These petals will surround the core of the flower.  Put them aside for now and deal with larger ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Bright flowers" class="if uuid-2698452" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2698452.jpg"></div><h2>  Lower petals </h2><p>  To weave a large petal, we also need an axis, but twice as much.  Form an axis and collect 20 peach-colored beads on it.  These leaves can be made of the same color, but in order to give the gerbera a more realistic look, we will use several - gently pink or white will suit the peach. </p><p>  Using the principle of weaving small petals, that is, adding a few beads, make an arc on each side of the peach color.  For the next row, type 2/3 of the primary color and 1/3 of the white.  Bend the petal and do the same on the other side.  Thus, we get a smooth, soft transition of colors. </p><p>  On the next arc around the petal, only light beads are typed. </p><p>  Lock the wire and weave another 24 petals.  These petals follow a number of small ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gerbera weaving" class="if uuid-2698446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2698446.jpg"></div><h2>  Foliage </h2><p>  We will decorate our gerbera beads with sepals and leaves. </p><p>  We weave a simple sepal of loops.  To do this, mark a long piece of wire, draw 5 cm of beads on it and twist the loop, making a couple of turns.  Thus, on one wire, make 11 loops. </p><p>  Adhering to the French weaving along the axis, we make several leaves.  To do this, take a length of wire 120 cm long. Twist the ends of the wire, forming a loop.  On the basis of dial 8.5 cm of beads, in the next rows add a few more beads. </p><p>  The video shows a master class on how to make a leaf with notches (like a gerbera). </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="TXY8KwiPiIc" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=260&amp;v=TXY8KwiPiIc" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/6/9/8/4/6984.jpg"></div><h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  We reached the finish line, it remains only to collect all the details in one flower.  To do this, take a mesh with a woven core and upper small petals.  Twist the two petals together, push them into the free hole as close to the center as possible.  Make these 12 inserts in a circle, evenly distributing them. </p><p>  Do the second row of small petals in the same way.  Spread the petals so that they lie all around.  Some of them can be made slightly concave. </p><p>  Next is a series of large petals.  These petals are connected in the same way as small ones.  Do not forget to spread the petals. </p><p>  Wrap the flower around with sepals, twist the wire together, insert thick wire in the thick of the remains of the wire so that the flower is stable.  Wrap it with the rest of the wire. </p><p>  Next, arm yourself with a tape and an even layer, masking the irregularities of the wire, wrap the stalk.  After making a few centimeters, attach green leaves to the weave, carefully twisting the excess wire to the stem. </p><p>  Fasten the floral ribbon and place the flowers in a vase. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bouquet of gerberas from beads" class="if uuid-2698444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2698444.jpg"></div><p>  So, without much difficulty, you can create an incredible bouquet of gerberas from beads.  Weave for yourself a bright, beautiful bouquet, using several flowers in the weaving of one flower or diversify the bouquet with several different ones.  We hope you enjoyed our bead gerbera workshop.  Imagine and create, decorate your home with your own hands. </p>
