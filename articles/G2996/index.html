It is in this country in recent years that the greatest number of tragedies have occurred that have destabilized the situation in the state.  And perhaps the most terrible among them was the terrorist attack in Beslan.

    <p>  2004, the first of September ... The militants suddenly burst into the territory of school No. 1, where a solemn meeting of first-graders took place and a ruler dedicated to the first school day.  Those who managed to run away, but the rest, mainly primary school students, their teachers and parents, were driven into the gym by the bandits.  As a result of the shootout that ensued with school guards, three workers were shot dead.  These were the very first victims that the terrorist attack in Beslan took. </p>

Two hours later, the terrorists released a woman from the school building with a note demanding that the heads of North Ossetia and Ingushetia be called for negotiations.

Dzasokhov, Zyazikov and <span>Dr. Roshal</span> came to negotiations with the bandits <span>,</span> whose presence was also a condition of Chechen fighters. </p><p>  The second of September came, but the terrorist attack in Beslan did not receive its permission.  The situation was heating up every minute.  The bandits made their demands: to release all of their criminal accomplices who participated in the attack on Nazran two months before the attack was planned in the school of Beslan. </p><p>  In order to prove the seriousness of their intentions, the militants handed over a cassette with a video recording of what was happening in the gym.  The picture was depressing: in the forty-degree heat, the children were inside the building without water and food, many of them were suffocating.  The terrorists demanded medicines, food and clothing, refusing to replace children with adults. </p><p>  The terrorist attack in Beslan, according to the President of Russia, had only one priority task - to free the hostages at all costs. </p><p>  The third of September has arrived.  At one o'clock in the afternoon, several explosions were heard in the school area, and shooting started.  Suddenly, the hostages began to run out of the building.  Under crossfire, soldiers carried hostages out of school.  Some were helped to escape, but many of the children who had grown weak during these painful three days were carried by the military in their arms. </p><p>  After the release of most of the hostages, a shootout of special forces with bandits began.  In parallel, evacuation of those who remained in the building took place.  Around the school were deployed mobile infirmaries, which constantly brought hungry and exhausted children.  Many of them wore no clothes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The attack in Beslan" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/291183.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The shooting in the building did not stop even for a minute, while shots thundered. </p><p>  Several militants managed to escape and take refuge in a neighboring house, which was immediately cordoned off. </p><p>  Only at eight in the evening did the fighters of Alpha and Pennant release the last hostages.  Emergency vehicles drove away from the school every minute, for which "military" corridors were formed by the military and the police. </p><p>  The terrorist attack in Beslan took the lives of 186 children, ten commandos, seventeen school workers and one hundred and twenty-one adults, including employees of the Ministry of Emergencies.  In total, during the shootout, twenty-eight militants were killed, one managed to be taken alive.  He was sentenced to life imprisonment. </p><p>  Shamil Basayev, one of the most brutal Chechen fighters, who subsequently managed to destroy, took all responsibility for the terrorist attack in Beslan. </p>
