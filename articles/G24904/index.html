    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  In addition to its advantages, the Volkhov Hotel (Veliky Novgorod) also has drawbacks.  Reviews reflect the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  the quality of food in the restaurant does not correspond to high prices; </li><li>  no desserts served for breakfast; </li><li>  prices for excursions at the hotel are much higher than at any agency; </li><li>  paid parking; </li><li>  standard rooms have very old and shabby furniture; </li><li>  very unreliable front door, and therefore scared to leave valuables in the apartment; </li><li>  in the bathroom the lock quite often sticks, and therefore you need to go swimming with the phone in order to be able to call the staff for help; </li><li>  clogged sewer pipes, due to which water flows very slowly in the sink; </li><li>  the numbers are cramped; </li><li>  in many apartments there is no closet, but there is only a hanger; </li><li>  bad coffee for breakfast; </li><li>  There are no shelves for your cosmetics in the shower. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The main advantage of the Volkhov Hotel is its convenient location in the central historical part of the city.  This opens up many opportunities for both tourists and business people.  The first will be pleased that many attractions are within walking distance.  The latter will appreciate the huge number of offices and business centers.  There is also a pretty good traffic intersection.  Nevertheless, you will have to overpay for such a convenient location (on the outskirts of the city, similar apartments will cost several times cheaper). </p><p>  Speaking of rooms, it is worth noting that they are a bit cramped (with the exception of single rooms).  Even in large apartments, there is very little living space due to a pile of furniture.  By the way, speaking about the latter, it is worth noting that in standard rooms it is not in the best condition.  In general, the accommodation conditions here are quite comfortable.  It is especially worth noting the perfect cleanliness of the rooms, which is ensured by a thorough, conscientious daily cleaning. </p><p>  Buffet breakfast is included.  The dishes are quite satisfying and varied, but sweet tooth will be disappointed.  There are also quite advantageous offers regarding integrated nutrition.  But if you want to place an order on the menu, you will be very disappointed with the discrepancy in price and quality.  Therefore, for a romantic dinner, it is better to find another place. </p>
