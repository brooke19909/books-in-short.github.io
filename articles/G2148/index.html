After all, it is on it that the most beautiful and most comfortable resort areas and beaches are located, and also there is a huge number of most valuable historical, architectural, and, of course, natural attractions, including legendary ones.  This heavenly place is suitable for spending holidays, regardless of what type you prefer: educational, sightseeing, beach, extreme, etc.  Despite the fact that Crete is located quite far from mainland Greece in the Mediterranean, here you will find real Greece, with all its inherent features, bright colors and real Greek hospitality.  However, the Greek gods made the island the strongest PR since prehistoric times.  It was here that they preferred to live and decide human destinies.  And no matter which of the many resort villages of Crete you go to Heraklion, Hersonissos or <span>Bali, where</span> Nostos Aparts 3 * is located, everywhere you will be incredibly interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nostos aparts 3" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/772787.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of a holiday in Crete </h2><p>  What is the special charm of this Mediterranean resort?  Do not forget, this is a very sunny island, and tourists going here on vacation can be calm that heavy rains, hurricanes and storms will not spoil the days of their stay on the island.  Of course, no one is safe from the fact that the sea suddenly wants to rage, but such phenomena are extremely rare here.  In a word, Crete is the ideal climatic conditions for a <span>beach holiday,</span> as well as a great and interesting place for lovers of history, legends and all kinds of adventures.  Going to the island, you will feel like a hero of one of the adventure films. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nostos aparts 3 bali" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/772783.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bali </h2><p>  "What does Bali have to do with it?"  - surely you will be surprised.  However, here we will focus not on an island in the Malaysian archipelago, but on the resort village of the same name on the island of Crete.  It is here that Nostos Aparts 3 * Bali is located, where we advise travelers who prefer a quiet secluded vacation directly on the seashore.  There were times when it was an ordinary fishing village, however, over the past decades, comfortable hotels with well-groomed territories, gardens and pools, shops, taverns and restaurants, and even night clubs have been built here.  However, the most attractive in the village is its amazing microclimate, as well as incredibly fragrant air, thoroughly saturated with the smell of apricot trees and tropical flowers, mixed with unchanged needles.  The village is located in a hilly area, on the slopes of the mountains, so wherever the hotel is built, it offers beautiful views of the aquamarine expanse of the sea.  The same can be said about the hotel Nostos Aparts 3 * (Bali).  The most important sights of Bali are the monastery of St. John the Baptist, as well as the Melidoni cave, where in 1823 the inhabitants and defenders of the island took refuge from the invasion of Turkish conquerors.  The shores of the resort will also appeal to lovers of marine activities such as diving and snorkeling.  The underwater kingdom near the island is particularly beautiful, sometimes you can see fragments of <span>sunken ships</span> , etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nostos aparts 3 reviews" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/772791.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Nostos Aparts 3 * (Greece / Crete / Bali) </h2><p>  This small hotel, consisting of two buildings - the old and the new - is located right on the shore of a beautiful bay, on the so-called first beach line.  On the other hand, it is located on the outskirts of Bali, which is very convenient for various independent walks around the island immediately upon arrival at the hotel.  By the way, in order to get here, you first need to fly to the capital's airport of the island, and from there get to Nostos Aparts 3 * either by bus or taxi, or pre-order a transfer or rent a car for 30 euros per day.  Of course, the most convenient option is a car rental, because you will always have a car at hand, on which you can independently travel around the whole island and not be limited to Bali alone.  However, for this you will need to spend about 50 euros, as well as have an international <span>driving license</span> with you.  And if tourists just want to relax in a quiet environment, enjoy the beautiful scenery and swim in the gentle waters of the sea, the best option for them is the Nostos Aparts 3 * hotel.  Reviews of tourists clearly show how convenient the hotel is from this point of view.  For tourists who prefer to eat on their own, there are shops near the hotel.  That is, even for the products you do not need to go anywhere, everything is right at hand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nostos aparts 3 crete" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/772790.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  This is a very compact hotel, so you will not see the vast territory stretching over several hectares.  And on the islands it is not particularly practiced.  The territory is small but very pretty.  As already noted, the hotel consists of two buildings, one of them is closer to the beach, and the other is a little further, just a couple of steps.  On the territory there is a cafe-bar where you can have breakfast, and in the evenings, if you do not go anywhere, then you can order a drink with a snack.  There is a small promenade between the bar and the piece of beach, which serves as a beach for the hotel.  On the territory of Nostos Aparts 3 * there is also a very beautiful swimming pool with crystal clear water.  As a decor, pink and tropical bushes and trees, various evergreens and sculptures flaunt everywhere. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Since the Nostos Aparts 3 * hotel has one building older than the second, the situation in them is slightly different, in the new building - fresh, and in the old - a bit older.  However, in its location the old building is in the black.  It has both rooms and balconies more spacious.  About this in their reviews are shared by hotel guests.  Of course, tourists who lived on the second floor are much more satisfied than those who were placed on the first floor.  Indeed, from their balconies and verandas a landscape of unprecedented beauty opens up, even if you look not at the sea, but at the mountains.  By the way, the hotel has only 15 rooms, and all of them are almost the same in category. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nostos aparts 3 greece" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/772785.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <h2>  Room conditions </h2><p>  Each room can accommodate up to 4 people.  There are two beds and one sofa bed.  In addition, there is a table and chairs, bedside tables, a dressing table, <span>a wardrobe,</span> and even a safe, though you will have to pay for the key from it.  Of course, the rooms have a TV and air conditioning, and most importantly - wireless Internet.  The spacious balcony is also equipped with outdoor furniture.  Some rooms have a bathtub in the bathrooms, while others have a shower.  Also, the rooms have a kitchenette with a refrigerator, stove, coffee maker, a minimum set of dishes, etc., because they are positioned as apartments. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Immediately I must say that it is better for very picky people not to go to Nostos Aparts 3 *.  Crete has a huge number of hotels of the highest level with impeccable service, but the price in them is appropriate.  This hotel is perfect for undemanding people.  Here, rooms are not cleaned every day, linen can be changed once a week, the same applies to towels.  But if you ask, then more often.  Meals, except breakfast, are also not included in the price.  Everyone takes care of himself.  Therefore, the prices here are quite reasonable - from 2000 rubles per day for one person. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Entertainment at this hotel is also not too much, but enough to not be bored.  In addition, you can find many restaurants nearby, where live music is played in the evenings.  You can perfectly get acquainted with the culture of the country, walk along mountain trails, etc.  In the reviews about the hotel you can not find absolutely negative.  At least, praise is more common with the hotel administration, as well as about the grooming and living conditions.  In fact, tourists obviously know what awaits them at the hotel and purposefully choose it.  And everything else here in Crete is simply magnificent, and the reviews are positive. </p>
