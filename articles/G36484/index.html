    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  It was in the XVII century that the first ideas were put forward about such a (yet not existing then) scientific section, as neurophysiology.  Its development might not have happened if it had not been for the accumulation of information about the histological and anatomical <span>structure of the nervous system.</span>  Experiments to study a new medical section began in the 19th century - before that there were only theories.  The first of which was put forward by R. Descartes. </p><p>  True, initially the experiments were not very humane.  First of all, scientists (C. Bell and F. Mazhandi) managed to find out that after cutting the posterior spinal roots the sensitivity disappears.  And if the same thing is done with the front ones, the ability to move will disappear. </p><p>  But the most famous neurophysiological experiment (which, by the way, is known to each of us) was conducted by I.P. Pavlov.  It was he who discovered conditioned reflexes, which gave access to objective registration of those nervous processes that occur in the cerebral cortex.  All this is neurophysiology.  <span>The higher nervous activity,</span> which was now discussed, was determined in the course of experiments conducted in the framework of this medical section. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Modern research </h2><p>  Neurophysiology, in contrast to neuroscience, neurobiology and all other sciences with which it has a connection, has one difference.  And it consists in the following: this section is directly involved in the theoretical development of neurology as a whole. </p><p>  Nowadays, science, like medicine, has gone very far.  And at the present stage, all the functions of neurophysiology are built on the study and understanding of the integrative activity of our nervous system.  What happens with the help of implanted and surface electrodes, as well as thermal stimuli of the central nervous system. </p><p>  At the same time, the development of the study of cellular mechanisms continues - it also implies the use of modern microelectrode technology.  This is a rather complicated and painstaking process, because in order to start the research, it is necessary to ‚Äúimplant‚Äù the microelectrode inside the neuron.  Only in this way will they receive information regarding the development of the processes of inhibition and excitation. </p><h2>  Electron microscopy </h2><p>  It is also used by scientists in our time.  <span>Electron microscopy</span> makes it possible to study exactly how the information in our brain is encoded and transmitted.  The basics of neurophysiology have been studied, and thanks to modern technology, there are already whole centers in which scientists model individual neural networks and neurons.  Accordingly, today neurophysiology is also a science related to cybernetics, chemistry and bionics.  And the progress is obvious - nowadays, the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke and disorders of the motor apparatus are a reality. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Clinical experiments </h2><p>  The neurophysiology of the human brain (both the brain and the spinal cord) explores its specific functions using electrophysiological measurement methods.  The process is experimental - only due to external influences, it is possible to achieve the appearance of evoked potentials.  These are bioelectric signals. </p><p>  This method makes it possible to obtain information about the functional state of the brain and the activity of its deep parts, and they can even not be introduced into them.  Today, this method is widely used by clinical neurophysiology.  The goal is to find out information regarding the state of various sensory systems, such as touch, hearing, vision.  In this case, both peripheral nerves and central nerves are examined. </p><p>  The usefulness of this method is obvious.  Doctors receive objective information directly from the body.  There is no need to interview the patient.  Which is especially good in the case of young children or people with impaired consciousness, who, due to their age or condition, cannot express their feelings in words. </p>

    <h2>  Surgery </h2><p>  Attention should be noted and this topic.  There is such a thing as surgical neurophysiology.  This, in other words, is an ‚Äúapplied‚Äù sphere.  It is practiced by surgeons-neurophysiologists who directly during the operation observe how their patient‚Äôs nervous system functions.  This process, most often, is accompanied by an electrophysiological study of certain sections of the central nervous system of the operated.  This, by the way, is related to an extensive clinical discipline called neuromonitoring. </p><h2>  Evoked Potential Method </h2><p>  About it is worth telling in more detail.  Neurophysiology is a discipline that allows you to find out a lot of important information that can contribute to the treatment of the patient.  And the method of evoked potentials is applied in relation to visual, acoustic, auditory, somatosensory and transcranial functions. </p><p>  Its essence is as follows: the doctor isolates and averages the weakest potentials of bioelectric brain activity, which is a response to afferent stimuli.  The technique is reliable, because it involves the use of a single interpretation algorithm. </p><p>  Thanks to such studies, it is possible to identify the patient with neurological disorders of varying degrees, as well as disorders that affected the sensorimotor cortex, the retinal paths, hearing function, etc. Moreover, the ability to calculate the effect of anesthesia on the human body has become real.  Now, using this method, it turns out to evaluate someone, to predict its development and calculate the likely <span>death of the brain.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Specialization </h2><p>  Neurophysiologists are not only doctors, but also analysts.  Through various studies, a specialist can determine how badly the central nervous system is affected.  This provides a way to establish an accurate diagnosis and prescribe a competent, proper treatment. </p><p>  Take, for example, an ordinary headache - it can be a consequence of vascular spasms and increased intracranial pressure.  But often this is still a symptom of a developing tumor or even convulsive syndrome.  Fortunately, nowadays there are several methods by which doctors find out what exactly happens to the patient.  You can talk about them in the end. </p>

    <h2>  Types of Research </h2><p>  So, the first is EEG, or rheoencephalography, as doctors call it.  EEG is used to diagnose epilepsy, tumors, injuries, inflammatory and vascular diseases of the brain.  Indications for rheoencephalography are seizures, convulsions, talking and wandering during sleep, as well as recent poisoning.  EEG is the only study that can be done even if the patient is unconscious. </p><p>  REG (electroencephalography) helps to identify the causes of vascular pathologies of the brain.  Thanks to this study, it turns out to study cerebral blood flow.  The study is carried out by passing through the brain tissue a weak high-frequency current.  Recommended for high or low blood pressure and migraines.  The procedure is painless and safe. </p><p>  ENMG is the latest popular study.  This is electroneuromyography, due to which the lesions affecting the neuromotor peripheral apparatus are investigated.  Indications are myosthenia, myotonia, osteochondrosis, as well as degenerative, toxic and inflammatory diseases. </p>
