Meaning of the word ‚ÄúJanissary‚Äù</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the notes of historians describing the Ottoman Empire, ‚Äúarmy in the army‚Äù is often mentioned ‚Äî special troops reporting directly to the Sultan.  You can find out who the Janissaries are and how such a type of troops was formed from this article. </p><h2>  History tour </h2><p>  Janissaries have been known since the mid-14th century, when units of the Turkish elite infantry were organized by the power of Sultan Murad I.  The meaning of the word "Janissaries" is "new army" (translated from Turkish).  At first, their ranks were formed from captured Christian teenagers and youths.  Despite the strict and sometimes fanatical Turkish upbringing, Christian names were left to future soldiers.  Yanicharov was raised separately from other children, instilling fighting skills and fanatical loyalty to the Sultan.  In the 16th century, young men of Turkish origin could also become Janissaries.  From the applicants were selected the most powerful, hardy and dexterous adolescents from 8 to 12 years old. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="who are the janissaries" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/717728.jpg" width="452"></div>  The elect lived in the barracks, their training took place in particularly harsh conditions.  The soldiers were divided into companies, ate from a common cauldron and were called friends of the dervishes.  They were forbidden to marry, their family was their own company (orth), the symbol of which was considered a cauldron.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The well-known historian of the 19th century T.N.  Granovsky.  In his works it is mentioned that the Turkish sultan possessed the most effective infantry in the world, but its composition was rather strange: ‚ÄúThe Janissaries won all the great battles under Varna, during Kosovo ...‚Äù It was thanks to their courage and valor that Constantinople was taken.  Thus, the Turkish ruler conquered new territories and strengthened his power thanks to soldiers of Christian origin. </p><h2>  The best of the best </h2><p>  Janissaries were given a number of privileges.  Since the 16th century, they had the right to start a family, engage in various crafts and trade in non-war time.  Particularly distinguished warriors were awarded personally by the Sultan.  Among the gifts were jewelry, weapons and generous salaries.  For many years, the commanders of the Janissary companies held the highest military and civilian posts of the Turkish empire.  The Ojak Janissaries garrisons were located not only in Istanbul, but also in all major cities of the Turkish state.  By the middle of the 16th century, the Janissaries ceased to accept strangers into their ranks.  Their title is inherited.  And the Janissary Guard becomes a closed socio-political caste.  This internal, fairly independent force participated in political intrigues, erected and overthrew the Sultans and played a huge role in the country's domestic politics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="who are the Turkish janissaries" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/717732.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The shape of the Janissaries </h2><p>  About who these janissaries are and what their place among other types of Turkish troops is indicated by high hats decorated in front with a large copper plaque - keche.  Wooden sticks were sewn on the sides of such a hat, which gave it a stable position.  Behind this headdress was a long cloth clot hanging down to the soldier‚Äôs belt.  The long slash symbolized the sleeve of the chief dervish, under whose blessing were the Janissaries.  The color of the cap corresponded to the color of the caftan (jupan) worn by the warrior. </p><p>  The janissary's outerwear consisted of a long warm cloak called kereya.  At first, there was no established color of kerei, but by the beginning of the 18th century, the cloak of the Janissary was in most cases red.  A woolen caftan, usually white, with long, wide sleeves, was worn under kereya.  On the sides, the zupan had long cuts, which allowed the Janissary to move freely in battle.  And below, this garment was embroidered with cords that were the same color as kereya.  Kaftan was decorated with a saber sling and a wide leather belt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meaning of the word janissary" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/717734.jpg" width="396"></div>

    <p>  The bloomers were long and wide to the color of the kerei.  Usually they covered the upper part of the boot to half. </p><p>  Many elements of Turkish <span>military clothing were</span> adopted by the Cossacks.  Following the example of the Janissaries, bright jupans and harem pants appear in their costumes.  The similarity is manifested in the appearance.  Cossacks and Janissaries did not wear beards, but grew a long mustache.  It is difficult now to say how such a borrowing took place, but that it took place is beyond doubt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cossacks and Janissaries" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/717736.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Janissaries officers </h2><p>  The officers wore almost the same uniform as the rest of the Janissaries.  Instead of a hat with a slap, they wore a tall one, over which a turban was tied, usually <span>white.</span>  Sometimes a belt was wound around a hat; such an impromptu turban in front was usually decorated with some kind of jewelry - a ring or a brooch with a stone.  Instead of a leather <span>belt, officers</span> wore a velvet belt or a rich Persian scarf. </p><h2>  Weapon of the Janissaries </h2><p>  Initially, the orts of the Janissaries were archers, so the first weapon of the Turkish guard was a bow.  Unlike the weapons of ordinary soldiers, the Janissary‚Äôs bow was complex, with a huge firing range.  Gradually the bows changed their guns.  By the middle of the 15th century, a dagger, scimitar and ax were in the arsenal of the Janissary.  About what a Janissary saber and what a formidable weapon it was, can be judged by the surviving museum exhibits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is a Janissary saber" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/717033.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The scimitar was a long (up to 70 cm) knife, curved in the form of a bull horn.  Unlike a saber, the scimitar blade was not on the outside, but on the inside.  His hilt looked like a <span>tibia.</span>  The weapon was so formidable that only the Janissaries had the right to wear the scimitar.  Moreover, in the 17th century they were forbidden to go beyond the borders of their unit with such a knife.  The scimitar, like other weapons, was award or trophy.  If at the beginning of the war the ortha fighter did not have personal weapons, he was issued by the commanders. </p><h2>  Janissaries of the Slavs </h2><p>  About who the Turkish Janissaries are and the effectiveness of these military units was widely known.  It is not surprising that such units also tried to form other states.  However, in everything except the appearance and purpose, the Janissaries in the army of the Commonwealth significantly differed from their Turkish namesakes. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 18th century, before the end of the Northern War, as a result of negotiations between the opposition of the tycoons and King Augustus II, military reform was carried out.  Temporary troops gave way to units of the regular army, which included two Janissary companies (gonfalons) in the infantry.  They played the role of the guard - they were part of the hetman and were used by him for <span>individual assignments</span> and as <span>a personal</span> guard. </p><h2>  Military bands </h2><p>  The banners had their own orchestras and their own music.  Such orchestras were called Janissary chapels.  The main difference of such a chapel was the drum - twice as many as in the orchestras of other infantry regiments.  Six or more musicians, otherwise called surrogates, took part in the chapel.  Contemporaries describe Janissary music as ‚Äúbarbaric‚Äù and ‚Äúterrible‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Janissaries in the army of the Commonwealth" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/717737.jpg" width="351"></div>

    <h2>  The end of the Janissaries </h2><p>  Belarusian janissaries ceased to exist after the defeat of Stanislav Radziwill.  After a series of military setbacks, he retreated abroad.  And his personal army was disbanded, and the Janissary squad was also demobilized. </p><p>  A more tragic fate awaited their Turkish counterparts.  In the Ottoman Empire, everyone knew who the Janissaries were.  Unlike the Commonwealth, these soldiers did not belong to the personal guard of the Sultan, but existed as a closed military caste, until 1826.  Then the Turkish Sultan Mahmoud II issued an order to destroy the Janissaries.  Since in open battle the chances of defeating experienced warriors were negligible, the sultan went to the trick.  More than 30 thousand people were trapped at the Hippodrome and shot with gunshot cannon.  Thus ended the era of the Janissaries, and their martial art was a thing of the past. </p>
