Canvas for embroidery - how to choose?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every woman strives for new knowledge.  After mastering the new macrame technique, the lesson becomes uninteresting, you have to look for something new, unfamiliar, something that the soul and others would like.  One of the most popular types of needlework since ancient times was embroidery.  It was this occupation that brought women peace and tranquility, was associated with lightness and femininity.  In those days, one could make good money by selling paintings, pillowcases, towels with beautiful patterns made independently.  Even our grandmothers were engaged in cross-stitching, they were familiar with concepts such as a pattern or canvas for embroidery. </p>

    <h2>  Hobbies or work? </h2><p>  Previously, it was customary to start making needlework on what would come to hand and not be useful in the household.  Women decorated cross-stitch pillowcases, towels, made <span>beautiful paintings</span> and even carpets on the wall.  There were no limits for needlework, so almost every village girl had her own occupation.  There was practically no one to sell the work done, sometimes rich people came to the village from the city, then everyone who was engaged in embroidery carried out their work and tried to sell their luck.  Some girls were incredibly lucky, and for several visits of city ladies they could sell 2-3 paintings and pillowcases at an attractive price.  Basically, cross-stitching in the village was done exclusively as a hobby and to decorate their home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Changes Coming Over Time </h2><p>  Over the years, the traditions of needlework have undergone changes, as there are fewer and fewer people who respect the traditions and beauty of such crafts.  Although there are whole sets on sale, which include a needle, thread and canvas for embroidery, women are less and less paying attention to them, finding more interesting entertainments. </p>

    <p>  Despite the low popularity, you can find those who continue to honor traditions, doing embroidery for their pleasure, even professionally.  Mostly experienced needlewomen embroider not only for themselves and their homes, but also for those around them, selling paintings of their own production. </p><h2>  What is the meaning of the work? </h2><p>  A professional embroiderer not only creates pictures according to previously found patterns, but also learns to create patterns by herself using programs for PC.  With the help of such universal platforms, women can independently create their own scheme, according to which a canvas for embroidery will be selected.  Basically, custom-made embroideries of photographs are presented for holidays to relatives and friends.  A personal photograph, embroidered with a cross on the canvas and enclosed in a frame, not only looks extraordinary and beautiful, but also attracts the eye of guests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to create patterns and choose a canvas? </h2><p>  Using the elementary program Stitch Art Easy, you can create incredible pictures from ordinary photos that find a second life in cross-stitch.  The canvas for needlework is selected individually, that is, in cases of self-creation of a scheme, the craftswoman alone selects the meter, color and material parameters on which the embroidery will be located.  Bright, beautiful paintings are embroidered on the black canvas, where white, yellow, and lilac colors are often found.  More calm and delicate paintings are usually implemented on standard material. </p>

    <h2>  What gives the picture to beads </h2><p>  There are options when you need a canvas for embroidery with beads, which differs from the usual one with wider threads and minimal holes that allow you to fix the bead well.  This sewing method gives the image vividness, realism, since the material used shimmers and shines.  Beads are increasingly becoming popular, because with it, photos or seascapes look beautiful, and most importantly, realistically, while beautiful embroidery on the canvas is provided.  Patterns with beautiful animals or portraits can be found in needlework stores, and if you have the artist‚Äôs talent, you can draw it yourself. </p><h2>  Selection of threads and beads </h2><p>  When embroidering with a cross, the right colors for the colors are the key to the success of the picture.  Threads of French manufacture - ‚ÄúVHI‚Äù, with more than 400 shades, are leading in the modern market.  Threads from this company have high strength, are bright and saturated, retain color for a long time.  The disadvantages of the products of this company include only the high price, but during embroidery you can be sure that the right shade was chosen for the picture. </p>

    <p>  Before buying beads for needlework, a canvas for embroidery with beads must be previously purchased, according to which all other necessary materials are purchased.  According to the scheme, the necessary colors are selected, while remembering that they should not be matte, but shiny, otherwise the effect of ‚Äúcome to life‚Äù will not work, and the embroidery will look exactly the same as when playing with threads. </p><p>  Taking up your free time with cross-stitch is an indicator of good taste and patience, therefore, even in the modern world you can meet girls who claim that embroidery is their hobby and sedative. </p>
