There are three ancient memorabilia here: Cheops, Chefren and the Pyramid of Mikerin.  Also in the large funerary complex is the Sphinx and a museum with an ancient boat located inside.  Egyptian pyramids, regardless of size, have great historical and <span>cultural value.</span>  Interest in them does not fade today.

Its pyramid has modest parameters compared to all located on the Giza plateau.  It was laid in the southwestern part of the Giza complex, at some distance from the tombs of Cheops and Chefren.  Mykerin's tomb has the shape of a regular pyramid.  Testimonies of those times claim that this pyramid was the most beautiful on the plateau, despite its size.  Locals call it "Heru", which means "high" in Arabic.  The Menkaur Pyramid, as it is also called, is the last of the great pyramids.  Later, their height was standard and did not exceed 20 meters.  The tomb is surrounded by ruined household buildings, as well as three mini-pyramids.  Presumably the <span>wives of the pharaoh</span> were buried in small pyramids <span>.</span>  Now it‚Äôs difficult to understand how exactly the pyramid of Mikerin looked like, since in the XVI century it was significantly damaged as a result of the Mameluke attack on Egypt.  Another reason for the partial destruction of experts is the haste in the construction of the temple, as well as the use of raw brick in the construction.

It rises by 62 meters, and the length of one side is 109 meters.  Mykerin pyramid has the shape of a <span>regular pyramid.</span>  Initially, it was 66 meters high, but time and the desert did their job.  Moreover, due to the fact that the pyramid was partially protected by sand drift, the length of the sides and part of the outer lining at the base were preserved.  As conceived by the designer, the pyramid was to have a base size of 60x60 meters.  However, later it was decided to significantly increase the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe base.  During the construction, the experience of building the previous pyramids was used.  Unlike its counterparts, the Mykerin pyramid has in its foundation an artificial terrace of limestone blocks.  Typically, the tombs were erected on a rocky natural base. <br><br>  The outer lining significantly distinguished the Mycerin pyramid among others.  It was made of the following types of material:

Parameters: 6.5x2.35 meters, and a height of three and a half meters.  The ceiling of the main room is made in the form of a semi-arch and is composed of two adjacent blocks, it creates the illusion of a vault.  For facing the inner walls of the mausoleum, polished granite was used.  He also laid out the walls of the corridor and the original tomb.

    <p>  A staircase leads into the room with the afterlife.  The pyramid was first examined in 1837 by the expedition of the British Colonel Howard Wens.  An autopsy revealed a basalt sarcophagus with a wooden lid and bones.  The sarcophagus was sent to study in London.  However, the ship fell into a storm and sank.  The lid of the coffin, made in the form of a human body, archaeologists attributed to the period of early Christianity.  Also during excavations, an extensive collection of sculptures was discovered.  The most valuable exhibits were exhibited at the Cairo Central Museum and at the Boston Museum of Art. </p><p>  The whole block located inside the pyramid, which weighs about 200 tons, also speaks about the skill of the designers.  This is the heaviest monolithic block brought to the <span>valley of the Pharaohs.</span>  Also in the main part of the temple was found a large statue of the king. </p>
