At the moment, LED-devices cover almost all niches of household lighting, and in some areas they completely replaced traditional lamps.  Such high popularity of the products was promoted by operational characteristics in the form of durability, radiation brightness, low power consumption, etc. And only experts in the segment understand the structural advantages of LED clusters.  Using the LED module, it is possible to form lighting panels of any configuration.  At the same time, due to the controllers, the user can experiment with lighting modes. </p>

    <h2>  What is an LED module? </h2><p>  The module itself is a cluster that acts as a carrier base for the placement of diodes.  In minimal designs, it consists of two parts - the body block and compound filling.  The remaining elements make up the electrical part that provides control and power to the LED.  There are also LED strips, but they are rarely referred to modules.  They are also most often mounted in a block structure or tubular forms, since the operation of such tapes requires a protective sheath. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Clusters can be equipped with outdoor LED modules, which receive additional frames that protect from rain, mechanical damage and vandals.  Manufacturers use modules as an element of larger structures.  For example, in multimedia LED platforms, one cluster is considered as a pixel.  This despite the fact that in one modular unit may contain 5-10 diodes. </p><h2>  LED as the base of the module </h2>

    <p>  The diode is a solid state light source.  Roughly speaking, this is an analogue of traditional light bulbs, but having many times smaller sizes - no more than a centimeter in diameter.  With small amounts of energy consumption, this element emits enough light to serve rooms in private homes.  The number of diodes in a cluster depends on the requirements for light volumes.  The most common are the diodes of the Straw Hat system, which have ‚Äúlegs‚Äù in the structure and themselves represent a lens head made of plastic. </p><p>  Initially, an LED module with such elements was conceived as an indicator without the full lighting function.  But with the development of technology, this task has grown into a backlight function and has come to emitting lighting.  Of course, more powerful clusters based on SMD LEDs cope with such tasks.  The developers have increased not only the power of such LED devices, but also the durability - on average, the resource is 50 thousand hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Control system </h2><p>  Each module has its own control line, which determines the parameters of its operation.  In particular, thanks to the programming of the control controller, the user can configure the cluster to glow with certain colors with a particular rhythm and frequency. </p>

It is the presence of controllers in the working circuit that allows you to create large multimedia panels with a controlled image.  But it is important to keep in mind that diodes are sensitive to electrical influences.

    <p>  In addition to the controller, there are LED power modules that provide power to the device.  The reliability of the circuit, in which the supply circuits and the control controller interact, will depend on how much the circuit board meets the electrical requirements - the infrastructure on which the diode is located. </p><h2>  Varieties of clusters </h2><p>  First of all, you can separate the modules according to the number of LEDs used - typical devices have from 1 to 5 elements.  In specialized clusters, this number may increase.  You should also separate devices for equipping the unit.  The simplest models contain only diode elements - in this structure, a connection is made in a serial circuit, which provides for the supply according to a circuit that limits the current for control. </p>

In such clusters, the connection is realized either directly to the power sources or to the control switch.  And the most technologically advanced embodiment of the cluster involves the integration of the controller itself.  In this case, the control is carried out on the channels of the serial interface, in particular on three-wire buses.

    <h2>  Application Modules </h2><p>  The main field of application of clusters on LEDs is the advertising industry.  Such elements are advantageous to use in the same multimedia panels, scoreboards, signs and tickers.  Moreover, in most cases, these products are used precisely in street furnishings.  They are equipped with building facades, billboards and even car bodies.  Sizes and configurations are practically unlimited. </p><p>  As for domestic use, in this area LED backlight modules with a decorative function are more often used.  Due to their structural flexibility, they can be used both in landscape design and as a means of spotlighting individual interior objects. </p>

    <h2>  Pros and cons of LED modules </h2><p>  This type of lighting has many advantages, and as LED technologies develop, more and more new strengths are discovered.  The main advantages are high lighting characteristics, a long service life, low energy consumption, compact dimensions, etc. </p><p>  In some areas, the fact that the LED module does not emit thermal radiation is also important.  This feature, in particular, allows the use of LEDs in the design of Christmas trees without the risk of fire.  The disadvantages of such clusters are caused by their high cost and temperature susceptibility.  Weakly protected modules work unstably in frosty conditions. </p><h2>  Manufacturer's Reviews </h2><p>  Large manufacturers of the Philips and Osram level mainly focus on finished LED products: lamps, spotlights, flashlights, panels, etc. And cluster segments are mainly supplied for third-party production.  Therefore, you should focus on less well-known companies, including Jazzway and WRS.  As the owners of these products, these modules are distinguished by a high-strength design, long-term performance and the presence of a developed control system. </p><p>  The products manufactured by PromoLED are also positively characterized.  In its assortment you can find not only functional and reliable, but also LED modules original in design.  The price of these products averages 200-300 rubles.  Tapes with diodes cost even less - about 100 rubles.  for the 5-element design. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  At the moment, LED clusters are available in a huge assortment, and each lighting technician or radio amateur can find a suitable solution for himself.  In the choice, experts advise paying attention to several parameters.  In addition to lighting indicators, the requirements for which are always individual, it is important to consider the quality of the housing on which the LED module and the adjacent infrastructure are based.  Preferred is preferably reinforced structures, which also provide a convenient locking mechanism.  In the future, he will save from unnecessary manipulation during installation. </p><p>  Depending on the nature of use, the housing cover is also evaluated.  For general safety purposes, it is advisable to choose modules with <span>polyester resins that</span> prevent the ingress of moisture. </p>
