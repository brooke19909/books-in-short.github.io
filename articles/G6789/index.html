    <p>  Tax revenues are used to cover the costs of the road sector in the region where they were taken.  Based on this, the tax rate for each region is different.  These funds are used to finance federal projects.  That is, the construction of a private road is funded by the investors who are building it. </p><h2>  Payment required </h2><p>  Vehicle tax can be determined by knowing the engine power.  It is calculated by multiplying the number of horsepower by various factors. </p><p>  If after repair the engine power has undergone changes, you must write a statement to the traffic police indicating new data. </p><p>  Legal owners will have to calculate the tax on their own.

It also provides an opportunity to pay off debt.  After payment, information from the site disappears. </p><h2>  Find out the amount of debt by number </h2><p>  If you want to check the tax on the car when you personally contact the tax service, presenting only its number, you will still have to show an identification card. </p><p>  This information cannot be found through the Internet.  In addition, almost all sites will ask you for data: </p><ul><li>  SNILS; </li><li>  TIN; </li><li>  passports. </li></ul><p>  Consider how to find out the tax on a car by last name or TIN.  What is nice - this is done without visiting various authorities.  You just need to register on the website of the Federal Tax Service, get access to the "Personal Account".  Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt do without visiting the institution: </p><ul><li>  submit an application by sending it via the website or in person; </li><li>  get a card with a username and password (with a mandatory personal visit to the inspection);  it is possible to generate a personal digital signature issued to an individual by a certifying center: for this, do not forget to take any storage medium; </li><li>  go to "My Account", click on "Electronic Services";  further look for "Pay taxes";  here you can already see the entire amount of debt that you have for all objects of taxation. </li></ul><h2>  We use the portal of public services </h2><p>  Registration is required.  You must enter your personal data, address of residence, be sure to provide an email address. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The calculation for owners of other vehicles (except cars) is about the same: you need to know the power (except for aircraft that have jet engines), the tenure and the base rate (the latter can be found on the website of the Federal Tax Service or from other official sources). </p><p>  However, each type of product has its own characteristics.  So, the tax base are: </p><ul><li>  Gross tonnage.  Needed to calculate tax if you have a non-self-propelled water vehicle. </li><li>  The thrust of a jet engine, calculated in kilograms of force (if you are the owner of an aircraft with a similar engine). </li></ul><p>  Conclusion: each object for calculating the transport tax has its own base, which can be found in the Tax Code. </p><h2>  Is everyone required to pay tax </h2><p>  Whether there is a benefit for a car tax for pensioners, you can find out by contacting the local branch of the Road Safety Inspectorate or the tax office. </p><p>  In general, preferential categories of citizens vary by region.  Nevertheless, there are several groups that are definitely exempt from payment, no matter what: </p><ul><li>  citizens with 1st and 2nd disability groups; </li><li>  parents and guardians of persons with disabilities under 18 years of age; </li><li>  veterans of World War II; </li><li>  Heroes of the USSR and the Russian Federation. </li></ul>

    <p>  In addition, the horsepower tax will be zero if: </p><ul><li>  cars issued by social security authorities to a disabled person and engine power does not exceed 100 "horses"; </li><li>  the vehicle belongs to government departments (for example, the Ministry of Emergencies, fire departments, the Ministry of Defense, etc.). </li></ul><h2>  New car tax </h2><p>  Many are faced with the question: is the car less than 3 years old - is the tax paid or not?  The answer is unequivocal: yes.  Payment of transport tax arises from the citizen at the time of purchase of the car and disappears on the day when he sells it.  It does not matter how much the car was owned: a week, a year or eight years - you will have to pay for the entire time of use. </p><p>  Usually a similar question arises when selling a car.  If he was owned for less than three years - you must pay a sales tax, the value of which will be 13% of the cost of the car.  In addition, it is necessary to understand here whether you received profit from the sale or not.  If you sold for a lesser amount than you purchased, there is no need to pay. </p><p>  But, we repeat, this has nothing to do with the payment of transport tax.  You will have to calculate the tax on the car and pay for it in any case, even if you owned it for only one day. </p><h2>  When to pay </h2><p>  The tax code (Article 363) indicates that for the past year must be paid before the end of October of the following year.  In other words, for 2015, the tax on the car, which can be checked via the Internet, must be paid before October 2016.  A month before the end of the term, the <span>tax service is</span> required to send a notification with the exact amount indicated.  If this did not happen: </p><ul><li>  it is better to go to the tax yourself and take a receipt for payment; </li><li>  go to the site of public services and / or the same inspection, find the page with the necessary tax name and find out. </li></ul><p>  There, and pay it.  If this is not done, the amount of the penalty will be one fifth of the tax plus a certain percentage accrued daily. </p><h2>  Legislative changes </h2><p>  In 2016, new rules for calculating the amount payable are introduced.  Calculating the tax on the car will be more difficult: now it will also depend on the year of manufacture of the vehicle, environmental standard, engine size. </p>
