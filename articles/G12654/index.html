  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Elite holidays in the Seychelles</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Seychelles is</span> considered a holiday destination for wealthy travelers.  They attract with its abundant vegetation, mild climate, large beaches and <span>beautiful landscapes</span> that inspire artists, poets and musicians of all time to create works of art.  Interestingly, the capital of Seychelles, Victoria is not only the smallest city in Europe, but also the only city on the island.  However, it is very nice and cozy here.  On small streets there are small houses that remind you of past centuries.  The city is literally surrounded by greenery and flowers.  There are a large number of museums, art galleries, small souvenir shops. </p><p>  By and large, rest in the Seychelles is very calm and peaceful.  People do not come here in search of noisy parties and deliberate luxury of hotels.  Here you can find harmony with your inner world and experience the environment with all five senses.  The subequatorial <span>marine climate</span> forms 2 seasons: hot and cool.  Due to the fact that the island is located in the <span>Indian Ocean, the</span> heat is tolerated quite easily and does not cause any inconvenience, which makes relaxing in the Seychelles as comfortable as possible.  In addition, monsoon winds form intermediate seasons during which it can rain, but this gives relief to the heat.  The time here differs by an hour from the time zone of Russia in the winter and the same in the summer.  These factors help tourists undergo acclimatization with virtually no consequences.  This climate allows you to get last-minute tours <strong> </strong>  to the Seychelles all year round. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The islands became known in the 16th century after the expedition of Vasco da Gama, but until that time, Arab sailors knew about this place.  For a long time, the Seychelles were used by pirates as a base from where they launched their attacks on ships sailing in the Indian Ocean.  The island began to ennoble the slaves brought by the French in the late 18th century.  It was they who grew spices here: vanilla, cinnamon, <span>cayenne pepper.</span>  Only in 1976 did the Seychelles become independent and become a full-fledged state.  Today there is a multi-party system.  The government clearly understands that the islands live off tourists, therefore they are especially kind to nature and travelers.  To rest in the Seychelles means to plunge headlong into an exotic virgin nature, the equal of which on earth simply does not exist. </p><p>  Not a single vacation in the Seychelles can be imagined without lunch at local restaurants.  The islanders' cuisine borrowed recipes from Europeans.  Rice and vegetables are very popular.  The latter are usually stewed or baked.  Rice can be found in many types of side dish.  It is seasoned with all kinds of sauces of lemon, capsicum or vegetable oil.  Due to the fact that the Seychelles islands are located in the ocean, a large number of fish dishes are presented in the menu of local restaurants.  Seafood in coconut sauce is surprisingly delicious.  Meat is not so popular with islanders, but restaurants can offer very exotic recipes, for example, bat stew.  For dessert, French pancakes or fried, baked, pickled fruits are most often served.  Fermented coconut juice ‚ÄúKalu‚Äù or stronger ‚ÄúBaku‚Äù is very popular - fermented <span>sugarcane</span> juice <span>.</span>  Coffee is loved by the islanders, but they do not grow it, but bring it from Colombia, Ethiopia or Yemen. </p><p>  You can hardly find last-minute trips to Seychelles on free sale, since tourists rarely go there in groups to relax.  In order to spend a vacation here you need to spend a lot of money, but every cent paid for it is worth it.  A more beautiful and pristine place is very difficult to find. </p>
