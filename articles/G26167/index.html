The resort complex New La Perla Hotel 3 * offers its guests quite a budget holiday and relatively good living conditions. </p><h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the New La Perla Hotel 3 * hotel cannot boast of a large number of stars, it is in no way inferior to its titled competitors.  The rooms and the hotel have all the necessary conditions to make guests feel comfortable and relaxed. </p><p>  Tourists have access to swimming pools (adult and children's), which host many recreational activities and sports games.  And those who are inclined to spend their holidays calmly and leisurely are invited to simply soak up in sun loungers in the shade of umbrellas and palm trees.  In addition, here you can improve your health and tidy up your figure using the services of a wellness center. </p><p>  Of course, comparing meals in hotels with 4 and 5 stars with an assortment of dishes of the main restaurant of the New La Perla Hotel 3 * hotel, you can see that the choice is not so big.  But this is exactly the case when a small amount is more than offset by excellent quality.  As for <span>the √† la carte restaurants,</span> they can even compete with their titled neighbors. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Hotel New La Perla Hotel 3 * is compactly located in the village of Um El Side, which is located near Sharm El Sheikh.  The hotel is 22 km from the airport, but only 5 km from the amazing picturesque Naama Bay.  The hotel is located not very advantageous relative to the sea - 800 meters, which is typical for the second coastline.  But this inconvenience is completely compensated by the fact that a regular bus carries tourists to the beach, which runs between the hotel and the coast all day with an interval of several minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Apartments </h2><p>  Hotel New La Perla Hotel 3 * (Sharm El Sheikh) is a large three-story building, which compactly accommodates 106 guest rooms.  Each room is equipped with all necessary furniture, and the most pleasant moment is, of course, a small balcony with wicker chairs, from which you can admire the pool and garden surrounding it.  The minimum necessary to allow guests to feel comfortable is a TV with cable channels, an international telephone line, an alarm clock and a radio for those interested in local news. </p>
