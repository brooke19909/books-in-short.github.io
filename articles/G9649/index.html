  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review "Lenovo S720": specifications and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This article will present the characteristics of the Lenovo S720.  This phone model is considered female.  Why?  This is indicated by the delicate color of the case (pink and white).  The design is original (it is worth noting that the beautiful half of humanity really liked it).  But what about the characteristics of the gadget?  Let's get it right. </p><h2>  Smartphone Dimensions </h2><p>  This phone model has standard sizes.  Thickness, by modern standards, is large - 9.9 mm.  However, before evaluating this indicator, the release date (end of 2012) should be considered.  What can be said about the height and width of this smartphone?  These parameters turned out to be standard for a 4.5-inch gadget.  The height of the case was 133 mm and the width was 69 mm.  With such dimensions, the mass of the device is 146 g. </p><div class="photo" data-original="phonesdata.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lenovo s720 specifications" class="if uuid-2480874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2480874.jpg"></div><h2>  Camera and screen specifications </h2><p>  The display in the Lenovo S720 has pretty good specifications.  In addition to the optimally selected diagonal (4.5 ∫), the type of matrix can be attributed to the advantages.  For 2012, most smartphones were equipped with TFT-screens.  The IPS display is already implemented in the same model.  What are the benefits to the user?  Firstly, wide viewing angles, secondly, high-quality image, and thirdly, excellent color reproduction.  It is also worth paying attention to the screen resolution.  At the time of the release of <span>Lenovo S720, the</span> maximum that the user could count on was 800 √ó 480 px.  In the described model, this parameter was increased - 960 √ó 540 px. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What cameras are installed in the Lenovo S720?  Specifications (see the photo of the phone in the article) optics are quite consistent with the gadgets of the middle segment.  The main camera has a resolution of 8 megapixels.  An indisputable advantage is the availability of autofocus.  The quality of the pictures is average, there are no special comments from users.  Detailed and clear photos are obtained only in the daytime.  But when shooting at night, digital noise is clearly visible on the frame, the color rendition is frankly lame. </p><p>  The front camera is equipped with a 1.3 megapixel sensor.  The quality of shooting is poor, but this is to be expected.  The characteristics of this camera are only enough for video communication. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.doeschance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Smartphone Lenovo S720" class="if uuid-2480903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2480903.jpg"></div><h2>  Lenovo S720: performance features </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the hardware platform is a significant drawback of this smartphone.  Its performance is provided by the MTK6577 processor.  It operates through two computing modules.  Each type is Cortex-A9.  The maximum that they are capable of is overclocking to 1000 MHz.  The PowerVR SGX 531 video card is installed with the main processor. As you can see from these data, the technical specifications of the Lenovo S720 are not the highest.  In work, noticeable second delays.  However, given that the device has the fourth version of Android installed, most games compatible with the OS run without problems. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Speaking of performance, we must also pay attention to the amount of memory.  The operational in the smartphone is integrated 512 MB.  This, of course, is not enough for modern devices.  That's why there are delays in work.  The amount of internal memory will also not please users.  Storage capacity is only 4 GB.  The only consolation is the ability to install an external drive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lenovo s720 specifications reviews" class="if uuid-2481687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2481687.jpg"></div><h2>  Battery Life </h2><p>  At first glance, the Lenovo S720‚Äôs battery characteristics are hardly impressive.  It seems to be the easiest battery at 2000 milliamps per hour.  However, compared with other devices with similar equipment, this model is able to work much longer.  When testing in the AnTuTu Tester application, the Lenovo S720 produced a good result - 659 points.  By the way, let's say that some phones with 3000 mAh batteries gain about 700 points.  What is the secret of such battery life?  In principle, the answer lies on the surface.  It's all about a frankly weak hardware platform.  Low performance can hardly be called a gadget's merit, but in this criterion it was she who played an important role.  100% charge is enough for 1.5-2 days of work.  However, such terms can only be expected with an average load.  If you play on a smartphone, then you will have to charge it much more often. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.doeschance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lenovo s720 specifications" class="if uuid-2480867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2480867.jpg"></div><h2>  Lenovo S720: reviews </h2><p>  The characteristics of this phone, released by Lenovo, were to the liking of most customers.  The advantages include: </p><ul><li>  Interesting design. </li><li>  Great screen quality. </li><li>  Broad multimedia features. </li><li>  Loud and high-quality sound (Dolby Mobile function). </li><li>  Decent battery life. </li><li>  Reasonable price (about 9900 rubles). </li></ul><p>  Does this model have disadvantages?  Unfortunately yes.  Many users in their comments drew attention to the small amount of RAM and integrated memory.  Also, poor performance is also causing complaints.  Should these shortcomings be considered critical?  Everyone must decide for themselves.  By the way, they are inherent in most smartphones in this segment. </p>
