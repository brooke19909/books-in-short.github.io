    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Hersonissos Blue Ex Averinos 2 * operates on an all-inclusive basis.  This means that tourists are provided with breakfast, lunch and dinner, and they can use the services of two bars that are available at the hotel throughout the day.  Unfortunately, the hotel does not have its own kitchen, and, consequently, cooks, so the food is brought in and filled with special containers for the buffet.  This is the main reason tourists are dissatisfied with this hotel. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel has one restaurant, two bars, a small but clean pool, at the entrance to the territory there is a parking lot, a shop and a souvenir shop, Internet access is free in the lobby, there is also a tour desk and a currency exchange office.

For entertainment, there are billiards and darts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel hersonissos blue ex averinos 2" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1572949.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The sea is located 50-100 meters from the hotel.  The beach is simply magnificent, sandy.  It is municipal, so sun loungers and umbrellas need to be rented.  There is a promenade between the hotel and the beach area.  On the shore, tourists are offered a wide selection of water activities, from diving to skydiving. </p><h2>  Hersonissos Blue Ex Averinos 2 * Hersonissos: traveler reviews </h2><p>  In all the comments of tourists that they left on the tourist portals about this hotel, there is dissatisfaction with the stinginess of the owners.  For example, many complain that the furniture is dilapidated, and due to the lack of maids (there is one for all 40 rooms), cleaning is very rare, unscrupulous, garbage is also taken out infrequently, and bed linen does not change at all.  And this is not at all because it is a two-star hotel, since there are many hotels of this category in Crete, where everything is much better.  Tourists also complain about food.  Since there is no own kitchen, food is brought from outside, and it is not always fresh.  Of the advantages, tourists note the friendliness of the staff and a special attitude to children. </p>
