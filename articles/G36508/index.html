Now many manufacturers produce decent models, but not all of them fit into the budget devices.  Huawei, Xiaomi and Meizu have good phones.  However, they are not for domestic realities.  However, users even purchase smartphones from highly dubious companies, relying on low cost.  And then they suffer, because devices work very badly.  But there is one company that can boast of inexpensive, high-quality and pleasant devices for use in our latitudes.  The company is called ASUS.  She is well known in Russia and the CIS countries.  And its budget <span>ASUS ZenFone Go ZB452KG, reviews</span> of which we will analyze a little later, at one time broke all sales records.  Why is that?  Let's get it right.  Let's start with the story. </p><h2>  A little bit about the company </h2><p>  ASUS was founded in 1989 as a manufacturer of low-cost components for the world's best computer brands.  Over time, a small subsidiary gained independence and achieved impressive success in the market of laptops, personal computers and their components.  The main products of ASUS at that time were motherboards.  They are still very popular in Russia and the CIS countries.  Relatively recently, the company began to release smartphones.  In the arsenal of its mobile division there are both premium devices (with appropriate performance and design), as well as fairly budget models.  The latest devices include the <span>ASUS</span> ZenFone Go ZB452KG smartphone, reviews of which are rather mixed.  Therefore, they need to be disassembled separately. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Despite the users' jokes that the ASUS laptops are natural stoves (they really get very hot), this did not affect the popularity of these devices.  Exactly the same situation with smartphones.  Although they cannot boast of performance (budget models), they greatly benefit from the unusual design, advanced functionality, a proprietary shell and price.  For example, ASUS ZenFone Go ZB452KG 8GB, which user reviews are extremely positive (with rare exceptions), is characterized by a very unusual location of the volume buttons.  Not a single manufacturer of mobile phones, even recognized masters, has ever thought of such a thing.  This is the attractiveness of smartphones from ASUS.  They simply do not look like any other devices.  And this is very true in the age of "faceless" devices.  So, let's move on to the device itself and consider its design. </p><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  The look of ASUS ZenFone Go ZB452KG, reviews of which will be discussed in detail later, is unique.  The smartphone has all the distinguishing features of a unique device.  That is, externally - this is an ordinary "brick" of the candy bar format.  But there is some zest in it.  It is not immediately possible to understand what exactly is wrong in the design of the device.  But then comes the understanding: the device has a very interesting surface under the display at the bottom.  It is made of ribbed plastic and looks quite unusual.  As expected, most of the front panel is a touch screen.  There are two modifications to the device: with a screen of 4.5 inches and a display of 5.5 inches.  Which one is better is pretty hard to say.  Both modifications are good.  But the main design feature of Zenfon is not at all on the front panel.  Although it is also very interesting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  But the rear panel of ASUS ZenFone Go ZB452KG 1A052RU, reviews of which are also negative, is of much greater interest.  The first thing that is interesting is that it is removable.  The manufacturer also provides a very extensive color palette for the rear panels.  There are also very bright colors that can advantageously emphasize the bright personality of the user.  But salt is not all that.  And the fact that below the camera and flash, which with a light tap on the screen turns into a flashlight, there are volume buttons.  A very unexpected decision!  None of the known smartphones have such a thing.  Also, many owners note the power button of the device, which is located on the upper end.  This is also very convenient if you use the device in a car holder.  Most smartphones have this button on the side, which is quite inconvenient. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Now let's move on to the boring numbers and technical features of the ASUS ZenFone Go ZB452KG White, reviews of which are full of laudatory odes.  Inside is a fairly powerful processor that allows the device to easily cope with all applications and the vast majority of games.  Frequency - 1.2 gigahertz.  The processor has four Cortex cores.  The amount of installed RAM is 1 gigabyte.  This is quite enough to ensure fast and smooth operation of the device.  The amount of memory available to the user is 8 gigabytes.  But the memory can be expanded with a microSD card.  The device supports flash drives up to 128 gigabytes.  Touch screen created using IPS technology.  There are two modifications to this unit: with a 4.5-inch display and a 5.5-inch screen.  Everyone can choose a device to taste. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Phone ASUS ZenFone Go ZB452KG, the reviews of the owners of which give all the comprehensive information, has two cameras: front and main.  I must say that ASUS was famous for its cameras in smartphones, but then gave a blunder.  It does not stand out for anything interesting here.  The main camera has 5 megapixels, aperture 2.0, proprietary image enhancements and a single-color flash.  She can record videos with a maximum resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels.  The front camera has only 0.3 megapixels.  With her, even selfies are worthless.  A feature of the smartphone is the simultaneous support of two SIM cards in Micro SIM format.  The operating system uses the Google Android 5.1 platform with the proprietary ZenUI shell.  Some do not like the shell, but I must admit that it is made reasonably and tastefully.  There is no support for the LTE (4G) communication standard.  Yes, it is not needed in a budget smartphone.  Nevertheless, the device is equipped with high-speed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth transmitters.  But the battery could be put and more.  The standard 2070 mAh is clearly not enough for such a device. </p><h2>  Who should use this smartphone? </h2><p>  So, who might like the ASUS ZenFone Go ZB452KG, whose customer reviews are mixed?  The target audience of this device is those people who want to get a completely modern gadget for a reasonable price.  However, the ‚Äúgeeks‚Äù and gamers are clearly not happy with such a gift, because the smartphone‚Äôs power is obviously not enough.  But those who use the device exclusively for work and some not very heavy entertainment will be delighted.  Because the smartphone works clearly, stably and quickly.  For many, this is a decisive factor.  Also, such a smartphone will welcome those who value simplicity and elegance, because the device is a model of style.  Despite its fairly cheap materials. </p>

    <p>  Another potential smartphone users from ASUS are children.  The device costs such ridiculous money that even if it is broken or drowned, it will not be a pity.  In addition, the gadget will perfectly cope with all the necessary tasks.  This device is also suitable for those who often use multiple SIM cards.  He is able to simultaneously work with two at once.  This means that the user does not have to carry several phones with him.  It is very comfortable.  ASUS ZenFone Go ZB452KG, reviews of which partially confirm all of the above, a universal device.  With all the ensuing consequences.  It will suit the vast majority of potential buyers. </p><h2>  Positive user feedback on smartphone design </h2><p>  The appearance of the smartphone is what the manufacturer can be proud of.  Indeed, almost everyone likes the look of the device.  Smartphone ASUS ZenFone Go ZB452KG, the user reviews of which we will now consider, is positioned as a youth device.  And it is true.  It is bright, modern, has quality materials and meets all modern requirements.  Many owners like it removable removable panels.  You can choose the color for you.  Also, some users note a rather unusual location of the volume control buttons.  Most owners strongly dislike this approach.  And this is understandable, because the public is not used to such radical decisions.  But some find this a peculiar uniqueness.  And they are absolutely right.  This arrangement of buttons makes the smartphone unique and memorable. </p>

    <h2>  Negative user reviews about smartphone design </h2><p>  However, not everyone likes this design.  Some snobs categorically do not like bright colors, the unusual arrangement of buttons and removable panels that the ASUS ZenFone Go ZB452KG Black smartphone has.  Reviews from some comrades are blown through with barefaced irony.  Indeed, people of the older generation do not need such excesses.  But such users, as a rule, do not acquire youth smartphones.  However, there are negative reviews about the design.  And they all rest against the inconvenient location of the volume buttons.  But this is a forgivable flaw.  However, some are not satisfied with the quality of the materials used to assemble the gadget.  But this is frank snobbery, because to expect from a budget device aluminum 7000 series or a glass case is pure madness.  Many do not understand this.  However, there is constructive criticism.  So, users massively complain about the flimsy back cover.  This is a known issue.  And while in ASUS do not rush to solve it. </p>

    <h2>  Positive user reviews on performance </h2><p>  Let's talk about the real performance of ASUS ZenFone Go ZB452KG.  The characteristics, reviews of which will be analyzed in this section, allow us to hope that the device will show itself worthily in all forms.  Indeed, the vast majority of owners claim that the smartphone‚Äôs performance is sufficient for the full operation of all applications.  Also, the device plays video files without problems and does not pass before playing audio in a format without loss of quality.  But this is where the multimedia capabilities of the gadget end.  Not all games are available.  Many users were surprised that they could not even download some toys from the Market.  It says "the device does not support this application."  Because of this, users were very upset.  But they knew they were taking.  So complain about the lack of performance in games is not worth it.  This is still a smartphone for work.  And for "innocent" entertainment (such as video and music). </p>

    <h2>  Negative user reviews on smartphone performance </h2><p>  There were some derogatory comments about the performance of the ASUS ZenFone Go ZB452KG 8GB Black.  Reviews are not very joyful.  Apparently, some got a defective copy (unfortunately, this is not uncommon).  Some owners complain that after two days of use, the gadget freezes tightly.  Only reboot helps.  But sometimes even this radical way cannot help.  Here the problem is not in the level of iron, but in the fact that the device turned out to be a factory defect. </p><p>  However, some owners complain (and rightly so) about camera application glitches.  This software problem is well known to the company's engineers.  They promise to fix it in the very near future along with updating the operating system.  Also, many categorically do not like the level of the device with GPS satellites.  Indeed, he has been looking for them for too long.  However, navigation works.  Though with flaws.  Let's not forget that we have a budget apparatus. </p><h2>  Should I buy this product from ASUS? </h2><p>  The answer to this question depends on how you plan to use the gadget.  If exclusively for work, then it is worth buying.  He will become an indispensable assistant.  This is a reliable workhorse.  In addition, the device has an unusual and unique appearance, which will help to stand out from the crowd.  However, if you are an avid gamer, then it is better to refrain from buying this device.  Even despite the very attractive price.  There will be many disappointments, because this smartphone is not intended for games.  Most of the modern masterpieces of the gaming industry will not even be installed on this phone. </p><p>  If you are a photography enthusiast, then this device is also not for you.  The camera in the smartphone is frankly none.  Taking a picture of a document or class schedule will do.  But not more.  On the front camera, in general, it is better to remain silent.  It is not enough even for using Skype and other instant messengers.  Not to mention the selfie.  On the other hand, this is a good working gadget that freely "lives" a day and a half from a single battery charge.  For those who use the phone exclusively for work, this circumstance is especially important.  Modern flagships do not know how. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  So, we took apart the <span>smartphone ASUS</span> ZenFone Go ZB452KG 8GB.  Reviews about it are rather mixed.  But the positive prevails from those who chose the device for work and some "simple" entertainment.  Those who expected an incredible performance from a gadget pour mud on it.  And completely undeservedly.  But the general opinion is this: it is a beautiful, high-quality, budget device, designed for productive work and having a very attractive price.  Knowing people will perfectly understand all its charm and, undoubtedly, will buy it.  The device is definitely worthy, and it's hard to argue with that. </p>
