This topic is of interest to many citizens, because tax fees are an extremely important part of the life of a modern person.  With debts, you can lose property and run into a fine.  All these phenomena are not too encouraging.  So what has the population prepared for the car tax?  Who should pay it?  What can be said about people with disabilities in this area?  Answers to all these questions will be given below.  In fact, everything is not as simple as it seems. </p><h2>  Transport tax is ... </h2><p>  The first step is to understand what kind of payment is involved.  To answer whether a disabled person of group 2 should pay the transport tax is not as simple as it seems. </p><p>  The thing is that the studied fee is an annual payment for a car.  It is brought in by all citizens who have a particular vehicle with a motor.  The amount of payment depends on the year of manufacture of the car, as well as on engine power. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do people with disabilities pay group tax 2" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1705105.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nature of payment </h2><p>  Everything seems to be simple: every year, citizens who own a car must make money transfers to the tax authorities.  Only in Russia there are various benefits.  According to the established rules, some categories of persons are exempted from taxes, either fully or partially.  That is why it will be necessary to find out whether the disabled people of group 2 pay the transport tax.  This category of persons is considered preferential in many areas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main problem of the studied payment is that the tax on the car is regional in nature.  This means that the order and size of it is fully regulated by the municipal authorities of a particular locality. </p><h2>  The ambiguity of benefits </h2><p>  This concept applies both to the tax calculation procedure and to beneficiaries.  Disabled 2 groups must pay transport tax?  They, as already mentioned, are beneficiaries almost everywhere. </p><p>  However, car taxes are not so simple.  Disability benefits are offered at the regional level.  Accordingly, somewhere this category of persons pays tax, and in some cities, such liability is removed from the disabled. </p><p>  In fact, most often in the presence of 2 disability groups, you can either rely on a full exemption from the tax tax, or get a discount.  For example, equal to 50%. </p><h2>  The situation in Moscow </h2><p>  Now a little specificity.  Does a disabled person of group 2 have to pay transport tax in Russia?  As already mentioned, an unequivocal answer is problematic.  It all depends on the rules that apply within a particular city. </p><p>  In the capital of Russia, the bulk of these individuals do not pay tax on the car.  She is completely exempt from this payment. </p><p>  People with disabilities in the capital, in principle, must make payments for transport.  This rule applies to disabled people of 3 groups.  This category of persons pays tax for a car according to general rules.  There are no exceptions for them today. </p><p>  Does a disabled person of group 2 pay transport tax in Moscow?  Not.  According to the established rules, disabled people of not 3 groups in 2016-2017 do not make this payment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="whether a disabled person of group 2 should pay a transport tax" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1705106.jpg" width="600"></div>

How are things with car taxes?  Should people with disabilities make appropriate payments? </p><p>  Yes.  Disabled people of 3 groups will have to pay, as in Moscow, for property expressed by a machine.  The only caveat is the availability of discounts.  Disabled 3 groups in the Moscow region are entitled to a 50% discount.  This means that this category of persons does not fully pay for the car owned. </p><p>  Does a transportation tax pay a disabled person of 2 groups in the Moscow region?  Not.  In the same way as <span>disabled people of group 1.</span>  You can apply for this benefit to all disabled people 1 and 2 degrees.  These are the rules that apply in the Moscow region today. </p><h2>  By type of transport </h2><p>  Only everywhere there are exceptions.  The transport tax and its benefits depend not only on the region where the citizen lives.  The type of vehicle charged is also taken into account. </p><p>  In practice, most often claim for benefits (for full or partial exemption from tax) can people with disabilities compact cars.  For more accurate information, it is recommended that you contact your local government. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Does the transport tax pay a disabled person of 2 groups" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1705107.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Accordingly, sometimes disabled people of 2 groups have to pay a transport tax.  Disabled persons of 2 groups in Russia, as a rule, are exempted from payment if they own cars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For example, in Moscow you can apply for a benefit if a citizen has a car.  The power of its engine should be no more than 200 horsepower.  Otherwise, a discount or full exemption from payment is not required. </p><p>  But in the Moscow region, these boundaries are lower.  Here you can arrange transport benefits if you have a car with an engine power of up to 150 horsepower.  Also, citizens with motorcycles up to 50 horsepower can take advantage of this opportunity. </p><h2>  The procedure for applying for benefits </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear whether the disabled people of group 2 pay the transport tax.  How can I get this bonus? </p><p>  The thing is that the tax authorities do not check citizens for the presence of certain privileges.  Therefore, people deal with this issue on their own.  They must inform the tax authority (by registration) of a partial or full exemption from the tax on the car.  Only after this you can not wait for the appropriate receipts.  Until a citizen has declared a preferential status, he must pay the bills. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Does a transportation tax pay a disabled person of 2 groups in the Moscow region" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1705112.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The procedure for applying to the tax for <span>exemption from the transport tax</span> is reduced to certain actions.  To receive a similar bonus from the state you need: </p><ol><li>  Collect a specific package of documents.  Their complete list will be presented a little later. </li><li>  Write a statement of the established form. </li><li>  Submit an application together with the prepared documents to the tax office at the place of registration. </li><li>  Wait for an answer. </li></ol><p>  As a rule, after applying, you can simply not pay for the car.  The tax authorities will carefully examine the request, after which they will release the citizen from payment (or provide him with a discount). </p><h2>  Documents for benefits </h2><p>  Does a disabled person pay group tax 2 groups?  Not always.  In practice, most often this category of citizens is exempted from such payments.  The privilege is granted only for one unit of property.  What does it mean?  If a citizen has several cars, he himself indicates in the application the vehicle exempted from the tax charge. </p><p>  As already noted, the vehicle owner will need a certain set of documents to apply for benefits.  These include: </p><ul><li>  passport; </li><li>  statement; </li><li>  documents of ownership of the car; </li><li>  TIN (if available); </li><li>  certificate indicating disability. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disabled people of 2 groups must pay transport tax disabled people of 2 groups" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1705110.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  Pensioners additionally need to attach a pension certificate.  No more documents are needed. </p><h2>  Deduction for past years </h2><p>  Another small nuance: all citizens (not only disabled people) can, if there are benefits, receive a tax deduction for previous years.  A similar situation develops when a citizen turned to the tax service to draw up a bonus from the state later than the actual appearance of the right to it. </p><p>  For example, if a disabled person first received a disability, then he paid taxes on a car for several years.  Tax authorities must do the recalculation.  The limitation period for the deduction, minus 3 years.  This means that a refund of the transport tax is allowed for the last 36 months. </p><p>  The documents that are necessary to implement this idea do not differ from the previously proposed list.  It is supplemented by the details of the account for the return of the overpayment, as well as payment receipts evidencing payment of taxes for the car. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  From now on, it is clear whether disabled people of group 2 pay the transport tax.  In fact, this question does not have a clear answer.  As noted earlier, it all depends on the region where the person lives.  In practice, people with disabilities of groups 1 and 2 can either be completely exempted from this payment or receive a 50% discount. </p><p>  In Moscow, 2 groups of people with disabilities should pay a transport tax or not?  Not.  And in the Moscow region, too.  In the capital, this category of taxpayers is completely exempt from the tax on the car, but only after submitting a written application for registration of the bonus.  But disabled people of 3 groups are not always beneficiaries.  In the capital, such people are not exempt from tax on the car. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="2 groups of persons with disabilities must pay transport tax or not" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1705109.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About disability </h2><p>  Who can be disabled 2 groups?  These are citizens who: </p><ul><li>  can service themselves only with specialized equipment or assistants; </li><li>  move with the help of special devices or other people; </li><li>  have limited opportunities for work (or it is completely absent); </li><li>  cannot study or can only be trained in specialized institutions; </li><li>  not able to clearly navigate in space; </li><li>  Do not control their behavior. </li></ul><p>  To get a disability you have to go through a medical commission.  After it, the citizen will be issued a certificate of the established form, which will confirm the existence of one degree or another of disability.  This document will have to be attached to the application when applying for transport tax benefits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disabled people of 2 groups must pay transport tax disabled people of 2 groups or not" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1705113.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What other features are disabled people of 2 groups?  Do disabled people of group 2 have to pay the transport tax or not in a particular region?  It is best to clarify this issue in the regional government.  And thus it will be possible to find out whether the disabled people of group 2 pay the transport tax. </p>
