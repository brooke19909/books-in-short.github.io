    <p>  In addition, if you are not careful and try to do the cropping yourself (and then insert the cropped card into the previous shape), you risk damaging the thin connectors on your phone. </p><h2>  Simka's story </h2><p>  The Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card is used in mobile phones as a memory chip that contains the data necessary for authentication in a mobile network.  Early cards only had storage from 16 KB to 64 KB, which was enough to copy authentication data, mobile data settings, as well as some contacts and text messages.  More advanced features were introduced with the advent of multimedia messaging.  Today, some SIM chips with the same connection format may have integrated microprocessors for added functionality.  Modern developers are working to add even <span>Near Field Communication (NFC)</span> to the SIM card chip. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Segment and Card Size </h2><p>  The original SIM card format was exactly the same size as bank cards.  Very early mobile phones really used these relatively large SIM cards.  What we call SIM cards today is actually in mini format.  When you buy a new "SIM card", it may be located inside the plastic form of the old model and be subject to ejection from it.  Presumably, this is done either to simplify production or to maintain <span>backward compatibility.</span>  Nowadays, it is increasingly possible to find that operators implement micro-SIM in a similar mini format. </p>

    <h2>  SIM card cropping to other formats </h2><p>  Cutting the card to the right size is not a big problem.  There is a special cutter for "sims", which allows you to do this most accurately.  Much more difficulties begin when you need to use micro on a mini device.  For this, there are various SIM card adapters on the market. </p><h2>  Cross compatibility </h2><p>  Most modern smartphones have a tightly mounted SIM card slot, rather than a swivel holder.  Some models go even further (for example, <span>Nokia N8)</span> - they have a push-to-eject system.  For this reason, such gadgets have very limited space in which the card must stand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Because of this, poor-quality adapters can easily get stuck on the contact pins and cause damage when you try to remove them.  For this reason, it is not recommended to make an adapter for a SIM card with your own hands. </p><h2>  What adapters are on sale? </h2><p>  Two types of adapters are available today.  The first is called Outline, and it is just a piece of plastic in the form of a mini-SIM with a hole for micro-SIM.  They usually come with an <span>adhesive label</span> to keep the SIM in place. </p><p>  Adapters for SIM cards of the second type are called Backed.  They differ from Outline in the presence of a thin plastic wall on one side of the space with a round hole in the center. </p>

    <h2>  Best adapters for SIM cards </h2><p>  As noted above, the main problem is that phones, as a rule, support different sizes of cards, and sometimes replacing a SIM card is not possible with a mobile network operator.  It is for this that we need a special adapter for a SIM card.  Such adapters are quite cheap, but it is necessary to take into account some of their features, so that your SIM card fits the phone perfectly.  Where to buy an adapter for a SIM card?  As a rule, the widest selection is presented in various online stores.  Below is a rating of the most popular devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Samdi brand adapter </h2><p>  This is one of the best-selling adapters you can find today.  There are several different color options, and all are available at the same price.  The adapter is equipped with micro and nano-SIM adapters.  There is also a mic adapter compatible with all iPhone models.  There is also an ejector SIM needle that comes with the kit, as many modern phones (such as OnePlus 3 and Apple) come with ejector trays.  You also get a file package for storing cards, which can be useful if you have a lot of ‚Äúsims‚Äù that you would like to save. </p>

    <h2>  Generic Sim Card Adapter </h2><p>  The universal adapter is compatible with all phone models.  This is the cheapest adapter that can be found in company stores, as it costs a little more than a dollar.  They are made of durable material and cut with great precision so that the SIM card fits perfectly.  The kit includes three different adapters - Nano to Micro, Nano to Standard and Micro to Standard.  There is no single ejection needle or file for storing cards in the set, but considering its cost, this justifies itself. </p><h2>  iCoolkit Nano-Micro </h2><p>  The iCoolkit micro adapter is another cheap device option for a SIM card.  It costs a little less than $ 3, and at the same time is of high quality.  This kit is different from others because it is of the Backed type, unlike the ones listed above.  The sticker included in the design allows you to firmly hold the SIM card in place after you put it in the tray. </p><p>  However, the disadvantage of this kind of adapter is that it is more difficult to convert, unlike other options.  The iCoolkit also contains microfiber cleaning cloth, which you can use to wipe your SIM card.  When using the adapter, no unnecessary marks or traces of glue are formed, so you can be sure that your SIM card will not be damaged. </p><h2>  Mobi Lock 3 in 1 </h2><p>  The Mobi Lock 3 in 1 adapter is priced slightly higher than some of the other kits on this list, but it provides very good quality.  The kit includes all three adapters through which you can convert micro or nano to other sizes.  All adapters are built so that your SIM card fits perfectly into the tray.  All of them are reversible, so you can always remove the "SIM" if you want to use it with several devices with support for various sizes.  Since the kit has three devices, it can be considered as an adapter for 2 SIM cards.  Adapters are compatible with all types of phones, and their installation is quite simple.  You do not need any additional tools to hold the card.  Also included is a singlet ejector needle. </p>

    <h2>  iSYFIX 4 in 1 </h2><p>  This is one of the more expensive sets of adapters for SIM cards, which at the same time offers very good quality in packaging and assembly.  The kit includes three different adapters for a SIM card.  There are Nano to Micro, Micro to Standard, and Nano to Micro adapters.  You will also receive a SIM tray pin ejector, which can be very useful for use on most modern smartphones.  Adapters are created using high quality materials and are cut with high precision, so they hold the card tightly.  Installation is very simple and only takes a few seconds.  For its implementation you will not need additional tools.  In addition, iSYFIX provides a one-year kit warranty. </p><h2>  LENTION 5-in-1 </h2><p>  The kit contains three different adapters, each of which is made in a different color so that you can easily identify them.  All adapters are made of high quality aluminum, so their durability is ensured.  They do not bend or wear out with frequent use, unlike plastic models.  There is also an ejector needle for the SIM tray, which is useful if you have lost the original. </p><h2>  R-Sim 3 pack Adapter Kit </h2><p>  This kit is one of the cheapest.  It costs only about a dollar and offers three functional adapters.  Thus, this can be useful if you have a smartphone with two SIM cards (most often users need an adapter for 2 SIM cards for Samsung).  There are also three needles for ejector cards.  Micro to Regular, Nano to Regular, and Nano-Micro adapters included.  The quality of their assembly may not be the best, compared to some other kits, but this is due to the low cost. </p>
