One of the most popular accommodation options can be considered the hotel Kilikya Palace Goynuk 5 *.  Reviews about this place are full of positive comments.  It is worth highlighting the following: </p><ul><li>  the hammam deserves all praise; </li><li>  beautiful children's animation; </li><li>  the hotel is located on the seashore; </li><li>  quick registration procedure without unnecessary delays and delays; </li><li>  beach towels are provided without collateral; </li><li>  immediately upon arrival (even before checking into the room) you can use all the services that are included in the All Inclusive package; </li><li>  many shops on the territory (prices are quite reasonable); </li><li>  a good playground with many attractions and interesting sculptures; </li><li>  there are a lot of green spaces on the territory, which not only create a cool shadow, but also give the air a pleasant aroma; </li><li>  thanks to the wide cornice above the balcony, direct sunlight does not fall into the room window; </li><li>  both in the architecture of the buildings and in the interior of the hotel, traditional Turkish elements are traced; </li><li>  soft soft music always plays in the lobby; </li><li>  between the immediate territory and the beach there is a small promenade where it is pleasant to take a walk in the evening; </li><li>  the beds in the rooms are simply huge; </li><li>  a separate pool is allocated for recreational activities, and therefore no one will interfere with swimming lovers; </li><li>  workers monitor the cleanliness of the beach by cleaning it several times a day (the situation would be even better if some tourists did not throw cigarette butts around them); </li><li>  waiters in restaurants are very polite, do their job quickly and efficiently; </li><li>  the buffet menu has a lot of fresh fruit; </li><li>  animators do not let anyone get bored day or night (but if you do not want to take part in entertainment, no one will be imposed); </li><li>  there is free Wi-Fi in the lobby of the main building (although it‚Äôs possible to use it only early in the morning when there are few people with gadgets in the lobby); </li><li>  hotel workers do not extort tips and treat all guests equally, regardless of nationality; </li><li>  in the corridors, unlike rooms, maids daily vacuum and thoroughly wash the floors; </li><li>  during the day, guests are constantly available some kind of snacks, but because between the main meals it is simply impossible to get hungry. </li></ul><h2>  Negative comments </h2><p>  In order not to spoil unpleasant surprises, it is worthwhile to prepare in advance for possible negative moments that may arise at the hotel.  So, a number of flaws is characterized by Kilikya Palace Goynuk 5 * (Turkey, Goynuk).  The most significant can be considered the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  theme nights are accompanied by incredibly loud music, which terribly hurts the head; </li><li>  if you live in a room that overlooks the pool, then until late at night you will not be allowed to sleep animation sounds; </li><li>  for the use of wireless Internet you need to pay 3 euros per day; </li><li>  the halls and corridors of the hotel are poorly ventilated, and therefore it is very stuffy in them; </li><li>  strong smell of bleach from the pool; </li><li>  regardless of the number of residents, only one key will be issued to your number; </li><li> there are not enough sun loungers, both by the pool and on the beach (the administration does not struggle with those who occupy a sun lounger in the early morning, but only come to rest by dinner or later); </li><li>  the gently sloping entrance is not provided in the pool (you need to go down the water through a metal staircase; </li><li>  visit to the children's playroom with electronic machines is paid; </li><li>  the sockets in the room are located at the very bottom of the wall, which is very inconvenient (for example, to turn on the kettle or charge the phone, you need to lower the device to the floor); </li><li>  no instructions are attached to the safe, which is built into the wardrobe, and therefore all guests have to call the master; </li><li>  the air conditioner does not work if a card is not inserted in the slot, and therefore in your absence the number will not cool; </li><li>  entry into the sea is not very comfortable, and therefore you have to shoe special slippers; </li><li>  room cleaning is not thorough enough (the floor does not wash and does not vacuum); </li><li>  towels are not replaced on demand, but strictly on schedule (even if you throw a dirty towel on the floor, the maid will hang it back on the hook); </li><li>  the choice of dishes in the main restaurant is not the widest; </li><li>  in order for a regular guest, birthday man, or newlyweds to receive a compliment, you need to go through a complex procedure from compiling several applications; </li><li>  the room has few lighting fixtures, which is especially felt in the evening. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The first impression of the Kilikya Palace Goynuk 5 * hotel can be called quite pleasant.  Photos taken by tourists demonstrate an interesting interior and beautifully designed area.  Also, one can not help but say about the huge comfortable beach.  Nevertheless, as a result of the rest, many guests conclude that this hotel does not correspond to its five stars.  It‚Äôs more like a Quartet. </p><p>  The first thing that fails is the quality of the cleaning.  Surely in your room you will find dust under the bed.  In addition, nutrition could be more varied.  And of course, it‚Äôs worth noting paid wireless Internet.  Nevertheless, the positive points outweigh.  In this hotel you will have a good rest, get acquainted with Turkish culture, and will also be constantly surrounded by care and attention from the staff. </p><p>  It is also worth saying a few words about the interior of the rooms.  It can be called a little "tired" and shabby, which is not so important for active tourists.  And if you want to live in a more beautiful setting, book rooms in the new Elite building.  They are equipped with new appliances and decorated with the latest interior trends. </p>
