Naturally, the most common fruit in our country is an apple.  In the article, we consider options for making an apple application.  We‚Äôll tell you how to make them, for which age group of children you can offer one of the options. </p><h2>  Development of children during occupations </h2><p>  Classes in the visual arts in kindergarten are represented by drawing, applique, modeling, manual labor.  All these activities contribute to the development of children's creative abilities, attention, accuracy, motor skills of hands and fingers.  Before starting work on the application, the child must listen to the explanation, consider the sample made by the teacher, and understand the sequence of work. </p><p>  In the younger group, children only paste the details already prepared by the teacher on a piece of paper, and you need to properly position them.  The ability to navigate in space is developing.  The part must be taken in hand, turned over to the back side, thoroughly greased with glue, especially the edges, and carefully glued, not rubbing, but blotting the part with a napkin.  It can be applique "Big and small apples on a plate." </p><p>  In the middle group, children begin to learn to use scissors, sometimes incising something or making a fringe at the edges of the product.  The works already have more small details, knowledge of the structure of objects and <span>animals is</span> required <span>.</span>  <span>The application</span> can be from different materials, volume elements are added. </p><p>  Older children are already cutting out the parts themselves.  Creative tasks are given on a given topic and the necessary colors of paper, and the children themselves should dream up and come up with a plot picture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of applications </h2><p>  The work uses different materials.  This napkin, crumpled lumps, and simple colored paper, cardboard, newspapers, cut out pages of glossy magazines.  Make patterns of torn paper or cut strips. </p><p>  Now there is an interesting hobby.  Pictures are made by twisting strips of paper using the quilling technique.  Often the teacher uses several types of fine art.  For example, to the application of an apple, you can add a drawing of a leaf made by sticking a hand painted with gouache. </p><h2>  Work for kids </h2><p>  To perform such an application in the younger group, apples are cut out of paper by the educator according to the number of children.  For work you will need such materials: napkins or corrugated paper in light green and dark green.  You can make an apple from red, yellow or pink napkins.  You will also need a brown colored pencil for the branch on which the apple grew. </p>

    <p>  You can replace it with a felt-tip pen or colored wax crayon.  In order to fill the surface of the apple, you will need to tear napkins or thin paper into pieces and stick together so that a white leaf is not visible.  The leaf is made by twisting napkins into lumps.  Then, on the form of the sheet drawn by the teacher, you need to stick them one at a time.  The balls are also located next to each other, filling the entire surface of the leaf.  The work is ready! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mosaic applique "Apple" </h2><p>  Such work is also done in the younger group.  In preparation for starting work, the teacher cuts out a sheet of paper in the shape of an apple with a leaf and a stick.  The contours of the parts are outlined with a marker, so that it is easier for the child to determine the boundaries of each individual part.  Next, for children on three different plastic plates lay sliced ‚Äã‚Äãsquares of three colors.  These are green for the leaf, brown for the stick and red for the apple itself. </p>

    <p>  To make children more interested, you can add a small worm with a funny face.  Kids have to glue each small square with glue and stick everything in the right places.  They should be close to one to one so that there is as little empty space as possible. </p><h2>  Apple on a plate </h2><p>  A similar application can be made in the middle group, only the children themselves should already cut out the leaf from the rectangle, wand and tear the paper themselves, trying to make all the pieces the same. </p>

    <p>  Children are given sheets of thick colored double-sided paper for printers.  The necessary colors are selected.  It can be a red, light green, yellow, orange, pink apple.  For a twig, you will need either green paper or brown.  The leaf, of course, will only be green. </p><p>  First of all, children are cut with scissors along the line drawn by the teacher, a strip of paper.  Next, you need to properly glue the ends to each other.  It is necessary to smear only one edge, and simply attach the other as the teacher showed.  At the time of gluing, you must immediately insert a brown strip between the ends.  In order for the parts to stick together well, you need to hold them pressed together for a while.  When both edges are firmly glued, it remains to add a leaf to the top edge of the stick. </p><h2>  Garland for group decoration in the fall </h2><p>  Even for decorating the group in the autumn, you can make apples large and small.  Volume application is made of identical circles and two small leaves.  You can do this work already with older children. </p>

    <p>  According to the pattern, children cut identical circles or the shape of an apple with a recess in the middle.  Next, you need to bend the parts in half and smooth the edge with your finger.  It turns circles bent at an angle.  Next comes the most critical part of the work.  It will be necessary to glue together all the details, spreading only one half with glue.  It is important that the child understands that it is necessary to glue the details clearly, otherwise the back sides of the applique will look out.  The apple will then be sloppy.  After all the circles are glued together, the last semicircle is joined with the first. </p><p>  Lastly, a leaf or two is glued to the volumetric apple.  A garland of apples of different colors or sizes will look beautiful. </p><h2>  Application "Apple and Pear" </h2><p>  In the kindergarten preparatory group, children love to do work in new ways.  They are already interested in various techniques, one of which is quilling.  On sale in stationery stores there are many sets with strips of different colors and widths.  Composing songs is easy, so children 6-7 years old can handle it. </p>

    <p>  For work, you will need strips of quilling of the right colors, a brush and PVA glue.  First, strips of red color are twisted, for example, around a pencil or felt-tip pen.  Adults use a special hook to work.  When you get a skein of two or three strips glued together, they are removed from the pencil and let the paper slightly unwind.  The edge is glued to the last turn.  After that, the shape of an apple is made from a red skein by crushing parts, and the shape of a pear is made from green or yellow.  It remains only to smear the end part with PVA glue and stick it on a cardboard sheet.  So that the part is well fixed on the plane, it is necessary to press it gently with the whole palm. </p><p>  Then they make a wand, simply folding the strip in several layers.  The leaf needs to be made by simple winding the strips around the pencil.  Only already need to wind tightly, pressing the tape to the base. </p><p>  Then the pencil is removed, the edge sealed on the last turn, and the circle is shaped like a rhombus, squeezing on both sides with your fingers.  The sheet is also glued with the end part onto PVA glue. </p><h2>  Large bulk apple </h2><p>  Such an application can be made as a crafts on the theme of "Autumn" in the preparatory group of kindergarten or in elementary school.  You will need a cardboard sleeve from the toilet paper for the base.  The red double-sided sheet for the printer needs to be cut in equal lines.  Then the strip is glued onto the sleeve as follows.  One edge of the strip is smeared with glue and glued inside the cylinder from above, and the other end is the same, only below. </p>

    <p>  Thus, the whole cylinder is glued.  The more strips will be placed on the sleeve, the more magnificent and beautiful the finished work will be.  When the bulk of the work is done, you will need to glue a stick out of thick cardboard and on top of it is a leaf.  Everything, the work is finished.  You can carry it to the exhibition. </p><p>  Parents have the opportunity with their children at home to make such options for apples from paper.  Then the kid in the kindergarten will be much easier to make applications.  Or maybe you will come up with your own version?  Create, fantasize, play with children, because they are so waiting for this! </p>
