Knitting needles in the technique of "enterlak": practical tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are many <span>knitting</span> and crochet techniques.  But constantly new and new interesting methods are becoming popular among lovers of artistic thread tangling.  In recent years, one of them has become entrelak, whose name in Runet was remade as enterlak, since it is easier to pronounce for a Russian person. </p><h2>  A kind of patchwork </h2><p>  Since childhood, we know an interesting patchwork, which is called a patchwork.  It turns out there is the same kind of knitting.  Only here the flaps are not cut out of the fabric, but knit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="enterlack knitting" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/699722.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  Enterlak is also considered to be this type of needlework.  Knitting in this way makes it possible to get a beautiful colored fabric from interconnected shreds.  The main difference from the main patchwork is continuous knitting.  In the first case, the flaps are knitted separately with a separation of the thread.  Knitting with the "enterlak" technique is interesting because it does not require a break in the thread from the beginning to the end of the product. </p><p>  Outwardly, these techniques are no different, which means that they can be put on a par. </p><h2>  Appearance Features </h2><p>  Enterlak has a very attractive and unusual decorative effect.  Knitting consists of squares or stripes directed in different directions.  It is very similar to a basket of twigs.  Even one-color canvas stands out among similar products.  The technique of knitting "enterlak" with needles allows you to place the flaps perpendicular to each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Products from multi-colored yarn look even more interesting.  From it you can knit each square of a new color.  Such things will really please positive and cheerful people.  For beginners, melange yarns are suitable in this technique, masters are able to combine several shades of plain yarn. </p><p>  Many craftswomen use Enterlack knitting and crocheting to create a wide variety of things: from cosmetic bags and wallets to dresses, shawls and rugs.  The technique looks great both in small details and in large-scale works. </p><h2>  Apparent complexity </h2><p>  At first glance, it seems that it is quite difficult to master knitting with Enterlack.  A master class in knitting simple figures and simple things will help in practice to make sure that this is not so. </p><p>  To master this technique, it is enough to be able to knit a hosiery fabric and understand the features of rotary knitting when the fabric is created obliquely.  This is the minimum set of knowledge necessary for mastering enterlak.  But before you start knitting the finished product, you need to practice on the old yarn.  Without experience, novice craftsmen in this technique run the risk of getting confused and making <span>mistakes, the correction of</span> which will be noticeable, since loose yarn loses its appearance in the product. </p><p>  After several training rows, which in the future can be turned into a stand for a glass or a cup, this simple, but at the same time requiring attention, technique becomes clear. </p><h2>  Enterlack: beginning of a row on knitting needles </h2><p>  In order not to be unfounded, we offer to try knitting "enterlak".  The master class will be virtual (on the pages of our article), but for experienced masters it will not be difficult to understand the features of the technique. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The web of triangles begins.  We collect 18 loops, which is equal to 3 triangles of 6 loops.  We knit a <span>stocking viscous,</span> in each row adding 1 loop.  We start with two facial.  We unfold and knit two wrong ones.  In a new row, we take one more from the typed loops and knit back and forth. </p><p>  In this way, we knit all 6 loops and return to the ‚Äúfoot‚Äù of the new triangle, which we also start with two loops.  We do not touch the knitted stitches of a half-square.  They are ready. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting enterlak" class="if" height="180" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/699726.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  In this way, we execute all three triangles, giving rise to the canvas using the enterlak technique.  The knitting pattern for the next rows will consist of side triangles and central squares. </p><h2>  Second row </h2><p>  This is where beginners have problems.  To make the canvas clear and beautiful, you need to correctly form an edge loop that separates one square from the second.  This is the whole ‚Äúenterlak‚Äù technique, knitting in this way is a little complicated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="enterlac knitting" class="if" height="180" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/699725.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  We knit the side triangle with the same turning parts: two wrong side, turn over, two front, and again turn.  Next, remove the <span>edge loop,</span> make a crochet and knit 2 loops together.  At the output we get 3 loops.  We perform the operation in the same way until we master all the loops of the lower triangle and get 6 new loops. </p><p>  The middle square is knitted from loops typed along the wall of the first lower triangle from bottom to top.  Each time we knit together one loop of the second triangle, until we master them all and get a new square of 6 loops.  In this case, the loops from the side triangle are not involved.  We continue knitting with the Enterlak technique until we get the right-sized fabric. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="enterlak knitting pattern" class="if" height="215" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/699718.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <h2>  Product completion </h2><p>  To make the product a neat look, you need to knit the last row correctly.  It will consist entirely of triangles: side and endlak knitting.  We knit a side piece with knitting needles according to the previous scheme, but in the last row directed to the center of the product, we close all the loops, alternately knitting two. </p><p>  Next, we collect 6 loops on the wall of the square-base and knit in the same way as before, only the last 2 loops in the extreme row are also closed. </p><p>  If you do everything exactly according to the scheme and never get off anywhere, you get a spectacular product that looks unusually even in a monochrome version. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting enterlak master class" class="if" height="215" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/699723.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <p>  Where to apply the enterlac canvas further?  Knitting in this technique for beginners is suitable for creating rugs and pillowcases.  The advantage of these products is that they do not need to create complex shapes.  Simple squares and rectangles will become not only a training for the craftswoman, but also an opportunity to gain experience in this amazing technique. </p><h2>  On a few knitting needles </h2><p>  Not only on two knitting needles you can work with enterlak.  It can also be created in a circle using connected knitting needles or a set of four to six two-pointed ones.  An example would be knitting socks.  Knitting needles in a circle is a bit more complicated than a rectangular fabric, especially at the beginning of knitting.  Therefore, it is worth starting a similar product only after simpler options have been mastered. </p><p>  Socks from one square begin and gradually expand to the desired size.  Further, knitting occurs in a circle without edge triangles, since there is no need for them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting enterlak socks" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/699720.jpg" width="300"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"

          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

    <p>  The heel is tied out by adding and removing the desired number of squares - a protrusion is created on the resulting stocking.  For a craftswoman with some experience, such a product will be not just another training of equipment, but also an occasion to give loved ones the beautiful multi-colored socks. </p><h2>  Enterlack and Hook </h2><p>  Crocheting, too, you can get a beautiful product from squares or rectangles.  This way it is easier to create colorful products, since there is no need to look at a large number of open loops. </p><p>  Practice shows that crochet "enterlak" crochet looks great in Tunisian knitting.  The canvas in this technique comes out softer, and the thread goes an order of magnitude smaller. </p><p>  You can use the columns that are familiar to us, alternating them into beautiful patterns.  But do not get carried away with it.  The main thing that enterlac needs to achieve is clear patches, not fancy patterns stuck to each other. </p><h2>  Knitting complication options </h2><p>  As already mentioned, you can complicate the product with threads of different colors to get a clear enterlak.  Knitting with several pieces of yarn is difficult and requires extraordinary attention from the master. </p><p>  There are options with one-color canvas.  These are small openwork inserts that should have a clear elongated shape to emphasize the direction of knitting and thus focus on the effect of the patches that make up the finished product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet enterlak" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/699721.jpg" width="320"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  But do not get involved in this.  It is more advisable to highlight a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe product, focusing on it.  It can be openwork sleeves or some stripes along, across or diagonally of the finished product. </p><h2>  Design solutions </h2><p>  Having achieved perfection in this technique, even knitting socks can be turned into art.  Enterlak has unlimited decorative possibilities.  It is always worth experimenting with color, patterns, <span>melange yarn, the</span> direction of knitting squares-rectangles. </p><p>  Ready-to-use enterlak looks very beautiful in combination with <span>embroidery with ribbons,</span> beads or yarn.  Do not forget about the edge treatment, which can both decorate the product and spoil it.  Having shown a little imagination, there is a chance to get an unsurpassed cardigan or dress worthy of the best catwalks. </p>
