    <h2>  Vasily Kotov: biography of early years </h2><p>  Vasily Afanasevich was born in 1885 in Dorokhov, Moscow province.  His father was a simple postal servant, because of which the family lived on a meager salary.  However, soon this money was gone.  When the boy was 13 years old, the head of the family died, leaving the guy an orphan (historians do not know anything about the fate of his mother). </p><p>  In order not to starve to death, Vasily Kotov arranged to work as an apprentice in a blacksmith workshop.  It was a very successful move, as it allowed the young man not only to acquire his own money, but also to receive a technical education.  Later, the ability to work with metal more than once will play into the hands of the ambitious Kotov. </p><p>  After graduation, Vasily Kotov gets a job at the Abrikosov factory.  In those years, it was a very famous confectionery, producing the best sweets in Moscow.  As for Vasily Afanasievich himself, the management of the company always saw him as a reliable employee, and therefore boldly trusted him with the right to manage the cash register. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Lights of the October Revolution </h2><p>  In 1915, Vasily Kotov inadvertently joined the ranks of the Social Democrats, which soon turned into big problems for him.  So, on an anonymous tip, he is accused of some fraud, which serves as an occasion for drawing up a court case.  Fortunately, the court is gracious, if I may say so, and only sentenced to administrative expulsion from the capital. </p><p>  In this regard, the lights of the October Revolution, Vasily Kotov met in Rostov-on-Don.  Here he quickly found friends among the Communists.  Soon he himself joined the ranks of the Red Army.  Thus, the expulsion from Moscow prompted him to new political activities aimed at strengthening the power of the people. </p><h2>  Party activity </h2><p>  After the revolution, Vasily Kotov got a job in the Moscow locksmith.  However, not even a year had passed before he switched to party activity.  Thanks to this, in 1919 he was appointed party secretary of the Sokolniki district of the city of Moscow.  In this position he stayed until 1925. </p><p>  After this, the career of Vasil Kotov is rapidly rising.  He is either appointed secretary of the party committee, or promoted to a member of the Central Committee of the CPSU (1930).  Subsequently, he even rose to the rank of manager of the construction trust of the People's Commissariat of the RSFSR (1933-1935).  And yet this position becomes the last in his life, because soon his person will be superfluous on the political scene of that time. </p>

    <h2>  Execution and acquittal </h2><p>  It is difficult to say what was the impetus for the repression of Vasily Kotov.  All documents are either classified or wiped off the face of the earth.  All that is known is that in September 1936 he was tried according to Art.  58-7 and 58-8 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR (preparation and organization of a terrorist act).  As a result, the death penalty is execution.  The sentence was carried out on May 27, 1937. </p><p>  And only in 1958, after the death of Comrade Stalin, the court reviewed the Kotov case.  All judges agreed that the verdict was initially incorrect, and acquitted Vasily Afanasevich.  Following this (in 1962) he was returned to the ranks of the members of the CPSU.  True, such a decision was unlikely to be able to atone for the damage that was done to the Kotov family. </p>
