    <h2>  Independent route </h2><p>  Well, the fastest and most reliable way to overcome the Anapa-Kerch route will be as follows: drive this distance in your own car.  In this case, there are many advantages.  Firstly, a person does not depend on anyone.  Secondly, comfort.  Thirdly, in this way it will be possible to reach the final destination much faster.  Of the minuses - the fact that not everyone has a car. </p><p>  Although there is another nuance regarding cost.  A bus ticket costs about the same as an independent car trip will cost.  About a person will need 360 rubles.  116 kilometers - this is the distance that must be overcome by going on the route "Anapa - Kerch".  And if a car spends 10 liters per 100 kilometers, then only 12 will be needed all the way. One of the most inexpensive gasolines costs 30 rubles per liter.  So the trip will be inexpensive.  If it weren‚Äôt for one nuance, the thing is that you still have to pay for a place on the ferry.  If a person rides alone, it will be somewhat costly - about 1,500 rubles.  If five people travel, it will be cheap. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Map travel </h2><p>  Before you go on a trip along the Anapa-Kerch route, you should carefully read the map and study the list of cities and towns through which you have to travel.  This is useful information, as it will still be possible to find out information about the existing traffic police posts and gas stations. </p><p>  The path from Anapa to Kerch lies through a large number of villages.  Cyanobalk, Grape, Utash, Dzhiginka, White, Hay, Fontalovskaya, Zaporizhzhya and Ilyich - these are their names.  You will also have to stop at the port of Kavkaz (ferries leave from there) and then drive through the <span>port of Krym</span> (it is half an hour from Kerch itself).  In general, the route is simple - you only need to familiarize yourself with it in advance - and you can go on a journey. </p>

    <h2>  Regular flights </h2><p>  If it is not possible to drive your own car from Kerch to Anapa or vice versa, then do not get upset.  This is not the only way to get to the city.  In the direction of "Anapa - Kerch" the bus runs regularly (and vice versa).  There are both direct flights and transit flights.  They all go to Sevastopol - to the Crimean hero city.  Few flights depart directly from Anapa (to be more precise - only one exists), mainly routes start from Krymsk, Novorossiysk, Tuapse, <span>Sochi, Gelendzhik</span> and Krasnodar.  The good news is that they go regularly - every day.  It is only advisable to take a ticket at least a couple of days before departure, because on the day of departure they may not be there - the destination is popular and, accordingly, is in demand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is worth noting another nuance.  Kerch is not always indicated on the flight.  Take, for example, the bus following the direction "Sochi - Sevastopol".  Kerch is not indicated in it - instead of it is marked ‚ÄúPort‚Äú Caucasus ‚Äù. However, in the city itself, the bus still stops, because, as mentioned above, the port is located not far from it. Therefore, if‚Äú P.  Caucasus ", you can be sure that in Kerch the bus will stop. </p>

    <h2>  Catamarans </h2><p>  Everyone knows that from Kerch to Anapa and back you can get there by water.  This is also a pretty convenient way.  And you can overcome this distance in three and a half hours.  Many travel along the Anapa-Kerch route.  The catamaran, however, is not as popular as buses, and therefore today there are only two such flights, at eight o'clock and at half-past three (daytime).  If you leave in the morning, then you can be in Kerch already at 10:30.  If you take a day flight, the catamaran will arrive in the hero city at 17:00. </p><p>  The ticket price, of course, differs from the fare on the bus.  An adult ticket will cost one thousand rubles (one way).  Children - two times less (from six to 12 years).  But there is a slight advantage in the form of a free ticket for children under six years of age.  In addition, on a catamaran, the distance can be overcome much faster.  The names of the ships are Sochi-1 and Sochi-2.  In this case, tickets should also be taken in advance, since catamarans are usually filled to capacity (their capacity is 250 people). </p>

    <h2>  Transport system development </h2><p>  It should be noted that recently (to be more precise, after the annexation of Crimea to the Russian Federation) flights from Crimea to the mainland (in particular, to the Krasnodar Territory) have become very popular.  Many people in March 2014 became interested in how it would be possible to move to the other side.  Therefore, the development of the transport system began very actively, and a test flight of the Sochi-1 catamaran was launched at the same time, in the first month of spring.  It took some time to practice the mooring and receiving passengers, and after that the flights have already become regular. </p>

    <h2>  Through the ferry </h2><p>  Well, everything is clear about catamarans, but there is another type of water transport.  And these are ferries.  Anapa - Kerch is a direction in which this <span>type of transport</span> does not go.  Ferries from Crimea to the mainland go only from Kerch and from Sevastopol.  From the last point they are sent exclusively to Novorossiysk.  And these are not passenger ships, but cargo ones.  So, getting to the other side on the ferry will be possible in only one way - initially having arrived by bus or car to the crossing, and there - to get a ticket for water transport.  Today it is the most popular way to overcome this route. </p>
