Fortunately, residents of the capital have the opportunity to go to one wonderful reservoir in the Moscow region, which is still little promoted in advertising posts, and thus retains its man-made and natural beauty.  This reservoir is called Shalakhovskoye.  Fishing here, judging by the reviews, is just great.  In addition, in this pond you can have a wonderful time, swim, swim.  On its shores there are many places for camping and for making a bonfire.  It is about this artificial pond that will be discussed in this article. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Shalakhovskoe reservoir is a great place for a family vacation.  It is one hundred thirty kilometers distant from the capital.  Located on <span>the Tsna River</span> in the east of the Moscow Region, this artificial reservoir extends along its channel for eight kilometers.  Twenty kilometers from it is the city of Yegoryevka.  The banks of the reservoir are wooded.  In general, the pond is hidden in a dense forest.  Many people come here for mushrooms, blueberries and blackberries, which are so rich in the shores of the Shalakhovsky reservoir.  Rest here takes place in the much sought after privacy.  Despite the fact that information about this reservoir is relatively small, however, people often travel here.  Those who have already been here are always extremely pleased with their time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Shalakhovskoe reservoir, reviews of the trip to which is mostly positive, is the largest body of water in the Yegoryevsky district.  Its shores attract numerous townspeople not only for their water expanses, but also in dense forests.  Two dams divide the reservoir into three components: the main (the most extensive water area), middle and upper.  As a result of these divisions, a huge water cascade was created, which is an amazing sight.  Two rivers flow into the upper part of the reservoir - Tsna and Studenka, into the middle - Popovka, into the lower - Konyushka, which forms a fairly branched bay with a length of more than five hundred meters when entering. </p>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Shalakhovskoe reservoir is located on the natural extension of the Tsninskaya valley.  In it, water is held both by the dam and by the waterproof clays that have come down to us since the Jurassic period.  They are underlain by water-glacial and river sands.  According to experts, it would be very difficult to create such an artificial reservoir below the Tsna River.  There, this aquatic artery cuts through a spur on the Yegoryevskaya Upland, and therefore its valley is quite narrow.  In addition, limestones of the Carboniferous period, which are soluble, are located rather close to the surface of the river from the surface.  Therefore, water could pass through underground cavities to bypass the dam.  That is why it was decided to build a reservoir in the upper reaches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Most of this amazing reservoir created by human hands is surrounded by the state natural regional reserve ‚ÄúTsna‚Äù.  Here lives a colony of gray herons. </p>

    <h2>  Geographic data </h2><p>  On the north side of the reservoir is the village of Shalakhovo.  The height of the reservoir above sea level is one hundred sixteen meters.  Its length from west to east is almost 7.5 kilometers.  Width from one hundred fifty to one thousand three hundred meters.  The average depth is 4 meters.  But there are sections with a depth of 2 or 4.5 meters.  Shalakhovskoe reservoir is a valuable wetland.  Its shallow water and thickets of vegetation are a great habitat for many waterfowl: gray heron, osprey, white-tailed eagle, great spotted spotted eagle, <span>gray crane,</span> capercaillie, owl and woodpecker. </p><h2>  Places for rest </h2><p>  Today, many residents of surrounding villages come to the Shalakhovskoe Reservoir for the weekend.  Camping with tents on the shores of this artificial pond is a fairly common pastime.  In order to go to places convenient for an overnight stay and picnic, tourists have to overcome a large swampy moat.  However, judging by the reviews of those who come to the Shalakhovskoye reservoir with tents, one can quite expect privacy here, which is a nice reward for minor inconveniences.  You can swim in a pond, especially since the descent into the water is calm and gentle, and the bottom is sandy.  In general, judging by the reviews, the Shalakhovskoye reservoir is the place where everyone can spend their holidays, which they prefer.  In the autumn, its coastal forests are full of mushrooms and berries, in the summer you can go swimming and sunbathing, grilling kebabs, but in winter there is real winter fishing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For naturalists and photo hunters, a trip to the Shalakhovskoye reservoir will also be a great pleasure.  It is here that the most famous unique natural site in the Yegoryevsky district is located - a colony of gray herons.  These birds have chosen this pond for permanent residence.  They nest here and breed chicks.  Therefore, those who want to observe the beauties of gray herons should definitely go to the Shalakhovskoye reservoir in early May. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shalakhovskoe fishing reservoir reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2021524.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  Reviews of those who have long chosen this pond for fishing are only positive.  On the reservoir itself, fishing is mostly prohibited.  But on the large and complex complex of fish ponds with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãeight hundred and fifty hectares, located in the <span>floodplain of the</span> Tsna River, there is room for lovers of quiet hunting to turn around. </p><p>  Fishing attracts not only fishermen from the nearest settlements, but also residents of the capital who come here to sit with a fishing rod, and at the same time have a great rest.  The full-flowing rivers flowing into the Shalakhovskoe reservoir saturate its estuarine areas with a huge amount of oxygen and various fodder.  And this means that fishing in the Shalakhovsky reservoir, especially in the places where rivers flow into it, is very effective. </p><h2>  Fishing spots </h2><p>  A huge part of this reservoir is part of the State Nature Reserve, so we repeat, fishing is not allowed in these places.  Slightly higher in the floodplain of the Tsna River, several ponds have been created in which fish are artificially bred, primarily carp.  However, here you have to pay for fishing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shalakhovskoe reservoir reviews" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2023011.jpg" width="557"></div>

    <p>  The banks of the reservoir are quite indented.  There are several small swampy areas, as well as coves.  It is there that many species of waterfowl nest.  Therefore, fishing is not allowed there.  In general, for beginners, who first came to fishing on the Shakhovskoye reservoir, to find a place on the shore for fishing will be somewhat difficult.  Therefore, it is worthwhile to ask in advance where the most catchy and comfortable for fishing plots are located. </p><p>  Although fishing in most places is paid here, there are also areas where it is possible to fish for free, for example in dams isolated from each other and surrounded by mixed forests. </p><h2>  Catch </h2><p>  The most popular fishing on the Shalakhovsky reservoir is fishing on carp.  However, other types of fish live in the reservoir: crucian carp, pike, perch, bream, roach.  Judging by the reviews, here, although infrequently, there are individuals of carp weighing up to ten kilograms.  Crucian carp is also well caught in the reservoir, and in the season decent scammers often peck.  Since there are no significant depths in the reservoir, in the summer hot time it is heavily overgrown with all kinds of vegetation.  It is in such places that perch, roach, and rattan peck.  Therefore, the presence of a boat, even rubber, for fishing is desirable. </p><p>  As for the winter season, fishing here is not as successful as the summer.  Of course, you can return home with a bucket full of perch and roach, but for this you need to use the right gear.  A good nibble, judging by the reviews, is provided by a jig - with or without a nozzle. </p><p>  Quite often in the winter, a pike is pulled out onto the ventilator‚Äôs necklace.  Less often, but you can catch this toothy predator on a spinner or a balancer.  According to local residents, from time to time a scammer comes across the ice in the reservoir. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Catchy sites with good sandy beaches are located at a short distance from the holiday village.  However, in the summer season there are always a lot of vacationers creating noise.  And this, in turn, is fraught with significant inconvenience to fishing.  For calm and, most importantly, comfortable fishing, it is better to choose the south-west coast.  There you can easily get there by personal transport.  In places where there is abundant sedge thickets, a lot of predatory prey is usually hidden.  Here you can successfully catch pike and medium-sized perches. </p><p>  These are all the advantages of a pond.  Tourists distinguish its shortcomings as follows: </p><p>  - there is no good entrance; </p><p>  - no infrastructure; </p><p>  - paid fishing. </p><h2>  How and what to catch </h2><p>  Fishing on the Shalakhovskoye reservoir will end successfully if you pre-feed promising points.  Best of all, as evidenced by the reviews of experienced fans of quiet hunting, add corn to the bait mixture, after steaming the grain.  The catch would be good if you add the same oatmeal with maggot. </p><p>  Catfish is best caught on the Shalakhovsky reservoir on a wobbler, spinners and popper.  Since mainly small individuals weighing from one to one and a half kilograms peck here, it is better to use small nozzles of natural colors, as experienced fishers advise. </p><p>  On a perch, the most effective are a small wobbler and small jig baits, as well as a twister and a vibro-tail.  In some cases, the minke bite only on the earthworm. </p><p>  On carp, crucian carp, scavenger and roach from tackle the most commonly used feeder or float rod.  You can catch from the shore, and from the boat.  In paid fishing, the cost of fishing with one fishing rod per day will cost about five hundred rubles.  You can rent equipment right on the spot, so many people come to relax, and at the same time they catch fish. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shalakhovskoe Reservation with tents" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/2023711.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Shalakhovskoe reservoir: how to get there </h2><p>  You need to get to this artificial reservoir along the Yegoryevsky highway.  Having reached the village of Porykino, you should continue on your way.  After another hundred and twenty kilometers, you should turn left.  After seven kilometers there will be a barrier where you can buy a ticket for paid fishing on the shore of the reservoir.  To reach comfortable places for relaxation, you should overcome a swampy wide moat.  Such zones are sparsely populated, and the water is comfortable for swimming, as it quickly warms up in shallow water. </p>
