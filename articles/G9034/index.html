In Russia, sales started in November 2014.  The smartphone has good characteristics and affordable cost, but since many manufacturers are developing a niche of economy-class models, it has strong competitors.  What can boast Huawei Ascend G620S?  The review will tell in detail about its characteristics, pluses and minuses. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  You can expect that a cheap smartphone will look cheap, but here you will be pleasantly surprised.  The design of the Ascend G620S mobile phones is quite presentable, albeit not claiming originality. </p>

    <p>  The back cover is made of plastic with a texture under the skin.  Its significant disadvantage is the tangible subtlety and fragility. </p><p>  If you remove the cover, then this impression only intensifies, it is possible that it can break from frequent opening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei ascend g620s reviews" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1032194.jpg" width="580"></div>

You can also see the battery, but it cannot be removed without special skills and tools. </p><p>  The smartphone looks elegant because of its small thickness and metallized stripes around the screen, but it fits well in the hand thanks to the textured plastic and rounded edges.  Since it is quite large (14.3x7.2x0.85 cm, weight 160 g), the manufacturer reasonably shifted the physical buttons (volume and unlock) to the right end, where they are easy to get.  They protrude slightly above the case, they are easy to find without looking and difficult to mix. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone design" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1032195.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The Huawei Ascend G620S smartphone boasts a large 5-inch display, but its resolution is only 720 by 1280 (pixel density per inch - 294).  This means that the picture is not as clear as the more expensive models with the same screen size, however, it is quite bright and pleasant to use.  Users with small palms will have to get used to its size. </p><p>  The smartphone has good viewing angles, and if you increase the brightness level, then it is quite possible to use it in bright sunlight. </p><p>  The manufacturer still prefers to place the touch buttons on the panel below the screen, although it would be more ergonomic to allocate this space under the display. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone Huawei ascend g620s" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1032192.jpg" width="600"></div>

Its interesting feature is that it is not 32-bit, but 64-bit.  But in reality, this does not give significant advantages for two reasons: </p><ul><li>  the smartphone is already equipped with the outdated Android 4.4 KitKat OS, which is not optimized for 64-bit processors; </li><li>  1 GB of RAM is not enough to fully benefit from this. </li></ul><p>  Nevertheless, the performance of the smartphone in the tests is slightly higher than that of competitors. </p><p>  But with constant memory, things are worse.  The built-in volume is only 8 GB, a significant part of which (4.18 GB) is occupied by the OS.  And the possibilities for increasing it are unexpectedly small - the smartphone supports memory cards up to 32 GB in size. </p><p>  One of the main advantages of this model is its 4G support, which you rarely find in the budget segment. </p><p>  In addition to 4G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and NFC are available. </p><p>  The call quality of the smartphone is quite high.  The interlocutor is well audible, and two microphones successfully cope with the noise reduction function, that is, on the other side you are also well heard. </p><h2>  Interface and Performance </h2><p>  Since the model uses the very popular Android 4.4 OS, all the functions of the smartphone are intuitive and do not require long study and getting used to. </p><p>  Ascend G620S works pretty fast, flipping screens or navigating in the list of applications does not slow it down at all.  The same goes for single-launch programs.  But if you open several applications at the same time or the application is being installed in the background, then be prepared for freezes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For most of the necessary functions (contacts, SMS, music player, etc.), the manufacturer provides the buyer with pre-installed utilities.  But, since often they have less functionality or elements in Chinese, it is easier to replace them with applications downloaded from Google Play. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei ascend g620s review" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1032189.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The Ascend G620S has a small capacity battery - only 2000 mA.  This is less than that of competitors, but it shows itself quite well in tests and everyday life.  For example, after a day of active use (16 hours, several calls, half an hour of games, using applications for a long period), 19% of the charge remains.  So the smartphone will need charging only at night. </p><p>  In extreme cases, you can switch to Ultra Power Saving mode, which almost doubles the battery life, but at the same time blocks access to all functions except calls and SMS. </p><p>  There is also a utility utility that demonstrates which physical components or applications are currently actively consuming battery power. </p><p>  As mentioned above, those who like to carry a spare battery are not lucky, because the "native" battery can not be removed. </p><h2>  Photo and video </h2><p>  On paper, the cameras at the Huawei Ascend G620S are completely identical to those that can be found among competitors - the main 8 MP (with flash) and front 2 MP.  But often the pixels in the characteristics do not correspond to reality.  So, the iPhone 6 also has an 8 megapixel camera, but if you compare the pictures taken on it and on the G620S, the difference will be obvious. </p><p>  The photos are of medium quality, the colors are bright, but not quite accurate.  The flash strongly whitens the picture.  As a result, the result is slightly worse than not only competitors, but even one of Huawei smartphones - Honor 3C. </p><p>  The application for shooting is rich in various functions, ranging from HDR and the Panorama mode to various filters.  There is even an opportunity to put a watermark. </p><p>  To take a picture, just click on the shutter icon, just the screen or the volume button, which in this situation replaces the physical shutter button. </p><p>  The camera can shoot video in up to Full HD (1080 pixels) quality.  The result is quite suitable for viewing, however, the focus is often lost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei ascend g620s case" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1032186.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  What do customers think about the Huawei Ascend G620S? </h2><p>  Reviews are mostly positive, but without much enthusiasm.  The smartphone has high performance, which is enough for the average user. </p><p>  It has an attractive classic design.  True, the weight is quite substantial (160 g), and not in every pocket it can fit. </p><p>  Many were surprised at the use of the old version of Android. </p><p>  What do buyers say about the camera in the Huawei Ascend G620S?  Reviews were divided on this option.  Many users evaluate its real capabilities in no more than 5 megapixels and find that this is too little.  Others, on the contrary, note the affordable price of the device, and therefore do not expect image quality from it like a camera phone. </p><p>  Many buyers are faced with such a problem as the abundance of pre-installed applications in Chinese, which are difficult to remove.  An even more annoying surprise was that a smartphone ordered on the Internet came with settings in the language of the manufacturer.  Therefore, when buying, be sure to check whether the goods are completely Russified.  Otherwise, you will have to spend a lot of time solving this problem or pay extra to the specialist who will do it for you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone features" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1032209.jpg" width="519"></div>

    <h2>  Cash Issues </h2><p>  And how much is the Huawei Ascend G620S?  The price of a smartphone is gradually decreasing, because this is not the newest model.  So, in July 2015, a smartphone could be bought for almost 12 thousand rubles, and in November 2015 the average price was set at about 10.5 thousand rubles.  This is a fairly popular model, so many electronics stores offer it at competitive prices.  You can also easily find accessories and accessories for the Huawei Ascend G620S.  A cover for it will cost about 700-800 rubles, a protective film - 500-700 rubles, and shockproof glass - from 700 rubles. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Huawei Ascend G620S could be considered a very good budget smartphone, if not for the increasing competition in this segment.  The Moto G, Sony Xperia M2 Aqua, or Microsoft <span>Lumia 640</span> pose a serious challenge to him, to which he cannot always answer, whether it be a camera, build quality or screen size.  Compared to competitors, he loses his attractiveness somewhat, but still remains a good ‚Äúworkhorse‚Äù.  If you are not interested in a unique design, the latest OS version and impressive multitasking, Ascend G620S can offer you a lot at a modest price. </p>
