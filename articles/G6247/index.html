    <p>  The cost of living at the hotel is quite affordable.  Therefore, luxurious conditions should not be expected.  Nevertheless, Aiyara Grand Hotel 4 * (Pattaya, Thailand) is a worthy option for living in Pattaya. </p><p>  The hotel benefits from its prime location.  The center with local transport can be reached in just ten minutes.  You can also easily get to Jomtien.  Aiyara Grand Hotel 4 * is located in Pratamnak (Pattaya area).  Unlike the center, it does not stink and is not so noisy. </p><h2>  Accommodation </h2><p>  Check in at the hotel in no time.  The only thing that can interfere is the language barrier.  In Thailand, almost no hotel speaks Russian, but they speak English quite well.  Upon check-in, a deposit of $ 100 is required, which is returned upon eviction. </p><p>  Aiyara Grand Hotel offers spacious, clean rooms with great views.  All apartments are freshly renovated with a stylish interior design.  For a nominal fee, employees can bring luggage to their rooms. </p>

    <p>  The path to the sea takes only ten minutes on foot.  Despite the fact that the hotel provides a free shuttle service to the beach (every day, at 10 a.m.), many tourists prefer to walk to it on their own.  After a hearty breakfast, such a walk is what you need! </p><p>  The beach closest to the hotel is Pattaya Park.  It is very clean both on land and in water.  The beach is equipped with sun loungers, umbrellas and other amenities.  In Thailand, it is very hot, so not everyone likes to fry in the scorching sun.  Pools in the hotel in this case are very helpful.  Moreover, they are filled with sea water, as well as equipped with sunbeds. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2>

    <p>  The food at the hotel is excellent.  Many vacationers remember this unique taste for years.  Depending on the choice of tour, various food options are offered. </p><p>  The service in the restaurant is very good.  The staff treats customers with special courtesy and helpfulness.  But some points can still confuse.  Thailand is almost always flooded with the Chinese.  Aiyara Grand Hotel also has a lot of them.  In the restaurant they create a lot of noise, and it is not very pleasant to eat in such an atmosphere.  Moreover, the Chinese are simply not indifferent to our brother, constantly striving to be photographed. </p><p>  The food was especially delicious for breakfast.  Such an abundance of exotic fruits is rarely seen.  In the assortment there are always watermelons, melons, papaya and pineapples.  They offer a huge number of dishes.  Over the entire period of rest, few have managed to try each of them. </p><p>  You can also enjoy delicious meals outside the hotel.  It is better to choose those institutions that visit local.  Food is equally tasty everywhere, but in cafes and restaurants designed for tourists, prices are much higher.  Within walking distance from the hotel there is a small cozy cafe.  It is located on a Russian street, on the way to the sea, behind the market.  It serves delicious food for ridiculous money. </p><h2>  Interesting places near the hotel </h2><p>  Near the complex there are shops of world brands, currency exchangers and cafes.  By local transport, tuk-tuk can reach the center. </p><p>  Within walking distance there is a market with an abundance of cheap fruits and souvenirs.  In the evening you can buy clothes here. </p><p>  Everywhere they sell delicious local beer, which costs several times cheaper than in Russia. </p><p>  Also close to the complex is a Russian street with numerous cafes, restaurants and markets. </p><p>  Opposite the hotel entrance there is a salon where you can get a great massage. </p><p>  It is best to change the currency in the cafe "Parrot", which is located on Russian street.  There is the most profitable course. </p><h2>  Walking around </h2><p>  Not far from the hotel rises a mountain on which the golden Buddha majestically sits.  This place is within walking distance.  There is an amazing atmosphere of peace and tranquility.  The soul immediately becomes good. </p><p>  It is also worth a visit to the island of monkeys.  These funny animals charge positively. </p><p>  As a rule, a tour includes a sightseeing tour and a trip to a crocodile farm and a rock garden.  For a fee, you should go to <span>the Erawan waterfall</span> or for a walk on the Madagascar sea.  It is simply impossible to <span>see</span> all the <span>sights of Pattaya</span> within the framework of one tour. </p><p>  There are many temple complexes in Thailand.  Many tourists say that after their visit, life completely changes.  It is filled with meaning, and it becomes easier to cope with numerous life difficulties. </p><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Many vacationers of the shortcomings note the huge number of Chinese people living in the hotel.  Special buses are designed for them, which bring them in the evening for the night, and in the morning take them on excursions.  Buses, however, like the Chinese themselves, create a lot of noise.  Tourists strongly recommend that you arrive on time for breakfast, otherwise after your Chinese brother there may be nothing left and you will have to wait until a new meal is prepared.  For the Chinese, the Russian tourist is exotic, so they are trying in every possible way to establish a relationship with him, or at least take a picture. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2>

    <p>  Overall, the Aiyara Grand Hotel deserves four stars.  It is clean and comfortable.  The excellent location of the complex helps to choose it again and again.  Within walking distance are all objects of tourist infrastructure (beach, shops, cafes, restaurants, market).  The food at the hotel is excellent.  The food is hearty, varied and very tasty.  There are a lot of interesting places nearby. </p>
