However, not all of us managed to acquire televisions with built-in digital receivers.  There are two ways to solve this problem: buy a new and modern TV or install a small DVB-T2 receiver in your home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dvb t2 receiver" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1788821.jpg" width="499"></div>  The second option is the most profitable and acceptable, because the receivers cost an order of magnitude less than the new "TV box".  However, some difficulties may arise here, if you do not know what to focus on at the time of purchase.

    <h2>  DVB-T2 receivers </h2><p>  Today, TV towers, both analog and digital, broadcast in the same range.  Therefore, to receive high-definition video channels, there is no need to install a new antenna - ordinary decimeter ‚Äúhorns‚Äù, which we all have for sure, are suitable. </p><p>  It must also be remembered that not all TVs are capable of ‚Äúreproducing‚Äù a digital signal.  Of course, by connecting the DVB-T2 receiver to an old "TV box", you can watch your favorite channels, but you will not notice differences in image quality. </p><p>  Modern digital receivers are small-sized devices that look very similar to DVD players.  Most models have the simplest liquid crystal display on the front panel, control buttons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the back wall of such a device are connectors for connecting to the antenna and to the TV, additional slots for flash cards, adapters and other devices, as well as a power switch.  Choosing a DVB-T2 receiver, you need to focus on the rear panel. </p><h2>  Receiver Characteristics </h2><p>  The first important characteristic of a digital receiver is the supported video resolution.  This setting should match the resolution of your TV.  So, if the screen only supports SDTV, then there is simply no need to buy a set-top box that supports high-definition HD video - the TV will still broadcast as before.  The same goes for the built-in 3D function. </p><p>  The presence of the necessary connectors for connecting the console to the TV is the second most important parameter.  In the vast majority of equipment, an RCA cable, or ‚Äútulips,‚Äù is used to connect.  Some DVB-T2 terrestrial receivers use SCART cables along with RCA ports. </p><p>  In addition, you can use one of the built-in interfaces to connect to a TV.  As a rule, an HDMI port is very often used as such.  The presence of all the above connectors allows you to connect two TVs to the same receiver at the same time. </p><h2>  Integrated Interfaces </h2><p>  On the market, you can often find equipment with a built-in USB interface, thanks to which you can connect a flash drive, a phone and, in some cases, even a laptop to the receiver.  However, such a DVB-T2 receiver is slightly more expensive than a typical installation.  Most often, the described features are used to record TV shows on a flash card or to play audio and video files stored on a flash drive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The built-in CI slot for connecting a conditional access card, which allows you to view paid channels, has a significant impact on the price.  Today, almost all channels broadcast on the territory of Russia are free, but in the future such an opportunity may turn out to be very useful. </p><h2>  Additional functions </h2><p>  The receiver may have a large number of built-in functions that owners are not even aware of.  The most popular is the ability to ‚Äústop time‚Äù - TimeShift.  But such an opportunity is just a trick that makes the DVB-T2 digital TV receiver more expensive. </p><p>  The fact is that such a function is available only for <span>satellite receivers.</span>  In ‚Äúantenna‚Äù devices, when the ‚Äútime is stopped‚Äù, a screenshot is taken and the sound is turned off, but the transmission itself continues to go. </p><p>  Another popular feature is the TV guide, which allows you to view the program guide, works slightly better.  Its functionality depends on the specific channel.  Setting a timer to automatically enable or disable the channel are the only additional functions that work flawlessly. </p><h2>  Connecting the console to the TV </h2><p>  There are two ways to connect a <span>digital set-top box</span> .  If your antenna has a ready-made coaxial cable, then simply insert it into the DVB-T2 digital TV receiver, and then proceed with setting up the channels.  In some cases, you have to buy a coaxial cable yourself, especially if your antenna has a built-in amplifier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dvb t2 television receiver" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1788832.jpg" width="600"></div>  In this case, you will also need a f-type screw connector.  To install it on a cable, it is necessary to cut off the insulation layer, distribute the metal foil and mesh along the contour and get to the copper core.  Then you can screw the connector into the receiver.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are many more ways to connect the TV to the console.  You can use tulips, RCA, SCART or HDMI cables.  There will be no difficulties here.  After combining the devices, it remains only to configure the DVB-T2 digital receiver in the same way as the channel search on the TV is configured. </p><h2>  Budget models </h2><p>  The cost of budget models is in the range of 1-2 thousand rubles.  Their functionality is enough for comfortable viewing of TV shows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="digital dvb t2 receiver" class="if" height="213" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1788830.jpg" width="600"></div>  The VVK SMP240HDT2 receiver opens to our list for up to 1.5 thousand rubles.  There is a built-in USB interface, which makes it possible to record TV programs and view media files.  The HDMI connector can be used to connect a TV with an HD screen.  Among the minuses, a bad reaction to the remote control and the coincidence of commands with the signals of the TV remote control should be noted. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dvb t2 receiver" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1788823.jpg" width="600"></div>  The D-COLOR DC1302 has all the same built-in functions as the previous representative.  But this DVB-T2 digital receiver is more loyal to the user - it responds better to remote control commands.  Buyers also noted a stylish metal case with plastic inserts.  Among the minuses is the belated channel switching.

    <p>  The <span>Oriel 963</span> receiver is less functional than previous representatives - there is no HDMI.  Users especially liked the simple setup of channels - it can be done in just a couple of clicks.  But the menu is not too convenient and understandable - you have to deal with it. </p><h2>  Special representatives </h2><p>  These consoles presented below can be called special for some additional features that are not available in the already described models.  In addition, the cost of these devices also does not exceed 2 thousand rubles. </p><p>  SUPRA SDT-94 is a digital DVB-T2 receiver with support for HD resolution and a USB interface for viewing data from flash cards.  Separately, users noted a good reception of signals, regardless of the type of antenna connected, as well as a simple channel search.  A special feature is the parental control function, which blocks certain channels until a password is entered.  The main minus is a decrease in image quality when connected via a composite output. </p>

    <p>  A more original model is the Rolsen RDB-532.  The receiver is compact in size and low in power consumption, which allows it to be used as a portable or <span>car receiver.</span>  To do this, you just need to buy a power cord.  It does not have an HDMI connector, but the ability to view multimedia is preserved.  <span>This</span> DVB-T2 television <span>receiver</span> has no complaints from users.  Its functionality is fully consistent with the price. </p><h2>  SMART receivers </h2><p>  This group of devices is the most expensive.  However, they are more functional and able to access the Internet, and also have a number of other features. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="broadcast dvb t2 receivers" class="if" height="271" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1788825.jpg" width="600"></div>  The Dune HD Solo 4K receiver, in addition to watching TV channels directly from the Internet in 4K format, playing multimedia, recording video, accessing the global network, a convenient menu and the functions already described by other models, can be used as a wireless access point to the Wi-Fi network. Fi  At the same time providing high speed simultaneously multiple users.  Of the minuses, a high price should be noted - about 24 thousand rubles.

But it costs 4 times less than the previous representative.  In addition to viewing Internet resources, playing multimedia, the device can be used to make video calls, you just need to buy a webcam.  In addition to the receiver, you can connect a mouse and keyboard.  Among the minuses is a rather long loading of channels.
