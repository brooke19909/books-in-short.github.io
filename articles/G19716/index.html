Nokia: specifications, photos, instructions, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  New, ever more powerful and high-tech mobile phones are constantly appearing.  Over time, they acquire more and more functions, become elegant, attractive in appearance, provide us with new opportunities for communication and Internet use.  Each of these smartphones, despite its compact size, copes with a huge number of tasks and becomes a real multimedia center.  Of course, devices of this kind are in great demand, and users automatically switch to them, encouraging developers to release new models of the same. </p><p>  However, many are in no hurry to chase another smartphone.  And the reason for this is not always the cost of powerful functional devices.  Often people consciously choose to work with older, but time-tested devices that do not fail at the right time (as new models do).  Often such devices are equipped with buttons, which also to some extent affects the user's choice.  After all, not everyone is accustomed to the touch panel as the main control element (especially for older people). </p><p>  In this article, we will just discuss such a device.  This is the legendary 6300 Nokia.  Many of us remember how we used this phone several years ago and, by the way, were pleased with its capabilities.  So let's ponastalgiruyte for those times and do a review on this model. </p><h2>  Release and positioning </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To begin with, we note that the device debuted back in 2007 - it was then that it saw the light of day.  Undoubtedly, at the time of its release, this was a high-tech solution on the market - they simply did not produce such devices.  And, undoubtedly, the Finnish manufacturer did not fail with its Nokia 6300 - the phone was bought up in huge numbers;  and his fame as a reliable and easy-to-use device has been preserved in the memory of users to this day. </p><p>  The phone was originally presented as a stable business-class device: everything indicated this, from the appearance to the hardware component.  The model was really conceived as a solution for successful, young and innovative customers;  but it came out as a replacement for another version - 6030. The line on the described device did not stop - the Finns continued to produce other modifications.  However, Nokia 6300 was able to make the most successful and attractive from the point of view of the buyer.  This is proved by many facts: they don‚Äôt just talk a lot about the phone, private companies have even begun issuing various additions to the model, such as a gilded case, for example. </p><p>  You can also mention the numerous copies of the phone, which even today are popular on Chinese electronics sites.  They are also in demand in domestic online stores among people who need an inexpensive, but reliable handset.  Attractive style comes as a welcome bonus. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  Speaking of appearance: this is one of the strengths of the device.  You can understand this by looking at least at the photos containing Nokia 6300.  We see on them a stylish device, assembled from metal and plastic, which fits comfortably in the hand, is pleasant to the touch, looks wonderful and combines with both the style of a fragile girl and the officialdom of a mature man.  Due to this, the device can be considered a universal product for those who are looking for a dialer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Visually, the device consists of two parts - the upper (where the screen is) and the lower (with keys).  Each of these zones is surrounded by borders with rounded edges;  due to this, a favorable appearance of the phone is created, its attractive design.  An addition is the glass navigation and call control buttons located near the joystick.  This is the most convex part that the <span>Nokia</span> 6300 has. </p><p>  The back panel is designed in a single concept with the rest of the device.  It is also a metal cover, interspersed with a dark plastic edge, on which the camera and the developer‚Äôs logo are placed.  On the sides you can also watch the navigation buttons (rocker for increasing and decreasing the sound).  You can also see the line between the two plates that make up the model body.  Due to her 6300 Nokia seems even more interesting, even from the side. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Of course, at the time of the device‚Äôs release, there were still no mass-sensitive IPS-based touch displays capable of transmitting colorful images in a quality manner.  Then, on the 6300 model, Nokia installed a TFT screen.  Of course, it is suitable for a keyboard device, since without a sensor there is no need to make a large screen.  However, of course, in practice it will not be difficult to discern the effect of granularity when viewed closely. </p>

    <p>  As the specifications describing the Nokia 6300 are noted, the model has a display with a resolution of 240 by 320 pixels (which, compared to modern models, looks like a joke. However, the gadget can transmit up to 16 million different colors. This is more than enough for the tasks that the user sets this kind of apparatus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  According to the specifications describing the Nokia 6300 phone, the device has an 860 mAh battery.  Of course, today it is a very small amount for an average smartphone;  However, do not forget about the level of charge consumption by our object of review.  Indeed, on a TFT-display, in the absence of various additional modules in the form of a powerful processor or support for LTE-connection, the phone consumes significantly less energy. </p><p>  This means that with the modest capabilities of its battery, the Nokia 6300 (reviews can confirm this information) is able to work more than 340 hours in standby time.  This means that you will not charge the device more often than once every 4-6 days (depending on the intensity of use).  It is worth comparing this parameter with Android gadgets that need daily recharges. </p><p>  Here is one of the main factors indicating that we are dealing with a classic dialer, which will last a long time. </p>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  You should also not expect that the device has as its basis some kind of processor that meets modern requirements, capable of high performance and a wide range of functions.  No, as of 2007, the device‚Äôs capabilities were truly amazing.  But, alas, it does not have an operating system (in our modern sense).  All the tasks that can be performed by the phone come down to a simple set of rules and functions like a call and a message.  For this reason, we called the gadget a dialer. </p><p>  Its peculiarity can only be called camera control and the ability to create pictures;  the presence of a player, as well as support for memory cards.  However, more on that later. </p><h2>  Interface </h2>

    <p>  You may ask, what is the control of a telephone that operates without an operating system on?  What is the very graphic core of the device?  We answer - this is the third generation Series 40 platform, which has been widely used on similar versions of devices. </p><p>  On the screen, the user saw a tiled menu consisting of icons of different applications.  Navigation between them is carried out using a horizontal joystick (button type).  Therefore, the device worked on the same principle as today we observe in touch models.  Probably, he was borrowed by the developers of modern smartphones as the most optimal and convenient. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Whoever found the time when the Nokia 6300 mobile phone we described was at the peak of popularity, knows that playing audio files was fraught with some problems.  In particular, many devices could not play mp3-format, forcing users to be content with wave-files.  The sound quality, of course, was lower, but such tracks also occupied an order of magnitude less space on the phone. </p><p>  Our 6300 model even supported clear-sound mp3 sound.  Moreover, the phone provided for the possibility of installing such a track as a ringtone, which was also considered something unique in its kind.  Due to this, Nokia gained more and more fans who refused to work with similar Samsung, Siemens and Sony Erricson. </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The amount of space available for downloading data on the described device may also surprise those who have not seen the world before the advent of modern smartphones.  As indicated by the instructions that came with the Nokia 6300, only 9 megabytes of internal memory is available here.  Compare modern gadgets with 2, 4, 8, 16 GB and so on, of course, this volume is impossible. </p><p>  But then developers already provided for the possibility of using memory cards.  As today, they were inserted into a separate slot and, after minor manipulations in the settings, could become an alternative source for reading data (or, conversely, downloading them).  The connected memory card solved the problem of lack of space for the same music files. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2>

    <p>  A modern smartphone user will ask: what about the Internet?  What connection format did the gadget described in the article use?  And what were the features of using such a connection? </p><p>  It should be clarified that as of 2007 in Russia there was no 3G or LTE connection.  Therefore, the need for such devices was simply absent, people did not know that technology could step so far in the near future. </p><p>  Therefore, a slower WAP Internet could be considered as a replacement.  With it, you could go to various mobile directories and download, for example, a picture for your desktop, set a ringtone or even download a small game.  WAP traffic was quite expensive for many mobile service providers, so a lot of downloading using the device, so no one could.  So, if you had a desire, you could go in and upload a couple of images, then to tune your device. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Nokia 6300 differs from simple ‚Äúdialers‚Äù at least by the availability of tools for creating photos and videos.  The resolution of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã2 megapixels.  Of course, it‚Äôs not worth comparing, again, with the images of modern gadgets what happened on the 6300 model - then the mobile device did not have so many new functions and various filters, image stabilization systems, autofocus and other things.  Then the photos from the phone came out really terrible, and you could not always figure out what was shown on them.  However, then people still did not come up with a selfie, so the camera was not so important. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Recommendations on how this phone behaves, the sea has remained on the Internet.  Thousands of people share with others their impressions of working with him, noting the positive and negative sides of it.  We also studied these reviews to understand who liked what or not.  We publish some of them here. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Let's start with the bad, and then finish the review on a positive note.  So, let's start with the functional limitations of the device.  Now we are subconsciously comparing it with other smartphones that have (relatively) simply fantastic features.  Therefore, people write that the phone has few functions, a weak screen, a bad camera, and so on.  Yes, this is all true, but at the time of the release of the device, all these elements were the best of what is available on the market. </p><p>  Some complain about the instability of Nokia 6300. The phone screen does not turn on, or not all the device does not respond to user commands.  The problem is expressed in different ways, but there is only one result - the user simply can‚Äôt do anything with his device.  We also have one piece of advice for those who are looking for why the Nokia 6300 does not turn on.  What to do if there is some kind of error in the device?  That's right, consult a specialist and solve it.  You can do this at any service center where they will tell you exactly why your phone has stopped working.  We do not recommend doing it in the form of disassembling the case and replacing parts on your own. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Against the background of the mentioned negative aspects (the possibility of failure, weak parameters), there are many ‚Äúpluses‚Äù of this model.  This, for example, is a stylish design (judging by the reviews, many really like it);  simplicity (many are lost in the huge menu of Android devices; in the case of the 6300, everything is extremely simple);  reliability (statistics on the use of keyboard phones like Nokia, which break less often than touch smartphones). </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Therefore, what can I say, the Nokia 6300 is a world-famous, very popular mobile phone, which continues to be in demand today.  What else is needed to prove that it is worth attention and justifies all the means to purchase it?  This is a really cool machine that (in a sense) is timeless. </p>
