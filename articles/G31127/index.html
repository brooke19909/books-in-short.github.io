Most of the ridges, river valleys, slopes, and small hills formed under the influence of glacial channels.  In these places, the bulk of the vast lowland zones of Pripechorye are covered with ice sheets.

This is a large flat terrain, the foundation of which is laid out by Permian sediments, on top of the overlapped ice layers.  The heights (marked absolute) here do not exceed 175 meters.  The central sections of this region are swampy. </p><p>  2. The Predgorny district (along the other hilly) is located on the western territory of the Ural section and extends to the very base of the Main Ural Range.  It is represented in the west by the transitional Artinsky Plain and 2 large ridges of hills.  Moreover, Western (B. Parma) has a height above ur.  the sea is approximately 437 meters. </p><p>  3. The mountainous region is represented by 4 systems of ranges in the northern part of the Urals.  Among them are the highest: Koip (height 1087.5 meters), Bear Stone, and Kozhimiz (height 1195.4 meters). </p><h2>  Pechora River (RF): characteristic </h2><p>  The Pechora River is the largest and largest in the European North.  Its source is located in the reserve.  These are 2 streams that merge together between 2 mountain peaks: Caves-Talah-Chahl and Engile-Chahl (with a height of 896.8 m.). </p><p>  The entire length of the river is 1809 kilometers, and the catchment part has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 320 thousand square meters.  km  The waters of Pechora flow into the Pechora Bay, from where they flow into the Barents Sea.  Pechora is the most powerful and largest river located in the <span>North of the European</span> part of Russia.  Every year it replenishes the sea with approximately 130 cubic kilometers of fresh water.  And this is 2 times less than the volume of water brought by the Volga, but 1.5 times more than the annual flow of water from <span>the Dnieper</span> and Don rivers in general.  The Pechora basin accommodates a total of 35 thousand rivers and streams and more than 61 thousand lakes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The longest river of the basin is very popular for Usa rafting.  Its length is 500 km. </p><p>  Pechora is usually divided into the Upper Zone, Middle and Lower.  Pechora Upper extends from the source to the mouth of the river.  Hairmaids. </p><h2>  Landscapes of the territory </h2><p>  The natural landscapes of the Upper Pechora Valley are peculiar.  Attractions are found all along its course.  The river flows between the ridges of the <span>Ural Mountains,</span> where the mountain waters of the Upper, Wed.  and N. Klyuchikov, Yurginskaya, Schegolikhinskaya and other rivers.  After the confluence of the Mannaya Volosnitsa, the river changes sharply to the west.  In the mountainous part, the river flows into the river.  Malaya Porozhnaya. </p><p>  Then, at the Bear Stone (mountain), after passing a long powerful threshold, Pechora flows to the foothill site.  The section of the channel from the mouth of B. Porozhnaya to the highest Parma has a width of about 150 meters and is flat aground, mostly lined with pebbles rather large, which makes it very difficult to travel in boats. </p><p>  Interesting in terms of landscape is this section of Pechora.  Natural sights here are presented in the form of small islands, in connection with which the river is divided into several branches.  Below the confluence of the B. Shezhima River, relatively quiet reaches with small rare rifts are quite common.  And the number of islands decreases further, but in size they increase. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pechora sights" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1086610.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Further expansion of the channel and the disappearance of the shallow are observed, and just below the mouth of B. Shaitanovka Pechora already represents steep and large bends.  On the border of the reserve (western) on the banks, one can often observe large outcrops of limestone (especially at the mouth of the B. Shezhim river). </p><h2>  Tributaries of Pechora </h2><p>  Almost all of its largest right tributaries flow from the Urals (from the peaks of Ilych, Sugor, Podcherie and Usa).  On the hills of the Bolshezemelsky ridge have the origins of Lai, Shapkin and Kolva.  Northern Mylva, Tansy, Izhma, Sula and Tsilma (the left tributaries of Pechora) originate on the Timan Ridge, and Unya - in the mountains of the Ural Range Silver Belt.  The rivers Kozhva, Ski, Lemu and Velha flow from the Lemyu Upland. </p><p>  It is unique not only for its position and the peculiar landscapes of Pechora.  The geographic map used to be in the river basin area and had marks that represented these territories as places for furs and hunting birds.  The largest of the upper <span>tributaries of the river</span> - Ilych, has a length of 393 km. </p><h2>  Feature of the Upper Pechora is interesting </h2><p>  What else can provide the curious and interesting for the romantic tourists of Pechora?  The sights of these places can be seen at the very sources of this river.  The first jets of water come from a very small spring, making its way between the stones on a mountain called Pecher-Ya-Taglyah-Syakhl, which is translated from the Mansi language as ‚Äúthe mountain that gave birth to Pechora‚Äù. </p>

Also in these places you can see dwarf birch trees with their curved trunks and numerous screes of stones.  The neighboring mountain is famous for the stone remains of Manpupuner.  A little further rise the green majestic peaks of the Silver Belt.

    <p>  One more curious fact should be noted: once a helicopter landed on Mount Pecher-Ya-Talakh-Syakhl, from which an unusual plate made of cast iron was unloaded, and on it - information about Pechora.  Here is such a rare honor granted to this river. </p><h2>  In conclusion about the Upper Pechora </h2>

Here, the drop in water level over one kilometer averages about 3 meters.  The vegetation of these places is mainly represented by pine trees interspersed with birch, fir and spruce.  The upper course, by the nature of its course, is mainly represented by rocky rapids, followed by small rifts.
