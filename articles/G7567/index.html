Then you came to the address!  In our article you will find not only a detailed description of the advantages and disadvantages of each type of battery, but also an overview of products from popular manufacturers.  In addition, we will also give our readers some recommendations for choosing the best batteries - long-lasting and high-quality. </p><h2>  Salt, alkaline (alkaline) or lithium? </h2><p>  Many people wonder, "Which batteries are better: alkaline or alkaline?"  If you are one of them, then we hasten to disappoint you, because the question is posed incorrectly.  These are two names for the same kind of power source.  Although it is not surprising that most people do not know this.  However, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the basic theoretical information on this subject by examining the list below. </p><ol><li>  Salt batteries.  The cheapest and most primitive variety of chargers.  Inside such elements there are electrodes made of zinc and manganese oxide.  They are interconnected by a special bridge through which current is supplied.  However, it is precisely because of this that the old models simply "flowed" among many users.  To date, such a scenario is extremely rare. </li><li>  Alkaline or alkaline batteries.  The most common type of charger, which is actively used in almost all devices that require a battery.  The latter have a fairly good capacity, as well as a long shelf life.  In addition, the process of their production is not particularly difficult, so they are relatively inexpensive. </li><li>  Lithium  The newest variety of chargers, which include a lithium cathode and anode (made of different materials).  Between these two elements is a diaphragm and a separator impregnated with organic electricity.  Due to the complex design, the energy consumption of the battery is very large, however, this same feature leads to the high cost of the batteries. </li></ol><p>  Thus, if you decide to choose the best finger batteries, then you should first consider their variety.  You can find out about it by consulting with a sales assistant or by carefully studying the packaging with the charging element.  For example, on batteries containing lithium, the English-language inscription ‚ÄúLithium‚Äù will be present.  Well, professionals can determine the type of charger by weight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Duracell Turbo Max (rating: 4.9) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.fiyatkarsilastirma.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Duracell Turbo Max Batteries" class="if uuid-3245641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3245641.jpg"></div><p>  To figure out which batteries are better, you need to carefully examine models from different manufacturers that are most popular.  You should start with one of the most famous companies, whose products occupy a significant part of the market.  Duracell Turbo Max is sold in packs of 2, 4, 8 and 12 pieces.  A distinctive feature of batteries is that they have a charge indicator (a special strip). </p><p>  The manufacturer assures its customers that the Duracell Turbo Max is able to work 70% longer than ordinary batteries.  However, studies conducted by an independent company revealed that this indicator was overstated by 54%.  However, it should be noted that the power source is able to cope with a huge amount of work.  The battery charge was enough to take 253 pictures with a digital camera in high quality format. </p><p>  Are there any disadvantages of the Duracell Turbo Max?  Despite the high rating, there are plenty of them.  Most customers are extremely unhappy that the company overprices its products.  In addition, the power supply has a very low short circuit protection rating.  Well and most importantly - the release of this series was discontinued some time ago.  However, to date, Duracell Turbo Max are the best alkaline batteries.  It's hard to argue with that. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sony Alkaline STAMINA Platinum (rating: 4.8) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cochces.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Alkaline STAMINA Platinum." class="if uuid-3245642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3245642.jpg"></div><p>  Thinking about which alkaline batteries are better?  Then you should definitely pay attention to another option, which usually comes in packages with four power supplies.  If you believe the manufacturer, the product is able to work almost 50% longer than analogues from competitors.  Although in reality this figure is overstated by 40% (when compared with batteries in the same price range). </p><p>  But at the expense of shelf life, Sony did not lie.  Batteries are really capable of working even 10 years after release (if a person complies with all storage recommendations).  However, if the battery will be in some device all the time, then its service life will be reduced by almost 5 times.  But the products have good leakage protection, so you can not be afraid to use batteries in expensive electronics. </p><p>  But a significant drawback of Sony Alkaline STAMINA Platinum is that the batteries are practically not common in the Russian Federation.  Most likely you will be able to find them only in a limited number and only in specialized stores.  In addition, batteries will cost a tidy amount.  So if you think which alkaline batteries are better, then you better give preference to the previous model.  It will come out much cheaper. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Energizer Ultimate Lithium (Rating: 5.0) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="universityleadershipinitiative.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Energizer Ultimate Lithium Batteries." class="if uuid-3245643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3245643.jpg"></div><p>  If you would ask us which batteries are better, then we would answer: Energizer Ultimate Lithium.  This product has tremendous durability (almost 20 years) due to the fact that it has almost no self-loading.  This feature is explained by the fact that lithium technology is used inside, the advantages of which you already know.  Because of this, the capacity and energy density of the battery remain stably high even after a while. </p><p>  It is strongly recommended to use Energizer Ultimate Lithium only in those devices that have a high level of energy consumption - only in this case you will notice that the battery life is 4 times longer than other products.  But if you insert the devices into the remote control or the watch, you will not see much difference, since the battery will stop saving energy and will be discharged even faster than the alkaline analogue. </p><p>  A significant drawback of products from Energizer is that the manufacturer requires a huge amount for it.  This is especially true for Ultimate Lithium batteries (a pack of 4 will cost about 450 rubles).  Therefore, it makes sense to buy a battery only if you are going to often use a camera or a wireless microphone.  Otherwise, ordinary alkaline batteries will suffice. </p><h2>  VARTA Professional Lithium (rating: 4.9) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="test.gtest.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Batteries &quot;Warta&quot; at a discount." class="if uuid-3245645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3245645.jpg"></div><p>  Now you know about the best alkaline batteries.  However, if you decide to keep up with the times and use only high-tech power sources, we recommend that you also familiarize yourself with another variety of batteries, which include lithium.  Despite the fact that VARTA products are very popular in our country, you can find these batteries only in supermarkets. </p><p>  According to independent tests, the device in which such a battery is located is capable of operating without recharging for 3 hours at maximum power.  Compared with the previous option, this indicator is less than just 20 minutes.  But in a moderate mode of operation, the power source will prove to be much more efficient.  So if you need to buy batteries in the remote control that you don‚Äôt have to change often, then the choice is obvious. </p><p>  As with other lithium batteries, this variety is quite expensive, so not everyone can afford it.  In addition, it should be noted that the release of VARTA Professional Lithium was discontinued several years ago.  So today on the shelves you can find batteries that are getting closer and faster to the date when they become worthless.  However, there is no reason to doubt the effectiveness of the products from this company. </p><h2>  Camelion Super Heavy Duty (Rating: 4.7) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.webncomp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Batteries from Camelion." class="if uuid-3245646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3245646.jpg"></div><p>  Now you know which battery is better: saline or alkaline.  However, we could not consider several budget options, because it is these batteries that are most popular.  And the thing is that most people use them in technology that does not require a constant power source (remotes, plush toys, scales, and so on).  What is the point of overpaying if it is easier to discard the battery and insert a new one? </p><p>  In some cases, this approach is justified.  For example, if you buy Camelion Super Heavy Duty - some of the best salt batteries that are very popular.  The reason is their rather high power, as well as a long service life.  In addition, packaging batteries (4 pieces) will cost only 100 rubles.  When used properly, the charge will last for about half an hour of continuous operation. </p><p>  However, do not forget about the most important drawback of salt batteries, which is also characteristic of the Camelion Super Heavy Duty - low durability.  Of course, most manufacturers are trying to deal with this problem, but chemicals still pretty quickly disable the charger.  If you believe the statements of the Camelion Company, the shelf life of their product is no more than 3 years. </p><h2>  GP GreenCell 15G (rating 4.9) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ukdapper.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="GP GreenCell 15G batteries." class="if uuid-3245647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3245647.jpg"></div><p>  One of the best batteries that contain salt.  GP lithium batteries are well-known to many customers, however, the company decided not to change traditions and released classic power supplies with an expiration date of 3 years.  The main advantage of batteries over the products of competing companies is their power.  GP GreenCell 15G batteries last about 50 minutes with maximum load. </p><p>  A few words about the configuration and cost of this product.  As a rule, most consumers prefer to buy packages that contain 2 batteries.  Such a pack will cost 70 rubles.  However, on sale you can also find equipment at once for 4 or even 8 pieces.  The first will cost about 130 rubles, and the second - about 250 rubles.  Prices may seem rather high, but it is difficult to argue with the quality of this product. </p><p>  The main advantage of GP GreenCell 15G is that they work equally effectively on almost any kind of device.  You can easily insert the battery into the microphone, camera or remote control from the TV - the efficiency will be approximately the same.  Although you should not forget that salt batteries are very short-lived.  Some users note that GP batteries started to ‚Äúleak‚Äù after 2 years of service. </p><h2>  Panasonic Eneloop Pro (Rating: 4.8) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.batteryjunction.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Batteries Panasonic Eneloop Pro." class="if uuid-3245649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3245649.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, each battery can be called a small battery, but not all power sources can be recharged.  For example, salt batteries will simply ‚Äúmelt‚Äù from energy overload, as a result of which they will stop working.  But still there is a special kind of power sources that are very durable and can be charged using a special charger. </p><p>  One of the best rechargeable batteries is the Panasonic Eneloop Pro.  This product has been on the market for several years, so there is no doubt in its effectiveness.  In addition, Panasonic has always been famous for its high-quality electronic products, so creating a good battery source for them was not difficult. </p><p>  The main advantage of Japanese batteries is their durability.  The manufacturer assures that they are able to work for at least 15 years, even if they are idle for a long time.  In addition, power supplies work without much difficulty even in severe frost.  Well, their power is enough to charge even a professional camera.  However, the main disadvantage of the Panasonic Eneloop Pro is its high price (1250 rubles for 4 pieces). </p><h2>  GP Rechargeable (rating: 4.9) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.gps24.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best batteries are GP Rechargeable." class="if uuid-3245656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3245656.jpg"></div><p>  This battery can be called without a shame the best that is on the market.  GP products are used almost all over the world, and their batteries are famous for their innovative technology, which is provided at a very reasonable price.  The capacity of one battery reaches as much as 2700 mAh - a very impressive indicator for an element that can be recharged.  Well, the cost of the battery will be only 500-600 rubles for 4 pieces. </p><p>  Also, one cannot fail to note the fact that for the manufacture of products from GP, materials obtained from batteries already used are used.  This means that the manufacturer cares about preserving the environment.  Perhaps this is why the company does not pursue profit, but provides power sources at very reasonable prices.  Particularly loved batteries for gamers who use them in wireless mice, joysticks and other devices. </p><p>  Are there any disadvantages of such batteries?  Just one: the service life can hardly be called the maximum.  The manufacturer assures that the duration of operation is only 5 years.  For a battery pack, this figure seems very meager.  In addition, on sale you can find packaging in which there are only 4 power sources.  So you still have to think about whether to buy GP Rechargeable. </p><h2>  What batteries do not need to be bought? </h2><p>  Now you know which batteries are the best (alkaline, saline, lithium, and rechargeable).  However, in the pursuit of economy, many buyers make the same common mistake - they purchase cheap power supplies from an unknown company, which claims that their products have unrivaled characteristics.  However, is it worth trusting a company that could not achieve great heights in the market? </p><p>  As a rule, such manufacturers attract the attention of the buyer with what they can best realize - beautiful packaging and relatively low price.  However, do not forget that a tasteless candy will not change its properties from the fact that it is wrapped in a beautiful wrapper.  By making such a purchase, the buyer runs the risk of getting a very weak device that will give out a couple hundred mAh maximum power. </p><p>  Also, do not forget that the manufacturer may simply not talk about some of the characteristics of his product, if he does not consider it necessary.  Most people can see on the battery of dubious quality something like: "It will last 20 years - we guarantee it."  Thoughts immediately arise in my head: "Even if I have to recharge it often - it's better than overpaying."  But who said that the battery has good insulation that will allow it to last at least 2 years? </p><h2>  What nuances should I pay attention to? </h2><p>  It's time to talk about some selection tips that will allow our readers to purchase the best batteries for a particular device.  After all, it is not necessary for the remote control on the TV to buy an expensive lithium battery, overpaying 10 times.  Therefore, when choosing a battery, consider the following nuances. </p><ol><li>  Type of electrolyte (battery composition).  Salt batteries are best suited for timers, calculators, remotes, and other devices that do not have much power.  Alkaline will ideally cope with stronger loads: kitchen scales, radio-controlled toys, players and so on.  Well, lithium will show maximum efficiency in film cameras, tonometers and microphones. </li><li>  Duration of operation.  Do not forget that products can also be divided into disposable and battery ones.  The latter can be recharged without any difficulty from a conventional network using a special device.  As a rule, one battery equals the power of 4 ordinary batteries.  So if you plan to use this or that device for a long time, then think about buying such a device. </li><li>  Shelf life.  Each battery has a specific time until it fails.  It is worth paying attention to this nuance especially if you purchase batteries at a relatively high cost.  However, it makes no sense to try to find salt power sources with a long life, since they will discharge much faster than their time runs out. </li></ol><p>  These are the most important details to consider.
