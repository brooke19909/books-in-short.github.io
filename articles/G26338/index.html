The nearest metro stations are Polyanka and Tretyakovskaya. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  On the odd side of the street are ancient buildings that house offices, cafes and restaurants. </p><p>  On the even side is the <span>drainage channel.</span>  In the warm season, fountains are included here, which can be admired from the Luzhkov Bridge, intended exclusively for pedestrians.

    <h2>  First mention </h2><p>  The embankment is located in the palace <span>Kadashevskaya settlement,</span> which was one of the richest.  In the place of the settlement was the village of the same name.  Mention of him is in the will of Prince Ivan Vasilievich, from 1504. </p><p>  There is a theory that the village existed for a long time and its inhabitants were engaged in the manufacture of barrels - cadets.  The second theory seems more reliable.  The word "kadash" in translation from ancient Turkic meant "comrade", or rather a free member of society.  There are written references to the fact that in the XVII century in this place weavers lived - Khamovniki, who made linen, and it was intended for the royal court.  For each yard (and there were about 413) a certain norm was established.  These weavers enjoyed certain freedom and privileges.  They were allowed to trade, travel outside the borders of the country and engage in crafts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Weavers were not poor, and many could even afford to build a stone house, by the way, some have survived to this day.  For example, the main room (chamber) of house number 10 in an alley near Kadashevskaya Embankment dates back to the 17th century.  Today it is a L-shaped building, because new rooms were periodically attached to the main chamber. </p>

    <h2>  Post-soviet times </h2><p>  Kadashevskaya embankment has always been a monument of urban development.  Even Catherine I, after laying the canal, built it up with a “continuous facade”.  Mostly these were two-story buildings, standing shoulder to shoulder with arches for arrival.  By the 1970s there was no solid line of development.  By 1994, houses 14, 20, 26 -32 were destroyed.  New buildings with attic floors of a completely different architectural style begin to appear.  The Resurrection Church, the dome of which always majestically towered above the embankment, is visually “drowned”. </p><p>  Luzhkov, the former mayor of the capital, also gives way to new buildings in the Tretyakov quarter, removing security status from some buildings of the embankment, in particular, from house 12. Historical monuments of architecture are gradually being demolished. </p><h2>  Present time </h2><p>  Kadashevskaya Embankment in Moscow has two sides, even and odd.  On the odd side is a bridge called Luzhkovy.  The official version says that the name comes from Tsaritsyn meadow, which is located on the other side of the passage, on Bolotnaya Square.  But since he appeared during the period when Luzhkov held the post of mayor, the residents of the city associate the name with his personality.  Also called the Tretyakov bridge and the "Kisses Bridge". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  House number 30 </h2><p>  The building was reconstructed in 2003.  It has 4 floors and more than 6 thousand square meters.  The business center “Kadashevskaya Naberezhnaya 30” is assigned Class A status. This means not only the high cost of rent, but also other benefits for tenants and visitors: </p><ul><li>  walking distance to metro stations (to “Tretyakovskaya” and “Novokuznetskaya” only 5 minutes); </li><li>  open and closed parking; </li><li>  3 elevators; </li><li>  magnificent view of the Moscow River; </li><li>  supply and exhaust ventilation system; </li><li>  conditioning; </li><li>  fire alarm. </li></ul><p>  Almost all offices are occupied on Kadashevskaya embankment.  Megafon, a leading mobile operator, has located its head office in this building. </p><h2>  House number 14 </h2><p>  This office building was designed as part of a complex of administrative buildings on Kadashevskaya Embankment.  The main concept of the project was to build the same buildings in historical places, that is, imitating noble estates.  And the architect succeeded - the building was built in 2001.  Many offices are located here, including the European Commission in Russia. </p>
