    <h2>  Netbynet Provider </h2><p>  NetByNet ("NetBynet") is one of the largest companies in Russia engaged in the development of communications, the provision of services for connecting to the Internet and digital television.  The company was established more than 10 years ago.  It was based on several telecom operators and Internet providers, whose union allowed us to create one of the most successful and popular brands in the field of communications.  The Netbynet provider offers its customers a wide range of services, including mobile Internet access and simple home remote monitoring systems.  Later, Netbaynet became a part of Megafon.  And even later, through joint efforts, a significant product in the field of telecommunications was created - Wifire TV, which is used by more than 50,000 subscribers.  Even such an ambitious project as providing the entire Moscow transport network with free Internet is the work of Netbaynet.  In this article, we‚Äôll take a closer look at the services offered by the provider, the cost of tariffs and reviews about the NetBine from the company's subscribers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Home Internet </h2><p>  The Internet connection service from NetByNet is offered under the Wifire brand.  The operator offers several tariffs for connecting a home network at once and provides users with all the necessary equipment.  To connect, just select the tariff you like and leave a request on the official website of the company.  It is also possible to create your own range of services for connecting an individual tariff. </p>

To support a high-speed network, the provider uses the LTE protocol.  The fastest and most stable technology available today.  To connect, you must leave a request on the company website.  The Netbaynet courier will bring you a SIM card anywhere in the city (you can pick it up yourself at any provider‚Äôs office if you wish).  After that, you need to insert a SIM card into your gadget and activate it (to activate, just open any web browser). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tariffs for mobile Internet </h2><p>  Tariffs "NetBynet" for mobile traffic (paid monthly) are as follows: </p><ul><li>  150 rubles - 1 gigabyte of traffic (ideal for communicating in instant messengers, social networks and working with e-mail); </li><li>  400 rubles - 4 gigabytes of traffic (suitable for listening to music in streaming services and downloading small files from the network); </li><li>  600 rubles - 16 gigabytes (suitable for listening to good quality music, watching YouTube videos, sharing files on social networks); </li><li>  900 rubles - 36 gigabytes (ideal for those who not only want to enjoy the Internet without restrictions, but plan to share it with others). </li></ul>

    <h2>  Television Wifire TV </h2><p>  Digital Netbynet TV is very different from what the competitors of the provider offer.  Television in the classical sense is completely outdated, and Netbaynet understands this.  Therefore, the company's engineers have created a new format that is completely controlled by the user and is available in any place where there is Internet access.  Wifire TV can be used on smart TVs from Samsung and LG (you need to download the application specifically), on mobile devices such as iPad and iPhone, as well as on any TV if you connect an Apple TV set-top box or a branded set-top box from Netbaynet to it .  When using Wifire TV, you completely control the viewing process.  You can pause the broadcast at any time.  It is possible to record a new episode of your favorite series and watch it over the next 3 days from the moment the series aired.  If you do not have time to start the transfer, you can always click on the ‚ÄúWatch First‚Äù button and enjoy the program, catching up on missed moments.  For those who own several gadgets and televisions at once, the ‚ÄúMultiscreen‚Äù option is suitable, which makes it possible to watch TV shows and TV shows on a tablet, phone and several televisions at once, paying for a single bill.  For those who doubt, there is a trial period of three days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="netbynet provider" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1891296.jpg"></div>

The provider works closely with Kaspersky Lab and offers its customers free anti-virus software.  Kaspersky Intenet Security allows you to protect a computer running Windows, Mac and Linux from malicious programs that can get into the system from the network.  This antivirus allows you to protect your personal data and make online payments without the risk of losing money from a credit card.  The antivirus license applies to several devices at once.  This means that you can protect not only the main computer, but also an additional one. </p><p>  If you connect the Internet to a child, then the Kaspersky Safe Kids option will come in handy.  Using this software package, you can limit the child‚Äôs access to the network and limit the time he spends on social networks.  Parents also gain access to the child‚Äôs publications to protect him from intruders and criminals.  Using the Kaspersky Safe Kids application for mobile phones, you can track the child‚Äôs geolocation and receive notifications if he leaves the apartment or school. </p>

    <h2>  Provider Equipment </h2><p>  For an additional fee, NetBynet will provide security not only on the Internet, but also at home.  The company sells D-Link cameras configured to monitor any premises around the clock.  Those who leave the child with a nanny or entrust the housekeeper with cleaning the apartment will now be able to monitor their work remotely, without being distracted from their affairs.  The camera is very easy to connect, and all the information recorded by it is stored in the archive for a month. </p><p>  In addition to cameras and SIM cards for the phone, Netbaynet offers users its own Wi-Fi routers.  Wifire are powerful routers capable of operating in the frequency range from 2.4 to 5 gigahertz.  You can connect a hard drive to the routers and download backup copies of data to it without connecting the drive directly to a computer or tablet (it works with the Time Capsule service on Mac computers). </p><h2>  Rates for camera and rent a router </h2><p>  Netbaynet tariffs for Wifire-camera (monthly payment) are as follows: </p><ul><li>  350 rubles - with a provider‚Äôs camera; </li><li>  300 rubles - with your camera or smartphone; </li><li>  550 rubles - with a provider‚Äôs camera for 30 days; </li><li>  500 rubles - with your camera or smartphone for 30 days. </li></ul><p>  Renting a router will cost <span>50 rubles</span> for each month. </p>

    <h2>  Regions and coverage map </h2><p>  NetByNet ("NetBynet") works not only in Moscow, but also in a large number of other cities in Russia.  Among the major cities it is worth highlighting Kursk, Khanty-Mansiysk, Yekaterinburg.  Netbaynet in Belgorod and Surgut works with restrictions.  Some other large cities like Nizhnevartovsk and Tomsk are not served by the provider at all.  In Moscow, Netbaynet supports working with LTE networks.  Mobile network coverage covers almost the entire territory of Moscow and the Moscow region.  Netbainet users in Belgorod face speed limits.  There, LTE is not stable everywhere, but the technology itself is supported by radio towers located in the city.  Among the Netbaynet regions, you can find any settlement, from Balashikha to Shipulino. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  ‚ÄúNetbaynet‚Äù, in spite of all the assurances of the operator and favorable offers for subscribers, has not the best reputation.  Users actively complain of constant crashes, unexpected outages and long delays.  Remote locations where Netbaynet works (regions in the first place) observe a decrease in speed on an ongoing basis.  The declared speed in 90% of cases differs from what the user ultimately receives.  There were times when the provider, without notifying users, changed the connection conditions and individual tariff plans, in connection with which the amount of the subscription fee and speed changed.  In addition to poor communication quality and sharp breaks, users note the obsession of technical support employees, who often call users and offer additional services that were not initially connected.  In addition, technical support often makes you wait, torments subscribers with the same questions and offers the same diagnostic methods, regardless of what causes Internet problems.  Another important point that Netbaynet employees in Moscow and other cities withhold is the cost of connection.  It is paid, and costs 3,500 rubles, which for many may turn out to be a critical amount.  Even the connection process itself can turn into one big problem.  Employees of the company can cancel your application for connection without explaining the reasons, and the technical support will just shrug, declaring that it is not responsible for the employees of the company. </p>

    <p>  There are also positive reviews about the "Netbaynet".  Some users are fortunate to deal with courteous and competent technical support, ready to make concessions.  Many residents of Moscow note a stable operation over several years of interaction with the provider.  Some undemanding users who switched to NetBynt from other providers also left positive feedback, since they believe that the conditions offered to them are much better than those of competitors.  This applies to both the performance of the connection and the features that are offered by default.  One of the distinguishing features of the provider is the ability to create several IP addresses for each individual device, including a router.  There is a bonus system that helps to save on paying for Internet services, television and mobile traffic. </p>
