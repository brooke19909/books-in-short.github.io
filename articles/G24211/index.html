On a sunny summer day <span>, the Okhotny Ryad shopping center</span> suddenly burst out.  This event can rightfully be considered the beginning of a series of terrorist attacks in the Russian Federation.  Similar explosions in Moscow in 1999 lasted for 2 months and during this period of time 231 people were killed and 737 Russian citizens were injured. </p><p>  These are truly very scary and painful events for many residents of the country.  Perhaps one of us lost a person close to him in a series of terrorist attacks of 1999, or this person was seriously wounded.  The bombings in Moscow in 1999 are a terrible catastrophe for the entire population of Russia. </p><h2>  The attack on Manezhnaya Square </h2><p>  As mentioned above, on the last day of the summer of 1999, an explosion sounded in a shopping center.  <span>This attack</span> is considered one of the first explosions in the next 2 months.  As a result of this action, more than 40 Russian citizens were injured, including 6 children.  As stated in the press, one woman was injured, not compatible with life, and died on the spot. </p><p>  The explosion itself occurred at about 8 p.m. in the Salon of slot machines for children "Dynamite".  According to the examination, the explosives were installed by professionals and were actuated using a clockwork.  After some time, the public became aware that the device was hidden in a plastic bottle or simply thrown into an urn. </p><p>  The terrorists hoped that the people in the building would die not from the blast wave, but from fire and smoke.  However, the expectations of the criminals did not materialize: the partitions were strong enough and did not catch fire after the terrorist attack. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Explosions of apartment buildings in Moscow, 1999 </h2><p>  An unexpected explosion on the first floor of a <span>multi-storey building</span> occurred on September 8, 1999.  This house was a nine-story building on Guryanova Street.  According to official figures released in the press, 106 people died as a result of the attack, and 609 residents were seriously injured. </p>

    <p>  According to the mayor of the capital, the explosion of residential buildings in Moscow in 1999 was planned in advance and carefully planned.  Indeed, most of the attacks in residential areas occurred at a time when people were preparing for bed.  As a result of the attack on Guryanov Street, two neighboring entrances were completely destroyed.  In the houses that were nearby, glass was broken and structures were deformed. </p>
