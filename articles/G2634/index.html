    <h2>  Briefly about the main thing </h2><p>  Vladivostok is located in the east of the country.  Monsoons are a fairly common occurrence for this area.  What weather prevails here?  The climate of Vladivostok (feedback from the local population is evidence of this) is formed precisely under the influence of these air masses.  Most often it is rainy and foggy weather.  <span>The average</span> air temperature in Vladivostok is considered to be +6 <span>¬∞</span> C. But this statement was refuted in some years, since in summer the temperature exceeded +29 ¬∞ C and in winter there were 30-degree frosts.  The rainfall in the city can reach 800 millimeters per year.  But local residents joke that there is simply no climate in the city and the weather in it is always bad.  That is why it is recommended that all tourists planning to travel take an umbrella and a jacket or raincoat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Spring season </h2><p>  The climate of Vladivostok is quite peculiar, however, as in the entire Primorsky Territory.  Given the proximity to the northern latitudes, spring in the city comes at the end of March and may not cede its rights to fly until the end of June.  Plus temperatures are approved only at the end of April.  Sharp jumps in this area are considered the norm.  In the spring, air temperature in Vladivostok can change over the course of one day.  For example, in the morning it will be +10 ¬∞ C, and in the afternoon it will drop to 0 degrees.  By night, warming or a sharp cooling may occur.  Therefore, weather forecasters have to work hard to make accurate forecasts.  Closer to June, the temperature can reach +15 ¬∞ C. The air humidity in spring, especially in April, becomes quite high due to heavy precipitation. </p><h2>  What awaits in the summer? </h2><p>  The climate of Vladivostok in the summer season also has its own characteristics.  Since the end of June, beautiful weather has been established, which lasts exactly 3 months.  However, only mists and clouds can bring grief.

The temperature often reaches +27 <sup>o</sup> C. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚ÄãVladivostok climate" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1222017.jpg" width="600"></div>
