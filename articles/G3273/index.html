    <h2>  Comments of tourists about the territory and location of the hotel </h2><p>  Almost all the guests, without exaggeration, were delighted with their own hotel grounds.  So, according to them, ‚ÄúMakriamos Bungalos‚Äù is located in a magnificent pine forest.  The aroma of trees in combination with the sea air creates a wonderful microclimate, setting up for an excellent, healthy stay.  Also, our compatriots appreciated the rich wildlife of this place.  A lot of songbirds live here, as well as peacocks that freely walk around the hotel.  In addition, there is a mini zoo with deer that you can feed.  According to vacationers, children will be delighted with this opportunity. </p><p>  As for the location of Makryammos Bungalows Hotel 4 *, the distance from it to the resort town of Limenas is only a couple of kilometers.  So you can get here in 20 minutes at a leisurely pace.  Here you will find a lot of shops, retail stores, taverns, restaurants and even several nightclubs.  Just a 10-minute leisurely walk from the hotel there is a supermarket with a large selection of products and a variety of basic necessities. </p><p>  Seasoned travelers to all people planning to relax at this hotel are advised to pay attention to the fact that it is located quite far from the airport.  In general, you will have to get about four hours from the air harbor to the hotel (including transfer by bus and ferry journey).  However, according to most tourists, usually the road is not particularly tiring, since along the way some picturesque landscapes are replaced by others.  In addition, if you are accompanied by a guide, he will not fail to share with you interesting and useful information both about the country as a whole and about the region where you plan to spend a vacation, in particular. </p>
