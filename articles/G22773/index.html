    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The Republic of Kalmykia is located in the European part of the Russian Federation.  In the south, it borders on the Stavropol Territory.  Nevertheless, the majority of the indigenous population of the republic profess Buddhism.  This is what Kalmykia is interesting for.  You don‚Äôt have to fly to Thailand or Mongolia to see the pagodas, prayer stupas and sculptures of the Buddha sitting in meditation.  All this is in Elista.  Kalmykia, located in the south of the Russian Federation, has a fairly significant size.  Its area is seventy-six thousand square kilometers larger than the territory of Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands or Denmark.  It stretches from south to north for four hundred fifty-eight kilometers, and from east to west - for 423 km.  In the south, the Kuma and Manych rivers are the natural borders of the republic.  In the southeast, it is washed by the Caspian Sea.  From the northeast, the territory of Kalmykia approaches the Volga.  And in the northwestern part it is limited by the Ergeninsky Upland. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  <span>The Republic of Kalmykia,</span> due to its large territory, is located immediately in three natural zones - deserts, semi-deserts and steppes.  The relief here is mostly flat, and therefore strong winds are frequent here, sometimes developing into dry winds.  The climate in the republic is continental.  The temperature in summer can reach +42 degrees.  Winters are not very snowy, but with crackling frosts.  Continental climate rises sharply from west to east.  But in the south of the republic, the average January temperature reaches only minus eight degrees Celsius.  The coldest winter in the northeastern regions.  There frosts can reach ‚Äì35 degrees Celsius and below.  But the republic boasts a huge number of clear days.  The sun shines here about 184 days a year.  A long warm period is also associated with this - 250-270 days.  And although the average July temperature is only +24.5 ¬∞ C, maxims are not uncommon.  Without exaggeration, we can say that this subject of the Russian Federation disputes the title of the hottest region in the Volgograd region. </p><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  On the territory of the republic there are deposits related to the Caspian oil and gas province.  Ermolinsk and Burul wells are now in operation.  Great potential in the development of the region is represented by wind energy resources.  The Government of Kalmykia is taking the first steps towards ensuring that the movement of air masses does not cause damage to agriculture, but benefits.  In particular, the Kalmyk <span>wind farm</span> is currently under construction <span>.</span>  A big problem for agriculture is the <span>shortage of fresh water.</span>  Precipitation falls a little - about two hundred or three hundred millimeters per year.  Therefore, reservoirs are important for agriculture.  The largest of them - Chograisk is located on the border of the Stavropol Territory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Rivers and lakes of Kalmykia </h2><p>  The sandy coast of the Caspian Sea, replete with small bays, represents a huge potential for the development of tourism in Kalmykia.  Alas, it is not used yet.  The Volga crosses the territory of the republic only at a twelve-kilometer stretch.  Other freshwater arteries are Kuma (it separates Kalmykia from Dagestan), East and West Manych, Egorlyk.  Most of the rivers of Kalmykia are small, drying out in the summer, and at other times carrying bitter-salty water.  Therefore, the main landscapes in the republic are dry steppes and semi-deserts.  However, one cannot but mention the lakes, which Kalmykia is famous for.  A photo of the Big Yashalt Lake, you have probably already seen.  Only the Dead Sea exceeded the healing properties of its water.  So far, only one medical center stands on its shore.  It was built recently and, probably, other similar institutions will soon be erected here.  After all, on the still wild shore of the lake people come to treat a lot of diseases - from respiratory to reproductive. </p><p>  One cannot ignore the <span>lake of Manych-Gudilo</span> covered with legends <span>.</span>  It got its name because of the wind emitting mournful frightening sounds over the surface.  Nesting sites for waterfowl are Deed-Hulsun.  Other important lakes are Sostinsky and Sarpinsky, Small Yashaltinsky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The capital of Kalmykia is elista" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/687732.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Flora and fauna of Kalmykia </h2><p>  Kalmykia, whose photo is often represented by endless steppes and semi-deserts, is the most treeless subject in the entire Russian Federation.  Vegetation is represented by feather grass, tumbleweed, and other species adapted to the arid climate and brackish soils.  About one hundred and thirty species of birds nest on the lakes of the republic.  Of these, twenty-three are listed in the Red Book of the Russian Federation.  But what Kalmykia is famous for is the fact that the only saiga population in Europe lives on its territory.  To protect this endangered species from extinction, the Black Lands Nature Reserve was established in 1990.  He stretched between Kuma and the Volga in an area of ‚Äã‚Äãone hundred twenty thousand hectares.  Here is also the lake Manych-Gudilo, already mentioned by us, with twelve islands.  Tourists come here to look at the nests of swans, bustards, curly pelicans, as well as watch the running of the herds of wild horses.  It‚Äôs good to be on Manych-Gudilo in windy weather.  Then giant waves walk along the lake (up to 12 meters high!).  And the wind howls so that it seems that all the evil spirits from Kalmyk legends have flocked here on the Sabbath.  True, there are no tourist centers on the lake yet.  Accommodation is possible only in the private sector of the village of Yashalta or in the guest houses of the reserve. </p>

    <h2>  Kalmyk population </h2><p>  According to Rosstat data for 2015, two hundred eighty and a half thousand people live in the republic.  And in the 2010 Census, this figure was 289,481. This decline in population is due to internal migration.  But in recent years, this outflow has decreased.  Kalmykia is gradually ceasing to be a <span>depressive region.</span>  Taking into account the vast territory of the republic, it can be judged that the <span>population density</span> is low: about four people per square kilometer.  Citizens make up forty-five percent of all residents of the region.  And if we recall that in the Republic of Kalmykia, the capital has a population of 103,730 people, it turns out that the population density is even lower.  In addition to Elista, there are two more cities - Lagan and Gorodovikovsk.  According to the 2010 Census, the ethnic composition in the republic is as follows: the majority (57%) are Kalmyks, 33% are Russians, the remaining 10% are other nationalities. </p><h2>  Authorities </h2><p>  The People‚Äôs Khural of the Republic adopts laws and acts.  This Parliament includes twenty-seven deputies.  Khural represents the legislature.  The highest official is the Head of the Republic.  He heads the executive branch and forms the Government of Kalmykia.  For seventeen years, the Head of the Republic was Kirsan Nikolaevich Ilyumzhinov.  This man has done a lot to ensure that Kalmykia, the capital of Elista and other cities and villages have gained a European look.  In 2010, he was replaced by Alexei Maratovich Orlov, at the post of the President of the Russian Federation V.V. Putin. </p>

    <h2>  History of the region </h2><p>  It is not simple and sometimes tragic.  Various peoples roamed along these steppes.  Cimmerians, Sarmatians and Scythians, as well as the Khazars, Huns, Polovtsy and Pechenegs succeeded each other, leaving behind them the mounds and the remains of ancient settlements.  This explains the many-sided culture of Kalmykia.  In the XIII century, these lands were part of the Golden Horde.  In Kalmykia, more than two hundred monuments of culture and history have been preserved.  Five of them are protected by the Russian Federation.  The Kalmyk people, like the Crimean Tatars, became a victim of deportation.  By order of Stalin, people were evicted from their native villages.  Thousands of them never returned home.  These tragic pages in the history of the Kalmyk people are dedicated to the memorial ‚ÄúExodus and Return‚Äù by Ernest Unknown.  The monument is located in Elista. </p><p>  Modern culture is inextricably linked with the dominant religion in the Republic.  After all, Kalmyks are the only people in Europe professing Buddhism.  Everywhere here you can find khuruls - characteristic Lamaist complexes.  For a long time Kalmyks were forbidden to practice their religion.  There was not a single working temple, and the old ones were destroyed.  The oldest surviving one is the khurul in the village of Tsagan-Aman, dating from the beginning of the twentieth century. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The capital of Elista accepts the majority of guests of the Republic of Kalmykia.  There is one airport in the city.  It takes regular flights from Moscow, Stavropol, Rostov-on-Don and Mineralnye Vody.  Travel by bus from the capital of the Russian Federation, although it will cost less than an airplane (1800 rubles), but it lasts more than a day.  To get to Elista by train, you first need to get to Stavropol.  There you should transfer to another train moving along the branch from the Divnoye station.  From Stavropol to Elista, you will spend eight hours on the road if you choose land transport.  Bus service also connects the capital of Kalmykia with Volgograd and Astrakhan. </p><h2>  Elista </h2><p>  This city is called the Buddhist capital.  It was founded in the late nineteenth century.  The capital of Kalmykia, Elista is a small city.  Only a hundred thousand people live in it.  Therefore, to get to know him, you can rely on your own legs.  Although minibuses constantly scurry around the city, but there are no traffic jams in the city.  The color of Elista captivates tourists.  Especially striking is the abundance of prayer stupas and Buddhist temples.  It is recommended to visit the Golden Abode of Shakyamuni.  This is the largest Buddhist temple in Europe.  It consists of seven levels.  It is decorated with a twelve-meter statue of the Enlightened, covered <span>with gold leaf</span> inlaid with real diamonds.  The temple contains holy relics: for example, the clothes of the Dalai Lama of the XIV century.  In the pagoda of Seven Days, a two-meter prayer drum from a tantric monastery in India is installed.  It is written in gold letters in several languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the mantra. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kalmyk population" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/687812.jpg"></div>

Be sure to try the dumplings ‚Äúborigi‚Äù, fried in oil pies ‚Äúwrestlers‚Äù, offal soup, lamb and tea ‚Äúzhomba‚Äù. </p><p>  In memory of the Republic of Kalmykia, the capital offers a wide variety of souvenirs.  These are mainly camel wool clothes and felt products - for example, yurt boxes.  Must visit a special area of ‚Äã‚ÄãElista - City Chess.  Everything is devoted to chess here.  And on the main street of the mini-town - Ostap Bender Avenue, there is a monument to the Great Combinator.  City Chess was built by Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the former <span>Head of Kalmykia</span> and concurrently President of the International Chess Association. </p>
