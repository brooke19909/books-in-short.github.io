    <p>  These peaks represent a series of mountain plateaus, which are dissected by deep passes and gorges with a large number of cliffs. </p><p>  Imandra (lake) and its surrounding territories attract attention also due to the proximity of the Khibin to them. </p><h2>  The origin of the name of the island </h2><p>  Until now, the origin of the name of the lake is not fully disclosed. </p><p>  Such an unusual name for the island, <span>A. Kazakov</span> suggested, came from the language of the peoples of Sami origin and means "a lake with a complex configuration of the coastline, with many islands." </p><p>  There is also an assumption (the opinion of N. N. Poppe) that "imandra" has a common root with the word "imatra".  It seems that this is a very ancient name, with non-local origin. </p><p>  The local Lopar name for the lake is Iverjavr, but it has long been obsolete. </p><p>  There is another assumption (S. B. Vasiliev) that if we take into account the transport significance of the lake in the daily life of the Lapps mainly in the winter season, it can be assumed that the lake was first called Inmander.  In translation, it is either “ice continent” or “ice space” (from the word “inn” - “ice” and “mandera” - “mainland”).  And later it began to sound more harmonious for Russian settlers. </p><h2>  In conclusion - the legend </h2><p>  Imandra is the name of the daughter of a hunter who lived on the shore of a small lake.  The daughter hunted with her father.  She was beautiful and quick, and her laughter aroused sleepy mountains.  A young hunter who lived on the other side of the mountains once heard her loud laughter.  He went to this sound and, seeing Imandra, was fascinated by her beauty.  He forgot that the mountains have deep gorges, because he could not take his eyes off the girl. </p><p>  The young man fell into one of the abysses, and Imandra began to beg the gods to revive this young man, but they were silent.  Then she often cried when she came to the gorge, and once she saw that one of the rocks turned into the face of her beloved, but it remained stone.  In desperation, Imandra rushed into the lake, which immediately parted and became very large. </p>
