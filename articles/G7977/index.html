This is not just an apartment, a cottage, even if it is very large and beautiful.  The house is, first of all, comfort, warmth, a sense of care and security.  Smart English always knew that ‚Äúmy house is my castle‚Äù and did everything to make this castle indestructible.  You can furnish your house with the latest fashion, you can decorate it with expensive pieces of art, but if it does not have love and warmth, it will still remain just a building, not a house. <br>  If after work you try to quickly come home, where you will be met with voiced children's voices and the smell of pies, if you manage to miss your relatives in a day, then you have a real House.  And even though things are scattered here and there and the cup is not always washed, you cannot find a more comfortable place on the whole planet. <br>  But it happens that the soul leaves the house, and the official spirit settles.  This happens when the relationship of two loving people breaks.  Meticulous statistics show that every four years there is a crisis in the relationship.  Someone successfully overcomes it, and someone leaves the race, and such a strong, as it seemed, family collapses. <br>  In order to prevent a sad ending, we need to work on relations, we must constantly throw fuel into the family hearth of love, then he will not be afraid of any crises. <br>  To refresh your feelings, you need to break out of the familiar circle and change the environment. <br>  Leave your children to your grandmother and go to Venice.  Why exactly there?  Yes, because it is impossible to find a more romantic place.  In a hotel <noindex>  <span>Savoia &amp; Jolanda prices</span> </noindex>  you will not be ruined, and a convenient location near historical attractions will not let you get bored.  A sea of ‚Äã‚Äãnew experiences, new activities will give an impetus to the discussion of a joint day, and planning subsequent walks and excursions will show that your interests coincide just as they did a few years ago.  Walking under the southern night sky, the mysterious and mysterious canals of Venice with gondola rides will give your relationship a light flair of novelty. <br><noindex>  <span>Hotel Casanova prices</span> </noindex>  which is also within reason, will charm you with its name alone.  Casanova, the conqueror of hearts, will share with you her charm and secrets of seduction. <br>  If a crisis of relations has caught you on cold winter evenings, pack your bags, pack your bags and leave with your half to ski.  Yes, it's that simple.  Physical fatigue will not give a chance of mental fatigue and will magically turn your discontent into care and willingness to come to the aid of your partner at any moment.  On the slopes you can‚Äôt do without love.  Add a cocktail of excitement, a surge of adrenaline, fun and mutual assistance.  Are you still bored together? </p></div></article>
