  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Types of Licenses</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In our country, to conduct certain <span>types of activities</span> it is necessary to obtain an official permit.  Licensing is carried out in approximately 100 areas.  Let's talk about what types of licenses are. </p><p>  To carry out activities in the field of medicine, you must obtain a special license.  It is issued to all institutions that provide medical services. </p><p>  Different types of building licenses are needed to carry out any activity of this kind.  Without them, construction is considered illegal. </p><p>  An environmental license is issued for the right to use <span>natural resources</span> and environmental wealth, as well as for the disposal of harmful substances. </p><p>  There is also fire <span>licensing.</span>  <span>This</span> permission for installation and further maintenance of all fire systems of any level, as well as the conduct of fire protection measures. </p><p>  One of the types is a license for the organization of pharmaceutical activities.  It includes permission to sell drugs. </p><p>  It is also necessary to obtain a license for a wide range of entrepreneurial activities. </p><p>  Production processes are also licensed.  Sometimes you need to get permission to organize and conduct activities of the enterprise that are not related to production. </p><p>  And finally, the types of banking licenses.  These special licenses are issued by the National Bank.  The order of receipt is regulated by the relevant code. </p><p>  From the day the license is issued, the bank <span>gains the right to</span> carry out its activities.  All issued licenses are recorded in a special registry.  Information about the withdrawal of permission is also entered there. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The license lists the banking services that the bank is allowed to provide. </p><p>  There are two categories of licenses.  Some are issued to the bank, which is just starting its activity.  Another category includes licenses to expand the list of services that an organization provides in the field of banking services. </p><p>  In the first case, the following types of banking licenses are distinguished. </p><p>  Permission to conduct operations only in rubles and without raising funds from individuals. </p><p>  License to conduct operations in rubles and currency without using the funds of individuals. </p><p>  And finally, a license to attract deposits and operations with precious metals.  It can be issued simultaneously with one of the other licenses. </p><p>  If a credit institution shows stable operation for six months, fulfills its obligations, has the necessary own funds and has no debts, is equipped with all necessary equipment for carrying out activities, then you can obtain a license to expand the scope of services. </p><p>  If the bank has received permits for all types of operations, then a general license is issued. </p><p>  Other types of licenses are distinguished. </p><p>  An exclusive license is issued to use the invention.  Its scope is established in the agreement.  This license governs the authority to use the facility.  Restrictions may apply to timelines, territories or methods. </p><p>  A non-exclusive license provides the right to use the item in a certain territory and transfer the rights to third parties. </p><p>  A full license transfers all rights to the object of the contract with their use throughout the territory. </p><p>  A franchise is another type that involves the use of trademarks, <span>marks, copyrights</span> , patents on joint conditions necessary for carrying out activities. </p><p>  Types of licenses depend on the organization and its scope.  In addition, any industry has its own licensing features.  However, all licensed activities are subject to state control and are regulated by the relevant authorities. </p>
