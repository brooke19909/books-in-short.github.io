How to plan your trip so that it is comfortable and interesting for everyone: children (fastidious toddlers and moody teenagers), and his wife, and even mother-in-law?  Many tourists choose Turkey for such trips.  A short flight, the absence of the need to ask for a visa from the embassy for a long time, the mild climate of the Mediterranean make this country a key vacation for the whole family.  And how not to notice Kemer among the various offers?  This is a wonderful resort near Antalya, protected from the northern winds by green mountains.  But are <span>Kemer hotels</span> suitable for families with children?  Let's try to figure it out.

    <p>  In Turkey, children are treated with reverence, and you can safely come to this country even with a baby.  In this regard, Kemer hotels are no exception.  For families with children, there are cots with high sides, high chairs in restaurants and a lot of specific entertainments for kids: from playgrounds to mini-clubs and water parks.  To lure <span>couples,</span> the hotel administration offers big discounts for small guests, and often takes kids for free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, in order for the tourist tourists to be comfortable in every sense: accommodation, food, leisure, one should choose four- and even five-star Kemer hotels.  For families with children, some of them, such as Marti Myra Holiday Village, even have children's rooms in two-story cottages.  Most of these hotels are located on the front page of the sea, and small legs will not get tired of walking from the shore for lunch and back.  Covering the beaches of Kemer - pebbles, but so small that you should not be afraid of injuries.  On the contrary, unlike sand, it does not stick to the body.  If you like to relax by the pool more, then in <span>family hotels</span> there are always ‚Äúplunge pools‚Äù with a depth of 45-65 cm, and even with all sorts of slides. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer hotels with children" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/231080.jpg" width="600"></div>  From the reviews it is known that babies often find aversion to unfamiliar exotic foods.  But Kemer hotels for families with children have provided such a possibility and have special restaurants and menus on their territory.  At <span>Club Med Palmiye</span> , you can prepare the infant formula for your baby.  Older children will be offered a large selection of ice cream and sweets.  In the village of Kirish, near Kemer, there is a very good hotel Limak Limra 5 *.  One of its parts, Fame Garden, is ideally suited for a cloudless pastime.  Separated territory, peace and quiet, three shallow pools, a kindergarten, a club for teenagers and a small water park - all these services are provided there.  For a small fee, you can hire a professional nanny to look after the baby. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer hotels prices" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/231085.jpg" width="600"></div>  As an alternative to the two previous hotels, you can consider more budget hotels.  Kemer (prices in this region are much lower than those spoiled by tourists in Antalya and Alanya) offers a choice of many inexpensive family hotels, such as the Ulusoy Holiday Club or Club Boran Mare Beach.  In all of them there is a full range of entertainment for both small and adult guests.

    <p>  So do not be afraid to go on vacation to Turkish Kemer.  Rest with children (hotels, water parks, playgrounds, entry to the sea - all this is an integral part of this concept) is quite possible there.  Even more: in a small and compact resort village, your baby‚Äôs dream will not be disturbed by any noise from the outside.  But the bustling Antalya, which turns into a metropolis in the summer, cannot boast of such advantages. </p>
