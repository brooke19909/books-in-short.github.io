There are many sanatoriums in Russia, where anyone can get qualified medical treatment.  In today's review, we will get acquainted with the sanatorium "Rus" and find out all the details of the rest there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ust-ilimsk.wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="resort rus ust ilymsk address" class="if uuid-3229772" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43079/3229772.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The diversified health resort ‚ÄúRus‚Äù is located in the Irkutsk region, on the banks of the beautiful Angara River.  Siberian nature, clean air and a pleasant atmosphere are the main components of a comfortable stay, which has a beneficial effect not only on the state of mind, but also on health. </p><p>  The Rus resort in Ust-Ilimsk, among other things, has real "wealth" that is available to all vacationers: the local mineral drinking water has a powerful immuno-healing effect.  It is possible to achieve special results in maintaining overall health by choosing the program "Strengthening the immune system." </p><p>  Come, the doors of the sanatorium are open for guests all year round!  The address of the resort "Rus" (Ust-Ilimsk): Irkutsk region, Ust-Ilimsk, st.  Heroes of Labor, d. 57. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="57.9604327" data-lng="102.71993450000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/7/5/3/17753.png"></div><h2>  Medical Services Provided </h2><p>  The Rus resort (Ust-Ilimsk) is equipped with modern medical equipment that allows treating both adults and children.  The main areas of the sanatorium are therapy and prevention of diseases of the musculoskeletal system, nervous system and digestive organs.  Specialists have achieved great results in the treatment of respiratory diseases, as well as the circulatory system.  In addition, the medical staff of the Ust-Ilim resort ‚ÄúRus‚Äù is well versed in pediatrics and provides qualified assistance to patients with occupational diseases. </p><p>  Among those undergoing treatment, mud therapy (sapropelic therapeutic mud) and balneotherapy (hydrotherapy in the form of a variety of bathtubs, Charcot's showers, underwater massage shower, etc.) are especially popular. </p><p>  In the arsenal of the Rus resort (Ust-Ilimsk) there are also innovative methods of therapy: aromatherapy, meditation, as well as sessions of complete relaxation by the pool with sea turtles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rusotdih.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="resort Rus Ust Ilim" class="if uuid-3229778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43079/3229778.jpg"></div><h2>  Sports and fitness services </h2><p>  What a vacation without entertainment?  In addition to treatment, the Rus resort (Ust-Ilimsk) offers its guests a range of sports and fitness services: the sanatorium has an indoor pool and several types of saunas, including the recently popular cedar barrel.  A sports gym and billiards, water aerobics and beauty programs, a children's playroom and a library - all this and not only is available for every visitor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Founded in 1987, the Rus resort (Ust-Ilimsk) underwent reconstruction in 2007.  Today, the sanatorium can accommodate 252 people on its territory.  The rooms are different in comfort, there are both single and double rooms, as well as deluxe and junior suites. </p><p>  The average duration of treatment is from 10 to 21 days.  The cost of stay is from 1200 to 1800 rubles per day. </p><p>  For those who want to spend their holidays, there are active field trips. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rus sanatorium" class="if uuid-3229775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43079/3229775.jpg"></div><h2>  Rus Resort (Ust-Ilimsk): reviews </h2><p>  On the Internet there are many diverse reviews about this resort.  It is obvious that the majority of people resting there are generally satisfied with the treatment provided to them, they find the healing programs useful and effective.  Patients who underwent rehabilitation after suffering serious illnesses and operations leave praise to the doctors who put them on their feet. </p><p>  Many also note the friendly staff who are attentive to their guests, always ready to come to the rescue in case of any difficulties or provide clarification when questions arise. </p><p>  However, along with positive reviews, there are also negative ones.  All of them are connected with the dissatisfaction of visitors with the rather desolate state of the sanatorium, which, in their opinion, has long been in need of repair.  I would like to believe that the leadership of Rus will listen to these reviews and take steps to correct this defect so that the Siberian unique health resort will please all visitors without exception. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ilim24.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="resort rus ust ilymsk address" class="if uuid-3229779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43079/3229779.jpg"></div><p>  You can talk a lot and for a long time, but you should try at least once: come to the sanatorium "Rus", its doors are always open for you! </p>
