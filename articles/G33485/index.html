    <p>  The English revolution of the 17th century is called by many historians the Civil War or the bourgeois revolution.  Indeed, over the course of several years, the British state turned into a constitutional monarchy with a very strong parliament, which opened up access to power for representatives of the bourgeois class. </p><p>  <span>However, the</span> English Revolution was not only a struggle against the <span>absolute power of the</span> monarch.  There was also a confrontation of religions - between Puritans and adherents of the Church of England, clashes constantly took place.  Permanent riots broke out among the Scots and the Irish. </p><p>  <strong>Reasons for the English Revolution</strong> </p><p>  After the death of Elizabeth Tudor, the country found itself in a very difficult situation.  It is worth noting that in the last years of the reign of the great Queen, the opinion of the parliament was practically not taken into account.  But the views of the nobility changed dramatically after the throne was taken by Jacob of England, who believed that the monarch is the only one who has the right to govern the state. </p><p>  The situation became even more heated after the coronation of Charles I, who adhered to the political views of his father.  Firstly, the king sought to unite the <span>population of Ireland,</span> England and Scotland, and this did not cause enthusiasm on either side.  Secondly, he tried to rule without the help of the House of Lords.  During the first five years of the reign, the monarch convened and dissolved the parliament three times, after which he completely refused his assistance for 11 years. </p><p>  In addition, Karl married a Catholic, which could not go unnoticed by the Puritans, who by all means tried to eradicate even the smallest sprouts of Catholicism in the country. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In connection with the Scottish uprising in 1642, Karl convened a parliament that is known to history as "long."  The monarch could not dissolve the <span>House of Lords</span> and fled to York. </p><p>  <strong>English revolution and its consequences</strong> </p><p>  As a result of the rebellion, the nobles and members of parliament were divided into two camps.  Cavaliers supported by God the given power of the monarch.  Most of the nobility from all over the country joined the king, which at first gave him some military advantage.  Another part of the population - round-headed - supported the ideas of the constitutional monarchy and the power of parliament.  Most of the round-headed consisted of Puritans, led by Oliver Cromwell. </p><p>  At first, Cromwell‚Äôs troops found it difficult to resist the trained cavalry.  However, the advantage was on the side of round-headed.  In 1644, the Battle of Marton Moore took place, as a result of which Cromwell took control of almost all of northern England. </p><p>  Already in 1645, an army of a new standard was formed, which consisted exclusively of professional, trained soldiers.  In the same year, the battle of Nesby took place, which finally consolidated the power of the round-headed. </p><p>  In 1649, Charles the First was captured and executed.  In the same year, England was proclaimed a constitutional monarchy. </p><p>  However, the government could hardly claim to be constitutional.  Already in 1653, <span>Oliver Cromwell</span> declared himself lord (protector), a military dictatorship reigned in England. </p><p>  Only after the death of Cromwell did the parliament decide to renew the status of the monarchy.  Historians believe that after the accession to the throne of the son of the executed monarch, the English Revolution ended completely.  In 1660, Charles II was crowned. </p><p>  <strong>The results of the English revolution</strong> </p><p>  The main goal of the uprising was achieved - England turned into a constitutional monarchy.  In the future, a strong parliament was formed, which significantly reduced the power of the <span>royal family.</span>  Now representatives of the bourgeoisie also had access to governing the state. </p><p>  <span>Free trade</span> was proclaimed <span>,</span> which significantly improved the state treasury, as well as weakened Holland, which was considered the main rival of England. </p>
