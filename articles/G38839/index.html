  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dimmable LED lights: description, specifications, principle of operation, photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  LED lighting has become an integral part of our lives.  Today, almost every house has similar lamps.  This is not surprising, because such a backlight is durable and, importantly, does not require large amounts of electricity.  However, conventional lighting devices cannot be connected through a dimmer - they begin to flicker.  The only exceptions are tapes connected through the controller.  But, as it turned out, there are dimmable LED lights with a built-in regulator.  It is about such devices that will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Dimmer: what is it and by what principle does it work </h2><p>  Speaking exaggeratedly, this device can be compared with a rheostat.  A conventional dimmer reduces the power of the supplied current, as a result of which the lamp burns less brightly.  Such devices have been known for a long time and for sure everyone came across them at physics lessons at school.  Modern dimmers are more high-tech, but their essence has not changed from this: they do the same job.  The only difference is that today they do not have such a loss of energy as in old rheostats. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stylepark.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Such a dimmable chandelier will decorate any interior." class="if uuid-3057392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3057392.jpg"></div><p>  Such regulators can be different: mechanical, electronic, touch, and even with Wi-Fi control.  The latter have a higher cost, but their popularity from this does not fall. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dimmable LED Downlights: What Are They For? </h2><p>  Many people think that overpaying for lamps that are susceptible to adjustment is a common whim, but this is a very misconception.  Take, for example, the living room lighting.  The man worked a full day in a brightly lit office and, having arrived home, wants to relax or even just watch TV.  It has long been proven that in complete darkness this is not worth doing: too much eye strain.  He turns the knob or presses a button on the remote control and enjoys a cozy and comfortable environment. </p><p>  Another option - a person wakes up at night and goes to the toilet.  The light turned on at full power instantly beats off a dream.  And here dimmable LED lights come to the rescue, allowing you to fall asleep again.  They can also be used for zoning rooms.  One thing is for sure: those who installed such appliances at home will no longer refuse to use them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modular fixtures are becoming more popular" class="if uuid-3057385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3057385.jpg"></div><h2>  The advantages of dimming equipment over conventional </h2><p>  If you compare these two types of LED lamps, then the first you can find many advantages with a single minus - a slightly higher cost.  The rest are only positive qualities, among which: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Simple design and ease of operation. </li><li>  Save up to 90% in energy compared to a conventional LED lamp. </li><li>  Standard plinths for which replacement of cartridges is not required. </li><li>  Dimmable <span>LED ceiling lights are</span> more durable by reducing the load on them. </li><li>  The ability to create an atmosphere that will be comfortable for the eyes. </li><li>  Change in temperature.  If the light is cold, turning the control knob will warm it up a bit. </li></ul><p>  You can learn a little more about them from the following video: </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="VzeXxMbvEK8" data-url="https://youtu.be/VzeXxMbvEK8" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/3/9/1/7/13917.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of fixtures of this type </h2><p>  Recently, modular LED dimmable luminaires have become widespread.  They are used in offices, trade pavilions or in houses and apartments.  Their advantage is the convenience of placement.  Such lighting devices allow them to be arranged in a row, connecting several pieces, or to use each as a separate element.  They can be either built-in or suspended.  There are special docking slots for connecting devices. </p><p>  When installing Armstrong-type ceiling lighting fixtures, the premises of offices or trade pavilions are also noticeably transformed.  These recessed LED dimmable luminaires are great for suspended ceilings and are a great alternative to old fluorescent lights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.upshine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Using a dimmer, you can change the color temperature" class="if uuid-3057384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3057384.jpg"></div><h2>  Household use of adjustable lamps </h2><p>  In apartments or private homes, such lighting can become simply indispensable.  Dimmable lamps are installed everywhere today.  If earlier it was necessary to turn off part of the lamps to make the eyes more comfortable, now it is enough to turn the regulator to the level that is needed. </p><p>  They found application in the kitchen.  The built-in LED dimmable luminaires proved to be quite good as panels above the working area.  In point, ceiling, directional and even desktop devices, such elements are used more and more often.  But the main area of ‚Äã‚Äãapplication, of course, remains a children's nightlight. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dimmable backlight for the kitchen area with LEDs" class="if uuid-3057390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3057390.jpg"></div><h2>  Possible compatibility issues </h2><p>  When purchasing an LED lamp and a dimmer for it, you should pay attention to the protocols, which may vary.  After all, if you buy incompatible devices, they simply will not work in tandem.  There are only 4 dimming protocols - these are TRIAC, 1-10V, DALI and Push DIM.  Each of them has its own characteristics, but 1-10V and Push DIM should not be considered.  They are extremely rare in Russia, and the chance of meeting such devices on the shelves is very low.  If we talk about TRIAC, then its feature is the need to check in the store the performance of the lamp and dimmer.  Even if both devices have this protocol, it is not a fact that they will work correctly in pairs.  Of the possible troubles - a tangible hum, up to the sensation of vibration. </p><p>  The DALI dimming protocol is the most common option that can be found on the shelves of electrical stores.  Its work is the most stable, and the devices on it work for a longer time.  All well-known manufacturers that have proven themselves in the Russian market adhere to it.  However, there are drawbacks that are worth mentioning.  Among them, a rather high cost and the need to call a specialist for initial setup.  It is unlikely that the master at home (if he is not familiar with such a protocol) will be able to complete it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theinternetlightingstore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="4-zone touch controller" class="if uuid-3057387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3057387.jpg"></div><h2>  Some tips for choosing equipment </h2><p>  When purchasing dimmable LED lights, you should pay attention to some nuances and rules.  The main thing to consider is that you should not buy products of little-known brands in pursuit of savings.  This can subsequently "go sideways."  It‚Äôs better to overpay a little and get a quality branded product that will last much longer. </p><p>  The lamp, as well as the regulator for it, must be selected so that it does not spoil the interior.  However, the appearance is not only this.  It is worth paying attention to the quality of the product.  Uneven seams, poorly-printed inscriptions on the case should alert.  But even if this is not observed, it is necessary to familiarize yourself with all certificates of conformity and other related documentation.  If the seller does not have these securities, then it is better to refrain from buying. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.banggood.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Colored lamps not requiring a separate regulator" class="if uuid-3057388" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3057388.jpg"></div><p>  As already mentioned, checking dimming protocols and device compatibility is one of the most important factors.  It should be understood that large retail outlets are unlikely to exchange such goods on the basis that the buyer has chosen not what he needs.  But here it all depends on the seller. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Dimmable LED lamps are very convenient devices that can create coziness and a comfortable atmosphere in an apartment or private house.  However, if you decide to purchase such equipment, you should be very careful that you do not have to "bite your elbows" after throwing money away. </p>
