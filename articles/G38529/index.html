He received this name in 1881, and bore it until 1917.  Subsequently, the ICC became known as MUR.  He was in charge of the inquiry and disclosure of crimes related to the concept of criminal, as well as the search for those who committed or were involved in a crime and missing residents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tunnel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ICC work" class="if uuid-3110047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3110047.jpg"></div><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  The Moscow Criminal Investigation branch appeared in the middle of the 19th century.  Researchers are inclined to attribute its origin to the early period of Russia.  For the first time the words "detective" and "detective" appeared in the era of the emergence of the Russian centralized state of the XV-XVII centuries.  The very concept and norms of its implementation were determined at the level of laws.  They were set out in the judiciary, and later in the Cathedral Code of 1649. It is interesting that the concept of ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù included three functions: the search for the offender, the investigation and the trial using torture.  Understanding the hierarchy of detective posts is not easy. </p><p>  In Moscow and its district, the Zemsky order was engaged in detectives, the staff of which included a deceased, clerks, clerk and all sorts of servants.  In the rest of the country, labs, which were headed by labial wardens, were involved in the search, investigation, and trial.  In addition to them, the watchmen who were subordinate to them, guarding the prisons, executioners and heralds (biryuchi), announcing the decrees of the mouth institutions, and other decrees were involved in the investigation.  They were assisted by military commanders (Sotsky, Pentecostal). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.yaplakal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow criminal investigation" class="if uuid-3110029" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3110029.jpg"></div><h2>  Search methods </h2><p>  All labial huts were subordinate, and coordinated by the Rogue Order, which was in Moscow.  In addition, they were dealt with by agents of central authority, governors, volostelites, and service people: bailiffs, landlords, raiders (those who conducted searches).  The history of the Moscow Criminal Investigation stores information about how investigative actions were carried out in those distant times.  The search methods then were: </p><ul><li>  Baldness.  The conviction of a person in repeatedly committed crimes. </li><li>  Search.  A survey of the entire population about the identity of the suspect. </li><li>  Confrontation.  Elimination of contradictions in obtaining data on a crime, a criminal. </li><li>  Experience.  Torture of a suspect in order to obtain a confession.  It was the main method of investigation. </li></ul><p>  Probably, the list of methods has not changed much since then.  The names nevertheless underwent some changes, additional investigation methods appeared, but the main list remained unchanged. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow criminal investigation methods of work" class="if uuid-3110045" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3110045.jpg"></div><h2>  Peter's times </h2><p>  Under Peter I, regular police were formed and the posts of fiscals, secret supervisors for all affairs, were established.  In 1729, a Search Order was created in Moscow, which became the prototype of the Moscow Criminal Investigation; a central body, the Search Expedition, was formed in St. Petersburg. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The duties of the Squad included the following actions.  After filing a petition (request, statement) or denunciation, the authorities gave instructions to the informer (investigator).  He began to collect information on this case.  They compiled a mandate that contained information about where the criminal was located, where the stolen goods were stored, etc. The order was transferred to the clerk of the Detective Department, who carried out a train (detention) with the military team in the presence of witnesses (devious).  In 1763, the Search Order was abolished, and a Search Expedition was formed at the provincial chancellery. </p><h2>  19th Century Reforms </h2><p>  An important stage of the reforms was the formation in 1802 of the Ministry of the Interior.  But the most important thing was the conclusion, in 1860, of judicial and investigative functions from subordination to the police.  She conducted only criminal offenses and detention.  These actions in the cities were performed by city guards and bailiffs.  In the districts, these duties were imputed to the bailiffs, the elders of the volost, and in the villages - to the elders.  In 1864, the Charter of Criminal Procedure was adopted, which reflected all the norms of conducting criminal cases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="taynikrus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Criminal Investigation History" class="if uuid-3110035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3110035.jpg"></div><h2>  Formation of the Moscow Criminal Investigation Department (ICC) </h2><p>  On the basis of the adopted Charter, the competence of the police included an inquiry, which was supposed to collect all the information using the search, interviewing witnesses and surveillance conducted behind the scenes.  For this purpose, for the first time in Russia, specialized police units were to be created, the competence of which was charged with the disclosure of criminal offenses and the conduct of inquiries.  In 1881, as part of the reforms, criminal investigation departments were formed.  As an independent organization, part of the Moscow Criminal Investigation appeared in 1908, after the State Duma of the Russian Empire adopted the law on the units of the Constitutional Court. </p><h2>  Responsibilities of the Criminal Investigation </h2><p>  The newly formed detective offices were tasked with conducting the inquiry procedure, which included: </p><ul><li>  Collection of evidence (evidence). </li><li>  The search and detention of persons suspected of involvement in the commission of criminal offenses. </li><li>  The creation of an intelligence network in an organized crime environment. </li><li>  At the request of the bailiffs, the execution of a number of specific activities. </li><li>  Conducting records, which included file cabinets with fingerprints. </li></ul><p>  The methods of work of the Moscow Criminal Investigation, like all actions of police officers, were strictly regulated by legal documents and laws.  In particular, the use of weapons had to be carried out according to special rules.  In this form, the unit lasted until 1917. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yaplakal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow criminal investigation" class="if uuid-3110027" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3110027.jpg"></div><h2>  Why did they call policemen ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù? </h2><p>  This is probably of interest to many, where did the name "garbage" come from.  The Moscow Criminal Investigation had the acronym ICC.  In 1908, he was headed by one of the talented Russian detectives A.F.  Cat.  He managed to put the work of the department in such a way that in the shortest possible time it becomes the best in Russia.  There is a version that Moscow detectives at that time began to be called "garbage." </p><p>  Although there are other versions.  For example, that this word came from the Hebrew word ‚Äúmuser,‚Äù which means a scammer, a spy.  Since secret agents worked at the ICC, they began to call them ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù in Russian.  Probably no one can say how true this is. </p>
