    <p>  Born in the year 39 Titus Flavius.  Vespasian was his father, and his mother was Domicilla.  Titus became the <span>first emperor of Rome</span> to inherit power from his own father.  But it will happen much later.  He spent his young years at the court of Claudius and Nero.  This was due to the dangerous situation in Rome with the strengthening of the power of Agrippina. </p><p>  After the death of Agrippina, Flavius ‚Äã‚Äãwas able to return to Rome.  His military career began on the lands of Britain and Germany.  Titus (future emperor) received the post of military tribune, and later took up questure.  His father also began his career. </p><p>  During the outrage in Judea, Nero sent Vespasian to resolve the situation.  Titus went with his father, he began to command the legion.  In Judea, the young man strengthened as a military leader. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Being a power-hungry man, Titus wanted more.  When another struggle for power began in Rome, Titus decided to promote his father Vespasian as emperor.  At first he waited a while, after attracting an influential Syrian ruler to his side.  His plan was a success, his father became emperor in 69. </p><h2>  Role in the Jewish war </h2>

    <p>  Vespasian left Judea, entrusting the main command to his son.  While in Judea, Titus began a relationship with the daughter of Herod Agrippa the First, the beautiful Berenice.  He later took her with him to Rome.  However, this did not prevent him from destroying Jerusalem.  And he did it with great cruelty. </p><p>  Titus returned to Rome with triumph, he became co-ruler of his father.  Officially, he took up the post of prefect of the guard, but could interfere in government affairs, use the tribune power. </p><p>  Under Vespasian, Titus was suspicious and merciless.  He killed those who seemed to him dangerous to the power of his father.  Once he invited the consul Avl Tsetsin to his meal and ordered him killed.  The Romans did not like the extreme cruelty of Titus.  In addition, they feared that his companion (a Jew from Judea) would later become Augusta. </p><h2>  Reign </h2><p>  Vespasian died in 79 (1st century), and Titus took his place.  The public was negative about his rule.  To rectify the situation, the emperor took the following measures: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  severely punished scammers; </li><li>  held luxurious games for the people; </li><li>  pardoned those who were accused of insulting the emperor. </li></ul>

    <p>  Titus (emperor of Rome) reformed the justice system.  Under his rule, it became exactly what it is being studied today as Roman law.  Under him, not a single Roman senator was arrested.  Although before that there was a practice of not only arresting them, but also executing them.  He also supported special programs whose task was to provide assistance to victims of catastrophes. </p><p>  Titus (emperor) ended his reign in 81.  Death found him suddenly.  He died of fever in the same villa as Vespasian.  At that time he was forty-two years old. </p><p>  Titus was married twice, from his second marriage he had a daughter.  Therefore, his successor was the younger brother Domitian. </p><h2>  Good memory of Titus </h2>

    <p>  Titus' reign lasted only two years.  During this time (1st century), three of the most famous events in the history of ancient Rome took place: </p><ol><li>  The world's largest stadium was built and opened - the Flavian Amphitheater, which everyone knows by the unofficial name of the Colosseum. </li><li>  There was an eruption of Vesuvius, which killed Pompeii. </li><li>  Rome was almost completely destroyed by fire and rebuilt again. </li></ol><p>  For all his merits after death, Titus (emperor) was deified by the Senate.  The decision was made at a special hearing, which was held every time after the death of the ruler.  The Senate decided how the descendants would relate to the deceased historical person.  They cursed some (Nero, Caligula), and deified others.  After this, the Romans did not change the decision adopted by the Senate. </p>
