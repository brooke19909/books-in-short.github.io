It became cross-border after Narva already belonged to a neighboring state.  The date of foundation of this settlement is considered to be 1492.  It was then that at this place the Moscow Prince Ivan III built a fortress, which was later named after him.  It was built opposite the <span>fortress of Estonian</span> Narva.  Perhaps that is why in many German documents it is referred to as "counter-Narva." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ivangorod sights" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/286561.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  What to see first of all, having arrived in Ivangorod?  Sights of this settlement include in its list of many <span>interesting places</span> and structures, the main of which is the fortress, which laid the foundation for the city.  Until now, only a few fragments of this structure have been preserved.  Initially, it was a quadrangular structure, in the corners of which were four square towers.  The walls were erected from local limestone, and their thickness reached 3 meters.  They ended with teeth, where loopholes were located.  Thanks to numerous restorations, the fortress has significantly changed and expanded.  Now it is a complete <span>architectural ensemble,</span> towering on Maiden‚Äôs Mountain, which is washed from three sides by the waters of Narva. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Continuing to study Ivangorod, its sights can be supplemented with religious buildings.  Thus, the Holy Trinity Church is the family burial place of the Stieglitz family, it was built in 1873 in the style of historicism, which clearly conveys elements of 17th-century Russian architecture.  The main material for the construction was brick.  Ultimately, the building is a five-domed structure, the foundation of which is laid out in the shape of a cross.  A bell tower was built above the western entrance, where ten bells are placed.  The interior is famous for its wealth and sophistication. </p><p>  But these are not all the attractive buildings that Ivangorod is famous for.  Sights include in their list a number of interesting structures, including the Assumption Cathedral, located on Kingisepp Highway.  Together with the small St. Nicholas Church, they make up a single architectural ensemble. </p>

The energy generated with their help served as the basis for the construction of a linen-spinning canvas cloth factory.  These waterfalls are in an old, over-dried river bed.  There is only one small feature: you can see them only a few days a year in the spring, when excess water comes down from the <span>Narva reservoir.</span>  For the rest of the time, these are just big stones. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ivangorod leningrad region" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/286559.jpg" width="317"></div>

    <p>  What else to see when arriving in Ivangorod?  Attractions can be supplemented by a list of numerous museums, including the Ivangorod Art Museum, which consists of three objects: a fortress, an art gallery and the museum itself.  The latter contains a large collection of Bilibin's works, which is complemented by works by other artists.  The art gallery constantly hosts various exhibitions, demonstrating new talents. </p>
