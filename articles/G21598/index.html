DIY alterations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the advent of heat, I want to please myself with new things.  But the biggest sadness for every fashionista is to be next to a girl dressed in the same dress.  Yes, unfortunately, this has to be contemplated constantly.  Either two "identical" ladies will drop into the minibus, then at the playground of children's mummies you confuse because of sundresses.  But everyone so wants to be individual and unique!  But this is not so bad, but if you come to your best friend's birthday, and in a restaurant you happen to find a girl in exactly the same dress?  How could the situation be more annoying? </p><p>  Therefore, it's time to tackle the alterations from the men's shirt.  Photos and descriptions presented below will allow you to choose a model for every taste. </p><h2>  To sew or not to sew - that is the question </h2><p>  Do not like meeting girls in the same dress?  There is only one way out - to sew an outfit for yourself.  Costly and long?  And no!  You can make a dress from a men's shirt.  Alterations of such a plan look quite interesting, and certainly no one will have such a dress.  Here the math is simple: the larger the size of the original product, the more space for the flight of fantasy.  <span>Remaking from a men's shirt</span> to women's clothing is a very interesting process.  And although many craftswomen claim that it is much easier to cut and sew again than to alter the old, the shirt can be considered as a half-finished product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="from a man‚Äôs shirt alteration" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1712966.jpg" width="500"></div>

At the same time, do not forget to measure the volume of the chest and hips and leave 5 cm of allowances for a free fit.  It remains to cut out the details where the <span>collar</span> and button fastener will already be <span>processed</span> .  Don't like the men's collar?  It is easy to make it female using embroidery with ribbons or beads.  And now before us is a feminine thing from a man‚Äôs shirt.  Alterations may be different, but often no one will say that once it was clothes for a "big" man. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alterations from men's shirts master class" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1712025.jpg" width="542"></div>

    <h2>  Option two: dress with a sleeve </h2><p>  Collar categorically not satisfied?  So, we cut it off completely, making a cutout with a boat.  The main thing here is to measure the width of your own shoulders, so as not to guess with the size.  It is necessary to cut the neckline more than the required width of ten centimeters, tuck and grind the cut and put an elastic in it.  If the width of the shirt allows, you can make a one-piece sleeve, extending the shoulder seam.  Next, measure the distance from the shoulder to the center of the chest and transfer it to the details of the cut.  It is at this level that half the measure of breast volume is noted.  At the waist, such a dress can be fitted with tucks or assembled with a rubber band.  In order not to miscalculate, it is necessary to measure the height from the shoulder to the waist and from the shoulder to the hips.  Directly on the fabric with tailor's chalk, you can mark these boundaries and then work out the width of the panels in accordance with the volumes.  In the summer wardrobe, this alteration from a man‚Äôs shirt will occupy a worthy place.  With your own hands, you can crochet cotton lace to it or sew a purchased openwork cloth on the bottom of the dress.  In any case, the lovely details will make the dress weightless and seductive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="remaking from a man‚Äôs shirt to a woman‚Äôs" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1712035.jpg" width="600"></div>

Alterations in a sundress require a little more effort, but it's worth it!  So, first you should cut the panels of the skirt for a sundress, the back should be cut 7 cm higher than before.  The chest will look much more interesting if it is detachable.  By the way, this option allows you to use not so large sizes, both in height and in width.  Long sleeves will go to the design of the chest.  To do this, cut two trapezoid with a base equal to one fourth of the chest circumference, and the upper edge of about 10 cm. The height of the figure is calculated as follows: measure "chest height" + 4 cm. Next, you need to determine the sides where the details will converge in the center of the front panel of the sundress .  The base of the trapezoid here needs to be smoothly cut by one and a half centimeters and thereby raise the side.  By cutting, you should make the fabric turn inside out or sew a slanting trim.  Next, the details need to be sewn to the top of the front panel, forming folds under the chest.  When this stage is over, you can close the side seams and process the remaining sections with a <span>slanting inlay</span> .  After the stage begins work on the straps or ties.  Simple strips of fabric inserted into the drawstring of the upper side of the trapezoid, which has already become a part of the chest, can be sewn at the shoulder blades on the back panel of the sundress or simply tied around the neck.  Fantasy will tell you what to do. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alterations from a man‚Äôs shirt photo" class="if" height="481" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1712967.jpg" width="564"></div>

    <h2>  Sewing ideas </h2><p>  In addition to dresses, you can sew original blouses from a men's shirt.  Alterations to the top or an interesting blouse with lace and frills will make a man's garment unrecognizable.  What to do with the clasp on the other side?  If this is a problem, then it is solvable!  Just when cutting, the front fabric of the shirt can be cut upside down.  However, few will pay attention to the buttons, if you approach the design correctly.  Flounce sleeves, frill on the chest, lace inserts on the shoulders and back, ribbon embroidery, peplum - these are just a small part of how to decorate a blouse from a man‚Äôs shirt.  Alterations can be so ingenious that girlfriends will start asking for the address of a boutique where you can buy such beauty.  By the way, they don‚Äôt need to know where the gorgeous blouse actually came from. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alteration from a man‚Äôs shirt do it yourself" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1712005.jpg" width="332"></div>
