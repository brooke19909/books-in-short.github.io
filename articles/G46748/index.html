Our country today has at its disposal, according to rough estimates, about 700 thousand lawyers.  Among them there are those whose names are well known.  So who are they - the most famous lawyers in Russia? </p><h2>  At the origins of Russian law </h2><p>  In 1722, Peter I signed a decree establishing the post of Attorney General, and Count Yaguzhinsky became the first.  In his new position, he especially zealously monitored the legality and justice of the resolution of all cases.  The count was very smart and adventurous, for which he received the location of the king himself. </p>

    <p>  The first <span>well-known lawyers in</span> Russia are more familiar to many as writers and civil activists, but they have done a lot in jurisprudence.  So, the well-known statesman of that era, Gavrila Derzhavin, who was the first Minister of Justice in the history of the state, had a hand in the formation of law in Russia.  He held the post for only a year, but managed to do a lot - to initiate the formation of an arbitration court, to prevent the appointment of people to senior positions in communications, and to fight bribery. </p><p>  <span>Alexander Radishchev was</span> also a famous Russian lawyer.  He received his education in Leipzig, but he began to engage in full-fledged legal activity in Russia only after exile for freethinking literary works.  Then he became the author of many legal works and treatises.  And Radishchev is considered the father of judicial statistics, since it was he who began to study, analyze and systematize criminal law phenomena. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Famous Russian lawyers of the 19th century </h2><p>  This time was marked by two prominent figures.  So, the name of Anatoly Koni is familiar from the lessons of history even to those who are far from the legal world.  This is an outstanding judicial figure, prosecutor, publicist.  In addition, he created several works on legal topics, which were reprinted repeatedly.  He also engaged in teaching at the main law faculties of the country. </p>

    <p>  Well-known lawyers in pre-revolutionary Russia include the name of the illustrious Fedor Plevako, who was called both Krasnoslov and Zlatoust.  He knew how to convey his thoughts to everyone, controlled the crowd with the skill of a virtuoso and became famous thanks to his lawyer's speeches.  As a lawyer, he represented his clients in civil and criminal cases and most of them won simply brilliantly.  Plevako was so famous that his speeches were printed in newspapers, and people came to his speeches just to hear the <span>great speaker.</span> </p><h2>  20th century lawyers </h2><p>  During the Soviet Union, it was difficult to become an outstanding lawyer without occupying an important public position.  Nevertheless, the <span>famous lawyers of Russia of the</span> 20th century are famous for their contribution to the history of our country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  One of the most prominent legal figures in the USSR is Andrei Vyshinsky, who was not only a prosecutor and foreign minister, but also Stalin's confidant.  Despite a brilliant mind and outstanding political and state powers, the figure is very ambiguous.  So, he unconditionally supported all decisions of the government.  Moreover, without his visa, not a single order of a single people's commissar received a move.  He also was a member of the commission on resolving issues with the death penalty, presided over all the high-profile cases of that era, for example, was one of the main members of the Soviet commission at the Nuremberg Tribunal and the actual curator of repressive organs in the USSR. </p>

    <p>  The name of lawyer Vadim Klyugvant is now inextricably linked with the high-profile case of Yukos and Mikhail Khodorkovsky.  Having received <span>money laundering for</span> 14 years, Khodorkovsky nevertheless achieved early release, but, as the media assure, this was possible only thanks to Klugvant‚Äôs ability to reach the president himself. </p><h2>  Famous Women Lawyers </h2><p>  According to statistics, today the profession has the same number of men and women, however, high posts and high-profile cases go mainly to men.  But among them there are also truly successful and well-known female lawyers in Russia. </p><p>  This can be called Tamara Morshchakova, who is famous for co-authorship of the Constitution of the Russian Federation and the position of judge of the Constitutional Court.  She was a supporter of the liberal wing and defended the rule of law.  After the resignation, she did not finish her career and taught at many of the most serious universities in the country, and at the invitation of D. Medvedev, she took part in the consideration of the Yukos case. </p>

    <p>  Another prominent female name in a series of high-profile trials in modern Russia is Irina Khrunova.  She, along with Farid Murtazin, represented in court the interests of Ekaterina Samutsevich, a member of the scandalous group Pussy Riot.  She was lucky with lawyers, as one Samutsevich managed to get a <span>suspended sentence,</span> while other participants received real terms.  The successful lawyer is also famous for representing Khodorkovsky in the case against Berezovsky. </p><h2>  Young lawyers of Russia </h2><p>  The most significant among the young lawyers of Russia can be called the Chechen Murad Musaev.

    <p>  Musaev became famous thanks to the case of Albert Tsoev, who shot the guard of the President of South Ossetia in 2011.  He was threatened with life imprisonment, but thanks to the efforts of Musaev and the proven state of affect of his client, Tsoev escaped with an insignificant period of only 2.5 years. </p><h2>  The notorious lawyers of Russia </h2><p>  Among modern Russian lawyers there are also those who are heard not only because of their undoubted successes in the profession, but also in scandalous stories or excessive publicity. </p><p>  The first of them, undoubtedly, is the lawyer Dobrovinsky, who is known not only for his clients (pop stars, artists, disgraced oligarchs and other public people), but also due to his remarks about opponents.  Has the award as the best lawyer of Russia in 2003. </p>
