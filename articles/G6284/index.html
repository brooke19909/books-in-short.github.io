    <h2>  Proclamation of the Russian Empire </h2><p>  On September 10, 1721, already at the end of the <span>Northern War,</span> Sweden and Russia concluded the <span>Nishtad peace,</span> as a result of which the latter annexed Estonia, Livonia, partly Karelia and Ingria.  The rest of the land that Peter I managed to capture, he returned back to Sweden.  As you can see, the history of Russia (the 18th century is no exception) is very rich and interesting.  Both sides also agreed to release all prisoners.  As a result of all this, Russia became a European power.  The Senate proclaimed Peter the Great ‚ÄúGreat‚Äù and gave him the titles ‚ÄúEmperor of All-Russian‚Äù and ‚ÄúFather of the Fatherland‚Äù.  Russia has become a prosperous empire.  However, the formation of the latter entailed a number of reforms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Church and military reforms </h2>

    <p>  It should be noted that the year 1721 in the history of Russia is famous for a large number of reforms.  So, 12 colleges were created that had a certain field of activity.  Great church and military reforms were carried out.  The most significant events are the adoption in 1721 of the Spiritual Regulation, which made the church dependent on power.  In addition, the <span>Holy Synod</span> was created <span>,</span> since the patriarchate was completely liquidated.  Quite often, 1721 in the history of Russia is celebrated as a time when the property of the church was taken away for the needs of the state, and more specifically, the emperor. </p><p>  As for military reforms, <span>military ranks</span> were introduced here <span>,</span> common to all of Russia.  Also this year a powerful fleet was created.  It is known that Peter I created an army with his own hands, the number of which amounted to more than 200,000 people.  Russian troops won many victories, this created favorable conditions for the further development of military equipment.  The Navy is divided into squadrons, and the land infantry is divided into regiments and units.  Such a classification made it possible to introduce some discipline and increase the fighting spirit of soldiers, as well as to act more coherently during hostilities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Changing Economics and Cultural Innovations </h2><p>  In the financial sector, many taxes have been introduced, including indirect ones.  A penny has become the main coin.  It cannot be said that the year 1721 in the history of Russia is also known as the time when the people were as poor as never before.  The fact is that the treasury was replenished by increasing taxes.  Even so, government money managed to steal in large quantities.  But at the same time there was no hunger or shortage of essential goods. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="1721 year event in Russia" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19732/398471.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <span>Peter the First</span> is known for introducing a ban on his beard.  Thus, he struggled with an obsolete lifestyle.  It should be noted that secular educational institutions are beginning to appear.  The beginning of these innovations falls precisely in 1721.  An event in Russia of this kind caused a storm of emotions among the common population. </p><p>  But this is far from all: the first newspaper is published, and foreign books are translated into Russian.  It is also worth paying attention to the fact that in 1721 medical, engineering and artillery schools were created.  At the same time, a network of theological schools appeared.  Their main purpose is the training of priests.  To educate the children of the military, several garrison schools were built. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In conclusion, I would like to say that 1721 in the history of Russia has changed a lot, and all thanks to the wise ruler.  At this time, the extradition of girls to forced marriage was canceled.  Thanks to this step, the king fell in love with people, despite the high taxes.  We can say that Peter the Great actively trained artists.  Moreover, he sent his to study abroad, and invited foreign to himself.  These are the times of the formation of an absolute monarchy, the peak of which was the emperor.  Industry is developing, higher education is emerging among the middle class. </p>

    <p>  Now at the sight of the king there was no need to fall to his knees, and near his house in winter it was possible not to take off his hat.  All this contributed to the fact that Peter the Great was loved and respected by people.  Most of his reforms were justified and went to the good of the state.  He also approved a decree establishing the Academy of Sciences, which was opened after his death. </p>
