  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Seven year war</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The seven-year war of 1756-1763 is considered one of the largest military conflicts in modern times.  It took place both in Europe and overseas: in the Caribbean, <span>North America, the</span> Philippines, India.  All the great countries of Europe, most of the small and medium-sized European states, and individual <span>Indian tribes</span> participated in this conflict <span>.</span>  <span>Winston Churchill</span> called the Seven Years War "World War I."  It is also called colonial, due to the fact that in the conflict there was a clash of the colonial interests of Spain, France, and Great Britain. </p><p>  In Europe, the main confrontation was due to Silesia between Prussia and Austria, which the latter lost in previous battles. </p><p>  The seven-year war, the reasons for which were largely related to the Anglo-French colonial rivalry in North America, began long before its official announcement.  The conflict laid the foundation for the violation of the system of military-political alliances prevailing in Europe.  Thus, the war of France officially declared by Great Britain in 1756 caused an international reorientation of some European states. </p><p>  However, a third force soon appeared.  In Prussia Frederick II came to power.  Since then, this state has begun to claim the role of a leading power in European politics. </p><p>  The strengthening of Prussia due to Silesia taken away from Austria in Russia was perceived as a danger to its western borders and interests in the north of Europe and in the Baltic.  The participation of Russians in the war was largely determined by the union treaty with Austria. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Frederick II, without waiting for his opponents to take any action, in 1756, on August 28, suddenly invaded Saxony, allied with Austria, and occupied it.  The beginning of 1757 was marked by the entry of the Prussian army into Bohemia.  On May 6, the Austrians were defeated in Prague.  After this victory, Frederick was about to move to Vienna without delay, but his plans were hindered by the Austrian army.  In 1757, June 18, the Austrians under the command of L. Down inflicted a heavy defeat on the Prussians, dispelling the prevailing myth of their invincibility.  Due to the failure of the battle, Frederick II was forced to leave besieged Prague and return to Saxony. </p><p>  In 1757, in October, a flying detachment of Hadik briefly captures Berlin (the capital of Prussia).  Having defended the city and averted the threat from the country, Frederick II transferred his army to Silesia.  On December 5, the Prussians defeated the Austrians at Leuthen.  Thus, a ‚Äúcombat draw‚Äù was achieved. </p><p>  Russia's participation in the Seven Years War began in the summer of 1757.  The Russian army was commanded by Apraksin.  For the state, the Seven Years War was successful.  So, during the hostilities with the support of the Baltic Fleet, Fermor‚Äôs corps took Memel, the clash of the main forces of the Russian army with the Prussians at Gross-J√§gersdorf ended in the defeat of Frederick. </p><p>  In 1759, on August 12, the <span>Prussian army</span> was defeated in the Battle of Kunersdorf.  This and other defeats forced Frederick II to propose to England to establish a peaceful congress.  However, the proposal was never implemented in connection with the implacable position of Austria and Russia.  These two powers hoped to use the victories of 1759 in a subsequent campaign to deliver the final blow to Prussia. </p><p>  Thus, hostilities continued. </p><p>  The year 1761 was not marked by any significant battles.  At this time, the Seven Years' War was largely conducted by maneuvering. </p><p>  At the same time, Frederick himself, and all of Europe, do not believe that Prussia will be able to avoid defeat.  It was clear that the resources of a small state were incommensurable with the strength of opponents. </p><p>  While Frederick begins to look for ways to start peace negotiations, <span>Elizaveta Petrovna</span> dies in Russia <span>.</span>  Instead, the throne is occupied by Peter 3. Being a longtime admirer of Frederick, the Russian emperor signs the Peace of St. Petersburg with him, voluntarily giving up all conquests.  This act of Peter 3 and his entire policy aroused strong indignation in Russian society.  The emperor lost popularity and was eventually overthrown. </p><p>  The seven-year war ended as a result of the complete exhaustion of the warring parties in 1763. </p>
