    <h2></h2><h2>  Standard way </h2><p>  If you do not want to spend a lot of time on needlework, then this option is for you.  It‚Äôs not a secret for anyone that do-it-yourself wedding albums are completely optional, since they can be bought almost everywhere.  However, such a standard collection of pictures can be designed creatively and originally.  To do this, arrange the photos in some special way, add wishes from your guests, and also decorate a couple of pages with some special elements (for example, a dried twig from a wedding bouquet). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Blank album </h2><p>  Today on sale you can find blanks for creating a book of photographs with your own hands.  As a rule, they are albums of various formats with a blank cover, sheets of cardboard and a strong binding.  Also, in some blanks, it is possible to adjust the number of pages depending on how many pictures you want to place.  Having such a foundation, you get an excellent opportunity for creativity. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Scrapbooking </h2><p>  Real craftswomen make wedding albums with their own hands literally from and to.  This method is very popular and involves the creation of a blank for a book of photographs, as well as its design not only with pictures, but also with thematic drawings, newspaper and magazine clippings, notes, memorable trifles, etc. To make an album in this style, you should stock up on the necessary materials in advance such as glue, sharp scissors, threads, colored paper and cardboard with different textures and patterns, colored pencils, markers, crayons, paints, various decorative elements (beads, cords, ribbons, rhinestones, flowers, sparkles  ki, stickers, cards, confetti, and so on. d.), as well as everything else that will tell you your imagination. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  There are several very successful and popular scrapbooking techniques.  One of them with certainty can be called embroidery.  You can beautifully embroider the names of the newlyweds or some suitable picture on the topic.  Also a very good element is the presence of notes.  So, you can put comments on the pictures or put on one of the pages of the album a short funny story about what happened to the young on the wedding day or in anticipation of it.  Notes can be written both by hand and created on a computer using various fonts and letter sizes. </p><p>  Another popular element of scrapbooking is framing.  At the same time, excess background and details are removed from the photos, which allows you to focus on the main subject.  However, it is important not to overdo it.  After all, cut off parts over time can take on a new sentimental or historical meaning, which will make you regret their removal. </p><h2></h2><h2>  How to make a DIY wedding album step by step </h2><p>  As a master class, we bring to your attention a way to make a paperback wedding photo book. </p>

    <p>  For work, we need: fabric, a dense folder with rings, threads, one or two centimeters wide foam rubber, Moment glue or glue gun, <span>double-sided tape,</span> thick paper or cardboard.  It is advisable to choose fabric and other decorative elements in accordance with the design of the wedding celebration itself.  In this case, your album will be a great addition to the holiday and emphasize your inherent sense of style. </p><p>  If the folder dusted for a long time in the cabinet, then it is imperative to clean it from dust.  From the foam rubber, we cut out a rectangle, the dimensions of which coincide with the crust of the folder, to which we glue the workpiece with a glue gun. </p>

    <p>  The next step is to give the album a general look.  So, from a well-ironed fabric, we cut out a rectangle.  Its length on the one hand should be equal to the height of the folder, plus 8 centimeters, and on the other, two sides of the crust plus the binding width and plus another 8 centimeters.  In order not to engage in calculations, you can simply open the folder and circle it on the fabric, adding eight more centimeters on both sides. </p><p>  After all measurements are completed and the rectangle is cut out of the fabric, we move on to wrapping it around our future album.  For this purpose, it is best to use double-sided tape.  Be sure to keep in mind that the material must be pulled tight enough so that wrinkles do not appear in the future, significantly spoiling the appearance.  After that, we cut out two rectangles from thick paper or cardboard, the size of which is slightly smaller than the crust.  We paste them on the inside of the folder to make invisible the junction of the fabric with the cover. </p><p>  After the main work has been done, you can proceed to the most interesting, namely to decorate the book of photographs.  You can decorate it with everything that your imagination tells you: rhinestones, beads, bows, dry flowers, etc. The decor can be made in the colors <span>of the album cover</span> or contrasted with it.  However, do not rush to immediately tightly stick the jewelry.  First, simply attach them with a needle and thread and see how the composition looks. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, do-it-yourself wedding albums can be done by almost everyone.  Having spent a little time and effort, you will receive a book of photographs that will delight you and your loved ones for many years to come. </p>
