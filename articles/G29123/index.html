You can completely immerse yourself in the atmosphere of bygone times and learn more about the life of our ancestors in the suburbs of the northern capital.  It is enough to visit the unique ethnographic and entertainment center in the Petrodvorets district of St. Petersburg - “Shuvalovka Village”. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.867441" data-lng="29.98209099999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/9/0/290.png"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The ethnographic complex got its name in honor of a really existing village located in the same area.  Even under Peter the Great, the lands on which today the settlement of Shuvalovka is located were granted to General I. I. Buturlin.  According to the documentary evidence of 1719-1721, at that time there were five Chukhon courtyards here.  Subsequently, the estate changed several owners, but only one of them glorified it.  The village Shuvalovka got its modern name in the 1750s.  It was at that time that I. I. Shuvalov, the <span>favorite of Elizabeth</span> Petrovna, became the new owner of the estate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kudago.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian village of Shuvalovka" class="if uuid-2235686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/2235686.jpg"></div><p>  The Empress personally visited these places with a court, the estate steadily developed and improved.  However, the subsequent history of Shuvalovka is sad.  The estate changed several owners, the main house of Shuvalov was turned into a farm and was rebuilt several times.  After the 1917 revolution, two marks on independent settlements appear on the map - Shuvalovka and Znamenskaya.  During World War II, all objects of historical cultural heritage were destroyed here.  The ethnographic complex begins its history only in 2002.  All buildings included in its structure are modern reconstructions of samples of ancient Russian architecture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Russian Village Shuvalovka": description and photo </h2><p>  All objects included in the cultural and tourist complex are made of wood.  In the design and construction of the village, architects relied on historical plans and a description of the area.

When visiting the ethnographic complex, guests can not only enjoy architectural masterpieces, but also learn more about the life of our ancestors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="al-spbphoto.narod.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ethnographic complex Shuvalovka village" class="if uuid-2235688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/2235688.jpg"></div><p>  The village has a farmyard, craft and pottery workshops, a forge, a mill and even a real boat.  “Izba Ekimova” is another object that deserves close attention.  This is a high-quality copy of the original old building, located today in the Vitoslavlitsy Museum.  It makes sense to visit the “Russian Village of Shuvalovka” not only in the warm season.
