    <h2>  Messages </h2><p>  Of particular delight for subscribers is the cost of messages within the region of connection.  Anyway, in Russia as a whole.  If you send SMS to the numbers of your city and region, then get ready to give only 90 kopecks (or 60 each).  In other words, now calls and messages are the same.  And inexpensive.  Subscribers quite often emphasize this feature when talking about the "Orange" tariff. </p><p>  In Russia, messages are transmitted at a higher cost.  For one SMS, give 2.5 rubles.  Buyers claim that this is not so much money.  Indeed, competitors of "Tele2" quite often the price tag of messages depends on the operator to whom you send the letter.  Yes, and it ranges from 5 to 10 rubles.  The difference is obvious. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Multimedia messages with their value also delight Tele2 subscribers.  Indeed, one such letter costs 6 rubles (in some regions - 4 each).  Regardless of where exactly in Russia you are sending it.  And on which operator - too.  So far, the Orange tariff (Tele2) offers truly favorable terms of use.

There are no sky-high prices that would scare away the buyer. </p><h2>  For the whole world </h2><p>  Tariff "Orange" ("Tele2") also receives reviews from its subscribers for calls around the world.  Few people pay attention to this feature.  But, nevertheless, if you suddenly have to call outside of Russia, you will not really think about the cost. </p><p>  Why?

The first one is the purchase of a new SIM card with this plan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff orange tele2 how to go" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1117789.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  To do this, you will have to contact the nearest Tele2 office.  Take your passport with you, and then inform the employee that you would like to buy a room with the Orange rate.  A few minutes of waiting - and the case is completed.  Check the correctness of filling in the data, select the number of your future phone and insert the SIM card into the mobile device.  Now you can enjoy all the benefits that you received after connecting.  Nothing complicated.  But only this option does not suit everyone.  Not really the desire to change the phone number every time you change the tariff. </p><h2>  Combinations </h2><p>  There are several more approaches to solving this issue.  How to connect the tariff "Orange" ("Tele2")?  First, check that you have at least 40 rubles on your phone.  This is the cost of changing the plan.  Ready? </p><p>  Secondly, you have to choose a method of tariff change.  You can call 630, and then use the voice robot to complete the action.  Not the best option if you want the process to go fast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tariff Orange Tele2 Voronezh" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1117788.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In this case, you can use a special "hot" combination.  It will automatically transfer you to the "Orange" tariff if there are enough funds in your account.  Dial * 630 * 8 #, then press the call key.  Wait for the SMS notification with the conclusion.  That's all.  Now you are connected to the tariff plan called "Orange" from "Tele2".  A free transition is carried out if you used the previous conditions of the operator for more than 30 days. </p>
