In addition to long-distance trains, a large number of trains run here serving the Moscow region and its environs. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The Yaroslavsky Station in Moscow is located at the place where the Artillery Yard and the road leading to Krasnoye Selo were built at the end of the 17th century.  This continued until 1862, it was then that a small station was built, serving the Moscow-Trinity Railway.  The station looked very modern: elegant lines, profiled traction and original windows were new at that time.  The passenger movement was opened in July 1862, the first train went to the village of Sergievo. </p>

    <p>  At the end of the XIX century, the station was rebuilt and got its current name, at that time it connected three cities - Moscow, Arkhangelsk and Yaroslavl.  After the station was electrified in 1929, much more trains began to run here, which caused a new need for the reconstruction of the building.  The last reconstruction was carried out in the spring of 2005, but still the building could not be restored to its historical appearance; it was irretrievably lost over the long years of its work.  In 2015, 25-ruble coins appeared, which were dedicated to the Yaroslavl station. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where can I leave from the station? </h2><p>  Are you planning to go east?

    <p>  The main direction that serves the Yaroslavsky station is the Urals, Siberia and the Far East.  Previously, the North also entered here, but recently most of the trains serving this direction have been transferred to another point of departure.  Trains departing from the Yaroslavl station often serve as the only means of transportation with which you can reach the capital.  International trains connecting Moscow with Beijing and Ulan Bator deserve special attention; in 1990, shuttle traders who sold goods from China and Mongolia operated there. </p><h2>  Electric trains </h2><p>  <span>Suburban trains</span> from the Yaroslavl station of Moscow connect the city with the largest settlements in the region.  By train, you can get to Zeleniy Bor, Pushkino, Aleksandrov I, Balakirevo, Monino, Krasnoarmeysk, Sergiev Posad and many other cities.  Electric trains run from 4 a.m. to midnight, their detailed schedule can be checked out at the box office. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Please note that the Yaroslavl move is very busy, so the schedule of electric trains may not always be relevant, frequent delays in movement are possible.  October train also passes through the Yaroslavsky station, but they do not stop; boarding and disembarking of passengers is prohibited there. </p>

    <h2>  Where to buy tickets? </h2><p>  If you have decided on the date of the trip and the train - it's time to contact the ticket offices of the Yaroslavl Station.  Some of them work around the clock, some have a limited mode of operation.  In all windows you can issue electronic tickets, a refund is issued in half of them, but bank cards are not accepted everywhere, so it is best to have cash with you. </p><p>  If you are unable to visit the ticket offices due to a busy schedule, you can buy a ticket using the official website of Russian Railways.  And in that and in another case, you will have the opportunity to choose any free seat in the car you like and immediately pay for it.  You can print tickets at the ticket office of the station, as well as using the terminals that are in the building.  If you cannot deal with the device yourself, you can ask for help from the staff of the institution. </p>

    <h2>  Metro </h2><p>  The metro is the most convenient means of transportation that <span>Moscow</span> possesses <span>.</span>  <span>The Yaroslavl metro station</span> also covers, next to it is the Komsomolskaya station.  The stop is simultaneously part of the Koltsevaya and Sokolnicheskaya metro lines, so getting to it will not be difficult. </p><p>  The station operates daily from 5:30 to 1 am, while the intervals here remain small regardless of the time of day.  ‚ÄúKomsomolskaya‚Äù is located under the square of the same name, on which there are three stations - Yaroslavsky, Kazan and Leningradsky (its second name is the square of Three stations).  That is why the metro will be easy to use to get to Yaroslavl. </p>

    <h2>  Ground transportation </h2><p>  If for some reason you cannot use the services of the subway, you will have to think about how to get to the Yaroslavl station using land transport.  Tram routes No. 7, 13, 37 and 50 run near <span>Komsomolskaya Square</span> ; you can also use trolleybuses No. 14, 41, 22 and 88. Please note that some electric transport numbers run late until the evening, and leave at the depot after nine in the evening. </p><p>  You can even get to the station by one of the many fixed-route taxis, as well as using bus routes No. 40 and No. 122. Ardent opponents of public transport in Moscow can use taxi services, but in this case, a large number of negative factors should be taken into account.  In addition to the high cost, a custom car is not very convenient because it can be stuck at any time, so if you still plan to use its services, leave at least a small margin of time for yourself. </p><h2>  Station Services </h2><p>  Yaroslavsky Station in Moscow offers its guests a range of services.  A local mini-hotel is working round the clock, a waiting room, you can use the services of a porter, visit the relaxation room.  Mothers with young children can be alone in the appropriate room, there are cafes and shops with reasonable prices. </p><p>  The first thing you will remember in Moscow is Yaroslavsky Station, the Komsomolskaya metro station and the square of Three stations.  To make it more comfortable for you to travel around the city, the easiest way is to leave things in an automatic or manual storage room.  Returning to the station, you can relax, and even take a shower if necessary. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Yaroslavsky railway station in Moscow is far from the only one, however it is he who receives the most passengers seeking to see the capital.  In 2015/2016, the station will serve about 300 pairs of trains daily, the station management seriously believes that the number of trains will only increase from year to year, and therefore is thinking about creating a project for its reconstruction. </p><p>  All stations in the capital have a strong transport connection in the form of trains, subway and ground transportation.  If you need to transfer from one train to another, and for this you need to change the place of departure, try to choose a route so that there is at least some time left.  It is necessary to take into account traffic jams in the capital, as well as various factors that may arise during your trip to Moscow. </p>
