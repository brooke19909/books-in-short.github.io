  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rest in the Crimea.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Now, beautiful at any time of the year, and also quite close in location to the Russians, is the famous <span>resort city of Crimea</span> in our country <span>.</span>  And what does a real rest in Crimea really mean?  Why is he so attracting such a huge number of tourists from all over Russia to the CIS countries? </p><p>  Holidays in the Crimea is, above all, a unique vacation in the warm and gentle Black Sea.  It is worth noting that the swimming season here and at numerous coastal resorts in the Crimea begins in mid-May, and ends only in early October.  That is why last-minute trips to Crimea allow you to enjoy numerous sunny days, which are usually so scarce, especially long in our country in autumn and winter. The light atmosphere and pleasant climate are due to the fact that in the resorts of Crimea the average duration of sunny days often far exceeds such same indicators in Sochi or Nice. </p><p>  <span>The average temperature</span> that holds here in the coldest months usually does not fall below +1 degrees in winter.  In addition, due to its unique location in the vicinity of mineral springs, rest in the Crimea is considered a real place for quality treatment for many diseases.  This opinion has developed since ancient times.  Many patients went here, who were positively influenced not only by the healing climate of the Black Sea coast, but also by <span>salt baths,</span> which are still advised by doctors at the resort. </p><p>  This healthy sea air, which is rich in many salts and passes through the steppe herbs, is unique not only for prevention, but also for treating a huge number of various diseases in the respiratory tract and diseases of the internal organs.  Also, unique healing mud and a large number of <span>thermal springs are</span> very popular in these resorts <span>.</span>  So it is safe to say that nature in these places generously rewarded man, and provided him with everything necessary for a quick and easy restoration of his health and a gradual accumulation of vitality. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is also unconditional that last-minute tours to Crimea are booked almost a month before the official departure, as places in boarding houses are usually occupied.  Here, in addition to medical procedures, there is a huge number of sports centers in which many girls come to lose weight following local diets.  Only natural and fresh vegetables and fruits will always be served on the table in the hotel and restaurant.  The abundance of various vegetables and fruits, many grape varieties, which grew on the fertile lands of Crimea, gives reason to characterize this region as the most fruitful. </p><p>  All vegetables and fruits produced by local residents on fertile lands, then travel around the country with large loads, and every day we have the opportunity to eat the most delicious and healthy products. </p><p>  Holidays in Crimea can afford a large number of tourists from different countries, even with a low income.  With the quick check-in at numerous <span>hotels in the Crimea</span> , there should also not be many problems, since most often booking tickets is carried out before the start of the trip.  Hotels will offer you the highest level of relaxation.  Due to the hospitality and accuracy in the work of all hotel workers, more and more vacationers in the Crimean resort choose them as their place of settlement.  Crimea hotels have always stood out as one of the most comfortable, which have a fairly high level of service.  Also, very close to the hotels are often located their own cleaned beaches and small fashionable restaurants of various cuisines of the world. </p>
