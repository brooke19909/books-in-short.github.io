Start modding with the very diapers!  Lovely babies already in a year understand that they are beautiful?  and so they love to admire themselves in the mirror, and those around them cheer and encourage.  But how could you not admire and indulge your favorite child with beautiful outfits?  And for this it is not necessary to run to an expensive children's goods store for shopping, because it will not be difficult for a girl (1 year old) to sew a dress.  A little effort, diligence, perseverance, and, of course, time - and the new little thing will certainly become one of the most beloved in the wardrobe of a little fashionista. </p><p>  Children's patterns are very simple to build.  There is no need to do many measurements and various calculations.  You can even say that when sewing children's clothes, simplified patterns are used that only remind the process of making clothes for adults with the main seams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern dress for girls 1 year" class="if" height="467" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1018428.jpg" width="235"></div>

    <h2>  Building a bodice template </h2><p>  In order to start working on the product, the baby should be measured.  It‚Äôs enough just the measurements of the chest.  You need to know this volume, do not rely on standards, because the children are all different and have their own characteristics of the body structure. </p><p>  How is the pattern built?  Dress for girls (1 year) does not require special calculations.  Shelves of the bodice are cut out of rectangular segments, the width of which is equal to half the circumference of the measurement of the breast + 5 cm. Usually for such babies the dress is made with a skirt from the line of the breast.  This model does not constrain movements and does not press on the tummy.  Therefore, the height of the rectangle, and therefore the bodice should not be more than 15 cm. The part is folded in half and a neck is drawn in the center of the bend.  Next, they move to the shoulder seams, which are slightly beveled to the cuts, about 1 cm. After that they make small indentations for the armhole.  There will be enough 8-9 cm of the height of the armhole.  The detail of the backrest is constructed in the same way, only with a cut in the middle of the shelf for zippers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As you can see, children's patterns are very simple to manufacture.  So do not be afraid that the product will not work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="children's patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1018424.jpg" width="463"></div>

    <h2>  Bodice assembly </h2><p>  What to do next, when the pattern is ready?  Dress for the girl (1 year) is sewn in parts, starting with the bodice.  First of all, the shoulder seams are closed, after the side seams and at this stage, the work could be postponed, subsequently filling out the neck sections and the armhole with an <span>oblique inlay.</span>  But in order to make a truly comfortable product, which will not only not press, but also possible seams that are rough for the delicate skin of a child, will not irritate, the bodice should be duplicated.  What does it mean?  You just need to cut three more details for the bodice from the same fabric, assemble them in the same sequence, and then connect them by closing the neck section and armhole inside the part.  To get it out neatly, you should first iron the parts inside out, sweep them, and then lay a neat line along the very edge. </p><h2>  Build and assemble skirts </h2><p>  For a skirt, you should take a strip of fabric equal to the length of two or three measures taken along the lower cut of the finished bodice, depending on the type of assembly.  By the way, it can be bow folds, or ordinary folds, or just a strip of fabric, gathered on a thread.  The creased folds are ironed a little and stitched to the lower cut of the bodice. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To make a neat seam, first connect the skirt to the front side (top) of the bodice.  The inner part should be treated with an overlock and on the front side, having smoothed the product well, lay a line along the alignment line at the very base of the skirt.  After that, it remains only to sew in a hidden zipper, and the dress for the child is ready. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dress knitted girl 1 year" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1018423.jpg" width="525"></div>

    <h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  Whatever the <span>pattern, the dress for the girl</span> (1 year) should be made of soft natural dress or knitted fabrics.  It should be borne in mind that the fabric should not contain wool and lurex, as they prick.  But synthetic materials are best used for the front of the bodice and skirt. </p><p>  <span>You can sew children's dresses</span> for the summer from batista, linen, staple, gauze, interlock knitwear or cooler.  For the winter version, velor on a cotton base is more suitable, as well as a footer with a pile. </p><p>  It should be noted here that when using hard fabrics, a soft lining should be made.  For example, if the <span>skirt is tulle,</span> then the bottom skirt should be made of cotton linen. </p>

    <h2>  Yarn selection </h2><p>  Of course, threads with natural fibers are best for children's clothing.  However, today there is a large selection of synthetic hypoallergenic yarn on sale, which can easily be used to make summer children's clothes.  So, for example, most children's yarn contains acrylic.  With such a thread, it is worth considering that the fabric will stretch during socks, and therefore the knitting should be tight.  A product from <span>cotton yarn</span> will look good after many washes only if you choose the so-called <span>mercerized cotton.</span>  This yarn is pleasant to the touch and has a beautiful sheen. </p><h2>  Practical tips for a stylish little lady </h2><p>  Dress knitted girl 1 year - this is an excellent option for a baptismal set.  In addition to it, you can tie beautiful flowers or lace frames for socks. </p>

    <p>  If the dress is sewn from fabric, a hat or kerchief of the same color is perfect for him.  Surely it would be impossible to take your eyes off such a small lady.  To make the image even more complemented, you can sew ruffles from a strip of material from which the dress is sewn to socks that are suitable in color.  To do this, cut out the tape from the material, process it with an overlock or zigzag, then collect with small stitches and sew to the top of the sock. </p><p>  Speaking about a dress for a little lady, one should not forget about the decor elements.  Various ribbons, ruffles, lace, mother-of-pearl buttons, bows and flowers - all these elements will make the outfit irresistible. </p><p>  We can‚Äôt but say a few words about how useful this pattern will be in the manufacture of clothes for the baby: a dress for a girl 1 year old, a T-shirt, top, sundress on shoulder straps - all these things will be easy to sew using this method of constructing a template.  Just a little modeling - and you can independently create a collection of summer dresses in which the baby will win the hearts of everyone around. </p>
