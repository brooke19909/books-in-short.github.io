  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Biography of the Polish politician Boleslav Take</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Boleslav Bierut (born April 18, 1892, died March 12, 1956, Moscow, Russia, USSR) is a politician in Poland.  His real name was Bernatsky.  He was born near the city of Lublin in a peasant family.  His political activity was very active, starting as a communist activist, he was able to become not only the chairman of the National Council, but also the president of the country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.welt.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="portrait of Boleslav Bierut" class="if uuid-3088462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3088462.jpg"></div><h2>  Boleslav Take, biography </h2><p>  He was educated at the Lublin School, but did not finish it, because in 1905 he was expelled from participating in a school strike, and a few years later he completed his studies at evening business courses.  In 1905, he began working as a typesetter in a print shop. </p><p>  The party activity of Boleslav Bierut began in 1912, at which time he joined the ranks of the left Polish Socialist Party (PPS).  Even then, he was a supporter of pro-Russian views, supported the ideas of the revolution proposed by Lenin.  Influenced by leftist socialist ideas, Bierut joined the Polish Communist Party in 1918 and spent the rest of his life organizing and propagating communist ideas in Poland. </p><div class="photo" data-original="weekend.gazeta.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Speech by Boleslav Bierut" class="if uuid-3088461" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3088461.jpg"></div><h2>  Communist figure </h2><p>  In the interwar period, he visited the USSR several times, where he graduated from the school of the Comintern (Communist International).  In recognition of his ideological fidelity, he was sent to Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Austria as an agent of the Comintern.  For political activity, he was arrested several times and imprisoned.  After returning to Poland (in 1933), he was appointed secretary of the district committee of the Communist Party of Poland in Lodz.  He was sentenced to 7 years in prison for anti-state activities.  Bereut was liberated in 1939 as a result of an amnesty. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the end, after his release, he left for Russia and remained there for most of World War II, returning to Poland in late 1943. </p><p>  With the outbreak of World War II, he was in areas occupied by Soviet troops;  In 1941-1943 he worked in the municipal administration in Minsk, Belarus.  In 1943, Bierut became a member of the Polish Workers' Party, from the very beginning he occupied a place in its leadership.  On New Year's Eve, Boleslav Bierut was sent to Poland by order of Stalin to create structures of the National Council created by the NDP.  The purpose of the National Council was to prepare the ground for the Communists, to ensure the seizure of power after the war. </p><p>  On June 28, 1945, the Provisional Government of National Unity was created in Poland.  The dominant role was played by representatives of communist and leftist groups.  A few months later, in December, the 1st Congress of the Polish Workers' Party was held, at the head of which was then Vladislav Gomulka.  Boleslav Bierut joined the Politburo of the Central Committee of the NDP as a secret member.  He was introduced as the non-partisan head of the National Council, formed on New Year's Eve on January 1, 1944.  Meanwhile, Bereut worked closely with Soviet intelligence and carefully defended the interests of Moscow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.uwazamrzehistoria.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Take on tree planting" class="if uuid-3088460" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3088460.jpg"></div><h2>  Posts and Posts </h2><p>  On February 4, 1947, the Legislative Diet elected Bierut as President of Poland.  According to historians, the results of these elections were rigged.  He held this post until July 22, 1952, while the new constitution, which had many features of the Soviet fundamental law, abolished the post of president.  In 1952-1954 he was prime minister of the Polish People‚Äôs Republic, and in 1954-1956 he was first secretary of the PUWP Central Committee. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Confrontation with Homulka </h2><p>  As the elected president of the Republic of Poland, Bierut quickly set about cleansing the party.  The head of the NDP, Vladislav Gomulka, did not want to implement plans for the collectivization of the Polish countryside.  He also opposed the imposition of sanctions on the leader of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, Marshal Joseph <span>Broz Tito,</span> with whom Stalin broke off relations in 1948. </p><p>  During a visit to the Kremlin in Moscow on August 15, 1948, Berut received permission to get rid of Vladislav Gomulka from the party.  The latter resigned after a heated discussion at the plenum of the Central Committee of the NDP, this happened on August 31.  A few days later, on September 3, 1948, Boleslav Bierut became the new general secretary of the Polish Workers' Party. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Take with children, 1951" class="if uuid-3088463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3088463.jpg"></div><h2>  Activities as a leader </h2><p>  The policy of Bierut not only made Poland dependent on the USSR, but also introduced many features of Soviet totalitarianism; he is responsible for the crimes committed during the Stalin period in Poland. </p><p>  After he played a major role in the seizure by his party of the Polish government after World War II, he was called the Polish Stalin. </p><p>  With the support of Stalin and the Soviet Army, Birut and his fellow communists were able to get rid of all active opposition by 1947, and he directed all his efforts to sovietization of all aspects of Polish life.  Always a loyal follower of party directives from Moscow, Bierut, as president of the Polish Republic, played an important role in the removal in 1948 of Vladislav Gomulka, the secretary of the Polish Workers' Party, who tried to adapt the Soviet party line to Polish circumstances.  They took him down and reorganized the party to form the Polish United Workers' Party (PUWP) in 1948.  In 1952, he left the presidency to become prime minister, but he resigned from his post in the same 1954.  He attended the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow, at which Nikita Khrushchev presented his famous report, "Crimes of the Stalin Era." </p><p>  The city of Kozlovka (Poland) is connected with his name, where there is a monument to this prominent political figure. </p>
