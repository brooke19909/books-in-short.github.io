  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thank you program from Sberbank: where it works, conditions, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sberbank's ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù program should be understood to mean a program for accruing bonuses and points that occurs as a result of purchases made with a Sberbank card.  When making payments, points are credited to the client's bonus account, which can be further managed. </p><h2>  The essence of the program </h2><p>  Such a program is a promotion from the bank in relation to its customers.  The main condition for participation is the availability of a bank card.  The advantages of the program are that it allows the cardholder to reduce their material costs due to the possibility of applying bonuses. </p><p>  As a result of purchases, the customer accumulates points, which are then used to receive discounts in a huge list of stores across the country. </p><h2>  How to get involved </h2><p>  A few steps to become a member of the program: </p><ul><li>  Buy a Sberbank card.  The exception is the Maestro, Maestro Social cards of the North-West Bank of Sberbank of Russia (with numbers 676195, 639002551). </li><li>  Register in the program, which is possible in two ways: through a self-service terminal (ATM), through Sberbank Online.  These issues will be discussed in more detail below. </li><li>  Make purchases, while paying with a card in all stores where there is such an opportunity. </li></ul><p>  The requirements for program participants are not particularly stringent.  They can be both holders of Premium cards, as well as ordinary pension and salary cards.  The exception is affiliate cards.  Some features for Momentum cards: you can register in the system only after 5 working days from the date of opening. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If there are several cards in the holder, bonuses will be accumulated for each, and then added up. </p><div class="photo" data-original="s3bank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="3. stores where thanks thanks from Sberbank" class="if uuid-2931752" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65633/2931752.jpg"></div><h2>  Using an ATM when connecting to a promotion </h2><p>  The following steps must be taken to activate the promotion. </p><ol><li>  Find any Sberbank terminal and insert a card. </li><li>  Enter the pin code. </li><li>  Find the main menu, the item "Bonus program". </li><li>  On the ATM screen, you must enter the cell phone number and confirm your consent to connect the program.  There are clues everywhere. </li><li>  Next, an SMS should come to the specified phone number.  This SMS will contain a special password.  That it will be necessary to inform the operator when contacting the bank's call center on the functioning of the program. </li></ol><h2>  Application of "Sberbank Online" for registration </h2><p>  The sequence of actions here is a little different. </p><ol><li>  You must enter your personal account from a computer or mobile device. </li><li>  Select the menu "My bonuses" </li><li>  Enter your email and phone number. </li><li>  An SMS notification with a password will be sent to the cell phone. </li></ol><h2>  Bonuses and points: accumulate and spend </h2><p>  To receive bonuses under the program wherever ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù from Sberbank operates, you must pay with a credit card in all possible situations.  For each ruble spent, 1.5 bonuses are paid during the first three months of registration in the program and 0.5 bonuses in the following months of participation in the program. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sometimes there are stocks with significantly higher accrual of bonuses for purchases, you need to follow this.  The terms for receiving points are usually up to 5 working days, if the purchase amount is not higher than 15,000 rubles, if this limit is exceeded, the terms can increase up to forty days.  If the card has been inactive for more than 12 months, all points and bonuses on it are burned out. </p><p>  You need to spend bonuses there, where the "Thank you" from Sberbank operates.  There are a lot of options.  Since the terms of the promotion stipulate that 1 bonus is 1 ruble, it is precisely in the amount of accumulated bonuses that the card holder will receive a discount.  Such bonuses received today are accepted as a means of payment in tens of thousands of stores and online stores where "Thank you" from Sberbank in Moscow and in general throughout the country.  If the cardholder has points in the bonus account, he can exchange them for a discount, the size of which can be up to 99% of the value of the goods.  That is, for example, the client has 1000 bonuses in the account.  The product he wants to buy costs 2000 rubles.  In such a situation, he pays half of the bonuses in the amount of 1000 rubles, and the other half pays in rubles.  Another situation: the client has 1000 bonuses on his account, and the product also costs 1000 rubles.  Then he pays 999 rubles with bonuses and 1 ruble pays extra, which is very profitable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="finann.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="4. where does it work thanks from Sberbank in Moscow" class="if uuid-2931753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65633/2931753.jpg"></div><p>  However, in order to spend bonuses, you must perform the following steps: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  at the cash desk where the ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù program from Sberbank is operating, inform the seller in advance that it is planned to spend bonuses under the program; </li><li>  indicate to the seller the amount of bonuses to be debited; </li><li>  pay the rest with a Sberbank card. </li></ul><p>  The use of bonuses in online stores is built around the same pattern, but there is a feature: </p><ul><li>  in the basket you need to place goods for purchase; </li><li>  Among the payment methods, it is necessary to highlight the payment with "Thank you" bonuses; </li><li>  further on the sites there are always tips on how to make the payment. </li></ul><h2>  Program changes since 07/01/2018 </h2><p>  In the summer, in the program "Thank you" from Sberbank there were changes in the terms of use.  The main goal of such changes is to increase the number of bank card holders, both debit and credit.  The new system has allocated four privilege levels for cardholders.  Accordingly, with an increase in the level of privileges, the share of deductions in favor of bonuses is growing.  In addition, points began to accumulate not only when paying with a card, but also when performing some tasks.  The peculiarity is the fact that if the client has a goal to move to a higher level, then he should use the card more actively. </p><p>  The new system is based on the same principle: 1 ruble = 1 bonus = 100 rubles spent from the card.  If the amount is not equal to 100 rubles, then rounding goes downward.  All Sberbank cardholders can still participate in the program. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vbankeonline.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="5. where are the points thanks from Sberbank" class="if uuid-2931755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65633/2931755.jpg"></div><p>  The table below more clearly shows all levels of the program. </p><p>  Examine the structure of the ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù program from Sberbank. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  <em>1st level</em> </p></td><td><p>  <em>2nd level</em> </p></td><td><p>  <em>3rd level</em> </p></td><td><p>  <em>4th level</em> </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  "Thanks" </p></td><td><p>  "Many thanks" </p></td><td><p>  "Thank you very much" </p></td><td><p>  "More Than Thank You" </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Regular bonuses: 0.5% for card purchases </p></td><td><p>  Regular bonuses: 0.5% for card purchases </p></td><td><p>  Bonus increase in two categories of purchases: up to 20% bonuses in the categories: shops and partner sites </p></td><td><p>  Bonus increase in four categories of purchases: </p><p>  up to 20% bonuses in the categories: stores where "Thank you" from Sberbank operates, and on partner sites (restaurants, gas stations, pharmacies, cinema, etc.). </p><p>  The ability to exchange bonuses for rubles </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  No assignments </p></td><td><p>  Tasks: </p><p>  ¬∑ Spend on the card over 30%; </p><p>  ¬∑ Buy over 5000 rubles; </p><p>  ¬∑ The balance on the daily average card over 10,000 rubles; </p><p>  ¬∑ Credit card limit over 10%. </p></td><td><p>  Tasks: </p><p>  ¬∑ Spend on the card over 50%; </p><p>  ¬∑ Buy over 5000 rubles; </p><p>  ¬∑ The balance on the daily average card over 10,000 rubles; </p><p>  ¬∑ Credit card limit spending over 10%; </p><p>  ¬∑ Do not pay at branches and ATMs; </p><p>  ¬∑ Do not pay at Sberbank Online. </p></td><td><p>  Tasks: </p><p>  ¬∑ Spend on the card over 85%; </p><p>  ¬∑ Buy over 5000 rubles; </p><p>  ¬∑ The balance on the daily average card over 10,000 rubles; </p><p>  ¬∑ Credit card limit over 50%; </p><p>  ¬∑ Do not pay at branches and ATMs; </p><p>  ¬∑ Do not pay at Sberbank Online; </p><p>  ¬∑ Take a credit card 1 time in 3 months or replenish the deposit once every three months. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  A personal account in the bonus program allows the cardholder to track their own accumulations, as well as bonuses that have been spent. </p><h2>  Partner Stores </h2><p>  Partners for the action where ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù from Sberbank operates are stores in which the cardholder and program participant can save money by paying accumulated bonuses for the program instead of rubles. </p><p>  Among the partners of Sberbank who participate in the action, one can single out the largest stores and online platforms of our country: MTS, Euroset, Svyaznoy communication stores, 585 and Zolotoy jewelry stores, Ozon.ru.

An exception is the online pharmacy, where paying with bonuses will not work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aptekamega.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="6. pharmacies where thanks thanks from Sberbank" class="if uuid-2931760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65633/2931760.jpg"></div><p>  We can distinguish large pharmacies where ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù from Sberbank are operating, which are partners of the program: </p><ul><li>  "Classic"; </li><li>  "Rainbow"; </li><li>  Permpharmacy; </li><li>  "Be healthy"; </li><li>  "First aid"; </li><li>  "Vita"; </li><li>  "Wrigla; </li><li>  Evalar; </li><li>  "FitoFarm"; </li><li>  "Doctor Stoletov"; </li><li>  "Good pharmacy." </li></ul><h2>  System flaws </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, the system has been working very successfully and effectively towards progress for several years.  However, it is not without flaws.  The main ones are: </p><ul><li>  the terms of the transfer to rubles are not clear; </li><li>  level 3 and 4, most citizens cannot be reached; </li><li>  the list of partners for the implementation of bonuses is rather narrow; </li><li>  if not used for 90 days, bonuses are burned out; </li><li>  continuous monitoring of level tasks; </li><li>  Bonus accrual scheme is not very clear and foggy. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="dengomer.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="9. list of stores where thanks from Sberbank" class="if uuid-2931766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65633/2931766.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Thus, the ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù program from Sberbank is very convenient and quite common among bank card holders.  Today, about 17 million citizens of the country are participating in this program, and this number is constantly growing.  It allows people to save decent amounts if they actively use a bank card.  In recent years, the program is gaining more and more popularity among the population.  This is due to the fact that the service is absolutely free.  And the list of stores where "Thank you" from Sberbank is operating is constantly growing. </p>
