  <section class="page js-page"><h1>History in human life</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Why does humanity need history?  Isn't it all the same what happened a hundred, or even a thousand years ago?  In fact, history is not such a useless subject.  Even more than that, it‚Äôs very necessary.  Studying historical characters and world events, you can make a lot of conclusions.  For example, for what reasons wars can occur or why existing realities are what they are, and not others.  Studying history helps to analyze all this and draw conclusions that can be used so that people no longer make past mistakes.  In general, in short: history helps to adjust the future. </p><p>  Are you interested in all this?  Do you want to become a creator of the future?  If there is such a desire, then we must study history.  And preferably not only the school curriculum, but also beyond that.  You can study in different ways: books, historical films.  And with the development of computer technology, mastering the basics of history has become even easier.  There are various sites of historical orientation.  But sometimes, historical facts on them can be distorted, so you need to look for a portal where the information really will be true.  For example, the site <noindex>  <span>Historian's blog</span> </noindex>  .  He is led by a man whose life is really connected with history.  So this information can be trusted completely. </p><p>  There you can find various materials not only on history, but also on social science, get acquainted with the basics of religious cultures and secular ethics.  Moreover, the material is supplied in such a way that it will become interesting even to former losers.  And who knows, maybe some of them will turn out great historians in the future?  Indeed, as you know, interest in any subject does not arise just like that.  Very often, he is born out of the fact that some person who is carried away by him talks so fascinatingly about this, that he willy-nilly begins to take an interest in all this.  The story is just such items. </p><p>  Those who are already interested in history will love the selection of books on this topic.  At the same time, the number of books will grow every day.  In order not to get confused in topics where to look for interesting materials, the site has convenient navigation in the form of categories.  The portal helps even prepare for lessons, so it will be interesting for parents who help their children do their homework. </p><p>  In fact, the story is very exciting.  Sometimes it is specially distorted to achieve a goal.  But it‚Äôs so interesting to get to the bottom of the truth!  Here, the work of the historian is somewhat reminiscent of the work of a detective trying to separate truth from lies.  But many of us would like to feel at least once in our lives in the role of a detective.  You see how interesting the story really is.  Teach her, and she will reveal to you the fascinating secrets and mysteries of mankind. </p></div></article>
