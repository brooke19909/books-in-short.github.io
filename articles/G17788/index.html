  <section class="page js-page"><h1>London train stations: architectural monuments of the industrial era of Great Britain</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  London is one of the most famous capitals in the world.  Almost everyone heard about this city, which is not at all surprising, because the metropolis claimed to be the third Rome.  One way or another, the capital of Great Britain delights the imagination of any traveler who touches the history of this ancient city.  London railway stations, like nothing else, convey the atmosphere of the industrial era of Great Britain and allow travelers to feel the spirit of the past. </p><div class="photo" data-original="londonist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="King Cross Station" class="if uuid-2556127" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2556127.jpg"></div><h2>  City development </h2><p>  London has always been a great city, following the path of man-made evolution.  This is one of the first capitals to face the flip side of progress.  What should have been a great blessing brought death and destruction much more effectively.  New technologies constantly met resistance in the form of a conservative population, but nevertheless they confidently advanced to the masses. </p><p>  The development of railway communication in the UK went quickly, but at the same time rather difficult.  However, even then, design engineers and architects thought that the city would become much larger in the future.  London train stations were deliberately designed so that none of the passenger rail lines cross the city itself.  <span>Of course, this</span> decision helped the city for a while.  However, later it became clear that the growth of the capital could not be stopped, and the stations were absorbed by the city, but the railway still did not cross it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Creating comfort - saving time </h2><p>  The British were surprisingly far-sighted people.  It is widely known that the first metro in the world appeared in London.  It has gone through many stages of its development.  However, the most noteworthy is the one when people believed that driveways move through hell.  The metro entered the lives of ordinary citizens much later, but it was then that it became part of London's train stations.  Understanding the urgent need to provide visitors with convenient and fast transport, each station received its own exit to the London Underground station. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  Architects initially understood that their structures would become an essential part of the transport infrastructure of the whole of Great Britain for the coming centuries.  They faced an important task - to design and build durable and attractive architectural style London stations.  Today we can say with confidence that they did it.  The stations of this city turned out to be original and unique.  They cannot be confused with similar structures in other countries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Authentic London Station" class="if uuid-2556129" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2556129.jpg"></div><h2>  UK's most famous train station </h2><p>  The most famous train station in London is King Cross.  It is he who appears in the famous work of Harry Potter.  During its construction, architects decided to abandon the traditional decor, which is why the appearance of the station is as close as possible to the industrial era. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.5316396" data-lng="-0.12442310000005818" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/6/0/0/4600.png"></div><p>  On the one hand, the interior is not outstanding, but on the other, even an inexperienced look can see the noble touch of time on all structures.  It seems that the station has experienced a lot and seen a lot.  In fact, the way it is. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.networkrail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best train station in London" class="if uuid-2556128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2556128.jpg"></div><h2>  Paddington </h2><p>  Another famous London train station is Paddington.  Its architectural style generally corresponds to the industrial era, but at the same time contains many decorative elements.  This is one of the most important and largest stations throughout the UK.  Trains from the famous Heathrow Airport also arrive here.  An interesting fact: the station is named after a teddy bear named Paddington, but there are very few links to it on the territory of the station complex. </p>
