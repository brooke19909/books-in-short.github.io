The phone is controlled by the Windows Phone operating system in version 8.  Of course, in terms of the number of applications and games, this OS is still inferior to iOS and Android.  But those that are available at Microsoft's company store work on the phone without any problems.  Downloading applications and games, as well as their installation, is carried out quickly (if there is an appropriate Internet channel).  The phone has a number of noteworthy applications that are installed by default.  Among them - a program for working with a camera, Nokia Smart Cam.  With it, you can take pictures, and then process them. </p>

    <p>  There is a convenient set of navigation programs known under the HERE brand - Maps, Drive and Transit.  These three applications can work with the same set of cards, they can also function offline - if the necessary data has already been downloaded to the phone.  With the help of these programs, you can look at information on traffic jams, bus traffic, look for the necessary addresses or, for example, get directions. </p><p>  Many users note the usefulness of the built-in application for buying and playing music tracks.  Also, the corresponding songs can be downloaded to your phone.  The program has the function of selecting music files for specific styles or years, which are defined by the user. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Soft: reviews </h2><p>  How do fans of mobile electronics software installed on Nokia Lumiya 925 rate it?  Phone characteristics in this aspect are evaluated positively in terms of the quality of the software.  Of course, many users lack the variety of games and applications that occurs when working with Android and iOS devices.  There are, however, mobile electronics enthusiasts who value primarily the speed of a Windows Phone phone.  Even with the modest technical characteristics of the device, this OS uses, as a rule, less hardware resources than Android or iOS platforms.  As a result, the device works faster, it makes it possible to easily launch games and applications, processing of which phones with similar resources under the control of competing platforms might not be able to handle.  However, we can talk about the specifics of hardware separately.  What resources does the phone have in this area? </p>

    <h2>  Iron </h2><p>  Having studied the specifics of the software, we will thus study another important aspect of Nokia Lumiya 925 - the technical characteristics in the aspect of hardware.  The phone is equipped with a Snapdragon S4 processor, clocked at 1.5 GHz.  There is a video processing module Adreno 225. The amount of RAM installed in the device is 1 GB.  The internal memory resource is 16 GB.  However, there is no way to install additional modules.  But the noted 16 GB user who is not too keen on installing "heavy" applications and games, as well as shooting a long video, should be enough. </p><h2>  Iron: reviews </h2><p>  Above, we noted that for many users of Nokia Lumiya 925, technical specifications are secondary - due to the fact that the overall performance of the phone running Windows Phone will be high enough anyway.  Indeed, the practice of using the device, as many users and experts in the field of mobile electronics note, shows that even quite ‚Äúheavy‚Äù 3D games and functional applications work very well on the phone. </p>

    <p>  However, the total number of relevant products adapted for Windows Phone is still inferior to that for Android and iOS platforms. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The sound components in the phone are of high quality.  This determines the excellent speaker volume.  Users and professionals positively evaluate the quality of music playback, both using headphones and when listening to tunes through the speaker.  It can be noted that the phone is equipped with a built-in equalizer.  It also supports Dolby Mobile technology, which significantly improves sound quality.  Users note that for comfortable listening to music, the headphones that are included with the device are quite suitable. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Next in turn is another crucial aspect of the Nokia Lumia 925 phone - camera features.  What remarkable facts regarding this hardware component of the device can be noted?  First of all, this is a fairly large resolution of the main camera - 8.7 megapixels.  The frontal one has a modest indicator - 1.7 megapixels, however, it is impressive against the background of the corresponding components of competing devices.  An additional camera can take photos with a resolution of 1280 by 720, or 1280 by 960 pixels, as well as shoot videos with an indicator of 720 pixels.  The main camera is equipped with a picture stabilization system.  This determines the very high definition of photos.  Using the main camera, you can also shoot video, and with a fairly high resolution - 1080 pixels. </p>

    <p>  Using the button located on the right side of the device, you can launch the built-in application that controls the camera.  It is noteworthy that the corresponding control works even if the screen is locked.  In shooting mode, the same button can also be used to release the shutter.  Thus, the characteristics characteristic of the Nokia Lumia 925 camera look quite competitive.  Photos from the device should be quite high quality.  Video is similar. </p><h2>  Camera: reviews </h2><p>  But how do users comment on the quality of the camera, how do they relate it to other characteristics characteristic of the Lumia 925 components?  Reviews of fans of mobile electronics regarding the functioning of the considered element of the device are enthusiastic.  High resolution of the main camera and not at all modest in the additional one, the presence of an optical stabilizer and a good program for working with photos and videos - all this predetermines extremely positive ratings from users.  They note a large number of useful functions of the built-in application - such as, for example, choosing the optimal shooting mode.  Users rate the quality of photos as high when shooting at any time of the day. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  Let us now consider the technical characteristics of Lumiya 925 in terms of communication resources.  The phone supports the main modern communication standards, including 4G, GPS, Glonass, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth in the 3rd version.  There is support for contactless payment technology - NFC.  All relevant modules, as noted by users and experts in the reviews, work perfectly.  Navigation is carried out without much difficulty.  As some experts in the field of mobile electronics note, the model under consideration is positioned by the brand as adapted just for those people who have a frequent need for using satellite navigation resources. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Another crucial aspect of the Nokia Lumia 925 is the battery feature.  What remarkable features of the corresponding hardware component of the device can be noted?  The phone‚Äôs <span>battery capacity</span> is 2 thousand mAh.  This indicator may seem rather modest.  But this is quite acceptable, in particular due to the fact that the phone has an <span>AMOLED display,</span> which is characterized by a rather low level of energy consumption. </p><p>  How long can a Nokia Lumiya 925 phone work without recharging?  The characteristics of its battery are rather modest, many users are sure, but in practice it turns out that the device shows quite decent results in terms of battery life.  So, mobile electronics enthusiasts who tested the device found out that it lasts for about a day and a half with a rather intensive use (talking, playing games, chatting on social networks, listening to music).  With continuous viewing of video resources, the battery lasts about 6.5 hours.  However, it can be noted rather fast charging - within 1.5 hours to a full level. </p>
