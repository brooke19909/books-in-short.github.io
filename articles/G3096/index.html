  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Home Insurance: Safety Designer</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A responsible, experienced insurance agent never rushes a client.  He will tell you in detail about all the conditions of the contract, patiently explain every nuance and readily answer any, most stupid, question.  Unfortunately, such specialists are rare, and when going to the nearest insurance company, it is better to decide in advance on the main points, such as the breadth of insurance coverage. </p><p>  <em><strong>Insurance Objects</strong></em> </p><p>  So, <noindex>  <strong><span>home insurance</span></strong> </noindex>  or apartments, as a rule, includes 3 components. </p><ol><li><p>  <em><strong>Actually insurance of premises</strong></em> , or rather, its structural elements: walls and stairs, ceilings and partitions, rough floors, balconies and loggias.  Including only this object in the insurance policy, you can protect yourself from an earthquake or fire, but from the flooding of the apartment or its robbery, this policy will be useless. </p></li></ol><ol><li><p>  <em><strong>Liability insurance</strong></em> .  Such a policy will help if the policyholder has caused damage to housing and property belonging to third parties, for example, flooded the neighbors.  You should think about such a policy if the neighbors below are well-to-do people who have invested heavily in the repair of their own apartment. </p></li></ol><p>  Unfortunately, the civil liability policy has a significant drawback: only the owner of the house or apartment can act as the policyholder on it.  But people registered on the living space, as well as tenants, do not have such an opportunity.  There is one more nuance: no insurance company will issue a civil liability policy if the policyholder has started repairs in his own apartment. </p><ol><li><p>  <em><strong>Finishing and engineering equipment insurance</strong></em> includes the largest list of risks.  This may be robbery and robbery, mechanical damage and the bay, fire and natural disaster.  The objects of decoration insurance include: all types of painting and plastering, lining and pasting of the ceiling and walls, any combustible elements of the ceiling, walls and floor, window and door structures.  In addition, decoration insurance protects all built-in furniture: kitchens, dressing rooms. </p></li></ol><p>  Engineering equipment insurance will protect heating and plumbing systems, cables, meters and wiring.  The landlord or tenant can choose either a standard package that includes all of the above objects, or independently determine the part that needs protection, for example, exclusive decoration of the ceiling or walls. </p><p>  Sometimes they single out another component of insurance of an apartment or a house - the protection of movable property.  It includes all furniture, excluding built-in appliances, other valuable items.  But as a rule, a property protection contract is in conjunction with decoration insurance, being an integral part of it. </p><p>  <em><strong>And again about the risks</strong></em> </p><p>  The most difficult thing that awaits everyone <noindex>  <strong><span>insure a house</span></strong> </noindex>  or an apartment in an insurance company - this is a list of risks.  Insuring real estate from everything is impossible, from many things it is expensive, and a ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù coverage does not make sense at all.  For example, if the contract states that the housing is insured against the gulf due to the fault of third parties, then the company will definitely not pay compensation in the event of a water accident.  Therefore, you need to clearly determine in advance: what risks are most likely in your case, and in the process of applying for a policy - carefully read every word of the contract. </p></div></article>
