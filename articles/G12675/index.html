    <p>  The state, which is romantically called Foggy Albion, is perhaps the only country that will always be very popular among tourists. </p><p>  Today, we can say with confidence that travelers will never stop coming here.  And it's not even that you can listen to interesting facts about the UK for hours from those who have already visited there. </p><p>  The United Kingdom actually captivates with the diversity of even the most seasoned adventure lovers.  The tranquility and beauty of rural landscapes, medieval cathedrals and Gothic castles, the frenzy and recklessness of London, the best language schools, prestigious boutiques and a flea market in the so-called "flea" markets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How can one not succumb to the temptation and not go to discover interesting places in Great Britain? </p><h2>  Section 2.

    <p>  You should once and for all remember and take into account the fact that not a single resident of Great Britain ever calls himself British.  Such a nation simply does not exist in their minds, and the name of the people depends on the province where certain people live: the British, Scots, Irish, Welsh.  And if you mix them up, which, incidentally, is quite simple, you can simply offend a person. </p><p>  It is unlikely that anyone will deny the fact that interesting information about Britain cannot be considered without a story about the people living in this state. </p><ul><li>  About the pubs.  Probably everyone knows that British people love pubs.  This is just some kind of stereotype.  On Fridays, huge crowds of people gather in such establishments who, it would seem, do not pay attention to others at all.  They drink and chat inside, outside and just next to their favorite pub. </li></ul><ul><li>  About politeness.  In general, it should be noted that representatives of the Foggy Albion are very tolerant.  It‚Äôs even hard for us to imagine that a seller can thank you about seven times for a purchase made from him.  Even for petty misconduct, they can apologize. </li></ul><ul><li>  About the relation to darlings.  In the state you will not find a single homeless animal on the street.  They create specialized shelters, which, incidentally, very often turn into interesting sights in the UK.  For example, the Laika shelter in a suburb of London.  Not only those who wish to shelter a pet come here, but also give special excursions called "Lessons of kindness."  Children and adults can gain invaluable experience in communicating with animals and only after that decide to purchase their own kitten, puppy, rabbit or guinea pig. </li></ul><ul><li>  About selfless care.  Interesting sights of the UK very often include numerous shops - both food and supermarkets.  However, it is worth paying attention to the fact that in this state it will be quite difficult to purchase food after 22:00.  The local administration takes care of the health status of its employees, and therefore there are almost no convenience stores here. </li></ul><p>  Love to read in the transport, but not enough money for the press?  But in Foggy Albion, there is always a distributor of free newspapers in front of the subway, which, by the way, is usually left after reading in the seat for the next passenger. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Section 3.

    <ul><li>  The famous tower, commonly called Big Ben, is actually named after St. Stephen.  Big Ben is just a bell located on top. </li><li>  In the UK, the very first public zoo was opened. </li><li>  Interesting information about the sights of the UK can be obtained absolutely free.  Why?  The fact is that most museums can be visited without any charge.  It is believed that visitors will donate as much as they see fit. </li><li>  The rumor that in London is always damp, cold and cloudy has no reason.  Precipitation in the form of rain falls here no more often than in Rome or Sydney. </li><li>  Great Britain is the only country in the world that does not need to write its name on postage stamps, since it was she who became the first to use this kind of note on envelopes. </li><li>  In our country, there are also several cities that have the same name.  But in the UK 150 Newtowns! </li></ul><h2>  Section 4. Walk through the museums </h2>

This institution is known for the presence of two exhibits - the so-called water.  One appeared about 100 years ago, it was made of fish bones and wood.  And the second was found off the Japanese coast in the eighteenth century.  It was collected from body parts of fish and monkeys. </li><li>  During the Great Patriotic War, an underground command center was built in Great Britain, where politicians and military leaders continued to manage the army and the country in safety.  Three times this center became a refuge for Winston Churchill.

    <p>  Great Britain ... The most interesting place, or rather, one of them, is located in North London.  Its area is thirty-seven acres.  In fact, strangely enough, this sounds to date, this cemetery is considered a historical vacation spot for local residents. </p><p>  In general, Highgate looks like a classic <span>English garden.</span>  Hedgehogs, hares, rabbits, foxes live in large numbers here, and a huge number of trees and bushes grow. </p><p>  The cemetery is divided into eastern and western parts.  You can visit the East only by signing up for the appropriate excursion, while the West is open for general inspection. </p><p>  Many famous people are buried in Highgate Cemetery: George Eliot, Karl Marx, Malcolm McLaren. </p><h2>  Section 6.

    <p>  In northern Scotland is Barra Airport.  Why is he so significant?  The thing is that this category of air gates can be assigned because of their runways, which are located directly on the beach of the Bay of Tri-Mor.  The flight schedule here is, given the ebbs and flows.  Night flights and during high tides are not served.  But in emergency cases at night, reflective tapes are laid out along the strip and the strip is illuminated by the headlights of cars.  Landing and taking off here is possible only for small aircraft. </p><p>  And the rest, Barra Airport is no different from the rest: a control room, baggage loading service, arrival and departure terminals - no differences from an ordinary institution of such a plan. </p><h2>  Section 7. Interesting about the UK: what do you think of an overnight stay in prison? </h2><p>  In Oxford, there is a hotel, which was equipped in a former place intended exclusively for the maintenance of prisoners.  It is called Malmaison Oxford Castle.  Without breaking the law, you can visit the former prison premises, where low ceilings and thick walls are still preserved.  Although the rooms themselves are cozy, comfortable and meet the requirements of all, even the most moody travelers. </p><p>  Once gray dreary corridors are now equipped with furniture by famous designers.  And where the former secretariat was located, today there is a bar and restaurant. </p><p>  The layout of the building is not broken, everything was saved: metal doors, and brick walls, and wooden floors, and prison bars.  But now such a situation does not oppress, on the contrary, these elements have become perhaps the key to the reconstruction of a peculiar atmosphere. </p><p>  And from the small windows that once were for prisoners serving their sentences here the only string of connection with the world, you can see a barbed wire fence. </p><h2>  Section 8. The Road to Nowhere </h2><p>  In Northern Ireland, there is a phenomenon unique in nature - hexagonal basalt columns, which are interconnected, form an incredible landscape resembling a pavement.  Only now it was created not by man, but by nature. </p><p>  This phenomenon is called the Path of the Giants.  And it appeared as a result of the activity of the volcano, and the protrusions, in turn, formed when the lava flow was already cooling.  In 1986, UNESCO added this unique corner of nature to the World Heritage List. </p><h2>  Section 9. Are you afraid of heights? </h2>

    <p>  On the southern coast of England there is a chalk cape called Beachy Head.  This precipice is the highest in all of Great Britain.  The height of the cape is 162 meters. </p><p>  The interest of tourists is caused by incredible and simply dizzying panoramas.  In good weather, you can see everything for several tens of kilometers around.  For example, you can see Brighton, and it is fifty kilometers from here.  But in bad weather, it‚Äôs better to refrain from a trip to Cape Beachy Head - windy weather can be very dangerous for a walk in such a place. </p><h2>  Section 10. Unusual attraction </h2><p>  Great Britain ... Interesting facts for children, as well as for adults, are found here at every step.  For example, you should definitely take note of the information that recently a new attraction has opened here - the largest trampoline in the world. </p><p>  This attraction is located in one of the caves in North Wales.  The structure itself looks like this: three trampolines of unusually huge sizes are stretched at different levels of the cave.  The structures are connected to each other by slopes with a slope.  All visitors to this attraction, necessarily dressed in helmets, come on an old miner train and will be able to bounce and take off under the ceilings of the cave, which are framed by hundreds of thousands of LEDs and thus turn it into a magical dungeon. </p><h2>  Section 11.

    <p>  It is simply impossible to list interesting facts about the UK and not to mention this place.  Today, East Stratton is an example of classic English landscapes.  For three hundred years, from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century, this village was rebuilt and continued its development thanks to three families: Rayotsley, Baring and Russell. </p><p>  The first bricks houses were once built in this village, and the roof was made thatched.  And now this is the calling card of East Stratton.  However, one cannot fail to note that today behind a roof with such a coating, especially careful care is needed, which not everyone can afford, and therefore only wealthy people can afford to have such roofs. </p><p>  Official interesting facts about the UK say that the highlight of East Stratton is that the village still retains the spirit of the <span>Victorian era.</span>  The descendants of the creators of this beautiful village left behind a huge park with incredible groves, gardens and sculptures in the Baroque style. </p>
