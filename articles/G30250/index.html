It is quite obvious that with connected access to the Network, the device gains additional capabilities.  Given the functionality of modern gadgets, we can say that with an online connection, they really can be many times more. </p><p>  But there is another problem - the choice of a tariff plan that is ideal for your needs.  Each mobile operator has its own set of tariffs, which differ in cost, data package and additional features.  Making the right choice in this whole kaleidoscope is not an easy task. </p><p>  Today we‚Äôll take a closer look at one of the most popular services available to MTS users.  The service is called "Super Bit", and that it can offer the subscriber will be described in this article.  Let's try to reveal as much interesting as possible about this tariff. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment Internet: Super Beat </h2><p>  We all know that mobile service providers provide different amounts of data for various subscriber needs.  The cost of the packages within which they are provided, of course, varies.  Thus, the more opportunities a subscriber opens up to, the more expensive the specified service will cost him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The tariff plan in question is a typical ‚Äúentertaining‚Äù option, suitable for fans of online services with which you can watch videos and pictures. </p><p>  Even on the MTS website (Super Bit, you can connect directly in your personal account, as well as using the combinations that will be discussed later) that the tariff is suitable mainly for entertainment purposes.  Due to the significant amount of data, the user has the opportunity to work with files (upload them to <span>cloud storage,</span> for example), communicate on social networks, watch videos, talk on Skype and much more.  This gives reason to argue that Super Bit is a tariff designed to work on a tablet.  Although this can be argued. </p>

    <h2>  Tablet or smartphone? </h2><p>  It all depends, first of all, on how actively the user works with his gadgets.  Even on your phone you can download videos and download TV shows - then, of course, this tariff will be just right.  On the other hand, someone who is used to checking mail on a tablet will not use up the declared amount of data.  And this means that he will have too much of such a package. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you look at the information about this tariff plan in more detail on the official website, it becomes clear: it is provided for smartphones.  Other, more ‚Äúvoluminous" tariff plans for tablets and PCs are located in another section, and their cost, as well as the volume of provided traffic, is much higher. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, instead of discussing Super Bit (MTS), the description of the tariff plan should be read first.  And after that, build versions about how you can use up the declared amount of data;  from which gadget it will be more appropriate to work with the tariff;  and that the subscriber can afford the gigabytes allocated to him. </p><h2>  Tariff Plan Terms </h2><p>  The most important thing is how much and what the subscriber receives from the operator as part of the tariff plan.  If we talk about "Super Bit", MTS (the description on the site completely coincides with the actual amount of information provided) allocates 3 gigabytes of data per month for free disposal by the user.  It is noteworthy that you can work with this package not only in networks of a certain format, but also choose them at the discretion of the user.  This means that Internet in 4G format will cost the same as a 3G connection.  Let's just say this: it is very convenient for those who have advanced smartphones and tablets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Package cost </h2>

    <p>  350 rubles per month - the cost of the Super Bit tariff plan (Internet).  MTS does not limit the service by region.  This means that you can fully use your device throughout Russia. </p><p>  Please note that the tariff plan is specialized purely for the provision of online access services.  This means that by connecting it, you should not expect that you will be allocated additional minutes for calls on the network or beyond, free SMS or other bonuses.  What does the MTS Super Bit tariff include?  The description on the site says that it is 3 GB of traffic. </p><h2>  How are funds debited? </h2><p>  It should be noted that money is withdrawn from your subscriber account once a month.  The debit date is the day the service was activated last month.  Accordingly, your task as a subscriber is to top up your account on time and take care of the presence of the full amount on it (350 rubles). </p><p>  Another interesting point is the daily withdrawal of money in case of lack of funds.  As described in the characteristics of the ‚ÄúBit‚Äù tariff plan, with a lack of money, a withdrawal of 8 rubles per day occurs.  However, on Super Bit, such an option does not exist at all.  Here, the data package is provided for a month, while in the ‚ÄúBit‚Äù tariff - for a day. </p>

    <h2>  How to connect / disconnect? </h2><p>  It may be that the user is not satisfied with the capabilities provided by Super Bit (MTS).  Disabling the service in this case will be the most correct decision.  The subscriber can manage it (connect or disconnect depending on preferences) in several ways.  The first, as already noted, is a personal account on the MTS website.  Having entered it, the subscriber can see what specific services are currently available by his number and, accordingly, can easily disconnect or connect them.  The same applies to the tariff plan that we are discussing. </p><p>  If you are a MTS network subscriber, you can connect Super Bit by dialing the operator.  It‚Äôs free, and all you have to do is ask for your service activation request.  Please note that processing it may take some time - it will be required to update the data. </p><p>  You can also activate the service yourself, using the short combination that you need to enter on the phone.  This is * 628 #, after which you need to press the call key.  Accordingly, the command to disable the service * 111 * 252 * 2 #.  Another option is to contact your operator for help. </p>

    <h2>  Additional features </h2><p>  For those for whom the amount of data provided under this tariff plan will not be enough, there is the opportunity to acquire the so-called "speed limits".  They can be used if you see that you will achieve a zero balance of traffic.  The service is provided in packages of 100 and 500 megabytes and costs, respectively, 30 and 95 rubles per day.  An additional amount of data disappears 24 hours after its activation or as the user spends it. </p><h2>  Alternative </h2><p>  For those subscribers who believe that they have too much data, there is an alternative.  You can order a cheaper service than Super Bit.  MTS describes an alternative service, by the way, right on the same page of the site as indicated.  We are talking about the Bit tariff plan.  It costs less, although it assumes a smaller data package: in total, as noted above, 75 megabytes per day with a monthly payment of 200 rubles.  It is important to note that the ‚ÄúBit‚Äù tariff is designed to work within the framework of Moscow and the region, therefore, in other regions it loses relevance.  To verify this, go to the Bit and Super Bit (MTS) services page.  Their description, as was emphasized, is located nearby so that the visitor can easily compare. </p><p>  If, on the contrary, you do not find enough data, you can switch to more expensive, but free tariffs for tablet computers and home PCs.  At MTS, these are the plans for MTS Tablet (4 GB per month) and MTS Tablet Mini (incremental increase in the package from 13 MB per day and beyond).  However, the conditions provided for by these tariffs are already the subject of another article. </p>
