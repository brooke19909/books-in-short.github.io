Among the sights of this magical land, one can distinguish a lot of unique and beautiful places: both natural ones - various parks, reserves, bays and mountains, and man-made cultural monuments, for example, "Swallow's Nest", the palace of Count M. S. Vorontsov and many others. </p><h2>  Pearl of Crimea - Evpatoria </h2><p>  Among the wealth of choice of resort places on the peninsula, it is worth highlighting the city of Yevpatoria, founded by the ancient Greeks.  It is located in the western part of Crimea and at all times attracted tourists with sandy beaches, the territory of which covers about thirty kilometers, a gentle descent to the sea and a mild climate. </p><p>  Of great importance when choosing a vacation spot with family and friends is the infrastructure, which in the city of Yevpatoriya is presented at the most modern level.  There are many theaters and cinemas, restaurants and cafes, dolphinariums and water parks, arboretums and night clubs.  In addition, for outdoor enthusiasts, there is everything you need: go-kart stadiums, diving, exciting jeep tours, paragliding and hang-gliding flights, horseback riding, ATV rides, and that's not all. </p><h2>  How to get to Yevpatoriya? </h2><p>  There are currently no direct flights to Yevpatoriya.  Therefore, you will have to get with transfers.  Of course, the fastest option is an airplane.  You need to purchase a ticket to Simferopol.  The distance between the cities of Simferopol and Yevpatoria is about 70 kilometers.  Therefore, when reaching the airport, you need to transfer by train, taxi or regular bus.  Travel time is about 1.5 hours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can also get by train or regular bus.  To do this, you must also purchase tickets.  It is worth noting that there is no direct connection with the peninsula, so you will have to cross the Kerch Strait by ferry.  Comfortable buses carry it with passengers, but if you choose a train, you will have to buy a ticket to Krasnodar or Anapa, and then get to the Caucasus port on your own, of course, it is most convenient to transfer to a regular bus to the city of Yevpatoriya. </p><p>  Some tourists travel by car.  It will take a little more than a day, depending on the departure point.  It is worth considering that the distance between the cities of Moscow and Yevpatoria is approximately 1,500 km.  Crossing the Kerch Strait will also have to be included in additional costs.  But at present, the construction of the Russian bridge in the Crimea is actively underway, and in the future all these difficulties can be avoided. </p><h2>  Golden Sands Beach (Evpatoria) </h2><p>  Special attention deserves a beach holiday on the peninsula, which is washed by the Black Sea.  Among all the beautiful beaches, the main pearl is the Golden Sands in Yevpatoriya.  They are located on Simferopolskaya Street, in the eastern part of the city.  This place is a great choice for a family holiday in Yevpatoriya. </p>

    <p>  In general, the Golden Sands beach (Yevpatoriya) is ideal for a comfortable family vacation.  A gentle descent to the sea allows the water to warm up quickly and throughout the season, which lasts in the city of Yevpatoria from May to October, to keep the temperature on the order of twenty degrees Celsius. </p><h2>  Children's rest on the beach </h2><p>  A special note deserves the presence of well-maintained children's corners on the beach, which are a bright playground with ladders and a water slide with a trampoline.  Also on the beach there is a group of professional animators who show tricks and organize contests, apply face painting, play funny miniatures and, of course, give gifts to the most active participants.  Therefore, tired parents can temporarily transfer custody of their beloved child and drink mojito in a cafe nearby. </p><h2>  Golden Sands (Evpatoria): reviews </h2><p>  The main advantage of this beach, which is celebrated by all tourists, is a comfortable stay with family and friends.  Here, the sea is shallow, with a gentle sandy descent, which allows children to splash calmly near the coastline.  Also, the developed infrastructure of the beach and its surroundings are among the advantages of the Golden Sands beach area (Yevpatoriya), and the cleanliness of the recreation area is not indifferent. </p>
