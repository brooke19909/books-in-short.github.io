  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to connect to someone else's wifi</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Oh, the great and powerful Internet!  For the first time, a worldwide network was launched in the early 60s, and until 1993, such a connection was the privilege of state institutions.  Until the late 90s, the Internet could only be used for sending e-mail, and in just over 20 years - such a great progress.  The World Wide Web is not that it has become commonplace, it has taken one of the main roles in our lives.  And, most likely, even this is not the limit.  But, as you know, you have to pay for everything.  In the truest sense of the word.  Free internet is still hard to reach.  And ‚Äúopen‚Äù points are only in certain places, which are often far from your home.  Is it possible to go online for free where you need it?  All you need is the ability to connect to a Wi-Fi network and a little savvy. </p><p>  It‚Äôs easy to learn how to connect to someone else‚Äôs wifi, it‚Äôs much harder to use it.  The legality of this kind of borrowing from someone an Internet connection service is very doubtful.  In fact, this is a real jurisdiction.  Although it‚Äôs much easier to throw off the hare from your connection than to calculate where and who is trying to take part of the traffic.  Please do not take these words as an incentive to action.  After all, it‚Äôs a blatant use of a service that someone else pays for. </p><p>  The situation is worse if the computer displays a window "wifi does not see the network."  This type of compound, although popular, is, unfortunately, not all.  Although for the sake of experiment it‚Äôs enough to just go out into the yard with a laptop or smartphone.  Even in the courtyard of a normal sleeping area, you can capture at least 30 wireless access points.  Tested by myself.  And after all, many of them can be easily made open to oneself.  Sit yourself in the yard on a small bench and actively communicate in social networks.  Absolutely free.  We proceed to the instructions on how to connect to someone else‚Äôs wifi and, if easier, how to find out the wifi network key.  For crackers, many special programs have been developed.  Knowing that, where to indicate, even an amateur will cope with breaking. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To get started, find or download Cain Abel 4.99.23 or Aircrack-ng 0.9.3 win + CommView for Wi-Fi.  The function of the programs is the same.  This is the capture and analysis of network packets, as well as decoding the passwords of available network connections.  The initial goal of these programs is to check the resistance of wifi networks to attack by malicious users.  The network undergoes a powerful ‚Äúcheck‚Äù and ... surrenders.  The controls are simple, you only have to choose the method of bombing the access point you need.  It is best to use this method when the victim is actively using the Internet.  The more packets are sent, the faster you will receive the coveted key.  The question of how to find out the wifi network key is now resolved.  Use on health. </p><p>  Suppose you do not live in a new house, and your neighbors are far from technological progress.  Wifi does not see the network or it either appears or disappears.  Even a hint of a network signal is already a potential free Internet.  To achieve this goal, you need to buy a wifi antenna.  An external device is always several times more powerful than the analogue built into a computer or phone.  But how to connect to someone else‚Äôs wifi at a great distance is often shown in spy movies.  You need the same antenna and tube with an aluminum coating inside (most often from chips).  A hole is made in the bottom of the tube and the antenna is pushed.  Guide and catch your prey.  The receiving capacity of such a device is already 10 times higher than that of your computer. </p><p>  The iWep PRO v1.1.4 program is quite popular.  A lot of recommendations!  How to find out a wifi network key in a minute?  And again the answer: ‚ÄúiWep PRO v1.1.4!‚Äù.  Some tips and no instructions.  If you find it, consider yourself lucky.  It should also be noted that points password protected in the WAP system are ideal victims. </p><p>  How to connect to someone else's wifi, you now know.  The temptation is endless when there are lots of dots around and you alone without the Internet.  Remember, this is an offense and if one is revealed ... only you will have to answer for everything.  It is much easier to approach a neighbor and offer "you to me - I to you."  For a symbolic price, you honestly get a password to the desired Internet.  Or just sign an agreement with your provider.  Today, the Internet, although paid, but quite affordable.  This is no longer a luxury. </p>
