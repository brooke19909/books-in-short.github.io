She is very attractive for her design, low price and technical characteristics.  It is popular among motorists who prefer natural high-quality sound.  The use of this radio is only a positive experience. </p><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  The sound quality of the Pioneer MVH X560BT is on top.  The radio supports all popular formats, as well as USB-carriers, connecting androids and iPhone devices.  You can connect any phone via bluetooth and listen to music from the phone on the radio.  This device became inexpensive due to the fact that manufacturers decided to remove the drive, thereby saving production costs.  Therefore, the model has become popular among motorists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": Bouray1, "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer mvh-x560bt" class="if uuid-2761427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2761427.jpg"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  What are the technical characteristics of the technique we are considering?

But it now looks more expensive than it costs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.caraudiocentre.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer mvh-x560bt for iphone" class="if uuid-2761431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2761431.jpg"></div><p>  Mini-jack input and USB port are located on the rear panel of the radio.  It supports synchronization with devices on the Android operating system via bluetooth, which is also present in this radio.  When synchronizing with an iPhone, it is possible to use the Siri voice assistant through a microphone on the front panel of the radio.  But in this function there is no support for the Russian language, therefore, without knowledge of English, this ‚Äúbun‚Äù from the manufacturer is useless. </p><p>  On the front panel is an LCD-screen with brightness control.  Swing track switching is not the most convenient, but you can get used to them.  An encoder is located between them.  To the left of it are buttons for receiving an incoming call, changing the playback mode (bluetooth, Aux, USB or radio).  At the bottom of the display are the buttons of your favorite radio stations, the second function of these buttons are: pause, repeat the track, repeat the playlist, display backlight, play tracks intermittently.  To the left of these buttons is the undo button. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The radio interface supports both English and Russian.  The reaction to pressing buttons in this radio is faster than on its counterparts.  The equalizer has standard settings that are provided from the factory, there are also two slots for user settings, in which you can adjust the level of high and low frequencies. </p><p>  Low frequencies are on top here.  Even without a subwoofer, they are very clearly audible.  The sound is impeccable, thanks to a built-in amplifier of 50 watts per channel, of which there are 4. This power is produced by a mosfet located on the amplifier board.  In order to increase power, in addition through the RCA connectors you can connect both an amplifier and a subwoofer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": Crutchfield, "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer mvh-x560bt blue" class="if uuid-2761430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2761430.jpg"></div><p>  In the settings you can change the color of the backlight, since there are more than 200 thousand of them.  The Pioneer MVH X560BT has a feature that automatically changes the backlight while playing music.  It depends on the rhythm, the amount of low and high frequencies. </p><p>  The radio can be used as a hands-free headset, making a connection via bluetooth. </p><h2>  Pioneer MVH X560BT Reviews </h2><p>  Buyers claim that this radio is worth the money.  Although today there are models that surpass this device in technical specifications, users who are not professionally versed in sound quality and sound reproducing equipment will not notice much of a difference.  But their price is very different. </p><p>  Others say that the sound is no different from the radio, which is an order of magnitude lower in price. </p><p>  There are opinions about the bluetooth, which periodically freezes, you can normally listen to music only by "Aux" or from a USB flash drive.  The decorative frame periodically departs, but this is not characteristic of each model of this radio. </p><div class="photo" data-original="campwestfalia.com" data-author=": Jeffrey Lee, "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer mvh-x560bt with head unit" class="if uuid-2761436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2761436.jpg"></div><p>  Pros: </p><ul><li>  the presence of Bluetooth; </li><li>  synchronization with android and "apple" devices; </li><li>  design; </li><li>  Speakerphone; </li><li>  display; </li><li>  price; </li><li>  adapter for controlling buttons on the steering wheel. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  overheats at high volume; </li><li>  music is interrupted when listening through bluetooth; </li><li>  at night the screen is too bright; </li><li>  sound quality; </li><li>  the quality of the sound entering the microphone; </li><li>  track switching buttons are uncomfortable; </li><li>  smooth encoder (it does not interfere with the rubber gasket). </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  For its price range, the Pioneer MVH X560BT has a large number of functions.  The price for it is from 60 to 100 dollars (4,000-7,000 rubles).  At the moment, almost all recorders have a remote control in their kit, thanks to which it becomes much easier to control the device.  A special surface will allow the console to attach to the steering wheel.  Although it may not be useful, because you can control the radio with buttons from the steering wheel. </p>
