  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Observation platforms of Krasnoyarsk: description and interesting facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When it is not possible to travel to distant hot countries, and you really want to change the atmosphere, you should pay attention to local tourist routes, where you can also find a lot of interesting things.  Today we will talk about Krasnoyarsk and its viewing platforms. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.01528339999999" data-lng="92.8932476" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/8/1/5/17815.png"></div><h2>  Krasnoyarsk </h2><p>  Krasnoyarsk is one of the largest cities in Russia, and also with a rich history.  It was built in 1628 and even then it became one of the central founding cities of Siberia.  Despite the fact that the city is industrial, the monuments of art are also honored and protected with great care.  The city has magnificent architecture, many buildings have survived from the time of Peter the Great.  There are many gardens, monuments, steles and, of course, viewing platforms.  Let's consider them in detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kudago.com" data-author=": michkoff, "><img itemprop="image" alt="River View" class="if uuid-3232669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3232669.jpg"></div><h2>  Playground "King fish" </h2><p>  "Tsar-fish" is one of the attractions of Krasnoyarsk and carries a special meaning.  This is a monolithic figure, created in 2004 in the form of sturgeon - fish, which in nature is considered the queen.  The monument appeared after a fairy tale of the same name, in which a tragic story is told about the struggle of a person with a fish.  After a hard fight, the fish goes to the depths of the sea, carrying many iron fishing hooks in its body. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="michkoff.narod.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="King fish" class="if uuid-3232671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3232671.jpg"></div><p>  The observation deck "Tsar-fish" in Krasnoyarsk is named after the monument.  This is one of the favorite walking spots of not only local residents, but also tourists coming from all over the country.  Magnificent views of the nearby villages, forests and meadows open from the observation deck in Krasnoyarsk.  A particularly beautiful view opens in the fall. </p><h2>  Skyscraper "First Tower" </h2><p>  The observation deck in Krasnoyarsk can be hidden from view, and not all locals know the way to it.  So, in the Siberian city in 2009 the first skyscraper in the city was erected, which received the simple name "The First Tower".  He entered the list of the tallest buildings in Russia, since its height is one hundred and eighteen meters.  The building has a variable number of storeys and consists mainly of office rooms in its corridors.  But if you go up to the top floor and open the vestibule door, in the blink of an eye you can find yourself in an interesting place called the observation tower "First Tower" in Krasnoyarsk.  Once on the highest roof of the city, magnificent views of the city and its sleeping areas open.  Particular beauty is revealed to those who came to the observation deck of Krasnoyarsk in the early morning or evening.  It is at this time that you can observe the incredible beauty of sunrises and sunsets. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.monolit-holding.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="First tower" class="if uuid-3232668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3232668.jpg"></div><h2>  Other viewing platforms </h2><p>  In addition to the listed observation platforms in Krasnoyarsk, there are several more that are worth visiting at least once.  Firstly, the Metropol.  The business center is located in the heart of the city and provides an excellent opportunity to enjoy a bird's eye view of the historical part of the city.  The building is eighteen floors high with high-speed elevators, which are on guard.  There are times when it is forbidden to use elevators, but most often friendly guards allow you to use the elevator and get to the observation deck in a matter of seconds. </p><p>  Secondly, the Nikolaev hill.  In the fifties of the last century, ski jumps were built here, which, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, were abandoned and nobody needed.  But people still come here for a walk for the magnificent panoramic views that open from the observation deck in Krasnoyarsk.  In addition, there is a sports recreation center nearby, which offers tourists skiing and snowboarding.  People who have already visited Mykolayiv Hill recommend that everyone gathered must take a camera with them to capture themselves against the backdrop of magnificent Siberian nature. </p>
