This country has long been considered the most suitable for living, since it had and has everything: a warm mild climate, the presence of a large number of waterways, a picturesque landscape and, of course, access to the sea.  Vacation spots here were formed back in the days of the <span>Roman Empire,</span> so let's look at a few regions that are the most popular and picturesque in this sunny European country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy resorts" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/228083.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The most luxurious resorts in Italy are located on the coast of the <span>Ligurian Sea,</span> near the border with France.  Often this area is called the <span>Italian Riviera,</span> as there are many bays of extraordinary beauty.  The coast of this region is lined with green gardens, where you can feel the coolness and silence on a hot summer day.  The main centers of the region are the cities of San Remo, Genoa and Rapallo.  It should be noted that Liguria is one of the most expensive places in all of Italy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy map with resorts" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/228084.jpg" width="600"></div>

This region is famous for its vineyards, a huge number of wine boutiques and restaurants.  It is generally accepted that Italian resorts, which are located on the Tuscan coast, are places where real gourmets gather.  There are also many architectural monuments that were erected in ancient times.  And these buildings of past centuries, together with modern architecture, are buried in the greenery of <span>coniferous forests.</span> </p><p>  Italian resorts are inconceivable without the famous Odyssey Coast.  This area is the country's greatest cultural heritage, where ancient myths and legends are reflected.  But attracting tourists here is not only a fabulous past, but also quite reasonable real estate prices.  It is also worth noting that there is a clear sea and wide sandy beaches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy's best resorts" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/228085.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  We examined the most popular resorts in Italy.  The best of them, however, are yet to come.  For example, cities that are located along the rugged coastline of <span>the Gulf of Naples.</span>  This place is a dream for those who want to relax from the hustle and bustle of the city.  No, these are not <span>wild beaches</span> and islands at all, but well-equipped places for lovers of exquisite relaxation.  Here, citrus orchards are buried in the clear blue water of the bay, and the clouds touch the mountain peaks.  There are a lot of hot healing springs on the territory of the Campania, so when you spend your vacation here, you can not only relax, but also improve your well-being. </p><p>  Listing all the resorts in Italy, we should not forget about the picturesque Venice.  It is located on the <span>Adriatic coast,</span> and at the same time has many rivers and bays on its territory.  This city is considered the hallmark of Italy.  Here, life does not stop day or night.  Endless carnivals, competitions, concerts and performances of actors and dancers - all this is presented to the attention of a large tourist audience. </p><p>  Finally, it must be said that the resorts of Italy are without exception its cities, because even if they have no sea, there is something that will attract the attention of a traveler.  Lakes and snow-capped mountain ranges, forests and valleys, vineyards and poppy fields - all this belongs to a country with a rich past and picturesque present. </p>
