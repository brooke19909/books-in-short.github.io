The article will discuss what it is for, as well as the Vizant 750st gadget. </p><div class="photo" data-original="unis.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="video recorder vizant 750st" class="if uuid-2467313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2467313.jpg"></div><h2>  The need for surveillance </h2><p>  It so happened historically that drivers are used to play safe in case of unforeseen circumstances.  Due to the global congestion of megacities with cars, the likelihood of accidents has increased.  Moreover, there are frequent cases when the culprit manages to escape from the scene, or the situation is such that it is not clear who is right and who is to blame. </p><p>  For this, Vizant 750st DVRs (or some other model) are mounted on the windshield, capable of recording everything that happens, providing the driver with a reliable evidence base. </p><p>  Thanks to the use of video surveillance, fraudulent actions on the roads that began in the mid-90s, when criminals deliberately provoked an accident in order to blackmail the driver and demand large amounts of money, were completely eliminated. </p><p>  Now this can only be seen in the movies.  And the surveillance cameras installed on almost every pillar will also help recreate the details of the collision, if the recorder has not photographed everything. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="new-elektronika.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Byzant radar anti-arrow" class="if uuid-2467326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2467326.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The Vizant 750st DVR with anti-radar function interested drivers not only with its design, but also with its capabilities.  The fact is that the gadget is designed as a rear-view mirror and in fact it is.  Therefore, it is simply mounted instead of its less functional "progenitor", eliminating the need to install any additional devices on the windshield. </p><p>  Vizant 750st perfectly functions as a radar detector, accurately recognizing the signals of modern speed detection systems.  Works with radiation ranges such as K, Ultra K, Ka, X and Ultra X. </p><p>  The gadget provides for the adjustment of sensitivity levels (there are three in total), which allows you to adjust the operation of the product in case of false positives.  Notification occurs through sound notification and light indication. </p><p>  There is one camera that records HD video (1280 √ó 720) at a frequency of 30 frames per second.  The output image is clear, thanks to a viewing angle of 120 ¬∞, it is possible to capture all four lanes, including road signs and license plates. </p><p>  The ability to view recordings right at the scene of an accident provides a 4.3-inch display. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="blog.motopapa.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vizant 750st equipment" class="if uuid-2467298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2467298.jpg"></div><h2>  What is missing? </h2><p>  As a rule, drivers choose for themselves ‚Äúfriend and assistant‚Äù for one purpose: to fix everything that happens around.  This requires the presence of WDR-technology, due to which high-quality recording is carried out at any time of the day, based on the principle of balancing the image intensity: the darkest places are lightened, and the brightest ones are darkened. </p><p>  It is WDR that allows for high-quality shooting in the dark with low street lighting.  The Vizant 750st does not state such a function instruction, which is an annoying omission. </p><p>  In addition, the G-sensor, another name for which is the shock sensor, plays an important role.  The module captures the moment of a sharp increase in the load on the vehicle and the moment of decline in speed.  At the same time, video recording is automatically turned on, the file is placed in a special area on the memory card that is protected from erasure. </p><p>  If someone crashed into a car in a parking lot, the automatic shooting starts again.  Therefore, the absence of such a useful module as an electronic accelerometer significantly reduces the likelihood of recording the culprit of a traffic accident on video. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The price of the Vizant 750st is quite considerable - from 10,000 to 10,500 rubles.  Although for the same money you can pick up other options for such ‚Äúsmart mirrors‚Äù with the above functions.  For example, a mirror-recorder Car Dvr Mirror. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vizant 750st DVR" class="if uuid-2467292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2467292.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Vizant 750st is praised for its compactness and ease of use.  There is not a large number of wires that can be annoying (we are talking about ordinary gadgets mounted on the windshield). </p><p>  According to reviews, this model looks great in the car as part of the interior and does not create a feeling of congestion.  Drivers are satisfied with the recording quality, as well as the convenience of installing the device - it doesn‚Äôt fall off when it is necessary to turn the camera sideways to record a conversation with the traffic police inspector. </p><p>  Separately, drivers note such a design decision as tinted glass of the camera, which eliminates the possibility of "light" image headlights oncoming cars at night. </p><p>  A lot of reviews that say about the indispensability of this gadget, characterizing such as the optimal ratio of price and quality.  In addition, motorists praise the product for the lack of need to delve into the complex settings of the options, it is noted that to understand the menu is very easy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avtoprofi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="camera on the Byzantine" class="if uuid-2467337" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2467337.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  There are few of them.  Mostly they complain about the poor quality of shooting at night, which is not surprising - the darkness is the same.  Significant remarks in the reviews about the radar function: the "Arrow" type radars are correctly recognized, for the K-band the device does not at all correspond to the declared description.  It is indicated that the operation occurs only when the car has already passed under the camera. </p><p>  In addition, video files are stored in too large a volume - 500 megabytes with a duration of 3 minutes. </p><p>  Someone is inconvenient, according to reviews, the need to lay the cord under the skin of the car.  Otherwise, the stealth factor is lost.  Perhaps this is a necessary sacrifice that must be made.  After all, an alternative can be standard gadgets that are not ‚Äúdisguised‚Äù as a rearview mirror. </p><p>  There are also negative comments that contradict positive ones: car enthusiasts indicate frequent false positives, it has been suggested that the Vizant 750st radar detector can respond to gadgets in vehicles passing by.  And also the video quality is terrible (even in the daytime), license plate numbers can be distinguished only in pause mode. </p><p>  Unsuccessful attempts to connect the rear view camera to the product were also noted: the image from the additional device becomes excessively bright.  Perhaps it's all about poor software compatibility. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avto-blogger.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vizant 750st mirror recorder" class="if uuid-2467308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2467308.jpg"></div><h2>  Information in conclusion </h2><p>  Summarizing, it should be said that, in general, this device is characterized positively.  There are a lot of ‚Äúpositive‚Äù comments, fewer negative ones.  But when choosing, you should still study the reviews in detail.  And it‚Äôs best to find a friend with the same gadget model and independently verify the correct operation of this device in order to decide for yourself whether to buy a Vizant 750st dashcam or not.  After all, a qualitatively captured video will help to thoroughly restore the details of a traffic accident, which contributes to a quick consideration of the case in law enforcement agencies. </p>
