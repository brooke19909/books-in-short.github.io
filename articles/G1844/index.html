Their sound is perfect.  The budget model is simple, but was able to gain wide popularity.  Immediately you need to understand that headphones are created only for games.  Listening to music through them will be a mistake, as its reproduction leaves much to be desired.  High frequencies are lost here, but low frequencies show themselves excellently.  The scene is excellent, the detail is high.  Such headphones allow you to feel the game, enjoy shots and so on.  If any sounds are important to continue the plot, you can hear it right away. </p><p>  In the article we will consider all the nuances of appearance, sound, and also separately consider the advantages and disadvantages of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus cerberus headphones" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1998505.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The model is simple and concise.  An overview of the ASUS Cerberus headphones will be given in this article.  Ear pads are 10 cm in diameter.  In general, for most players this figure will be enough for a quality game.  Headphones have a closed acoustic design.  Sound insulation is passive, and it is at a good level, respectively, a person will not be distracted by extraneous sounds. </p><h2>  Ease of use </h2><p>  Buyers note that one of the most pleasant features is the wire on which the <span>volume control</span> and the on / off key are located.  The latter is responsible for working with the microphone.  These headphones are easy to use not only for games, but also for talking on the phone.  The kit includes a detachable microphone of excellent quality, and there is also an extension cord for working with a computer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus cerberus arctic headphones" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1998506.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The headphones discussed in the article are quite comfortable.  They do not press and do not press.  You can spend a lot of time in them, if not for one ‚Äúbut‚Äù, about which a little lower. </p><p>  There are two microphones in the headphones.  Thanks to this, the device can be used as a headset or as a portable model. </p><p>  Cables are the most reliable.  The wires have a fabric braid. </p><p>  In games, the sounds are of the highest quality.  Even with the fact that there is no surround playback system, playing with headphones is convenient.  Steps or explosions - everything is clear and easily distinguishable among themselves. </p><p>  The design can not be attributed to the pros or cons - someone likes it, but someone does not, but in general the appearance is not bad.  The design is simple but attracts attention. </p><p>  Value for money at the best level.  You should not expect special musicality from reproduction, but for its value, the positioning of sounds is at the best level, and this is considered the most important in these types of headphones. </p><p>  Price quality.  From the sound, of course, one should not expect any musicality here.  But for their very modest, compared to other models, price, these headphones give very good positioning of sounds, and this is the most important thing for a gaming headset. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the headband of the Asus Cerberus headphones (customer reviews confirm this) is made of plastic.  Of course, this material is reliable and durable.  However, it would be nice to use small metal inserts. </p><p>  Ventilation of cups would not hurt.  The fact is that after twenty minutes the headphones are used, the ears begin to sweat.  Because of this, they have to be removed after a while. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The design has bad features.  For example, cups are too large - 60 mm.  Moreover, they are not able to rotate 90 degrees.  Therefore, the headphones will be uncomfortable if removed and hung around the neck. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  These headphones are sold in a cardboard box.  It is made in black and red.  There is a huge blister.  The headset is placed in the box. </p><p>  There is a removable microphone, an extension cord is a Y-shaped wire. The standard mini-jack plug is 3.5 mm.  There is also a small adapter for working with other devices.  In any case, the manual comes with headphones.  There is also a warranty card. </p><p>  Unfortunately, a cover is not provided.  In addition, the device cannot be called a mobile headset, so this minus is not particularly critical. </p><p>  The package bundle is excellent.  Many buyers note that models for the same price from another manufacturer have a meager set.  That is why the company is pleased with such a response from customers. </p><h2>  Technical specifications of Asus Cerberus headphones </h2><p>  As already clear from the name of the model, the American company ASUS is engaged in production.  The type of headphone is a headset.  Monitor view design.  Connection is carried out only with a wire.  Closed acoustic design.  The frequency range is from 20 to 20 thousand Hz.  The impedance is 32 ohms. </p><p>  Mounting is carried out using the headband.  One-way connection.  The diameter of the membrane is 60 mm. </p><p>  Connection is made using a standard 3.2 mm jack.  Gold plated connectors.  The wire has a length of 1.2 m, an extended cable will be slightly larger.  The connector has received a straight form. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Microphone range from 50 to 16 thousand Hz.  You can turn the part on or off.  It is mounted movably.  Tuning the Asus Cerberus headphones will not produce much effect, since the sound is more dependent on the external sound card and the settings of its equalizer.  Due to the fact that the headphones do not have their own sound card, proprietary software for their work is not required. </p><p>  There is a volume control, a removable microphone and magnets.  Sold in black.  Weight - 0.26 kg. </p><p>  Now everyone knows and can understand the technical characteristics of the model in question.  If you think about many indicators, they are not at the best level, but completely overlap with other data.  Therefore, all the existing shortcomings can be called uncritical.  The device is comfortable and fits well on the head.  The headband does not rub or crush with prolonged wear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="headphones asus cerberus photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1998508.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Headband </h2><p>  Plastic used black and matte.  There are inserts of red color.  Even with such characteristics, the design cannot be called aggressive.  The forms are not chopped - on the contrary, they are smooth and soft.  The device is practical and convenient. </p><p>  The highlight of the design can be called a headband.  It is flexible and plastic.  Many buyers conduct a test - twist it with a screw.  The headband is then able to take its original form.  Why it happens?  The headset has a memory effect.  It is hidden under the headband and steel arcs.  The first part is made of synthetic materials, and the second is considered the basis for the design.  To prevent the user from seeing the rough model, steel arcs have a plastic shell. </p><p>  The headband has all the advantages of a classic spring.  It is soft, smooth, instantly returns to its original form.  Accordingly, during operation, the headphones do not grab the head too tightly, but they sit perfectly.  The headband also has another feature.  There is no fixation of the sliding mechanism.  He, in fact, is simply not there.  When a person puts on headphones, the headband moves apart.  You can even notice the plastic tape on the sides.  As soon as the headset is removed, everything will return to its place.  Therefore, the ergonomics of the headphones is as simple and reliable as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus cerberus gaming headphones review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2001141.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Cups </h2><p>  Conducting a review of Asus Cerberus <span>gaming headphones</span> , it should be said that all headsets from the manufacturer received large cups, including the model in question.  The diameter of the parts is 100 mm.  Thanks to this, the manufacturer was able to install 60 mm emitters.  Also, this indicator makes it easier to wear headphones.  Large ear cushions made of leather perfectly cover your ears, which ensures sound insulation.  Cups can take off a little, but not 90 degrees, as usual.  In principle, a small characteristic is more than enough.  The bowl mount looks really reliable.  No need to be afraid that the device will break after two to three times wearing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus cerberus headphones customization" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1998509.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Microphone </h2><p>  On the bottom left you should notice the connector, which is necessary to connect an external microphone.  You can also insert an audio cable here.  The microphone that comes with the kit is arranged on a twisted metal bar.  It can take any form.  When compared with the headband, the microphone simply does not return to its original shape, this should be taken into account.  The device also has a foam pad that will remove all unnecessary noise. </p><h2>  Cable </h2><p>  The model received a quality cable.  It has a strong synthetic braid.  The wire is hard, but it bends easily.  It will not work to tear it or deform it.  The cable stretched for 1.2 meters, has a four-pin connector. </p><h2>  Additional wire </h2><p>  In order to connect to regular computers, you need to use this cord - type Y. The wire is included.  Its length was 1.3 meters.  In general, the total length of two cables should be enough for anyone - 2.5 m. </p><h2>  Remote control volume and microphone </h2><p>  In addition to the usual microphone, which can be removed, the headset has a built-in.  It is located in the control panel.  The latter is on the cable.  The remote control received a clip made of plastic, due to which you can fix the profile on the clothes.  On the part you can find a wheel that decreases / increases the volume and a movable microphone switch. </p><h2>  Headphone Impressions </h2><p>  Headphones have their own characteristics, although they are few.  They attract the attention of buyers.  The manufacturer paid more attention to wearing comfort, rather than design.  However, it is also impossible to say that the appearance was lost.  This model is a confident average. </p><p>  At an external examination, it was noticed that the headphones fit perfectly on the head.  They are able to automatically adjust to the characteristics of the head of each person.  And it does not matter who uses them - a child of ten years old or an adult man.  And this is not an exaggeration - users have confirmed this fact.  The headset fits easily and quickly.  No need to adjust the headband.  The headphones sit firmly on the head, so it is difficult to knock them off the head (by accident) with sharp jumps or fast running.  Turns by the case and so on are not terrible. </p><p>  Headphones Asus Cerberus Arctic will cause discomfort in humans, only if they are on the neck.  Many buyers do not like to completely remove their headphones - it‚Äôs easier to lower them to the neck.  And here the user will feel great discomfort.  Cups will rest on the chin, because they simply do not bow to another level.  As a result, you have to almost peek out over the headphones.  The owners note that this is inconvenient, so after a few minutes of such walking the headphones are either removed or put back on the head.  This may seem like a minus of the design itself, but still this question hurts the usability of the device. </p><p>  Users note that, if desired, you can throw headphones into a clogged portfolio and calmly get to the desired goal.  The device will not break.  It may crack or get some dents, but the headphones will not break. </p><p>  Of course, I need to say about the sound quality of Asus Cerberus Arctic headphones.  No need to expect anything supernatural from this model.  Regular <span>monitor headphones of</span> the same price category will be much better.  The headset has a specific sound that works perfectly in conjunction with games or movies.  The picture is not juicy and bright, sometimes it seems that the frequency range is clearly underestimated.  But on the other hand, when you turn on games or movies, it is understood that the manufacturer has perfectly matched the sound to the desired type of playback.  To work with these types of music, headphones must have clarity, proper sound positioning and no noise. </p><p>  The speakers are big.  They have a diameter of 60 mm.  There are no complaints to them.  The sound detail is top notch.  Nobody recommends listening to classical music through these headphones.  They are suitable only for compressed audio and video films, as well as games.  Headphones do just fine with this limited list. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gaming headphones asus cerberus" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1998511.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Price </h2><p>  The average cost of the device is 3 thousand rubles.  It fully justifies all the disadvantages of the device, which were described above.  Headphone setup is not necessary.  They work immediately after connecting to the port.  A photo of Asus Cerberus headphones is contained in the article. </p><p>  Thanks to the materials, you can evaluate the appearance of the device, and understand whether you really like the model.

You can‚Äôt call the device universal, but it will be perfect for gamers.  Since drivers for ASUS Cerberus headphones do not need to be installed.  This greatly saves time and effort. </p><p>  Black headphones ASUS Cerberus can not be called a universal model (this applies to both games and music), but gamers can quite recommend it for purchase. </p><p>  All owners are quite happy with their purchase.  The headset really deserves praise.  For a small price, the owner receives a quality and convenient device.
