But there are exceptions.  Phoenix Island (China) appeared as the goddess of beauty Aphrodite from the sea.  The man-made formation of the Middle Kingdom is ready to surpass the famous <span>landmark of the United Arab Emirates.</span>  Rather, combine the two futuristic masterpieces of the UAE - the Palma archipelago in Jumeirah and the Parus Hotel. </p><p>  The largest project in the history of China (after the construction of the Great Wall) was launched in two thousand and eight.  What came of this?  You will learn the answer to this question from this article.  We will tell about the man-made island everything that is known at the moment.  After all, construction is still not finished.  But the greatest attraction of South China is already attracting considerable attention of tourists, and its photograph adorns the guides in the region.  Let's take a virtual tour of the man-made island with such a sonorous name - Phoenix. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phoenix island" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1266073.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is </h2><p>  South China is famous among vacationers around the world Hainan.  It is a natural island, the second largest in the country after Taiwan.  It is known for the fact that the only one in the Middle Kingdom lies in the tropical climate zone.  Therefore, Hainan is often called Thailand in miniature or Asian Hawaii.  This island is a favorite place for Russian tourists, especially from the eastern regions of the Russian Federation.  A short flight allows them to escape from the cracking Siberian frosts and warm their bones on the amazing sandy beaches of Hainan.  Arriving at the airport takes the city of Haikou - the provincial capital.  In the south of the island there are many resorts.  And the most brilliant of them is Sanya.  Getting to her from Haikou Airport by bus is not difficult.  It was off the coast of Sanya that they began to erect the Phoenix island in 2008.  Already in May this year, with the barely outlined embankment, the Olympic flame of the twenty-ninth Games began its journey across the planet.  Perhaps this is the name Phoenix.  Although the Chinese also believe in a mythical bird.  The local name of the island is Fenghuang Tao. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phoenix island china" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1266070.jpg" width="600"></div>

You can cross this distance by taxi.  In the future, the possibility of a ferry crossing is being considered.  The cheapest option available today is city buses.  Route No. 25 follows from <span>Dadonghai Bay</span> to the man-made island, and route No. 26 from Sanyavan. Buses take passengers to the start of Fenghuang Tao (Phoenix).  To get to the dream island, you need to go through a security inspection at a checkpoint.  After the checkpoint, customers of Phoenix hotels expect electric cars.  All types of vehicles running on gas are prohibited on the ecological island.  However, the cleanliness of the surrounding water area can be questioned.  Indeed, the construction of a port for ocean liners was included in the ambitious project for the construction of the Phoenix.  Nevertheless, the man-made island remains the largest <span>attraction of Sanya</span> and Hainan in general.  After all, such futuristic architecture can not be found anywhere else, except in Dubai. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hainan Phoenix Island" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1266065.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Phoenix Island (Hainan) </h2><p>  The project was approved in 2007.  The bulk island, barely rising above the waters of the South China Sea, was supposed to have a perfectly oval shape, one thousand one hundred and three hundred and seventy meters wide.  Thus, the Fenghuang Tao area is incomplete four square kilometers.  However, such a tiny piece of land, reclaimed from the ocean, is literally ‚Äústuffed‚Äù with various elite and futuristic buildings.  The total built-up area at the moment is three hundred and ninety-three thousand square meters.  Like the Palma archipelago in the Emirates, Phoenix Island in China has the most expensive housing in the country.  In addition to private apartments and luxury hotels with seven stars, there are luxurious boutiques, restaurants, park areas and playgrounds on the embankment.  The real decoration of the island is a fifty-meter sculpture of the Phoenix - a fabulous bird, which, according to Chinese mythology, brings good luck and longevity.  It rises on a separate island on the southern headland of the embankment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Filling" of the Phoenix </h2><p>  It is not necessary to be a client of one of the luxury hotels, a tenant of apartments or a passenger of an ocean liner to get acquainted with this very key <span>attraction of Hainan.</span>  But first, you should take a picture of the Phoenix island from afar, from the Sanya embankment.  It seems as if a two-hundred-meter-high building is rising from the bottom of the sea, resembling the famous Parus Hotel in Fujairah with its outlines.  Like the Emirates, this high-rise building houses a seven-star hotel.  The hotel is surrounded, like twin sisters, by five 28-story houses.  The cost of housing in them reaches twenty-four thousand dollars per square meter!  Do you think the apartments are empty?  Not at all.  For those who like to live closer to land on the island, lower buildings have also been built - six ultra-luxury cottages.  The infrastructure on Phoenix allows the islanders not to feel the lack of anything.  There is a park with the intricate name "The deer turned his head."  It is located right next to the bridge leading to Sanya.  It is supposed to build an amusement park here.  There are private schools and colleges, sports clubs, restaurants, shops on the island. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phoenix Sanya" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1266064.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Phoenix Building </h2><p>  The work on arranging the man-made embankment was led by the architectural company MAD Studio, which promised to finish it by two thousand fourteen.  However, the results of the implementation of a bold design project were presented to the general public ahead of schedule.  The opening of the island on December 1, 2011 brought together rich people from all over the world.  In the evening, such a firework was given that it was long remembered by the inhabitants of Sanya.  But the work has not yet been completed.  Phoenix Island continues to settle down and beautify.  A conference room, a marina and other grandiose buildings are being built. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phoenix island in china" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1266075.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to see on Phoenix </h2><p>  What is remarkable Phoenix?  The buildings on it represent an amazing mix of ancient Chinese architecture with the futuristic hi-tech style.  The buildings are dominated by bizarre curved lines.  The color of the buildings is such that it seems as if the sea and clouds are connected in them.  Do not leave Phoenix Island after dark.  The photo of high-rise buildings illuminated by a million LED lamps is the hallmark of this man-made landmark. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phoenix Sanya Island Hotels" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1266087.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Phoenix Island (Sanya): hotels </h2><p>  Finding a budget hotel in this prestigious land area is a futile task.  The futuristic project costs the Chinese government and foreign investors more than five billion yuan, which amounts to seven hundred million US dollars.  Given the small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe man-made island (less than four square kilometers), we can only judge how much land is on this embankment.  One can only list the boutique hotels on Phoenix.  These are Jing High Branch, Luxury Life, Shenyang Apartment, Sanya President Resort, Xinchen Sea View Holiday Hotel, Sanya Skyview Luxury Apartment and Phoenix Island Royal Menzon.  However, their prices are much higher than in similar hotels in Hainan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phoenix island photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1266071.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Evening phoenix </h2><p>  Vacationers Sanya with sunset go to the promenade of the city.  Their goal is not to admire the sunset at all, although he is also insanely beautiful here.  After all, one of the attractions that Phoenix Island is famous for is its highlight.  The American company Daktroniks has developed special panels that are mounted in the walls of buildings from the outside using the latest propixel technology.  Thanks to this, residents of elite hotels and private apartments are absolutely not uncomfortable with the riot of lights.  And people around admire the successive video compositions.  It is best to admire the game of lights from the Sanya embankment.  But a good sight opens from the terraces of elite restaurants on the island of Phoenix. </p>
