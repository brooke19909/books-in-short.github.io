  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Maximum Contribution In Gold</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today the period has come when it is necessary to look at how to make the maximum contribution to gold, because  economies of world countries are shocked by new crises, and their currency has lost its former stability. <br><br>  The basis for those who decided to choose their investment as ‚ÄúMaximum contribution to gold‚Äù will be, even without looking at the fact that there was a small drop in the exchange rate - this is the price of gold.  The price of this metal has increased since the beginning of the year by twelve percent in the equivalent in US dollars.  Only a small number of banks store deposits in gold.  The ‚Äúpublication‚Äù provided such data as of September 2009 that only 12 institutions have such a product. <br><br>  At any courses in economics they teach that if it is necessary for banks to attract new resources for themselves, they mean operations to place the same resources on their own.  There is also today a low development of lending in gold.  The global crisis hit the consumers and jewelry production significantly, the pockets of those who were the main consumers of the product.  Banking interest after such events in ‚Äúgold deposits‚Äù is extremely significantly different from other resources. <br><br>  The main and main rule of the gold deposit is a careful approach, a multifaceted and comprehensively clarified view of deposits in gold.  The complexity and diversity of the product is so high that it is extremely difficult to track all the facets and aspects that can result in all the cash receipts and profits of the one who invested to "0". <br><br>  With the availability of volumetric bullions in the hands of the depositor, an interest arises in such a service as an anonymized metal account with a savings bank, or the interest of those who want to collect a deposit in dimensional bullion.  Having such an ingot, you can store it in a safe and expect a new increase in quotations, and hence the price of this metal. <br><br>  ‚ÄúCash out‚Äù can even be a deposit that does not have a physical support, but a fee for additional fees will be required.  Those who wish at the end of the deposit period to collect its value in currency or cash equivalent should open a deposit ‚Äúin non-cash gold‚Äù.  Those who buy non-cash gold pay only for the metal itself and receive the maximum contribution to gold in the future.  When purchasing cash gold, it is necessary to pay the bullion itself, its production, its delivery, storage, etc.  - In the world, most of all operations with precious metals are made with non-cash gold.  The main plus of non-cash gold is the extremely low margin level for purchases and sales (about one percent), while for operations with cash gold the indicator grows ten times. ‚Äù </p></div></article>
