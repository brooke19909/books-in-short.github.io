    <p>  From the photo you can immediately say that rest in this palace is not cheap.  Middle class people are unlikely to be able to afford health in this fairy tale.  Everything is so beautiful and elegant that, not knowing where it is, you might think that this is sunny Antalya or one of the islands of Spain. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Accommodation for vacationers </h2><p>  The elite building of the Marat sanatorium (Gaspra, Crimea) is Park Chair, a villa with twenty-four comfortable rooms at its disposal.

    <p>  The beach at the hotel is private, pebble.  All vacationers at Park Chair villas receive a VIP beach card, which gives the right to use all beach equipment: sun loungers, umbrellas, awnings, showers, changing rooms.  For a fee, vacationers can stay in cozy bungalows with mattresses and curtains. </p><h2>  Villa "Park Chair" (Crimea): reviews </h2><p>  Reviews of vacationers about staying in this elite resort hotel are almost all positive.  Tourists are quite satisfied with the rest spent here and consider it worthy, like the popular resorts of Turkey and Egypt, and you can trace the fact that every year the reviews are getting better, that is, the hotel is improving and developing. </p><p>  Guests note the professionalism of the staff, its presentability, hospitality and courtesy. </p><p>  All guests are satisfied with the rooms.  The reviews say about the successful layout of the villa, about cleanliness, decent furniture and household appliances.  High-quality plumbing is also not satisfactory. </p><p>  Some tourists say that there is some disorganization of the administrative staff during check-in, especially at night: there are no carriers of suitcases and nocturnal meals. </p><p>  Nutrition, in principle, is not satisfactory.  The food is tasty and quite varied, but there is no such abundance, as, for example, in hotels in Turkey. </p><p>  Regarding the beach, vacationers make comments.  There is some neglect and mismatch with photos from the official site.  Many sun loungers are after repair and must be replaced long ago.  Mattresses are not available on sun loungers, while in all popular resorts this is the norm. </p><p>  There are no complaints about the sea itself, the sea is clean, the slope is gentle.  There are some negative reviews about off-season cold water, but this does not apply to reviews about the villa. </p><p>  The outdoor pool pleases both children and adults.  Vacationers respond positively about it, water slides and hydromassages do not let you get bored. </p><p>  In general, Park-Chair (villa 4 *, Crimea) receives positive reviews and satisfies vacationers.  However, the administration has much to strive for.  Still, when compared with the popular resorts of other countries, the local people are somewhat behind, but the conditions for development, of course, exist. </p><p>  Tourists leave negative reviews about the hot water supply, which is not available at night.  By VIP standards, this is unacceptable, water should be around the clock. </p><p>  Animation at the hotel is, but relatively weak, as tourists say.  The children's club of creativity and the magnificent children's organizer is celebrated and praised. </p><p>  The location of the hotel is flawless.  Very comfortable.  Proximity to all Crimean sights, convenient location, park area and the views that opened did not leave indifferent tourists. </p><p>  Reviews of vacationers at Park Chair villa allow us to conclude that in order to have a dignified and comfortable rest, it is not necessary to fly to distant lands.  Our close and affordable Crimea can offer a vacation no worse, and maybe even better, because it is dearer. </p>
