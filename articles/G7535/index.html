After all, there is a huge assortment of them, many price categories, all well-known brands - it is easy to make a choice.  However, when potential buyers are guided by a good and durable product, the search circle narrows sharply, because 90% of the market is represented by new Chinese brands, which no one had heard of a couple of years ago. </p>

    <p>  This article presents the wonderful Asus Zenpad 10 tablet. ‚Äù  Reviews, specifications and a description of the product will allow the reader to get acquainted with one of the best devices on the mobile technology market, and at the same time decide on a choice in the price range of 15-25 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Market positioning </h2><p>  A well-known Taiwanese manufacturer decided to satisfy all buyers looking for a decent gadget in different price categories, and introduced several modifications of the device to the market: </p><ul><li>  with support for WiFi (Z300C); </li><li>  with support for 3G and WiFi (Z300CG); </li><li>  with support for LTE and WiFi (Z300CL). </li></ul><p>  This solution found support among all potential buyers, because not every user wants to overpay for technologies that he will not use.  Due to the fact that in the vastness of our vast country 3G coverage prevails over LTE technologies, the Asus Zenpad 10 Z300CG 1B018A 3G 16 Gb White tablet is officially recognized as the best-selling device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Do not forget that modifications equipped with 3G or 4G modules have GSM support, which means that they allow the user to make calls from the tablet and exchange instant messages.  The cheap representative (Z300C) does not have the required functionality at the hardware level. </p><h2>  First meeting </h2><p>  As practice shows, most users decide to purchase in the first minute of their acquaintance with a mobile device.  Then the company's technologists did their best.  Firstly, the thinnest case of the device is made of very high-quality plastic that will not slip out of your hands.  Along with the miniature, the Asus Zenpad 10 16Gb White tablet still has a small weightiness, giving the future owner some confidence that he is not the next Chinese trinket. </p>

    <p>  Elegant body, luxurious look and excellent build quality are the basic criteria that influence the choice of the buyer.  But to the configuration of the device there are questions.  Advertising on this device, which is present in the media, demonstrates the gadget in combination with a docking station and a touch pen for drawing.  However, these wonderful devices are not in the package - they must be purchased separately. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Performance first </h2><p>  Reviews for the <span>Asus</span> Zenpad 10 Z300C tablet begin with a description of the powerful <span>Intel Atom processor.</span>  The crystal has 4 cores and uses a 64-bit platform.  The amount of RAM, as practice shows, cannot be called decent - 2 gigabytes for such an expensive device are a minimum.  But for multimedia and office applications this is enough.  And for fans of demanding toys, it is better to look at tablets with a large amount of memory and a more efficient processor. </p><p>  Users have questions about the graphics accelerator.  The manufacturer acted dishonestly with customers by providing a gadget with an LTE modem with a PowerVR G6430 video card (like on the Iphone 5S), while in other versions a weak Mali 450 MP4 video adapter is installed.  On the other hand, the user is still not destined to play productive games anyway, so there is no point in overpaying for a powerful accelerator. </p><h2>  Technical Games </h2><p>  Apparently, the manufacturer promotes only one modification on the market, and all other products are needed only to create competition in budget niches.  We are talking about the tablet Asus Zenpad 10 Z300CL.  Reviews of the negative nature of potential buyers can be understood, just compare the technical characteristics of all devices. </p>

    <p>  The main camera modification Z300CL has a 5-megapixel sensor with software interpolation up to 8 megapixels.  For other products, the camera has a resolution of 2 megapixels.  The same goes for the front camera (0.3 megapixel versus 2 megapixel sensor). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The manufacturer also played with the amount of internal memory, equipping an expensive modification with a 64-gigabyte solid-state drive, while younger products have exactly half the amount.  It all boils down to the fact that the older modification is a more sought-after purchase in the domestic market (only the price can stop - 25,000 rubles). </p><h2>  Weak link </h2><p>  It is good that the manufacturer thought of equipping a 10-inch device with a modern IPS matrix.  However, there are a number of problems with the screen that is installed on the Asus Zenpad 10 tablet. ‚Äù  Reviews, price, specifications and reviews of enthusiasts lead to the idea that the liquid crystal display is of poor quality.  Better to start with resolution - 1280x800 dpi is a very low indicator.  Five years ago, it was a decent parameter, but now FullHD is considered a minimum. </p>

    <p>  The built-in ambient light sensor does not fulfill its direct obligations at all.  Many users prefer to manually adjust the brightness of the screen, as the automatic system reacts too slowly to changes in lighting, and also tries to constantly save energy in bright lighting by setting the backlight to its maximum position at 80%. </p><h2>  Useful and useless features </h2><p>  Some users are very interested in what the owners think about the additional functionality that the gadget is equipped with, and what reviews the Asus Zenpad 10 16Gb Z300C tablet has about this.  The performance characteristics of all kinds of sensors for most buyers are in the first place, so they will be discussed. </p><ol><li>  Accelerometer  It is suitable for both work and games.  During operation, users have no questions for him. </li><li>  <span>Digital compass.</span>  The most useless feature that no one ever uses. </li><li>  <span>Hall Sensor.</span>  A very useful feature that can turn off the display when the device is placed in a case, or when the tablet approaches your ear when making a voice call. </li><li>  Light sensor  The fact that he is is good, but his efficiency causes a lot of negative emotions. </li></ol><h2>  The best accessory </h2><p>  Naturally, we will talk about the docking station, which is equipped not only with a keyboard unit, but also with an integrated speaker system, about which there are only positive reviews in the media.  Asus Zenpad 10 Z300CG 16Gb on the hardware and software level can work with any wireless accessories available on the mobile market, however, it is better to give preference to the brand decision of the manufacturer Asus Zen Audio Dock. </p><p>  Firstly, the user is provided with full comfort - in fact, the docking station turns the tablet into a laptop.  All this thanks to the articulated mechanism with which the accessory is equipped.  The gadget's display can be positioned at any angle, or even folded like a book, moving closer to the keyboard unit. </p><p>  As for the keys themselves, they strongly resemble the keyboard of Apple products both in appearance and in quality.  There are no questions to the built-in speakers either; they sound quite loud and of high quality. </p><h2>  Instrument of a true artist </h2><p>  Artists and designers will certainly be interested in the Asus Zenpad 10 tablet. ‚Äù  User reviews assure others that with the optional Zen Stylus accessory, you can draw real masterpieces on your device‚Äôs screen.  Once again, you can recall Apple products, or rather, an accessory called Pencil, with which young talents and professional portrait painters create masterpieces on the iPad screen. </p>

    <p>  In fact, this is the same tool, with similar functionality and the principle of operation.  Devices differ only in color and cost (the Asus product is 3 times cheaper than the American counterpart).  As for the convenience of drawing, here, too, the Taiwanese representative has everything at the highest level.  You can find a discrepancy only when working with shades of bright colors at high resolutions - the Apple product, no doubt, has a higher quality. </p><h2>  Software part </h2><p>  ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù version 5.0 is an updated operating system that is installed in the Asus Zenpad 10 <span>3G 16Gb</span> Z300CG tablet.  For some reason, the description from the manufacturer in the media does not pay attention to the program part.  After examining the feedback of the owners, and getting acquainted with the conclusions of enthusiasts, it should be concluded that Taiwanese technologists spent too little time on both the firmware of the device and the proprietary software. </p>

    <p>  The tablet is constantly trying to save energy.  Apparently, the manufacturer is to blame for this, which claimed 16 hours of continuous operation of the device.  In standalone mode, the tablet reduces the brightness of the backlight (even in those cases when it is needed), slows down the processor (when working with several demanding applications, this is noticeable), and also knows how to adjust the power of wireless modules.  Users expect more loyal firmware on the manufacturer‚Äôs website for their devices. </p><h2>  Interesting functionality </h2><p>  Music lovers appreciated the functionality of the DTS-HD Premium Sound, which is equipped with the Asus Zenpad Z300CG 10 16Gb tablet.  Owner reviews positively describe the work of virtual multi-channel sound, which the gadget is able to output both to the speakers and to the connected stereo headphones.  It is worth paying tribute to the manufacturer, because he implemented this functionality not only at the hardware level, but also provided the owner with the opportunity to manage the settings using the program of the same name. </p><p>  To improve the quality of photographs taken by the built-in camera will help the proprietary utility PixelMaster, which perfectly copes with the task.  Many users in their reviews compare this application with the plot programs of digital cameras, however, as practice shows, the functionality from Asus is several times more interesting and convenient. </p><h2>  A bit about bullying </h2><p>  The manufacturer did quite strange with his fans, installing a low-quality screen in the Asus Zenpad 10 tablet. ‚Äù  User reviews could have forgotten this incident as a nightmare, however, the ASUS VisualMaster proprietary utility, built into the device at the firmware level, constantly reminds the owners about this. </p>

    <p>  Many services created by this application try to make the image on the screen more contrast and bright.  Yes, when viewing high-quality color pictures (although at a resolution of 1280x800 dpi it is difficult to talk about it without a smile), there is a certain 3D feeling, but automatic backlight control can easily ruin everything. </p><p>  But the ASUS TruVivid function is a kind of artificial intelligence that the Asus Zenpad 10 tablet is equipped with.  User reviews describe in detail the operation of this utility, which is able to adjust the screen sensor to the pressure of the owners.  It is very convenient to work with such functionality.  The user does not need to get used to the sensitivity of the screen, the tablet does everything by itself. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  After studying the capabilities of the device and a closer acquaintance with its functionality, all positive feedback from users becomes clear.  Asus Zenpad 10 Z300CG 16Gb really has all the necessary qualities to become the best purchase for any owner: </p><ul><li>  affordable cost; </li><li>  high performance; </li><li>  excellent functionality; </li><li>  the presence of accessories that expand the capabilities of the tablet. </li></ul><p>  Not without negative, especially if you touch on the quality of the liquid crystal display.  But in the price category ‚Äúup to 25,000 rubles‚Äù it will be difficult to find an analogue of higher quality, except in the secondary market.  Therefore, you can safely recommend this device to all customers who wish to purchase a high-tech device in the mobile market. </p>
