    <h2>  Features of the scientific point of view </h2><p>  Most scholars are of the opinion that man comes from ape-like creatures.  The latter changed in the process of evolution.  Their backs were straightened, long arms were shortened.  The brain continued to develop.  Thanks to this, these creatures became smarter.  Their separation from the animal world was inevitable.  So the first ancient people appeared.  It is worth noting that the above theory is not fully supported by scientific evidence.  Nevertheless, even at school, they begin to study how ancient people lived (the 5th grade of the school curriculum gives brief information about that era). </p><h2>  Features of the appearance </h2><p>  The history of ancient man begins about two million years ago.  The earliest remains were discovered by scientists in Africa.  Thanks to this, it became possible to establish how he looked.  This man could walk only by leaning forward strongly.  He had arms so long that they hung even below the knees.  At the same time, his forehead was sloping and low.  Powerful <span>eyebrows</span> protruded above the eyes.  The size of his brain was smaller than that of a <span>modern person.</span>  However, when compared with a monkey, it was larger.  This person has not yet learned to speak.  He was only able to make jerky sounds.  People continued to evolve over time.  The volume of their brain has increased.  The appearance has also changed.  Gradually, they began to learn speech. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient man's story" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/556353.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of the first tools </h2><p>  The life of ancient people was full of dangers.  They needed food and protection from various predators.  For this, special devices were needed.  So the first tools of ancient people appeared.  They were made from improvised materials found in nature.  A few stone blows between each other were enough to make a coarse, but durable fixture with a pointed end.  With the help of it, digging sticks were grinded and clubs were cut down.  The first tools of ancient people were represented precisely by them, as well as pointed stones.  Thanks to the ability to make them, man was different from animals.  The work of ancient people can be called painstaking and hard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tools of ancient people" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/556355.jpg" width="370"></div>

    <h2>  Core activities </h2><p>  The life of ancient people, in particular Neanderthals, took place in caves.  In the ice age, they protected people from the cold.  Near the remains of Neanderthals, scientists often managed to find the bones of cave hyenas, lions and bears.  This means that a person had to fight with predatory animals for housing.  The remains of other animals, such as large ones like a rhinoceros or a mammoth, allow us to conclude that the life of ancient people was closely connected with intensive hunting.  In the time of Moustier, it especially developed.  The history of ancient man indicates that to a large extent food was obtained by hunting small animals, as well as collecting fruits and roots. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient people grade 5" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/556354.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of the hunting process </h2><p>  Neanderthals from the Mousterian era went hunting not only in open areas.  They also visited forests for these purposes.  There they chased mainly medium-sized animals.  The life of ancient people forced them to unite.  Very often they attacked together large animals.  Sometimes they were sick and defenseless animals caught in a swamp or pit.  Neanderthals did not disdain eating their corpses.  The whole process of cutting an animal was divided into several stages.  Killing him, Neanderthals using stone tools cut the skin.  Also, through their use, meat was removed.  Long bones were broken.  Then the nutritious bone marrow was extracted, and the brain was extracted from the skull.  The meat was eaten raw.  It could also be pre-fried at the stake.  Most likely, the skins of slaughtered animals were used to shelter the body. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first ancient people" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/556356.jpg" width="468"></div>

    <h2>  Further development </h2><p>  In the era of Moustier, the management and technique of farming became much more complicated.  The division of labor continued.  The most experienced hunters became leaders in the primitive herd.  It is worth noting that the European Neanderthals were quite adapted to environmental conditions, even quite severe.  However, their life expectancy was significantly reduced due to the difficulties of the struggle and various diseases. </p><h2>  Features of stone fixtures </h2><p>  The existence of <span>primitive man</span> was filled with dangers and hardships.  As for the stone tools of Neanderthals, they were already very diverse.  In addition, their processing has improved compared to previous eras.  Hand choppers related to shell culture were made thanks to the upholstery of the stone core with a certain calculation.  So, one end was supposed to be a cutting, stabbing and percussion instrument.  At the same time, the other was made so that it was convenient to hold in a hand clenched in a fist.  The Shell era is also characterized by other forms of tools, in addition to manual chopping.  Ashel culture is characterized by more symmetrical instruments.  They are upholstered over the entire surface.  Thus, it is advisable to conclude that it was then that the techniques of new technology arose.  There are also tools that are made of fragments shot down from the nuclei.  As for the Moustier era, for her the most typical are the pointed and scraper.  They were produced not from flint kernel, but from flakes.  In the Moustier era, the technique of manufacturing tools has changed dramatically.  This is evidenced by the manufacture of devices found in European deposits.  If we compare with the Acheulean form, then there was a change in the size of the ancient tools.  This makes it possible to more accurately judge the methods of their use.  In some cases, guns can be found in large quantities.  Usually they are next to the remains of bonfires and broken animal bones.  The ancient tools of people, as well as some other elements associated with their activities, provide an opportunity to draw important conclusions about the <span>lifestyle of a</span> person of that time.  The same applies to the level of economic and <span>social development.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="labor of ancient people" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/556357.jpg" width="556"></div>

    <h2>  Features of the organization of labor </h2><p>  Of course, it was necessary to work not only for men, but also for women.  However, it is obvious that the form of their labor participation was different.  It is advisable to take into account the anatomical and physiological characteristics inherent in women.  They could not take part in the hunt for large animals, since it required a quick and long chase.  In addition, it was more difficult for women to deal with dangerous animals, as well as throw stones.  Thus, there was an urgent need for the division of labor.  And this was required not only by hunting, but also by many other features of the life of ancient people.  The complication of public relations, as well as collective action. </p>
