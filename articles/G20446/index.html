However, she rarely succeeds in creating masterpieces.  So, 3 decades after the presentation of the Walkman portable CD player, the Japanese manufacturer introduced the next portable device, which is destined to become a legend for the next several decades.  The focus of this article is the Sony GTK-X1BT boombox.  A review of the model, customer and expert reviews, as well as comparison with other <span>speakers</span> will allow users to get to know the new product better. </p>

    <h2>  Special offer </h2><p>  Many manufacturers on the world market have long been trying to combine cool acoustics, light music, a DJ console and modern multimedia technologies in one device for a long time, only the result is deplorable.  In the pursuit of low cost, Chinese manufacturers forget about quality, and serious brands create boring systems in a conservative manner that attract only a few customers. </p><p>  Sony GTK-X1BT Music Center is a dream of any person who is able to satisfy the needs of any music lover, without reference to age, gender or nationality.  This is the new Sony Walkman player, only in a modified shell, with improved functionality and great acoustic capabilities.  Once you see this boombox in action, and the desire to own it will lead the music lover to the audio equipment store for a purchase. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First meeting </h2><p>  The Sony GTK-X1BT music system, the price of which is within 20,000 rubles, comes in a huge package, which is not only dimensional, but also very heavy.  However, after removing the gadget from the box, it turns out that the boombox is not so heavy, and the protective packaging, foam and many cellulose partitions, which protected the center of the music center from shocks during transportation, gave the package its weight and large dimensions. </p>

    <p>  Before the first start-up, the manufacturer recommends that the new owners dry the stereo system well, leaving it in a ventilated room for one day.  It is clear that many buyers will ignore this advice, but experts still recommend making sure that the speakers of the device are dry, otherwise they will simply vomit at high volume. </p><h2>  Sound Power Above All </h2><p>  Regarding the acoustic abilities of the Sony GTK-X1BT, expert reviews were divided into two camps.  Some believe that the 500 Watt RMS sound power for two speakers operating in different frequency ranges is sufficient to extract high-quality sound.  It is logical to assume that the stereo system is ready to cope with any genre, providing the user with the entire frequency range from 20 to 20,000 Hz. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  However, there are many questions for the boombox.  Firstly, the RMS standard.  It demonstrates the peak load, and the nominal in this case will be 300 watts (150 watts per speaker).  That is, the power is artificially inflated by the manufacturer.  There are questions about high frequencies, because all speakers even in the middle class have a separate ‚Äútweeter‚Äù for reproducing sound at high frequencies.  No one has any questions about the bass - they are deep, sensitive and have no interference even at maximum volume. </p><h2>  Innovative approach </h2><p>  The light music built into the Sony GTK-X1BT speakers is, of course, far from the stroboscopes used on the dance floor, but in low light the power of the LEDs is enough to create the atmosphere of a real disco.  True, without sound, judging by the reviews of the owners, light music does not look very attractive. </p><p>  Finally, at least one manufacturer of the overall <span>speaker system</span> thought of providing his product with convenient handles for transporting the device.  This is truly a breakthrough in the multimedia market.  It is worth noting about the capabilities of the boombox to measure sound in the room, determine the position of the speakers (vertical or horizontal) and automatically adjust the equalizer.  That is, in a room, on the street, in a theater or in a bathroom - everywhere the sound will play without distortion. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Full availability for sound source </h2><p>  By reviewing the Sony GTK-X1BT music center, readers will probably find that the portable device is not only able to communicate via Bluetooth wireless technology, but also supports working with the NFC system, which was originally intended by the developer to work in the banking sector.  In fact, without unnecessary movements, the user just needs to turn on NFC on his smartphone and put the mobile device on the speaker (in a special niche) to listen to music. </p>

    <p>  As for Bluetooth, the device supports several connections at once (the choice is made from the control panel), and there is also the possibility of authorization, which eliminates interference with the acoustics from the outside.  The device can also read music from a USB drive, for this purpose a corresponding port is provided on the case, which has the function of charging mobile devices. </p><h2>  Hidden gadget features </h2><p>  It is strange that the manufacturer kept silent about the additional features of the mini music center Sony GTK-X1BT.  If you have several similar devices, you can combine them into one system using the Party Chain function wirelessly.  The speakers connected to the head system will not only play the same music, but they will even borrow the frequency settings from the leading music center.  Judging by the reviews of sellers, 4 such systems can control any disco. </p>

    <p>  The owners of smartphones based on Android are opening up additional possibilities for controlling the stereo system: remote control and advanced settings.  The manufacturer has equipped his product with a radio receiver that does an excellent job of searching for radio stations and playing music in stereo.  After all, the entire speaker is one large antenna. </p><h2>  Control system </h2><p>  It is better for users of the Sony GTK-X1BT music center to start familiarizing themselves with the operating instructions, since the device‚Äôs menu is more like a spacecraft control system.  It‚Äôs too early to talk about the negative about the stereo system settings, because the manufacturer in any case tested the music center and revealed that even a child can deal with the controls (in any case, there are no age restrictions on the package).  You need to take instructions, a remote control, turn on the music and perform the step-by-step actions prescribed in the instruction manual. </p><p>  As for the LCD screen with LED backlight, it is really small and uninformative.  Yes, in the dark it enhances the club atmosphere, but most buyers want to see the functionality involved on the display, and not enjoy the beautiful backlight. </p><h2>  Passion around Sony products </h2><p>  Readers could not fail to notice that the review conducted by the Sony GTK-X1BT music center demonstrates the convenience and portability of the gadget, but its use for outdoor activities, away from civilization, is not advertised anywhere.  The fact is that under portability there is only the possibility of convenient transportation of the stereo system by one person.  But without an electrical outlet, acoustics will not work. </p>

    <p>  It not only does not have a battery, but the device itself is not intended for mobile use.  It is clear that such an approach of the manufacturer will cause a negative among potential buyers, but one should not forget about power - after all, even a dozen car batteries will not be able to ‚Äúpump‚Äù 500 watts.  Here it is up to the user to decide what is more important to him - mobility or power. </p><h2>  Comparison with analogues </h2><p>  Sony's music center is considered to be exclusive in the world market - in terms of compactness-functionality, it simply has no competitors both in the price niche and in reproducible power.  And this is true, but many experts on audio systems still recommend that buyers get acquainted with other representatives of the market.  Although they are not so powerful, they have the right to participate in the review, if only because they have created their world famous brands. </p><p>  Bang &amp; Olufsen introduced its product under the name BeoPlay A8.  Yes, its power is only 10 watts, but the product surpasses the Sony GTK-X1BT stereo system in sound quality.  User reviews have no complaints about the <span>Marshall</span> Woburn <span>acoustics</span> - 50 watts of perfect sound, wireless technology support and classic design found their customers.  Products Geneva Sound System M, B&amp;W A7 Air, Harman Kardon Go also have the right to the title: "The best portable stereo system." </p><h2>  User Reviews for the Sony GTK-X1BT Music Center </h2><p>  The main advantage with which the owners of the stereo system begin all their reviews is the surroundings.  When turned on, a ten-kilogram plastic device can turn any event into a grand celebration.  I took it out into the street in the evening - get a real disco in the courtyard, if you want to enjoy high-quality sound in the family circle - please.  There are no restrictions with the product from Sony, the audio system reproduces all formats, defines any mobile devices - full versatility. </p>

    <p>  Oddly enough, many users attributed the DJ remote to the disadvantages.  It is inconvenient and limited in functionality, and, accordingly, quickly bothers.  Things are slightly better with a custom equalizer, but only a few users managed to achieve perfect sound with it.  The rest had to use an intelligent system.  Naturally, the equalizer received negative reviews. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Overall, the Sony GTK-X1BT stereo is commendable.  The manufacturer seriously approached the problem relevant to many music lovers and issued a very interesting solution.  High power, functionality, convenience - everything is created for normal and cultural recreation.  As for the alternative, it is, but either its price is too high, or the power leaves much to be desired.  Reviews from experts and most users agree - this is the best speaker system on the market for noisy parties at home. </p>
