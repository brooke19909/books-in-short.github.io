    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The most rapid growth occurred in 2011, when the bank "Military Industrial" sharply increased its financial performance, expanded its network of sales and service offices.  At that time, there were eighteen separate units, which were located, for the most part, in the region of the capital.  More than eight hundred and fifty employees served the Military Industrial Bank (according to the payroll number of employees).  This financial institution managed to cover almost the whole country with its own network of hardware and software devices: 517 ATMs and terminals could serve customers in the most remote locations. </p><p>  Corporate clients had an expanded catalog of services, in addition to lending and settlement and cash services.  This collection, and RBS (remote servicing), and salary projects, and corporate cards, and much more.  Private individuals could open deposits, operate with money transfers, pay for services, rent safe deposit boxes, issue bank cards and much more, and all this was provided by the Military Industrial Bank.  Volgograd, Lipetsk, Rostov-on-Don, Sochi, Krasnoyarsk, <span>Ivanovo, Vladimir,</span> Stavropol, Ryazan, Bryansk received branches of this credit organization, and this in addition to the head office in Moscow and three large branches - in St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk and Rostov- to the Don. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Customers </h2><p>  Among the customers there were a lot of sonorous names and loudly sounding company names that chose Military Industrial Bank for themselves.  Reviews can be found from MDM-Trade, a wholesale food company, from Automobile Plant No. 41 - car service and transportation services, from the well-known construction company Peresvet-Invest, which carried out real estate transactions, as well as many, many well-known legal firms in the country persons. </p><p>  Fifty additional offices and fourteen operating rooms were owned by the Military Industrial Bank, as a partner of PJSC MKB (Moscow Credit Bank).  This collaboration allowed plastic bank card holders to use services such as preferential cash withdrawals.  And this was not the only partner who appreciated the cooperation with such a solid organization as the Military Industrial Bank.  Its rating has been consistently high for a long time.  But someday it‚Äôs all over. </p>

    <h2>  License revocation </h2><p>  In September 26, 2016, the license under number 3065 was revoked due to the failure of this credit institution to comply with federal laws regulating the activities of banks, and regulatory acts of the Bank of Russia (Central Bank of the Russian Federation) were also not implemented.  The blame for the organization (as well as many others that have been deprived of the right to conduct banking operations in the past few years) is not only the absence of counteraction to the legalization of income (money laundering, which was obtained by criminal means), but even the absence of measures that exclude financing terrorism.  The relevant articles of the Federal Law No. 6 and No. 7 were imputed (only one clause was deleted from these articles). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, the bank was charged with a decrease in equity below two percent, that is, below the minimum authorized capital.  The Central <span>Bank of the Russian Federation (Bank of Russia)</span> has repeatedly taken measures to keep the Military Industrial Bank afloat.  In St. Petersburg and Moscow, in Novosibirsk and Stavropol, in many cities of the country, people entrusted their savings to a seemingly reliable organization.  It is their Central Bank that is now to be saved, because to save this organization did not work.  The Military Industrial Bank itself could not adequately assess the risks in the most unsatisfactory condition of the assets.  In St. Petersburg, Moscow and other cities, investors panicked. </p>

    <h2>  Composition </h2><p>  Now this credit institution does not have an integrated ownership structure, since there are many minority owners whose shareholdings do not allow them to manage or even participate in the management of the bank.  Here revealing the story of the former beneficiary <span>Oleg Safonov</span> (now - the head of the Federal Tourism Agency).  At the end of 2014, his share in this organization was 21.58%.  Suddenly, his name from the list of persons controlling the bank disappeared.  Immediately after, in January 2015, he was approved in this interesting and quite bread position. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Now the list with 20.53 percent of the shares contains Vasily Ivanovich Nosal from Podolsk, perhaps he is the very inconspicuous owner of the bank.  He has experience, was a co-owner of Promsberbank, a Moscow region, who lost his license a little earlier - in 2015.  Further, in ascending order, other beneficiaries: with 2.37 percent Evgeny Kireev (member of the board of directors), Evgeny Kobal, Sergey Efremov, Marina Lebedeva, Sergey Pupynin, Leonid Evropytsev, Mkrtich Pichikyan and Alexander Kachur with 18.79 percent.  By the way, most recently, the latter had a much greater influence on the bank's activity, since its share amounted to almost a quarter of all capital - 24.94%. </p><h2>  What happened  Media version </h2><p>  As of September 1, 2016, VPB was in 89th place in the rating of assets in the country, that is, it can be said that it confidently ran in the first hundred of the best financial institutions in Russia.  Then it became known about the problems that suddenly began.  The Bank of Russia introduced a provisional administration in this company, and shortly before this, the electronic payment system was turned off by WBB.  The credit institution filed a lawsuit, but its requirements to recognize the actions of the regulator as illegal were not satisfied. </p><p>  The media wrote a lot during these months about the problems and the apparent causes of the problems that the Military Industrial Bank has befallen.  Rostov, Volgograd, Stavropol, Krasnoyarsk, not to mention St. Petersburg and Moscow, put forward versions of the reasons for such an unpredictable collapse.  In all cities, information was received that corporate clients began to leave the bank, withdraw funds from their accounts, and this took place en masse across the country.  And liquidity problems began after a win dispute with the Ministry of Defense.  As the journalists found out, this is the strongest department in the country used the bank guarantees and kept billions of its rubles there. </p>

    <h2>  Process started </h2><p>  In the summer of 2016, the Ministry of Defense was preparing to receive payments on guarantees, but did not achieve what was wanted.  Specialists from the Ministry of Defense appealed to the court, but lost the case, and therefore were offended and decided to withdraw the deposits from the Military-Industrial Bank completely.  From here the chain reaction began.  This agency is not the only one to lose the guarantee payments court. </p><p>  Such "monsters" as the FSB and the Federal Drug Control Service quarreled and sued with VPB on this subject.  The Hermitage - and he lost this lawsuit.  Corporate deposits melted away almost instantly.  The Ministry of Defense set a good and effective example.  Following him, the other departments, as well as individual holders of large blocks of shares, described above, were pulled. </p><h2>  Crash </h2><p>  Of the ten billion rubles by September, only three remained, which were taken away by the Central Bank and counterparties for the Interbank, as the newspaper Vedomosti wrote.  It should be recalled that this is the third bank in the top hundred that lost the license during the same week (first Finprombank and Rosinterbank, and on September 26, 2016, the Military Industrial Bank was also deprived of the license). </p><p>  In St. Petersburg and other branches, in the branches of Ryazan and Volgograd, there were especially many investors who lost their funds.  Of course, the reputation of this bank was credible, but today it is a big risk to keep the amount in excess of the guarantee in any financial organization in the country.  Under the guarantee, only 700,000 rubles are returned to depositors of VPB. </p>

    <h2>  As it was before 2016 </h2><p>  Everything used to be fine.  Legal entities received not only settlement and cash services and loans (loans were especially taken by representatives of small and medium enterprises), but also bank guarantees, which suddenly ceased to be fulfilled.  It was good with salary projects, and collection, and customs cards, and corporate.  Naturally and fearlessly funds were placed here.  Deposits and settlement accounts had high interest rates on the <span>minimum balance.</span>  Both brokerage and depository services were carried out. </p><p>  Individuals were admitted to deposits, cash settlement services, plastic cards were available to them, including debit cards with a very good interest on the balance, currency transactions, consumer, car loans and mortgages were also carried out, various money transfers could be received and sent - ‚ÄúBEST‚Äù, Caspian Money Transfer, UNIStream, Contact, Western Union, Golden Crown.  Any payments were accepted - cellular communications, utilities and the like.  There was a mobile bank and a range of services, <span>safe boxes.</span>  Here they received pensions and social benefits (in Moscow and the region) and much, much more.  The Military Industrial Bank worked well.  Volgograd, Kaliningrad and other cities willingly provided their ‚Äúred lines‚Äù for its offices. </p><h2>  In 2016 </h2><p>  At the beginning of the year, the loan portfolio was 90.5% formed by corporate loans, and before May 1, it decreased by 2.57 billion rubles.  The share of retail lending has fallen sharply.  Loans are predominantly long-term; almost 70% of them were concluded for a period of more than one year.  Overdue debts are quite low compared to other banks.  But there are few reserves and they literally melt before our eyes, that is, the bank's borrowers are in an increasingly worsening financial situation.  The security of the loan portfolio is very low - only 16.2%. </p><p>  As of May 1, the securities portfolio totaled only 13.5 billion rubles, and it was completely represented by bonds - securities of foreign companies and Russian financial institutions, OFZs.  In addition, at the beginning of May, this <span>bond portfolio was</span> almost entirely pledged (repurchase transactions).  It should be noted here that the turnover of such securities is very high - more than one hundred and fifty billion rubles, and the bulk of <span>the transactions are repurchase agreements.</span> </p><h2>  What happens to licensed banks? </h2><p>  The actions related to the revocation of the license, which the Central Bank (Bank of Russia) takes in relation to the institution that has lost confidence, have already been said a little.  However, details are needed.  Typically, a license revocation is accompanied by the following events. </p><ol><li>  The very next day, the bank has a temporary administration, since the former is deprived of a legal basis to carry out banking activities. </li><li>  Fifteen days later, the Central Bank submits a claim to the arbitration court for the compulsory liquidation of the banking institution. </li><li>  If financial insolvency is found in a bank that has been deprived of a license, then the second demand is filed with the arbitration court - to declare the bank bankrupt. </li></ol><p>  It should be brought to the understanding of all citizens that a bank without a license does not have the right to continue financial activity, and therefore it must be closed.  In December 2016, the Military Industrial Bank was declared bankrupt.  Ryazan can be comforted: right on the website of the bank branch, some kind people offer for a little money to return the deposits lost in this bank.  Contact Moscow, the Taganskaya metro station.  Also scammers, probably.  It is unlikely that anyone will need the exact address of the Military Industrial Bank now, it does not exist in practice, just like the bank itself. </p>

    <h2>  What is lost </h2><p>  Somehow, it happened that during the inventory the interim administration revealed a shortage of 26,484,561,000 rubles (billions).

For fixed assets, where bank equipment, furniture and office equipment are reflected, only 116,920,000 rubles were not enough.  Open correspondent accounts with other banks lost 104,901,000 rubles. </p><p>  Lack revealed.  Work is underway to find lost property and financial resources.
