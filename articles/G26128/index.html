Insurers invest in safe deposits, a risk fund and bonds with high potential income.  Thanks to investments in the guarantee fund, the company ensures their timely return.  Unlike a regular deposit, the sum insured cannot be divided upon divorce or seized. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Life insurance features" class="if uuid-3096180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3096180.jpg"></div><p>  Also, the client does not need to have special skills and knowledge in the field of investment.

Among them are: </p><ul><li>  shares of Sberbank of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  gold; </li><li>  US stock market; </li><li>  global real estate sector; </li><li>  raw material fund; </li><li>  RTS Index; </li><li>  innovative technologies. </li></ul><p>  Funds under the Smartpolis program can be invested in the Bond Fund, which provides a large profit for a long period of their use.  Investing in popular precious metals also does not lose relevance at the moment.  The choice of the fund is based on the requirements of investors, it must satisfy their needs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.financialexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance product specifics" class="if uuid-3096188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3096188.jpg"></div><p>  Conservative customers can choose a bond strategy.  The most stable sector in the international financial market is the Global Bond Fund.  The reviews of Smartpolis in Sberbank Insurance confirm that the bonds provide a stable income over the long term investment of funds. </p><p>  Energetic customers who intend to keep up with the times choose raw material funds.  Many people prefer to invest in the innovative sector of the economy: new technologies.  Sberbank's Smartpolis is able to protect cash and increase revenue.  The program conditions allow the client to change the asset, make additional contributions, withdraw dividends, as well as take profits. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Some reviews of Smartpolis in Sberbank contain information on profitability.  It is indicated that it can reach 200% for the entire period of the contract. </p><h2>  Features of the Sberbank Smartpolis Life Insurance Program </h2><p>  The client may include any natural person as a beneficiary.  The minimum period of validity of the contract is 5 years, if desired, you can extend the contract period.  The client is able to make additional contributions and independently choose financial instruments to form the target amount.  In your personal account you can manage investments and control the return on assets. </p><p>  An investment product allows not only to save money, but also to receive a certain level of income.  If the client carefully examines the terms of the contract and correctly assesses the risks, then one can hope for profit and be sure of the return of previously invested funds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.is2.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Contract process" class="if uuid-3096195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3096195.jpg"></div><h2>  How does the program work? </h2><p>  At a practical level, it works as follows: </p><ul><li>  The client generates capital, which is subject to increase, and also determines the frequency and amount of contributions.  He can deposit funds once a year, quarter or month. </li><li>  Then you need to determine the duration of the Smartpolis program.  For many clients, it is dedicated to significant events: the child‚Äôs admission to university, retirement, travel around the world, etc. </li><li>  After the above conditions are met, a person will need to consult with a specialist about cases when they can be paid.  It is permissible to include additional risks at the request of the client in the contract. </li></ul><p>  He then makes payments on a regular basis until the end of the insurance period or until the target amount is accumulated. </p><p>  You can be completely confident in the reliable protection of the deposit, which is located in the insurance company.  The Bank, at its discretion, uses the money to invest in promising projects and earns certain interest on this.  Profit earned is distributed as a percentage of the depositor's account and the banking organization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New service of Sberbank" class="if uuid-3096209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3096209.jpg"></div><p>  The insurance company pays the agreed amount only upon the occurrence of events, which can be attributed to the definition of "insured event".  Reviews about Smartpolis in Sberbank report that life insurance provides a reliable financial pillow.  If the client received an injury that led to disability, the insurance company will pay the fees for it. </p><h2>  How to terminate the contract </h2><p>  To carry out this procedure, you must contact the company‚Äôs office with a proposal to terminate the contract by agreement of the parties with a subsequent refund.  In the event that the company does not respond to the application, it is recommended to file a lawsuit with the judicial authorities at the place of registration.  The client may indicate various reasons for terminating the contract, for example, violation of the terms of the contract. </p><p>  Reviews about Smartpolis in Sberbank inform that the institution satisfies the requests of customers who make such statements.  Experts do not recommend terminating the contract ahead of schedule, since such actions may entail financial losses from the client.  In accordance with the Civil Code, insurance premiums are not refundable unless otherwise provided by the contract.  This condition is not provided even for customers with a special format of service.  These include Sberbank Premier policyholders.  Feedback from depositors on the coupon Smartpolis states that such an agreement can only be terminated through a judicial authority. </p><h2>  Smartpolis coupon </h2><p>  This product is distinguished by the ability to generate annual income when all the conditions of the contract are met.  Choosing a "Smartpolis" coupon, the client invests funds for 5 years.  In the event that an increase in the value of the shares did not occur in the first year, the client can receive coupons.  The program provides for two of their types: </p><ul><li>  investment, which is provided to the client after a year with an increase in the value of shares; </li><li>  guaranteed, which is payable regardless of external factors (income is 0.1% of the deposit amount). </li></ul><p>  If the value of the shares has not increased over the year, and in the next period there has been a sharp increase, the client may receive a double investment coupon. </p><h2>  Advantages of the coupon "Smartpolis" </h2><p>  If the value of the shares has risen, the investor receives benefits, for example: </p><ul><li>  The client can expect a 100% deposit return. </li><li>  Throughout the entire period of the investment agreement, a tax privilege on deduction is applied. </li><li>  At the time of conclusion of the contract, the percentage of the investment coupon is established. </li><li>  If the client dies during the term of the contract, then the beneficiary can receive all the money.  At the same time, the final payments are not subject to taxation. </li></ul><h2>  Public opinion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.creativereview.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="User reviews" class="if uuid-3096202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3096202.jpg"></div><p>  Customer reviews report that this program helps to generate passive income.  Many note the benefits of Smartpolis over traditional insurance programs.  However, there are also very unflattering statements of clients about this program. </p><p>  Negative reviews are associated with the lack of the ability to exit the investment program without financial losses.  In addition, Smartpolis does not guarantee the payment of high income. </p><p>  It is important to consider that the higher the guarantor, the lower the level of return the investor can receive.  This program is suitable for people who can independently choose a highly profitable fund and are focused on long-term investment of funds. </p><p>  Some customers report that investment insurance is the best option for customers who have formed an initial capital of 100,000 rubles and are ready to invest this amount for at least 5 years.  Investment life insurance, reviews of which confirm the feasibility of investing, is gaining popularity in the country every year.  Customers talk about the possibility of receiving a refund even in a situation in which the main asset falls in value. </p><h2>  Investor Reviews </h2><p>  Some customers report a low yield of only 5% of the amount of the Smartpolis deposit at Sberbank.  Reviews about life insurance are completely different, but many investors are not happy with the countdown, which begins only a month after signing the contract. </p><p>  Clients report that during the contract they are in the dark about information related to the work of money.  In other words, depositors cannot obtain information on the percentage distribution of the investment deposit. </p><p>  Reviews about Smartpolis (Sberbank-Insurance) contain information about the difficulties in redistributing funds between funds.  Dissatisfied investors report rare updates to stock price chart in their personal account. </p><p>  According to many reviews of Smartpolis in Sberbank Insurance, it can be concluded that it is problematic to terminate the contract without financial loss.  Often there are comments about the lack of high returns. </p><h2>  Brief conclusion </h2><p>  This product allows the customer to obtain guaranteed protection of health and life in the event of unforeseen situations, which is confirmed by numerous positive reviews about Smartpolis at Sberbank. </p><p>  Clients can invest free cash without the risk of loss for transactions in the stock market.  The total amount of the insurance premium is not subject to personal income tax, and deposits cannot be collected or confiscated from the client. </p><p>  It is important to know that assets are not related to jointly acquired property.  At the request of the client, beneficiaries may be provided for in the insurance contract in case the insured person dies. </p>
