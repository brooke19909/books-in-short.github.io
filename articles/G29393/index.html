It is famous for bewitching places and natural beauties.

Currently, the historical territory of the Finno-Ugric ethnic group of the Karelians is divided between Russia and Finland.  Russia includes a large amount of this land in the north-east of the country, in the Republic of Karelia, the Murmansk and Leningrad regions.  It is believed that Karelians are the so-called autochthonous ethnos, that is, one of the few that formed and throughout the whole history lived on the same territory. </p><h2>  Favorite place in Karelia </h2><p>  Terrific territory is located in Russia.  Residents of our country can easily get here.  Tours to Karelia are very popular in the field of world tourism.  Foreign citizens here also have something to admire. </p><p>  One of the most popular places is the Karjala Park complex.  Feedback from visitors suggests that having been here once, I want to return again.  In particular, natural beauties do not leave clients of the tourist complex indifferent.  Memories of the rest in the park, according to vacationers, for a long time sink into the soul. </p>

    <h2>  A small historical excursion </h2><p>  People in this area first appeared in 7-6 thousand BC.  e.  Their main occupations, according to archaeological research, were hunting and fishing.  Only from the end of the 10th century AD  e.  the ethnic composition of the indigenous population becomes known.  These are Finno-Ugric tribes: Karelians, Vepsians, Lop, Sumy (hence the official name of Finland is Suomi). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the time of a single Old Russian state, this territory was included in the sphere of influence of the Slavs.  After the collapse - moved to the Novgorod Republic.  In terms of cultural and technological development, the indigenous population was inferior to the more developed Slavs.  As a rule, it did not enter into interethnic and political confrontations, but lived separately in its quiet and calm world. </p><p>  Despite this, from the 12th to the 17th centuries, the local population was drawn into feudal relations.  A local elite was formed, which gravitated towards Novgorod as a developed shopping center. </p><p>  During the Russian-Swedish confrontations of the XV-XVII centuries, the Karelians actively supported the Russians.  During periods of intervention, the territory moved away from Moscow.  Karelians massively moved to Russian lands.  They were linked by centuries-old cultural and commercial ties, despite the fact that they were ethnically closer to the Finns who were under Swedish rule. </p><p>  Since 1992, the Republic of Karelia signed the Federal Treaty and became a full-fledged subject of Russia. </p><h2>  Karjala Park: entertainment and relaxation </h2><p>  This hotel is located among centuries-old pine trees.  At 406 km of Cola in the majestic forest between Murmansk and St. Petersburg.  Nearby is the village of Matros.  In addition to the surrounding beauty, the complex offers tourists many services for every taste. </p>
