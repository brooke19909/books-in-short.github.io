    <p>  A very small number of craftswomen with vast experience can create their creations directly on fabric that does not contain a printed pattern.  The rest are embroidered with beads directly on the finished blanks.  Ideal for this pattern beadwork icons.  In this case, a ready-made multi-colored pattern is present on the fabric, it remains only to attach the beads on top. </p><h2>  Selection of schemes </h2><p>  The purchase of material for embroidery should be treated responsibly, because the appearance of the finished product depends on it in the first place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Embroidery of icons with beads master class" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39141/1027571.jpg" width="300"></div>  If you decide to embroider the icon with beads, you need to purchase the scheme in a specialized store.  If you decide to save on materials, then in return you run the risk of getting something incomprehensible, only remotely resembling the product that you would like to receive as a result of your labors.  Since the icon, regardless of whether you embroider it for yourself or make it as a gift, this is an item that will please the eye for more than one year and even more than one decade, the material should be appropriate.  It is best when the pattern of embroidery with beads of the icon below is sealed with non-woven fabric.  Then the beads will hold on tight, and when pulling the finished product onto plywood or cardboard, it will be much easier for you to frame it. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Embroidery with beads icons scheme photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39141/1026467.jpg" width="396"></div>

It should be clear, for beginners it is best to dwell on the option when the entrance and exit of the needle in the diagram (the places where the needle with the stringed bead is stuck) are marked with dark dots.  Beginners are so much easier.  Later, when the eye has already been set, you can use the scheme without the above marks. </p><h2>  Bead selection </h2><p>  Having decided what kind of icon you are going to embroider, you proceed to the next, very important stage - the selection of beads. </p>

    <p>  As a rule, in order to embroider beads on fabrics, material from Czech manufacturers is selected.  There are a lot of goods from Chinese firms on the market.  However, compared to them, <span>Czech beads are</span> even, smooth, beads are one to one, and there is practically no marriage.  This uniformity is very important in beadwork.  Since it is the quality of the material that guarantees a beautiful performance of the work.  When the beads lie one in one, the icon, and any other picture, acquires an unusually luxurious look, shimmers in the sunlight and gives joy to its owner. </p><h2>  Training in embroidery techniques </h2><p>  Bead embroidery, the master class of which is presented in our article, is a very fascinating activity.  The main <span>thing</span> in doing the work is <span>accuracy.</span>  If you make even stitches and stack all the beads on one side, you will get an unusually beautiful product.  As for how to embroider correctly, opinions differ.  Some needlewomen embroider from bottom to top, passing with a needle stitches in the direction from the lower left corner of each square of the pattern to the upper right.  Others, on the contrary, embroider from top to bottom.  In this case, the needle passes from the upper left to the lower right.  Choose a comfortable embroidery corner with good lighting.  In the evening, you can additionally use a table lamp.  It is best to arrange the beads according to their colors in special containers - then it will not crumble, and it will be convenient to string it on a needle.  Choose the most suitable embroidery method for you (many prefer to do work from the bottom up) and feel free to start your work.  The result of your work will be an icon that will protect you or your friends (if you embroider it for a gift). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Why do icons help? </h2><p>  The Russian Orthodox Church believes that the Lord sensitively hears prayers before the faces of those saints who, during their lifetime, have proved their special purity, the presence of the Holy Spirit in them, thanks to which they performed their good deeds in a particular area.  At the same time, each saint was given the power to help people precisely in those matters that he himself was engaged in during his lifetime.  This became the main decisive factor in why each icon has its own special purpose.
