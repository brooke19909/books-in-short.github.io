Do not underestimate the quality of the first installation series.  It is very important to remember that the more carefully it is connected, the better the finished thing will look.  In the article we will dwell in detail on how to dial loops with a hook. </p><p>  A beginner knitter in the head always raises a lot of questions.  It is impossible to answer them immediately.  It takes hours, and sometimes weeks of training, in order to get at least some result.  The main thing in this matter is not to quit what was started, to try again and again, even if not everything works the first time. </p><h2>  Tool selection </h2><p>  For the correct execution of the first loops, you first need to choose a suitable hook and yarn.  Tested by the experience of many craftswomen - do not save on tools.  Choosing low-quality raw materials, you run the risk of getting a completely different result than you expect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to loop crochet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/798744.jpg"></div>

    <p>  <span>How to</span> crochet loops if the tool leaves much to be desired?  Cheap <span>knitting tools</span> are most often made without observing production technologies, so such tools may break unexpectedly, or they may have nicks that will catch even the best yarn and, accordingly, spoil it.  As a result, you will spend a lot more money than you save when choosing a low-quality hook.  People who are just starting to get acquainted with this type of needlework should immediately opt for tools of famous and proven brands.  In this case, the hook capture method is of great importance.  If you hold the hook like a handle, you should look at the Clover brand, and if like a knife, you will surely like Addi tools.  However, there are also pitfalls here.  A good hook cannot be cheap; there is a risk of acquiring a fake.  To avoid this, buy tools and materials from trusted suppliers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet air loops" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/798746.jpg" width="370"></div>

It is better to have a pair of the most common sizes of hooks, but of good quality.  Remember, knitting is often a hobby, and it should be fun! </p><h2>  Yarn selection </h2><p>  As for the choice of yarn, the same criteria are important here as when choosing a hook.  However, in this case, it is worth considering the instructions presented to the model you have chosen.  If you knit according to a magazine or according to a pattern taken from other sources, then the choice of yarn should be strictly limited by the recommendations of the author.  You should not take risks and select yarn that is similar in composition and thickness to the eye.  Without prejudice to the product, only a master with many years of experience in knitting can do this; a beginner can‚Äôt do this. </p><p>  Only after you have decided on the yarn and its quantity, you can go to the needlework store.  Here you can touch the threads, see by your own feelings whether they are suitable for the one for whom the thing fits.  The only significant disadvantage of shopping at the store is the high cost of yarn.  If for you the cost is an important criterion, then you will like handmade online stores more.  Very often, various promotions are held there and discounts are provided to regular customers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to dial crochet loops" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/798754.jpg"></div>

As a rule, most needlewomen use this technique: the thread is doubled and twisted, and the hook should be exactly the same in thickness. </p><h2>  Start loop </h2><p>  How to dial the first crochet stitches?

    <p>  Now that we already have the initial first loop on the hook, we can knit further.  We tightly clamp this loop with the fingers of the left hand, and with the right, we pick up the working thread and drag it through the first.  We continue to knit in this way until we get the length necessary for the selected product.  Despite its seeming simplicity, the question of ‚Äúhow to correctly crochet loops‚Äù is quite complicated.  The success of the result ultimately depends on many factors, some of which we will consider below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to dial crochets" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32798/797604.jpg" width="433"></div>

    <h2>  Loop counting </h2><p>  Many beginner needlewomen have difficulty counting.  How to crochet air loops in the right amount?  In order not to make a mistake, it is always worth remembering that the loop that is currently on the hook is not considered.  If you keep this in mind when counting, then your knitting will always follow the pattern. </p><h2>  Knitting density </h2><p>  Density when knitting the first row is very important.  The initial chain should not be made too tight, otherwise the edge of the product will look tight and we will not get a smooth side.  In other words, we will form a kind of trapezoid that expands during the knitting process.  In addition, a tightly bound first row makes it very difficult to knit the next.  Too loose should not be knitted either.  In everything you need to feel the measure.  A fair question arises: how to <span>crochet air loops</span> correctly?  It is worth noting that the density of knitting can vary even from how exactly the needlewoman has a working thread on her hand.  This important factor is often not noticed, so it causes bewilderment among some knitters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet loops" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32798/797608.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  <span>How to loop crochet</span> so as not to get too tight edge?  You can take the tool one number more than the one you have chosen for the entire product.  After the air chain is ready, you should change the hook to the appropriate one. </p><h2>  To help the needlewoman </h2><p>  Another point at which it is worth focusing is on which side of the ball it is better to start knitting the first row.  If you knit a small product, then do not be wise, you can begin to carry out the initial chain as usual, towards the ball. </p><p>  How to dial loops crochet in the direction from the ball?  If the product is voluminous, then counting a large number of air loops is quite problematic.  To facilitate your work, you can rewind a piece of thread from the ball to two to three times the required length of the chain and start a set of air loops from it.  After counting, all unnecessary can be dissolved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to loop crochet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/798758.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There is another option - knitting the first row from a separate ball.  This is the easiest way of all proposed above.  You simply knit the initial chain from one skein, and then cut the thread and continue to knit the second and subsequent rows from another.  In other words, how to make loops with a hook, each needlewoman decides for herself. </p>
