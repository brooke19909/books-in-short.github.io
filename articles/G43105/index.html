    <h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  Festival Riviera <span>Resort 4 *</span> makes an excellent first impression.  If you look at the photos when choosing a tour, he will surely delight you.  Chic territory, two magnificent buildings, luxurious rooms.  Even the name itself already says that here you will have a wonderful vacation with a cool entertainment program. </p><p>  Hotel "Festival Riviera Resort" positions itself as a family complex.  It is located away from the bustling city, at the far end of Hurghada.  Further only the desert.  Since the complex consists of two buildings, you can settle in any of them, while taking into account the nuance of their location.  The first, main, building is located on the first line, and the second - on the second, through the underpass from the first.  But judging by the reviews, this does not cause inconvenience. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  In total, 434 rooms are offered.  Of these, four hundred are positioned as doubles, and the rest are family-type.  But in standard rooms you can easily deliver a bed if desired. </p><p>  Equipped as standard, as elsewhere.  Bed, TV, wardrobe.  It has a safe, air conditioning, minibar and hairdryer.  Here are the last few complaints from the guests.  Many simply did not find it in their room.  And instead of a technical device, the administration offered a gel or an extra towel. </p><p>  The condition of many rooms is unsatisfactory.  Although the Hotel "Festival of the Riviera Resort 4 *" was built relatively recently, in 2008, everything was very dilapidated.  On the forums you can find photos of tourists, where it is clear that the sheet is torn, the plaster from the ceiling peeling off, the bathroom is full of fungus.  Plumbing is leaking, and you have to sleep on hard wooden beds.  In general, reviews about rooms are more often negative than positive. </p><p>  The same song with cleaning.  The staff is inhospitable, linen does not change, dirty towels are met immediately upon arrival, according to reviews.  Unpleasant stories happen, for example, you may be asked to pay for someone else's damaged towel on the day of departure.  So you need to always be very careful. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Festival Riviera Resort 4 * offers a very meager and monotonous food.  This is noted by almost all vacationers.  The menu does not change.  Reviews warn that if on the first day for breakfast you received an omelet, then for the next ten days it will lie on your plate in the morning. </p><p>  For lunch and dinner, the choice is small.  Either potato, or pasta, or rice.  A piece of meat with gravy or a cutlet of dubious quality is attached to them.  There are few fruits, and if there are, they appear green or spoiled. </p><p>  All dishes are portioned, on plates.  You just need to go up and take the one that suits: with potatoes or pasta. </p>

    <p>  Another interesting observation of tourists is the waiters who distribute cutlery.  That is, in order to eat, you need to call a special young man to the table to give you a spoon, a fork and a napkin.  Moreover, the latter in a hotel worth its weight in gold - no more than one piece per person.  Amazing service.  At the same time, vacationers say, the restaurant always smells unpleasant and very dirty. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  But in terms of entertainment, the Festival Riviera Resort 4 * hotel was not deceived.  Indeed, rest can be compared to a real festival.  Animators work good.  Entertained from morning to evening. </p><p>  Before breakfast, you will be invited to aerobics by the pool.  With fervent music, you can do an excellent charge to get an energy reserve for the whole day. </p><p>  Before and after dinner, girls and boys entertain children.  The programs are interesting, funny.  Kids are delighted.  In the evening, there is also something to do.  You can go to a disco or attend a theatrical performance. </p><p>  In addition, the hotel has a huge pool, for children - a smaller one, with a water slide.  If you don‚Äôt want to go to the beach, you can spend the whole day without going outside the complex - here you will surely find something to occupy your leisure time. </p>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  Due to the vast territory of the <span>Festival Riviera Resort 4 *</span> offers many additional services.  Most of them are paid.  So, you can visit the massage room at any time or use the laundry room.  There are many shops on the territory, but tourists are advised to buy souvenirs in the city, so it will be cheaper. </p><p>  You can visit 6 restaurants that feature different cuisines.  Experienced tourists do not recommend Japanese.  They say that everything is very primitive and tasteless there.  There are also many bars near the beach or pools. </p><p>  The <span>hotel Festival Riviera Resort</span> 4 * has Wi-Fi.  It catches well only in the lobby, but you can buy a local SIM card or visit a cafe with free Internet access. </p><p>  By the way, you can exchange currency directly at the hotel, so there is no need to look for banks in the city.  If necessary, the hotel staff will provide a doctor.  His services are paid by you independently, regardless of insurance. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The beach at the Festival Riviera Resort 4 * hotel is its own, quite wide and spacious.  For relaxation there is everything you need: sun loungers, umbrellas, towels.  In principle, what could be the claim to what nature gave?  None.  But what is happening in the recreation area is more like a city beach in Odessa. </p><p>  Tourists say that all sorts of merchants and endless Arab guides are constantly moving along the beach.  They are very intrusive and can even wake you up if you dozed off in the sun.  Tell them right away that there is no money.  They will understand and lag behind. </p><p>  There were cases when right at the height of the day, sand cleaners came to the beach and began their work, which terribly bothered vacationers. </p><p>  The sea itself is very shallow, with a long pontoon.  You can swim only in special slippers. </p>

    <h2>  Overall rating </h2><p>  Many people choose a vacation tour in a country like Egypt.  Festival Riviera Resort 4 * refers to a fairly budget category of hotels.  Its rating on major tourism forums and sites is low. </p><p>  Of the ten possible points, Festival Riviera Resort 4 * scores only 5.5.  This rating is based on 185 reviews left.  The hotel is in 87th place in the ranking of the best hotels in Hurghada. </p><p>  At the same time, on a ten-point scale, visitors put such ratings for different categories: </p><p>  - Number - 5.6 points. </p><p>  - Service - 5.8 points. </p><p>  - Cleanliness - 5.7 points. </p><p>  - Food - 6.2 points. </p><p>  - Infrastructure - 6.7 points. </p><p>  From 185 positive reviews - 98, average - 62, negative - 25. </p><h2>  Vacations from "Aneks-tour" </h2><p>  Best of all, it is the Festival Riviera Resort 4 * hotel that advertises Anex Tour.  Tours, according to the statement of this tour operator, will leave you completely delighted.  And now I want to warn all those who decided to travel with this company.  By coincidence, the worst reviews from tourists who arrived on a ticket from ‚ÄúAnex-tour‚Äù. </p><p>  There are a lot of complaints, from the procedure for obtaining a visa to the end of the holiday.  At the same time, tourists note that the guides from the Anex Tour at the hotel, selling excursions, are so intrusive that they try to drive you a trip to the desert or to the sea under any pretext.  At the same time, there is no satisfaction from what he saw, because the organization is very weak. </p><p>  Often delayed by a bus, boat or other means of transportation.  Once tourists from Russia were generally left far from the hotel, and they traveled on their own.  In a word, you need to be more careful with Anex Tour. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  There are a lot of four-star hotels in Hurghada.  One of them is Festival Riviera Resort 4 *.  Reviews about this place are very disappointing.  According to tourists who have been there, the hotel barely pulls at its 4 stars, and even more so not at five, as Anex-Tour advertises.  Many who have been there are satisfied with the rest, although they have some comments.  One third found more minuses than pluses, well, and another part of the tourists surveyed said that they would never go to Festival Riviera Resort 4 * again.  Whether or not to buy a tour to this place is up to you, but our task is to warn you of possible unpleasant surprises. </p>
