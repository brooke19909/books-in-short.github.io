    <p>  4G antenna will not only increase the speed of the connection, but also improve the quality of its reception.  A new generation of Internet allows you to play online games without lags.  With a new connection, you will increase fps and lower ping.  This will allow even at the same speed to get a better Internet connection. </p><p>  Today, people are trying to connect to the new high-speed Internet, but not everyone can get a high-quality connection.  What is the reason for this?  It is not strange that this is not the fault of the operator, but the technique.  In small towns or villages there is no quality connection.  In this case, only a 4G antenna will help, which you can do yourself.  We will come back to this.  Let's look at what interferes with your Internet connection. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="antenna for 4G modem" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1361537.jpg" width="504"></div>

This makes it impossible to get a high-quality connection in villages or small towns. </li><li>  Location of the modem.  Everything from the height at which it is located to the material used in the construction of the house is taken into account. </li><li>  The location of the modem.  In this case, an obstacle may be a forest, skyscrapers or power lines. </li></ul><p>  What can be done with this?  How to solve a problem?  As we have already found out, a 4G antenna will correct the shortcomings of signal transmission.  It will strengthen the Internet connection and will allow you to get high speed even in the most abandoned village. </p><h2>  Homemade Antennas </h2><p>  An antenna for a <span>4G modem is the</span> only way to improve your Internet connection.  Many people are concerned about the question: is it possible to make the necessary design on their own? </p><p>  Of course, if you have the necessary knowledge of working with radio equipment, then you can do the manufacturing.  A 4G antenna is a great way to increase the level of working with technology, learn how to select the right elements and learn something new.  You must understand that the antenna for a 4G modem can burn, there is a wrong way to make it.  In order not to lose your money, you must use all the recommendations for manufacturing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4G DIY antenna" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1361536.jpg" width="600"></div>

Now you can find many different schemes for assembling such a design.  Of course, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, and you can not cope with self-production, then the best option is a proprietary 4G MTS antenna or Megafon. </p><h2>  Amplifier for 4G modem </h2><p>  To make an amplifier for a 4G modem, you need to take a can of peas or coffee.  At the bottom you need to make one small hole.  It will be needed for the sleeve, which is made of tin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4G pay antenna" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1361539.jpg" width="489"></div>

    <p>  After that, the sleeve will need to be soldered.  First, you can cut a hole on the body in the shape of the letter "H".  It should be the size of the modem. <br>  It is necessary to insert a modem into the fabricated structure (center of the can to the top of the modem).  After that, you need to direct the amplifier to the side where the operator‚Äôs tower is located.  It remains only to connect the Internet to the computer via a USB extension cable. </p><p>  If you want to get a high speed Internet connection, you must use the cable that is used to connect the antenna with the modem, as short as possible.  This is proven experimentally. </p><p>  Also, the modem should be installed near the ceiling, so that nothing would interfere with the reception of the signal.  If you use these recommendations, you can increase the speed of the Internet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4G directional antenna" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1361535.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kinds </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself 4G antenna can be made in various shapes.  There are reflective or collective forms.  As a rule, the collecting form is fixed to the modem, and the reflecting ones need to be connected only to the 4G output.  Reflectors or reflectors come in different shapes, the main thing is the correct connection. </p><h2>  Application </h2><p>  Unfortunately, such designs can only be used for indoor use.  They, like factory amplifiers, are not able to withstand moisture or temperature extremes.  Therefore, they are used only at home. </p><p>  Unfortunately, a simple reflector is not able to qualitatively improve the signal.  A 4G <span>LTE antenna is</span> about 10 times more powerful than our homemade product.  But this does not mean that the reflector is not able to improve the quality of the Internet connection. </p><h2>  DIY antenna </h2><p>  To amplify the signal to the 4G modem, you can make an antenna from a satellite dish.  This method is quite effective, since the dish can be tuned to any station, and it receives the signal well.  How to make this design?  There is nothing complicated, we need to take a modem and a satellite dish.  DIY 4G antenna will be quite primitive.  In the focus of the dish you need to install a modem and tune to the desired station.  So we get a pretty good receiver.  There should not be a problem with this.  Another question is setup. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4G lte antenna" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1361534.jpg" width="589"></div>

    <h2>  Customization </h2><p>  The tuning method is reminiscent of how to install a satellite dish on a satellite for television.  The internet is a little different.  Direct the plate below.  You may even have to point down.  This is due to the curvature of the reflection.  In order to configure the satellite dish with the highest quality, you need to rotate it and use a special program to monitor how the Internet connection is changing.  After you are sure to get the maximum value, the antenna must be fixed. </p><p>  The external 4G antenna is fixed, now we can move on to the next step.  Now it‚Äôs worth experimenting with focus.  For different models of modems, it is necessary to configure the converter holder in different ways.  To do this, you need to change the position of the focus and look at the quality of signal reception. </p><p>  In order to correctly adjust the focus, you need to know that the antenna of the modem is on the opposite side from USB.  Of course, this is not arranged on all models, so it is worth disassembling it to understand where the receiver is. </p><p>  If you have not achieved the conditions of direct visibility, then you should raise the design.  Also, increasing the quality of the signal can help increase the diameter of the mirror.  A 4G directional antenna is capable of catching a signal over a long distance.  How is diameter related to reception quality?  On average, a plate with a diameter of 1 m provides a pretty good Internet connection at a distance of 30 km from the station.  To connect the modem to a computer, you need to buy a USB cable.  What should it be like?  Of course, you should use a quality cord, a small cross-section with shielding and ferit at the ends.  You can also purchase several of these cords and connect, the quality of this is not lost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4G external antenna" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1361533.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  It should be remembered that it will not work to use a satellite dish for television and to strengthen your Internet connection.  Of course, you can attach the modem to a satellite dish to slightly amplify the signal.  But it should be remembered that if the dish is tuned to TV, you do not need to turn it away from the satellite.  A high-quality signal can be obtained if the <span>satellite dish is</span> set to the line of sight condition. </p><h2>  Protection </h2><p>  To protect the modem from rain, you can make a protective structure.  You can use a regular bottle or bag for this.  Of course, it is better to create a high-quality protective case from materials that can withstand temperature extremes and moisture. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  That's all.  If you live in a small town or village, you can use the tips and <span>increase the speed of your Internet connection.</span>  Of course, people who live in megacities will not need this.  The quality and speed of the Internet connection depends on the distance of the modem from the station, the height of the modem and the obstacles that may get in the way.  Of course, if you make and connect the amplifier correctly, you can get high-speed Internet regardless of various obstacles. </p>
