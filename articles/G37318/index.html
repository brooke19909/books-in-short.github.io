The current economic situation in the country is forcing citizens increasingly to seek help.  Delayed salaries, unforeseen financial expenses, repairs, construction or the purchase of housing, payment for medical and educational services - all this and much more can be paid using loans from Alfa Bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="usstudentloancenter.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alfa bank cash loan" class="if uuid-2587462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2587462.jpg"></div><h2>  Lending programs </h2><p>  Who said that a bank loan is a bondage that plunges into a debt hole?  Perhaps this is so, but only if it comes to the unreasonable use of financial resources and the wrong choice of a potential lender.  Alfa-Bank in Russia offers its regular and potential new customers to take advantage of attractive loan offers in 2018. </p><p>  Pay attention to the conditions for obtaining a loan that apply to individuals and payroll clients.  It is the latter that can count on low interest rates and more loyal loan conditions.  The list of documents required for obtaining a loan has also been reduced. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.paisabazaar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpha bank consumer loan" class="if uuid-2587463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2587463.jpg"></div><h2>  Why Alfa Bank? </h2><p>  Loans are the main activity of the banking structure.  This determines the widest range of offers, among which every citizen of Russia will be able to find the most suitable option. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Turning to a loan officer, a potential borrower can get not only qualified advice, but also help in choosing a loan.  Thus, the ratio of income and the size of the required loan will help you choose the most suitable loan option, which will not only solve financial problems, but also keep the family budget safe and sound. </p><p>  Why are Russians increasingly choosing loans from Alfa-Bank?  Yes, if only because it is the largest private bank in Russia, with branches in large and medium-sized cities of the country.  The banking structure has received high marks in international rating agencies.  In addition, Alfa-Bank was awarded a place of honor among systemically important banks in Russia, which means that it is of great importance for the entire Russian economy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="themoscowtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="loans from alfa bank money" class="if uuid-2587457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2587457.jpg"></div><h2>  Obvious benefits </h2><p>  Why are loans from Alfa-Bank better?  To get an answer to this question, you should pay attention to the obvious advantages of cooperation: </p><ul><li>  Instant loan issuance.  It is enough to submit an application - it can take only a few hours to consider it (the maximum term for considering an application is 2 working days). </li><li>  Ability to apply remotely.  A potential borrower can travel by public transport and, using his own mobile phone with Internet access, apply for a loan from Alfa Bank. </li><li>  The minimum package of documents.  So, holders of salary or pension cards can apply to the credit department with only one passport. </li><li>  Loyalty to borrowers.  Almost all loans are issued without guarantors and collateral. </li><li>  Possibility of early repayment without commissions. </li></ul><p>  And that's not all.  Loans from Alfa-Bank differ in democratic interest rates, which is important for most residents of the Russian Federation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.atholsb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="loans from alfa bank" class="if uuid-2587465" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2587465.jpg"></div><h2>  Standard loan conditions </h2><p>  Such conditions will be offered to ordinary customers contacting a bank branch.  We are talking about a consumer loan in cash, which can be obtained directly on the day of treatment (subject to weak workload of the credit department employees).  The loan amount in this case will be quite large, but less than the loan that is available to holders of salary or pension cards.  The loan term will be shorter, but the interest rate on the contrary will be higher than those who have more promising conditions for cooperation. </p><p>  Cash loan terms and conditions at Alfa-Bank: </p><ul><li>  The maximum amount is 3 million rubles. </li><li>  Loan term: from 12 to 60 months. </li><li>  Without collateral, without guarantors. </li><li>  Interest rate: from 15.99% to 19.5% per annum. </li></ul><h2>  Conditions for payroll clients </h2><p>  Individuals receiving a salary or pension on an Alfa-Bank card can apply for a consumer loan on more favorable terms: </p><ul><li>  The maximum loan amount is 4 million rubles. </li><li>  Loan term: from 12 to 60 months. </li><li>  Interest rate: from 13% to 19.5% per annum. </li><li>  No collateral or guarantee is required. </li></ul><p>  The same conditions apply to employees of Alfa-Bank's partner companies.  This is one of the main advantages of the organization. </p><p>  A cash loan can not only solve financial problems, but also correctly manage money.  Many people prefer using credit cards.  And here the private bank was ahead of its competitors - in the arsenal of loan offers there are several cards with attractive terms of use. </p><h2>  How to get a consumer loan from Alfa-Bank? </h2><p>  Everything is very simple.  First of all, you need to apply.  This can be done remotely or through a personal visit to one of the departments.  After waiting for a preliminary decision (the banking system will notify the client about this), you must contact the Alfa-Bank branch directly with a package of documents: </p><ul><li>  Passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  The second document to choose from (this can be an insurance policy, driver's or pension certificate, passport). </li><li>  A document confirming the presence of an official place of work and income level. </li></ul><p>  It should be said a few words that not everyone can become a borrower.  The bank puts forward certain requirements for those who plan to get a loan: </p><ul><li>  Russian citizenship. </li><li>  Compliance with the age criterion (at the time of application, the client must be at least 21 years old and not more than 65 years old at the time of full repayment of the loan). </li><li>  The presence of a mobile and landline phone. </li><li>  Availability of an official place of work and relevant experience. </li><li>  Positive financial reputation. </li><li>  Lack of criminal record. </li></ul><p>  It remains to add only that loans are a new word in the modern economy.  And, if the world powers have debt obligations to each other, then what can ordinary people who also want a new car and smart repair in their apartment say? </p>
