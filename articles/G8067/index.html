This is not to say that bears and bunnies do not surprise anyone, they are certainly cute.

    <h2>  Originality of the idea </h2><p>  Of course, this product can also be made to decorate your own home.  However, you should be prepared for the fact that you have to urgently do the same for the enthusiastic neighbors and friends. </p><p>  Crochet <span>patterns for potted flowers</span> do not exist as such.  Due to the individuality of the product, it will have to be developed independently.  It is not as difficult as it might seem at first glance, but it is not so simple as to claim that any craftswoman will cope with the work. </p><h2>  Pot making </h2><p>  The best way to get a perfect flower pot is to tie a plastic or cardboard pot. </p><p>  First of all, you need to make a bottom.  It should be knitted using any circular pattern.  It is better that it be a dense pattern, because the base will be visible through the openings of the lace.  Next, proceed to knitting the sides of the pot.  It is necessary to constantly apply the canvas to the base and perform extensions in accordance with its shape.  A pot of <span>flowers crocheted</span> around a plastic frame will be the most stable, especially if you fill it with gypsum or densely folded material. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Soft base for attaching flowers </h2><p>  To get a beautiful voluminous bouquet and not have to spend a lot of time and yarn on flowers, you can use a semicircular lining.  It is quite simple to knit or sew from a soft fabric.  Such a lining is knitted from two parts: a flat bottom (like the bottom) and a semicircular top (you can use the cap top scheme). </p><p>  After it is sewn and stuffed with synthetic winterizer, it must be attached to the upper edge of the pot along the entire circumference. </p><p>  So, the pot blank is ready, only color schemes (crochet) are needed. </p><h2>  Knitting flowers to fill the pot </h2><p>  Flowers can be absolutely any.  The photo above shows a pot of violets.  They are quite simple to manufacture.  Here you can apply different crochet patterns.  There should be many flowers in pots, they need to be placed very close to each other.  So that the soft base is not visible. </p>

    <p>  Such a flower has five petals, but they can be adjusted by increasing the number of arches from the air loops in the first row.  Also for knitting violets, the knitting scheme of the first layer of the petals of a volumetric flower, which is lower, is perfect. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Knitting leaves </h2><p>  Once <span>crochet patterns</span> for potted <span>flowers</span> are found, you need to take care of the green leaves.  Their presence is very refreshing composition.  Small leaves can be connected as follows: </p><ul><li>  A chain of 8 air loops (VP) + 1 VP lift. </li><li>  Single crochet (RLS), 2 half columns (PLC), 2 double crochets (CCH), 2 PLC, 1SBN. </li></ul><p>  PLC serves as a transitional stage between RLS and SSN.  He begins to knit in the same way as CCH.  But instead of knitting a loop and a crochet sequentially, they are knit together. </p><p>  To make larger leaves, you need to dial a larger number of VP and increase the number of CCH in the middle of the sheet by the same number.  If the thread is very thin or there is a desire to connect large parts, the described algorithm can be applied on both sides of the VP chain. </p><h2>  Potted <span>Crochet</span> Layered Patterns </h2><p>  The photo below shows a voluminous flower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet a rose" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1191039.jpg" width="280"></div>

    <p>  It consists of three layers.  The petals of each of them are knitted in circular rows.  For all layers, except the first, two rows are required: first, a chain of VP is knitted, then a petal is imposed on it. </p><p>  In the manufacture of petals there is nothing complicated, you just need to follow the scheme.  The principle of arranging flower layers deserves a separate description: </p><ol><li>  After the first layer of the flower is ready, without tearing the thread, you need to tie a chain of 5VP. </li><li>  It must be fixed on the reverse side of the flower canvas in the place where its 1st and 2nd petals are connected.  On the diagram in this place is an icon similar to a CCH with a hook from the bottom. </li><li>  Continue to knit chains of 5VP to the end of the row. </li><li>  Knitting the first petal of the second layer begins according to the pattern.  Under the arch of 5VP they knit 1SBN, 1PLS, 1SSN.  Then follow 32, 1, 1, 1.  The petal is completed. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet roses" class="if" height="485" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1191040.jpg" width="484"></div></li><li>  All others are knitted in the same manner, referring to the pattern. </li></ol><p>  There can be as many layers as you like.  Using such crochet color schemes, you can change the color or texture of yarn for knitting different layers. </p><h2>  Crochet roses </h2><p>  You can crochet a rose in several ways: </p><ul><li>  Make each petal separately and then stitch them. </li><li>  Knit a multilayer flower (as in the previous paragraph) from yarn of the corresponding color.  Layers should be very many, at least ten. </li><li>  Collapse the flower from the prepared knitted part. </li></ul><p>  This article will cover the final way to crochet a rose.  This method can be considered the simplest, since it takes a minimum of time and effort.  The sequence of knitting roses is outlined in the following photo. </p>

    <p>  This flower can not be called a traditional rose (rather, fantasy).  It consists of two types of petals: spiky and square.  Knitting begins with a set of chains of VP.  To calculate it, you need to take into account that on the pointed petal you need 6 loops of the base, on the square - 3 loops. </p><p>  Next, they knit the 1st row: it consists of loin mesh cells (see diagram).  In the process of knitting the 2nd row, partial formation of pointed petals (pico from 3 VP) and the knitting of squares occur.  To separate different types, you can change the color of the thread.  Lastly, they knit the 2nd row of pointed petals. </p><p>  At the final stage, the rose needs to be folded in the correct order and stitched. </p><p>  Thinking about how to <span>crochet a rose</span> in a classic style, it is not necessary to look for a new pattern.  You can perform the described algorithm by connecting all the petals square or semicircular (as in the diagram with a volumetric flower). </p>
