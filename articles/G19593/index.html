It is located in the northeast of the <span>Iberian Peninsula,</span> on the one hand surrounded by a mountain range, and on the other - the Mediterranean warm sea.  The sights of Catalonia are incredibly ancient and beautiful monuments of art and architecture, which are scattered in different cities.  Inspect them all in one trip is simply unrealistic.  In order to fully know this region and enjoy its beauty, you will need a lot of time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of catalonia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/470627.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where are the main attractions of Catalonia? </h2><p>  It is difficult to list the addresses of all the memorable places in this region.  Mostly they are scattered around the most famous cities of the region: Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãReus, Tortosa, Tarragona, Figueres, Lleida and Girona.  We will begin the brief review with Barcelona in the center of which the <span>Plaza of Spain</span> is located <span>.</span>  It was rebuilt in 1929, at the descent of Mount Modjuic.  Near the same mountain are fountains, also named after her.  During the day they give cool to all residents, and at night they turn into a free light show.  In the same city is the famous Sagrada Familia at 401 Mallocra. This building is another architectural masterpiece of the genius Antonio Gaudi, which he erected here in the late 19th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Something about Barcelona </h2><p>  The famous resort city of Barcelona is the <span>capital of Catalonia.</span>  From time immemorial, here were built chic <span>cathedrals, churches,</span> monasteries and palaces.  Urban development in the region has never stopped, so on the streets you can find Gothic buildings, and Romanesque, and the most modern.  Any excursions here include a walk along the Rambla Boulevard.  The local attractions of Catalonia are enclosed in the homes of former merchants, in museums and small cozy cafes.  In addition, this street is landscaped, so it always smells fresh and pleasant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of catalonia spain" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/470625.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Barcelona in the Middle Ages and in modern times </h2><p>  Now consider the most ancient sights of Catalonia.  Spain is a state that was previously ruled by the Romans.  Therefore, on the <span>outskirts of Barcelona</span> and other cities of the region, you can find the ruins of ancient buildings.  Here you can find statues of gods, and the highest columns, and steps that lead to vast squares and pedestals.  Of particular interest to the tourist is the Gothic Quarter, without which the sights of Catalonia would not be so interesting.  It consists entirely of narrow winding streets, on the sides of which houses, churches and museums are located.  The center of the quarter is the Cathedral of the Holy Cross and St. Eulalia.  This is a living monument of Gothic architecture, known throughout the world.  At the end of the 19th century, the city began to be built up by the architect Antonio Gaudi.  Among the masterpieces made by his hand, we meet the chic house of Casa Millo and Casa Batll√≥, the Sagrada Familia, Park Guell and many other modernist structures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of catalonia by car" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/470626.jpg" width="600"></div>

Even streets that are so narrow that the car simply cannot pass through them were not rebuilt here.  The old part of the city is famous for its Cathedral, built specifically for citizens in the 14th century.  By its beauty and mystery, this architectural monument is not inferior to the Church of St. Philip.  Tarragona, in turn, is a city with an even more ancient heritage.  Tourists come here to see the sights of Catalonia, abandoned by the Romans in the era of their rule.  Among them, an aqueduct, an ancient amphitheater, and, most importantly, the Tomb of Scipio, which is located on the Mediterranean coast, is preserved. </p><h2>  Catalan geniuses of modern times and their cultural heritage </h2><p>  The seaside town of Figueres is the very place where the surrealist and simply very popular artist Salvador Dali was born.  In this place, literally everything is saturated with his spirit, unreality and refinement.  The city has many museums dedicated to his work.  Here <span>Dali</span> 's <span>paintings</span> are kept in the originals and are not for sale.  Every tourist can admire them by ordering a tour.  Next to Figueres is another province - Reus, which gave Spain Antonio Gaudi.  Local excursions go to the house where he lived, to the church where the future architect was baptized.  Tourists are also given the opportunity to visit the interactive museum, which hosts an orientation program with the basics of his work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of catalonia addresses" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/470624.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to travel around Catalonia? </h2><p>  As you can see, this incomplete list of famous places in this region already tells us that a tour of the region will take a lot of time.  You need to travel around every town and village to see all the sights of Catalonia.  By car, this is much easier.  In the price range from 100 to 1000 euros per day, you can rent a car in Barcelona and drive it all over Catalonia without missing anything. </p>
