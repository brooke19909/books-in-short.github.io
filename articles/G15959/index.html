Origami is also voluminous.  A tulip is made of paper, then a stream of air is blown into it through a tube.  Thus, the folds of paper are straightened, forming a three-dimensional figure. </p><p>  Very beautiful tulip crafts are obtained from the modules.  You can buy them in stationery stores in ready-made kits or independently fold each module from special paper.  The modular origami of a tulip looks impressive, you can simply assemble it by tightly inserting the modules one into the other, or you can use glue for better fastening.  After making several flowers and attaching them to the stem, you can create a beautiful bouquet of tulips, which will be an unusual decoration of the room. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider several different options for making an origami tulip with step-by-step instructions for folding paper.  Thanks to the schemes, it will be possible to complete the work quickly and easily. </p><h2>  Flat flower </h2><p>  To work on the origami flower of a tulip, they take a square sheet of colored, preferably double-sided paper.  The diagram below shows how to step by step folds of paper to create the flower itself and the green part of the craft - a leaf and a stalk.  The first action is performed with red paper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Origami tulip from paper" class="if uuid-2571240" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2571240.jpg"></div><p>  The square is rotated angle to the master, and the lower edge rises up.  The fold should turn out diagonally.  Further, the side corners need to be lifted up so that three petals are clearly visible on the top of the flower.  The last action is performed with the bottom corner.  It is bent to the back in a flat line.  Origami flower tulip from paper is ready! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Flower stalk </h2><p>  Folding the next part of the craft is already made of green double-sided paper.  The leaf is assembled from a square blank.  First, the fold is made diagonally from top to bottom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What does the finished work look like?" class="if uuid-2566505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2566505.jpg"></div><p>  Then the upper sides are bent to the center line from two sides, then the recess is hidden inward by folding the workpiece in half.  This turns the stem of the flower, and so that a leaf appears in it, the lower part rises up to form an even line at the base. </p><p>  Such an origami tulip can be glued to background paper or blue cardboard.  If you make a flower from thick paper and make a small hole from below, then a cardboard stalk will be able to keep the flower in an upright position. </p><h2>  Hollow flower for inflation </h2><p>  Such an origami tulip is much longer and harder to fold.  Pre-cut from a dense sheet of A-4 square.  So that all its sides are equal, one of the corners is turned to the opposite side, forming a right triangle.  On the side there is a residue of excess paper.  This strip must be cut off with scissors. </p><p>  The next step is to bend the square in half, first vertically, then horizontally.  The sheet after each fold returns to its original position. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To correctly execute the blank for origami tulip from paper, you need to make folds also diagonally in one direction and the other.  Expanding the square to its original position, we see a lot of triangular parts in front of us.  With your fingers you need to take a square over the edges of the central horizontal line and pull them up and in the middle.  If the folds are done correctly, then the paper should fold into an accordion and the top side will lower to the bottom.  Everything, the workpiece for further work is done! </p><h2>  Origami assembly diagram </h2><p>  In the picture below there is a step-by-step instruction of origami tulip, in which each subsequent action corresponds to the serial number of the figure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Origami Tulip Pattern" class="if uuid-2566496" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2566496.jpg"></div><p>  At number 6 below, under a folded tulip, a cloud with an arrow is drawn.  This means that at this stage of work, you need to insert a thin cocktail tube into the hole below and blow it into it.  At the same time, the paper straightens, forming a three-dimensional flower, as in the main photo in the article.  It remains only to expand the fingers of all the petals in different directions.  The flower is ready! </p><h2>  Flower of modules </h2><p>  For work, you will need more than 100 modules folded by triangles.  It is most convenient to buy a set with ready-made elements made of thick special origami paper.  Begin assembling a flower by connecting together two elements.  Place one triangle next to another so that the sharp corners look up.  Here the third element is put on them, thereby holding them together.  Then they put the 4th module to the first two, fixing it in the second row of the fifth.  Assembly continues until the end modules cannot be wrapped in a circle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modular origami" class="if uuid-2566509" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2566509.jpg"></div><p>  The beginning of the tulip is laid, then by stringing models on the corners sticking up, they raise the flower 4-5 cm high. Next, the production of petals begins.  To do this, divide the number of modules into equal parts and reduce the number in each of them until all one element remains at the top of the triangle. </p><p>  If you want to store origami from modules for a long time, then it is best to strengthen the PVA design during assembly. </p><p>  When the flower is ready, you can attach it to a thin stick by inserting it into the hole on the base.  To prevent the flower from sliding, the stem is fixed with a glue gun or thick PVA.  The stick can be wrapped in corrugated green paper of any color, on the sides you need to arrange wide leaflets cut from the same material. </p><p>  The finished product looks very impressive.  If you can make a solid tulip from the modules, then you can try experimenting with colorful corners.  You can lay them out in rows, spirals or stripes vertically. </p>
