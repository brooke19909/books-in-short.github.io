How to change the battery?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern smartphones perform quite a lot of functions.  They have become indispensable helpers for us.  With an ordinary device, you can easily navigate the terrain using the GPS module, use high-speed Internet, take high-quality photos, play productive games and much more.  Of course, this all badly affects the battery: it starts to discharge faster, the battery lasts less and less. </p><p>  So it turns out that after a few years you have to change the battery.  Now we‚Äôll look at how the battery is replaced with an iPhone 5 and how to understand when it needs to be done. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="replacing the battery with an iPhone 5" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1751925.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reduced smartphone runtime </h2><p>  If you notice that your iPhone 5 phone is running out of charge faster, then this is the first signal that the battery will need to be replaced soon.  Remember that your smartphone should not lose more than 1% of the charge at one time.  Of course, if you do not play "heavy" games.  You can follow this in the settings by going to the battery statistics. </p><p>  Also, your device should not turn off spontaneously when the battery charge is 20-30%.  This phone behavior clearly indicates a battery malfunction.  In this case, the battery must be replaced with an ‚ÄúiPhone 5‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how much is iPhone 5" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1751334.jpg" width="295"></div>

This feature allows you to track battery capacity.  Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt see these data in the settings - they are available only to Apple employees. </p><p>  The average user can control the battery using iBackupBot.  You only need to connect the iPhone to the computer, run the program and request all the battery status data.  The utility will establish a connection between the computer and the device and show the number of charge cycles, the current state of the battery, its initial volume.  If the original battery capacity is noticeably different from the current one, then replace the battery.  In general, the phone can work well until it exceeds 500 battery cycles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone Iphone 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1751335.jpg" width="449"></div>

    <h2>  Replacing the battery on the iPhone 5 </h2><p>  If you decide to replace the battery yourself, you will need a TS1 screwdriver, a suction cup, a plastic tool to remove the case and a PH000 screwdriver.  Before you begin, you must turn off the smartphone. </p><p>  It should be noted that the Chinese "iPhone 5" looks no different from the original.  Therefore, the battery will be replaced almost identically. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Near the Lightning module you can see 2 screws that need to be unscrewed.  After that, take a suction cup and put it on the screen, it is advisable to place it closer to the "Home" button.  Place the suction cup tightly so that it adheres well to the glass. </li><li>  The display is attached to the housing with latches.  Our task is to gently pry it with a plastic tool and slightly raise it.  Remember that the screen is connected to the motherboard by several cables.  In order not to damage them, you need to slightly raise the display and disconnect the cables.  On iPhone 5, one is located under the Home button, and the rest are on the top of the phone. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chinese iphone 5" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1751931.jpg" width="591"></div>  This procedure can take a lot of time, since the display of the smartphone is quite tightly attached to the body.  Do not pull the screen very much in the hope that you will be able to open it faster.  So you just damage the cable, and the phone will have to be carried to the service center. </li><li>  When the display is held on the cables, you can remove the suction cup.  After that, we proceed to complete the removal of the screen.  First, we lift it from the side of the Home button and gently pull out the cable.  It is advisable to do this with tweezers.  Remember, the cable should not be tense when removed.  When disassembling a smartphone, you need to remember the sequence of actions in order to prevent assembly errors.  In order to correctly install the cable, it is necessary to direct the side with several slots to the battery, and the side with small cloves down the device.  The iPhone 5 phone is fairly well assembled.  In order not to damage any element of the device, you must very carefully perform all the actions.  You must use tweezers to disconnect the cable from the motherboard.  The display can only be raised if you make sure that everything is turned off. </li><li>  In the next steps, the display needs to be raised 90 ¬∞ to make it convenient to disconnect the other elements.  There are 4 screws on the motherboard that need to be unscrewed. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 5 battery" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1751922.jpg" width="560"></div>  When assembling, you need to carefully screw in the screws so as not to harm the phone.  If the screw does not tighten well, then do not screw it in with force, you may have made a mistake with its location. </li><li>  Remove the protective screen.  Using a plastic ‚Äúpaddle‚Äù, disconnect the loops of the selfie camera and sensor.  Next, disconnect the display.  When assembling, you must ensure that the cables are fully latched, otherwise you may encounter some problems when using.  In this case, it is necessary to reconnect the loops and reboot the device. </li><li>  It's time to disconnect the display.  Now you can carefully remove it and set it aside.  Using additional tools, disconnect the battery cable.  You should also hold a "spatula" near the headphone jack. </li><li>  To get the battery, you need to gently pry it with a plastic card.  Try not to bend the battery, so as not to harm the "iPhone".  We insert the card deeper so that the adhesive tape begins to tear. </li><li>  Now just get the <span>battery out.</span>  <span>Replacing the battery</span> on the "iPhone 5" is completed.  When installing a new battery, use a new adhesive tape. </li></ol><h2>  Battery on iPhone 5 </h2><p>  If you plan to replace the battery yourself, you must first buy a battery.  The original battery can be purchased on the Internet for just 1000 rubles.  Of course, you will first need to make sure that it is suitable, and only then make a purchase. </p><h2>  Service centers </h2><p>  If you are hesitant to replace the battery yourself, you can contact a service center.  Everyone knows how much iPhone 5 costs - it's a fairly expensive phone.  Therefore, battery replacement and repair as a whole will be quite expensive.  On average, they ask for 1,600 rubles to replace the battery.  This price includes the battery itself and the services of the master. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Replacing the battery is no big deal.  You only need to carefully and consistently carry out all the actions.  Beginners can spend quite a lot of time replacing, but this is necessary to qualitatively fix the problem.  If you do not want to take risks, then you should contact the service center.  How much is?  ‚ÄúIPhone 5‚Äù masters can repair quickly enough, but it will take about 1600 rubles. </p>
