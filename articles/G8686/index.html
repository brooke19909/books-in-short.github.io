    <p>  This is a logical game where they build a sequential chain of knuckles ("bones", "stones") that touch each other in half with the same number of points (points). </p><h2>  Bones </h2><p>  The domino tile is a rectangular tile with the correct geometry - its length is equal to the width multiplied by two.  That is, these are two connected squares, on each of which points (points) are drawn: from zero to six.  This is a kind of flat reincarnation of the <span>dice.</span> </p><p>  In a regular set of dominoes, twenty-eight stones.  It is made up of combinations with repetitions of two by seven numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).  But there are special sets in which there are points up to nine or more on the knuckles.  In general, the number of bones in a set is calculated using the formula (n + 1) x (n + 2): 2, where n is the largest number of points.  That is, for a common set, the formula looks like this: (6 + 1) x (6 + 2): 2 = 28. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  They make bones from simple or ivory (hence the name), metal, plastic, wood. </p>

    <h2>  The history of dominoes </h2><p>  From India and China in the eighteenth century the game was brought to Italy.  It has changed somewhat and has taken root very firmly in monasteries, where it was forbidden to play card games, so the monk Domino invented this game (legend). </p><p>  There is another option because of the white dots on a black background, the game began to be called dominoes, like a <span>suit of Dominican monks.</span> </p><p>  From lyrical reasoning, let's move on to practice and figure out how to play dominoes. </p>

    <h2>  General rules </h2><p>  Two, three and four people can play.  The rules of playing dominoes together differ in that each player gets seven dice in his hands, if there are more than five players. </p><p>  The remaining bones (points down) are laid aside - this is a "reserve" or "bazaar".  They turn to him when there is no necessary element for the move on his hands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The participant who has the smallest double (the bone with the same points 0-0, 1-1, 2-2, etc.) begins the game.  If no one has it, then they are looking for a bone with the smallest value, for example, 0-1 or 1-2. </p><p>  Go clockwise in turn.  A player does not have the right to skip a move or go to the "bazaar" if he has a stone in his hands on the layout.  Only one bone can be laid out in one move.  They skip the move, ‚Äúknock‚Äù if the stones of the ‚Äúbazaar‚Äù run out, but there is no necessary one. </p><p>  The end of the game round comes when one player runs out of all bones - he leaves.  The rest count the points from the stones remaining in the hands. </p>

    <p>  "Fish" - a situation in which everyone still has stones, and there are no more moves - blocking the game.  It happens when all combinations of combinations of one number are laid out, for example 5, that is, bones 5-4, 5-0, 3-5, 5-2, 5-5 already lie on the table, and one end of the chain ends with a stone 5-1, and on the second player put a stone 6-5.  In such a situation, the person who placed the last knuckle, ‚Äúfish‚Äù (6-5), is called the ‚Äúfisherman‚Äù.  All points of the game participants are recorded in the account of the "fisherman".  He begins the next tour.  They play up to one hundred, one hundred one, one hundred twenty five, two hundred points agreed at the beginning. </p><p>  These are the general rules for playing dominoes.  It is very flexible, so there are many varieties.  And by and large, each company, laying the knuckles on the table, creates its own individual game, with its own private rules.  But there are also some modifications that have taken root in our country, for example, the "goat". </p><h2>  How to play dominoes in "Goat" </h2><p>  Since the main points remain unchanged (the number of players, tiles, the beginning of the turn, etc.), we list only the distinctive <span>rules of the "goat"</span> : </p><ul><li>  the last stone from the "bazaar" is not taken; </li><li>  the next round begins the player who came out in this, or "fisherman"; </li><li>  you can start recording your points only with twenty-five scored at a time; </li><li>  if after the ‚Äúfish‚Äù the players have the same number of points in their hands - ‚Äúeggs‚Äù, these points will be added to the loser in the next round; </li><li>  the one who scored one hundred twenty-five points and more loses, he is a ‚Äúgoat‚Äù. </li></ul><h2>  "Sea goat" </h2><p>  This is a more complex, active, but very popular kind of game with us.  If there are four players, then they are played in pairs (team) diagonally. </p>

    <p>  Let's clarify how to play dominoes in the Sea Goat: </p><ul><li>  the winner of any round records all the points of the losers; </li><li>  if the player has doubles on both ends of the bone arrangement, he can set them in one move; </li><li>  the one who first began to record points for himself can start any round with a double six or six, and if he himself wins this round - ‚Äúone hundred‚Äù, he will win the whole game, and if he loses with twenty-five points, he will lose more; </li><li>  who finished the double-zero-zero double is a winner, such a draw is called a ‚Äúbald goat‚Äù; </li><li>  if the last double is six or six, then the player is also considered the winner, provided that at least one loser has twenty-five points or more on his hands, if not, then his next con ‚Äúone hundred‚Äù is necessary; </li><li>  if there is only a bone zero-zero left on your hands - this is twenty-five points, only six-six - this is fifty points, only zero-zero and six-six - seventy-five; </li><li>  if the ‚Äúfisherman‚Äù has less stones than twenty-five points, and the opponent has more, then in this round the ‚Äúfisherman‚Äù wins, and his next draw is ‚Äúone hundred‚Äù; </li><li>  if you didn‚Äôt play the ‚Äúeggs‚Äù after three attempts, that is, you didn‚Äôt start the next con with doubles from one to one to three to three, these ‚Äúeggs‚Äù are ‚Äúrotten‚Äù; </li><li>  if in a doubles game one comes out victorious against a pair of opponents, he is a ‚Äúgeneral". </li></ul><p>  As you probably noticed, the differences in the rules of the varieties of the game are very subtle, and you can choose how to play dominoes.  There is also a ‚Äúsports domino‚Äù, black-and-white, ‚Äúdonkey‚Äù, ‚Äúphone‚Äù, ‚Äúmuggins‚Äù, ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù, ‚Äúsausage‚Äù and many, many others ... By and large, each gathered company decides how to play dominoes.  The rules are very detailed and thoroughly negotiated.  Sometimes they are even recorded before the game. </p><h2>  We play dominoes with a computer </h2>
