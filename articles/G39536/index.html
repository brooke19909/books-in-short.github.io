They distribute materials with a negative color, designed to undermine the trust of associates and forcing followers to turn their backs on him.  Newly-fledged detectives, having read reviews of Alexei Vilnius, incriminate a trader in direct cooperation with a brokerage company.  And also in receiving rewards from her with great means to create the image of a successful person, continuously traveling around the world and living in a big way.  Using Vilnius, Olympus Trade, according to critics, is pursuing an aggressive marketing policy that allows you to save on advertising and attract new customers. </p>

    <h2>  Does Vilnius work with Olympus Trade? </h2><p>  The main argument incriminating a trader in cooperation with a broker is to create a VIP club, which is used to attract supporters.  All of them are interested in trading, want to study and strive for professional growth. </p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1MBj8ISs3DM&amp;usg=ALkJrhhc0rMhNKsw_aiZYRBI4k1Uk-5lzw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>  Creating a club, Alexey Vilniusov set a goal - to combine traders with the way of thinking of successful people.  In-depth work is being carried out, an exchange of views and the search for the most effective methods of earning money on binary options trading are being carried out.  A successfully functioning VIP club allows participants to receive the following information: </p><ul><li>  detailed analysis of trading strategies - indicator settings, rules for searching entry points, filtering false signals; </li><li>  effective application of technical analysis - building support and resistance levels, price channels, determining a trend, identifying candlestick patterns of a reversal or continuation of a trend; </li><li>  profit from fundamental factors affecting the Forex currency market. </li></ul><p>  Trades Vilnius for Olympus Trade, using the tools presented on the broker's platform.  The strategies developed and adapted by him are based on the use of indicators and analytical materials available on the company's website.  Naturally, traders invited by them to the VIP club will have to use the same tools, which means that they will trade on the same platform.  Judging by the reviews, Alexey Vilnius does not require fees for membership in the club from traders.  The only condition is that there is a deposit of at least 30,000 rubles, confirming the seriousness of the intentions of people who receive from Alexei for free: </p><ul><li>  valuable information; </li><li>  psychological support; </li><li>  professional tips to help grow in personal terms and make money. </li></ul><p>  It was the requirement regarding replenishment of the deposit for a certain amount with the broker that became the main evidence of the cooperation of Vilnius with Olymp Trade.  According to critics, otherwise he could not verify the actual replenishment of the account.  Alex offers to register traders who have submitted applications for joining the VIP-club, using his referral link.  Analysts of the broker check the status of the account at the request of any owner of the VIP account, attracting people to the platform using their link.  Vilnius is profitable for people with large deposits, because he receives a percentage of their turnover, and therefore deals with them in-depth analysis of strategies that allow both parties to earn more. </p><p>  The ‚Äúcouch‚Äù critics did not limit themselves to the study of reviews of Alexei Vilniusov, and apparently watched several trader‚Äôs webinars.  They made certain conclusions, while not having a sufficient level of qualification. </p><h2>  Criticism claims against trading system </h2><p>  Homegrown analysts cite trading on the M 1 time frame, which is characterized by an abundance of market noise and traces of the use of HFT robots, as evidence of a fraudulent activity of a trader.  Being a professional, unlike his critics, Alexey Vilniusov knows how to make a profit when trading at all time periods, identifying on the charts the traces left by market makers.  The basis of most of Alexey‚Äôs strategies is price levels - the points where large market participants place limit orders.  Find them as follows: </p><ul><li>  the price beats several times at one point; </li><li>  there are false breakouts by shadows and two bars; </li><li>  the price on contact with the level abruptly bounces, forming long wicks near the candles; </li><li>  earlier in this place there was already a level. </li></ul><p>  Most traders see these levels, but do not know when to enter the transaction and for what period of time, and therefore can not create a profitable strategy.  And Vilniusov, using Olympus Trade as a progressive platform, has clear rules for entering a deal: </p><ul><li>  identification of the price level by the specified factors; </li><li>  the presence of BFU - a bar forming a level, the first touch by the price of a limit order; </li><li>  the appearance of BPU - a bar confirming the level, the second contact of the price with the order; </li><li>  third touch - if the level does not break through, then the deal is entered. </li></ul><p>  The time frame does not matter when using the fundamental principles, since the interaction of the price with limit orders always manifests itself identically and can be recognized by an experienced trader both on M 1 and D 1. Traders who work closely with him in VIP- in their reviews of Alexey Vilnius club, confirm the high efficiency of his trading methods. </p><h2>  SKU is not Martengale </h2><p>  The authors of shocking revelations convict Alexey of unprofessionalism and deliberate wrecking of his colleagues in the workshop, using information about his system of compensation for losses (SKU), which assumes a doubling of investments with an unrealized forecast.  The methodology is really similar to the Martenhale system, developed for gambling and not well-proven in options trading. </p><p>  Traditional strategies using the system are to purchase an option when identifying a signal to enter a deal on the chart.  If the forecast did not materialize, then Martenheil adherents offer to open positions in the chosen direction, constantly doubling bets, and so until the money on the deposit runs out ... </p><p>  Designed by Alexei Vilniusov SKU has fundamental differences from Martenhale: </p><ul><li>  if the entry turned out to be unprofitable, then transactions no longer open and the search for new signals begins; </li><li>  the maximum doubling limit is 8 steps - Vilnius, trading on Olympus Trade using this system, developed <noindex>  <span>special table</span> </noindex>  for deposits with different levels of capitalization; </li><li>  the probability of losing all money due to one unsuccessful entry is minimized, because each new transaction is the result of an in-depth analysis.  And the probability of 8 unsuccessful operations is lower than when using the classic Martenhale system. </li></ul><p>  The reviews left about Aleksey Vilniusov allow us to conclude about the effectiveness of SKU, and most importantly, the acute need for its use.  We must remember the negative expectation when trading options, because with an investment of $ 100, the trader risks losing the entire amount, and receives with a successful forecast no more than 90%. </p><p>  To get profit with a series of 3 unsuccessful transactions without applying SKU, you can make a series of 6 correct entries in a row, and given the objective market conditions, this is quite difficult.  That is why Alexey Vilniusov proposed a system of compensation for losses, leveling the effect of negative mathematical expectation. </p>

    <p>  Critics blame Alexei for the lack of clear criteria for opening a position, reproaching him for being unsystematic.  Conclusions are made on the basis of viewing videos posted by the trader on Alex V. The materials published there are for guidance only and they do not provide an in-depth analysis of strategies.  The main details are explained by Alexei at online seminars organized for members of the VIP club, where he substantively works with interested people. </p><p>  The authors of high-profile reprimands reproach Vilniusov, who uses Olymp Trade as a platform for earning, in the absence of fundamental analysis.  Allegedly, he does not use news filters to identify periods of increased volatility and avoid trading in an unpredictable market.  The whistleblowers did not bother to study the functionality of the broker's trading platform and ascertain the high quality of the product offered by Olymp Trade.  Information on the release of volatile news appears on the main page 1 hour before its publication with a countdown.  There is simply no need for Alexey Vilniusov to additionally open the tab with the economic calendar in the browser, as the broker took care of this.  Reviews posted on the Internet about Alexey Vilniusov confirm his professional approach to trading, taking into account all possible risks. </p><p>  The last argument of the authors of high-profile articles in the media was the accusation of Alexey Vilniusov of trading in large sums of money without using, in their opinion, a reasonable money management.  A visit to several webinars by Aleksey Vilniusov made it possible to create an objective picture of his risk management system: </p><ul><li>  deposit amount - an average of 1,700,000 rubles; </li><li>  the first stage of SKU is 1,000 rubles; </li><li>  the maximum limit is 900,000 rubles. </li></ul><p>  Trading is conducted during the European, Asian, American sessions during the first 3 hours after the opening of exchanges.  In fact, Alexei is really at a great risk and sometimes loses large sums of money, but this happens extremely rarely.  And in comparison with big earnings, one-time losses practically do not affect his financial condition.  A trader uses a clear and understandable money management system, and each person determines the degree of risk for themselves. </p><h2>  Alexey Vilniusov: real and fictional reviews, where is the truth? </h2><p>  The well-known personality Alexey Vilnius at Olymp Trade has been trading for a long time and is pleased with the terms of the broker.  Telling people about trading and recommending trading platforms, it is based on personal experience.  Naturally, he advises to register with a broker, verified by him on his own many years of experience.  Aleksei was presented as the result of a marketing development, which consisted in providing information to blog subscribers from an independent person with a pronounced demonstration of his success.  No evidence of such a conclusion was provided, and the authors are guided by their own speculations and the opinions of strangers writing dubious comments on the Internet.  Alexei is compared with other bloggers, drawing parallels in their activities, having no reason for this. </p><p>  It is frivolous to make such accusations, guided by negative custom reviews about Alexey Vilniusov, collected on the Internet. </p></div></article>
