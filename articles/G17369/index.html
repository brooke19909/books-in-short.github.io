    <p>  Combat tactics, as part of military art, are a combination of theory and practice in preparing and conducting combat operations, starting from the offensive and ending with tactical regroupings, units, formations or units of armed forces and troops on land, sea or air. </p><p>  The tactics of warfare involves the use of some tactical principles that allow you to achieve victories.  So, in order for the enemy to detect defense positions as soon as possible and come closer to them, it is necessary to mask them well.  The likelihood of an opponent breaking through the defense line will decrease if the reloading process is well-coordinated. </p><p>  In any case, tactical methods of conducting combat contacts are somewhat different in different areas.  Moreover, such properties as cross-country ability, sweepability, camouflage, visibility and defense are of great importance here. </p><p>  So, the tactics of warfare in the city suggests the presence of a ‚Äúleft-handed rule‚Äù.  It consists in the fact that a person with a right leading hand performs actions that are associated with a left turn.  In particular, this applies to shooting.  The peculiarity of performing effective and accurate actions associated with a counterclockwise turn is related to the orientation of the human nervous system and the development of the musculoskeletal system. </p><p>  When shooting from the right shoulder or arm (depending on the <span>type of weapon),</span> it is necessary to use shelters, for example, stones, building corners, etc., which should be on the left side of the person to cover part of the head and body. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Moving in the dark, it is recommended to avoid or jerk lighted areas.  In the event of a collision with an enemy group, one must not run backwards, as they may be shot in the back.  In this situation, you must open fire from your weapon, shooting quickly and often, while moving forward to the right side of the enemy. </p><p>  The tactics of warfare in such conditions involves the commission of quick action.  So, opening fire on the enemy, you need to outline a side vision shelter where you can hide and reload weapons. </p><p>  There are situations when a person gets into a situation on the street, when shooting suddenly begins.  In this case, it is necessary to make movements from one shelter to another.  If at the same time there is no weapon, you need to abruptly move away from the fire to your left side in zigzags or rifts to the nearest shelter. </p><p>  Combat tactics in the forest require splitting into groups of seven people, the distance of movement between which should be fifteen meters in order to maintain their visibility. </p><p>  The first should be a reconnaissance group of three people to detect enemy ambushes.  If any are found, it is necessary to stop the movement, transmit the message to the main group and disguise themselves. </p><p>  The simplest and best battle tactics in the forest are called the ‚Äúdouble tail‚Äù.  It consists in the movement of the main group in a column of two people in a checkerboard pattern.  During the attack, these columns are bent in a semicircle, starting with the ‚Äútail‚Äù, and move to the place of the conflict.  Thus, the enemy is closed in a circle. </p><p>  When ambushed, it is necessary to fall and reveal the exact direction of fire, determine the target and destroy it.  Firing, you need to break through to the enemy, using grenades. </p><p>  Thus, different terrain, settlements are supposed to make decisions directly at the place of military events.  That is why it is necessary to conduct discussions on situations that may occur in practice. </p><p>  It should be noted that reality requires reasonable offensive tactics against the enemy in order to avoid unnecessary losses.  Knowledge of the basic tactical principles and methods of warfare makes it possible to avoid dire consequences. </p>
