By the way, a great idea is to involve children and other family members in the manufacture of edible figurines.  General domestic work, all the more so fascinating, allowing you to show imagination, is very unifying. </p>

Try to work with a knife very carefully.  Children should not trust such work.  Make cutouts small and shallow.  The paws are best placed at a considerable distance from each other.  In this case, the dog will be better standing on the surface of the table or plate.  For greater stability and confidence, insert one toothpick into each foot.  If they are long, and the dog‚Äôs paws are short, then the wooden stick can be broken in half and carefully inserted into two parts at once.  They will not be visible anyway. </p><p>  The first overseas fruit on which we made the paws should cut off the upper part.  Crafts made from bananas are made very easily thanks to the suppleness and softness of the material.  Getting to the design of the head.  We take the second banana and cut it in half.  We mark with a felt-tip pen the places where the ears and eyes will be.  Doing banana crafts with your own hands, you can use any materials at hand.  As a rule, peas are used to shape the eyes.  If not, small cloves are great.  To make the dog's ears, it is necessary to cut a piece of banana in the middle and carefully pull out half the pulp.  From the remaining peel, cut out the ears.  They will hang down, which, in fact, we needed to achieve. </p><p>  Very often, young mothers, preparing creative work for a competition in a kindergarten or school, ask themselves the question: how to make a banana craft to be durable and survive the transportation and the competition itself ?.  Conventional toothpicks come to the rescue.  To bond the body and head of the dog you need a decent amount of them.  As experts say, you should not skimp.  The more sticks in the design, the more stable it will be.  A soft banana pulp will hide unnecessary details.  Everything, the dog from the banana is ready! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Banana Dolphin </h2><p>  Another <span>banana</span> craft will also look equally impressive on fruit salad <span>.</span>  <span>Dolphin</span> can be done in minutes.  In this case, the result will exceed all your expectations. </p><h2>  Components for crafts </h2><p>  To make an unusual banana dolphin, you will need: </p><ul><li>  A banana is one thing. </li><li>  Clove - two pieces. </li><li>  The berry is one thing.  You can take for crafts hawthorn, cranberries, sea buckthorn - any bright berry. </li><li>  Sharp knife. </li><li>  Marker. </li></ul><h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  To begin with, you should get rid of the ugly and completely unnecessary fruit legs for us to do.  Making banana crafts, as a rule, you can use all parts of the fruit.  But in this case, we will not need a black leg.  The dolphin's body will need one third of the banana.  Cut off this part. </p><p>  Now you need to make the dolphin fins.  Using a marker, we outline the places where they will be located.  With a sharp knife, carefully cut the peel in the shape of a triangle.  Next, we make a small shallow incision on the other side of this geometric figure.  Raise this part of the peel.  It will serve as a support for the fin.  With the help of such an incision, the fin itself should separate some distance from the dolphin's body.  At the same time, it will be more voluminous.  In the same way we make the second fin.  Remember that when making crafts from bananas in the form of animals, you need to observe symmetry with respect to the location of the paws, ears and other parts of the body. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make banana crafts" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1486196.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The next stage is the eyes.  With the help of an ‚Äúassistant‚Äù - a marker - we make outlines.  We put cloves in these places.  It remains only to make a mouth.  For such a banana craft, we need some bright berry.  We cut the remaining tip of the fruit leg in half and insert it inside - it looks as if the animal is holding a ball.  The banana dolphin is ready! </p><h2>  Banana island </h2><p>  Crafts from bananas and other fruits are made not only for competitions in kindergarten, but, as we have already noted, for decorating cuts.  In this case, we suggest you make this fruit dish completely, the main component of which will be a banana.  Ingredients that you will need: </p><ul><li>  Two bananas. </li><li>  One orange or tangerine. </li><li>  Two kiwis. </li><li>  Six to eight grapes. </li><li>  Two kiwis. </li></ul><h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  Two bananas must be peeled from the skins.  We leave the whole fruit, the second - we make it a little shorter.  These are the future palm trees on the island.  On top of the banana trees we need to arrange a sprawling crown.  It will be made of kiwi.  To do this, they are cut into half rings - long, thin petals are obtained.  Then we proceed to the design of palm fruits.  In this role, grapes or any other berries that your imagination can think of or which you will be able to fish from the bowels of the refrigerator look great. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from apples and banana" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1486192.jpg" width="453"></div>

    <p>  Amber sand can be made using slices of mandarin or orange, as shown in the photo above.  But there is another interesting design option.  We make a green lawn of peeled and sliced ‚Äã‚Äãkiwi into thin slices.  This fruit in this craft will act as grass.  From tangerines or oranges in this case we create a bright orange sun, cheerfully illuminating the fruit island.  The luminary can be made, for example, from lemon.  The circle will be the core of the sun.  And from the skin we cut out small rays and draw a circle. </p><p>  Such cutting, in addition to a beautiful and original appearance, has a high practical value.  All fruits are finely chopped, so they are convenient to take and eat.  Do not be afraid to show your imagination!  Do not limit toddlers in this!  As a rule, children's fruit crafts are much more unusual than adult creations.  And how pleasant it will be to eat such an edible composition at the family holiday table! </p>
