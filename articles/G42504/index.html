The company "Apple Rus" is engaged in official deliveries of mobile devices and other equipment to the territory of Russia.  The largest chain stores collaborate with this company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="abcnews.go.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Retail purchase" class="if uuid-3121194" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3121194.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, there are official distributors who purchase from <span>Apple and distribute it among retailers.</span>  <span>The official sellers of iPhones are the following organizations:</span> </p><ul><li>  "Megaphone". </li><li>  MTS. </li><li>  KNOW-HOW. </li><li>  The Messenger. </li><li>  Euroset. </li><li>  re: Store. </li><li>  DNS </li><li>  Ozon </li><li>  Flash Computers. </li><li>  "Note". </li><li>  Yulmart. </li><li>  Citylink. </li><li>  "El Dorado". </li></ul><p>  The presented list includes stores where almost all people buy iPhones.

The catalogs present a small assortment that includes only modern models of mobile devices. </p><p>  For many Russian buyers, the cost of the gadget is of paramount importance.  Therefore, most customers are waiting for the update of the range, which will allow you to purchase an obsolete device at a reduced price. </p><h2>  Apple Resellers </h2><p>  There are many advantages to authorized resellers relative to other companies where you can buy an iPhone.  Such organizations are Apple's business partners that are selected according to certain criteria.  Authorized sales representatives can order equipment with the necessary configurations for customers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="nypost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Buying a smartphone from a reseller" class="if uuid-3121173" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3121173.jpg"></div><p>  The Cstore online site is very popular.

Delivery is carried out in more than 80 regions of Russia. </p><h2>  Retail chains </h2><p>  The most obvious option for many people is to buy an iPhone at one of the Megafon, MTS, M. Video, and other points of sale.  When answering a question about where it is better to buy an iPhone, it is necessary to purchase smartphones in retail chains with caution. In many stores, expensive smartphones are stored in a single copy. Such a gadget may be fully functional, but it may not look the best. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldofbuzz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Red iPhone" class="if uuid-3120665" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3120665.jpg"></div><p>  Not all sellers can correctly advise customers.  In addition, retail chains impose additional paid services.  It‚Äôs important to remember that employees are not interested in returning customers.  Therefore, if the smartphone has a factory defect, then it will be very difficult to return your money.  However, retailers offer favorable terms of purchase, as well as set low prices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Other options </h2><p>  There are other options where you can buy a good iPhone <span>.</span>  <span>The largest Chinese trading floors allow you to purchase a gadget at a significant discount.</span>  <span>Keep in mind that almost 90% of iPhones are second-hand.</span>  <span>There is also a risk of getting a gadget that is programmed to work with a foreign operator.</span> </p><p>  <span>However, Chinese sites are the most popular trading platforms where you can buy iPhone at the most affordable prices.</span>  <span>Along with the cost of shipping and forwarding, a substantial amount may run up.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.businessinsider.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Buying a mobile device" class="if uuid-3120660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3120660.jpg"></div><p>  <span>It is not recommended to purchase iPhones through bulletin boards, since it is not known whether the smartphone was purchased legally by the owner of the gadget.</span>  <span>If the transaction is completed, it is necessary to check the serviceability and correct operation of the device.</span> </p><p>  <span>Many</span> people purchase refurbished iPhones, which practically do not differ from the original smartphones.  The high demand for such phones can be explained by low cost.  Refurbished gadgets cannot be sold on the regular market, so they are sold on black at a reduced price.  This information will allow future owners to answer the question of where to buy a good iPhone, and not be deceived by unscrupulous sellers. </p><h2>  Features of the acquisition in the official online store </h2><p>  It is important for customers to know that the online store has developed a strict pricing policy.  It does not provide for the use of a discount system.  Therefore, the price of gadgets can increase or decrease only depending on the exchange rate of the foreign currency to the ruble. </p><h2>  How to save on purchase </h2><p>  At that moment, when the cost of ‚ÄúiPhones‚Äù approached 100 thousand rubles, the market was full of restored and fake gadgets.  Many of them are in the low price category, however, the quality of such devices should be seriously questioned. </p><p>  If the client is not ready for big expenses, you can purchase an updated smartphone with accompanying documentation and serviceable functionality.  Some sellers purchase iPhones abroad and sell them in Russia.  Such gadgets are sold much cheaper than on official Internet sites, since they are classified as gray mobile devices.  This is due to the fact that for such phones you do not need to pay duties, taxes and declare them at customs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ibtimes.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Purchase and sale transaction" class="if uuid-3121184" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3121184.jpg"></div><p>  Buying a used smartphone is the most dangerous way to complete a transaction.  On various online boards there are lots of offers on the implementation of smartphones at low prices.  In some cases, sellers intentionally deceive people and sell fakes. </p><p>  Other people sell high-quality devices due to certain life circumstances.  Many people prefer refurbished gadgets that look ‚Äúlike new.‚Äù  Such devices are completely identical to the usual model, while they are quite cheap.  However, not all iPhone models exist in restored versions. </p><h2>  Self checkout </h2><p>  The client can independently arrange delivery of the smartphone directly from the manufacturer, which eliminates the extra charge.  However, it is impossible to arrange delivery from America without additional intermediaries who charge a fee for the services provided.  Thus, the leveling of the benefits of the purchase.  Consideration should also be given to the time involved, since mail parcels take a long time. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  People who are interested in the question of where to buy an iPhone can study real customer reviews who are willing to share their experience.  Some reviews report that there are many stores selling Chinese fakes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.creativereview.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Public opinion" class="if uuid-3121198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3121198.jpg"></div><p>  Others say that a smartphone with a good discount can be purchased at any mobile phone store.  When wondering where to buy iPhone, many recommend shopping at the official apple.com online store.  <span>Users recommend purchasing smartphones only on proven Internet sites, as this eliminates a lot of risks.</span> </p><p>  <span>Many customers praise the online store where you can buy iPhone without extra charges and arrange home delivery.</span>  <span>Customer reviews contain information that any iPhone can be checked on a special resource.</span>  <span>Therefore, before buying, you need to find out the exact model number, and then enter the received data on the Apple website.</span> </p><p>  <span>If the number is included in the registry, then the company supports the model warranty.</span>  <span>You can also check by serial number and see information about past activations of the device.</span>  <span>Buying an ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù on hand is the most dangerous event, because the client will never know if the gadget was opened or not.</span>  <span>Also, many sellers sell restored smartphones under the guise of the original.</span> </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  For several years in a row, Apple's smartphone line has been the benchmark for comfort and convenience for users.
