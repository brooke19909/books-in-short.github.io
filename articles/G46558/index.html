    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  With regard to this issue, the hotel guests did not agree.  So, someone was quite satisfied with the catering in D Varee Mai Khao Beach 4 *, and someone was not.  However, reviews of almost all guests agree that when booking a stay, you should not choose the option ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù.  According to travelers, the ‚Äúol inclusive‚Äù system here is very different from what tourists are used to in Turkey and Egypt.  So, the choice of dishes and drinks is much smaller. </p><p>  As for breakfast, most tourists were satisfied with them.  So, according to them, in the morning in the hotel restaurant you can eat several types of local dishes, sausages, scrambled eggs or fried eggs, boiled eggs, pastries, cereals, fruits and vegetables, juices, coffee and tea.  True, some guests who came to rest with small children complained about the absence of some dairy products and cereals. </p><p>  If you do not live according to the all-inclusive system, you can also have lunch and dinner at the Di Vari restaurant, but for an additional fee.  Almost all travelers agreed that the prices here are too high.  Therefore, many tourists preferred to eat during the day in a cafe in the vicinity of the hotel.  There are several of them, and you can choose what suits you. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  There were no complaints to the hotel regarding this item.  Moreover, almost all the guests in their reviews mention that they were very pleased with the beach holiday.  So, travelers describe a multi-kilometer clean beach with a fine pleasant sand.  It can be reached from the residential buildings of D Varee Mai Khao Beach Resort (Phuket) in just a couple of minutes.  There are very few people here, so you can enjoy the sea and the sun. </p>
