    <h2>  Chinese tropics </h2><p>  As you already understood, if you go for a beach <span>holiday in China,</span> Hainan Island (see photo in the article) is the best place for this.  Its main advantage is the clean air, the pristine nature, as well as the originality of the natives, which is of great interest to tourists.  The island is located in the South China Sea.  It is separated from the mainland by the narrow Hainan Strait.  On the island there are many craters of extinct volcanoes, a large number of thermal springs, next to which there are cottage villages - sanatoriums.  One thermal bath treatment costs about 80 yuan.  The most convenient places for a beach holiday on the island are wonderful <span>bays (Dadonghai,</span> Sanyavan, Yalunwan and Sanya), on the shores of which there are many luxury hotels 3-5 *.  Hotel Sanya Jingli Lai Resort 4 *, located in Sanya, is quite popular among Russian tourists.  It represents the perfect combination of "price-quality" and provides tourists with thoughtful service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hainan Hotels </h2><p>  On the island there are many comfortable <span>3-5</span> star <span>hotels</span> .  Among them, one can see chic hotel complexes belonging to global hotel brands, for example, Hilton, Palm Beach.  The attendants in many of them are Chinese.  They are very executive, but not smiling and do not want to make contact with vacationers, unlike Thais or Malaysians.  But in general, service in Hainan hotels can be rated at the top five. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sanya jingli lai resort 4 sanya bay" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/505752.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  As already noted, Hainan Island is the southernmost of the Chinese islands, it has a tropical climate.  The sun shines almost all year round (out of 365 of it in a year, 300 are solar).  Air temperature is + 24 degrees on average, and water - two degrees higher.  It is believed that the best time to relax here is the period from March to October, although it is also warm enough in the winter months, and with a pleasant combination of circumstances, you can swim in the sea, especially in Sanya - in the southernmost of the island's resorts.  In a word, even in winter you can go for a tan to Sanya, on Hainan Island.  The best hotels are located in this resort. </p><h2>  How to get to Sanya? </h2><p>  This resort, due to its relevance, has its own international airport among tourists.  If you bought a tour to the Sanya Jingli Lai Resort 4 * hotel, then you can fly here by direct flight from Moscow and St. Petersburg in just 4 and a half hours.  You can also choose a flight from Moscow to Haikou (the capital of the island), and from there go by car or bus to the resort (for 350-450 RMB).  Sometimes, Russians prefer to fly to Sanya with a stop in Beijing or Shanghai to explore these beautiful cities, as well as go shopping.  By the way, group tourists do not need individual visas, and they can get permission when entering the country, but for single tourists it is better to take care of a visa (its cost is $ 20) in Moscow to avoid unexpected troubles when passing customs control. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  General description of Sanya </h2><p>  Sanya is deservedly called Chinese Hawaii.  Here, tropical vegetation blooms violently, there are many flowers and vines.  Everywhere spreading <span>palm trees, coconuts,</span> conifers, etc.  The air is warm and humid, it rains often, but they are short-lived, the sea is amazingly warm and gentle, sandy beaches and simply magnificent.  Sometimes the course brings large flocks of jellyfish, which can sting people painfully, but this is a rare occurrence.  The only drawback of the beaches is that there is a highway between the hotel area and them.  They are all public, so sun loungers, umbrellas are paid (50 yuan), but towels need to be brought with you.  The beaches also have showers, changing rooms, water activities, beach volleyball.  Off the coast of the resort it is very convenient to dive (for 400-500 RMB), and in windy weather - windsurfing.  There are many hotels of different categories, and among them the most popular are four-star hotels, for example Sanya Jingli Lai Resort 4 * Sanya Bay.  Here the prices are not so high, and the level of service is almost the same as in five-star ones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4 Hainan hotels" class="if" height="202" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/505757.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Description and room services </h2><p>  The deluxe rooms have no balconies.  And this is one of the reasons for the discontent of tourists.  In their reviews, they complain that in the evenings they do not have the opportunity to relax in the fresh air, conveniently sitting on the balcony.  The bathroom is equipped with a shower, there is a full set of bath and toilet accessories, slippers, a hairdryer (you need to ask at the reception).  The rooms are equipped with modern furniture.

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  In the evenings, the complex has evening animation in two languages: Chinese and English.  Unfortunately, there are no Russian-speaking animators at the hotel, as well as attendants.  Tourists have to communicate with the hotel staff in sign language.  In the daytime, children's animation is organized for young tourists.  In addition, they are always welcome in the children's mini-club, where they can play enough with various toys, draw, play educational games, compete with peers, etc.  Cinema fans can spend an evening watching interesting films in a cozy movie theater or have fun in the game center.  In short, for lovers of quiet entertainment here is quite acceptable.  But gourmets can upset the scarcity of the kitchen.  The hotel has only two restaurants: Arc DE Triomphe, where breakfast and dinner are served buffet style, and Chaohuangfu, which serves traditional Chinese cuisine.  A reservation is required to visit this restaurant.  Unfortunately, the hotel does not have a nightclub or disco, and for noisy entertainment tourists have to go to the center of Sanya. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  At Sanya Jingli Lai Resort, tourists are served by two food systems: BB (breakfast only) and HB (breakfast and dinner).  According to vacationers, a wide variety of dishes at the buffet in this hotel is not observed.  In addition, there is no separate children's menu, and this is the main reason for the discontent of tourists-parents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sanya jingli lai resort 4 reviews" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/505748.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  As already noted, all beaches in Hainan are municipal.  This means that the Sanya Jingli Lai Resort 4 * Sanya Bay has no private beach.  Vacationers use the beach of Yuhai International Resort.  You already know that sun loungers and umbrellas are provided for tourists for 50 yuan, a shower is also paid, but costs a little less (about 30 yuan).  The beach is surrounded by bright emerald tropical greenery, the water near the shore has a surprisingly beautiful turquoise hue.  The natural landscape of these places is beautiful, and this compensates for all the shortcomings of this resort, the main of which is the highway laid between the hotel and the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="china hainan island photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/505753.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The most interesting attraction on the island is the so-called ‚Äúmonkey island.‚Äù However, this is not an island at all, but a peninsula called Nanwan. Several thousand macaques live here. as well as always ready to treat yourself with sweets or fruits from hand.In Sanya, the grand Sanya Nanshan Temple with a giant statue of Guanin, which rises above the sea, was built in 1998. The cost of the ticket for exploring this  Remarkably 150 RMB. But diving enthusiasts prefer to visit the island Wuzhizhou. Here, off the coast of the island, a stunningly beautiful underwater world. You can find the unique marine life that live exclusively in this region. </p><h2>  Sanya Jingli Lai Resort 4 *: reviews of tourists who visited the hotel </h2><p>  As for the ratings of tourists about this hotel, they are different: both positive and negative.  If we put aside the factor of subjectivity and soberly analyze all the reviews, we can draw the following conclusion: the hotel meets its four-star category.  The infrastructure is quite developed here, the service is well established.  However, vacationers are not satisfied with the cuisine, which consists mainly of local dishes.  It is especially difficult for families with children who are unaccustomed to Chinese dishes.  Moms complain that their children refuse to eat Chinese dishes and remain hungry, and it‚Äôs impossible to buy anything edible in a store on site.  Young people also do not like the hotel, because there is practically <span>nothing to do here</span> in the evenings.  And the main dissatisfaction of tourists is associated with the presence of rodents and insects in the hotel and on the beaches. </p>
