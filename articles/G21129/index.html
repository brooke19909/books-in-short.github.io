    <p>  Medieval armor was forged strong enough, but at the same time as light as possible, which was an important factor in the battle.  At the same time, we often encounter the ideas of contemporaries that medieval armor weighed incredibly much, that a knight chained in armor was not able to independently rise to his feet or climb on a horse.  Of course, all this had nothing to do with reality.  Any modern historian, a reenactor of that era or simply interested in it, will easily refute these myths.  For example, on average, full knight armor already in the 15th century, when it reached the climax of its improvement, weighed no more than thirty kilograms.  This is quite comparable with the calculation of modern infantrymen.  By the way, most of the weight of modern fighters is concentrated in a backpack and puts pressure on the shoulders.  Armor was evenly distributed throughout the body.  The same applies to the concept of integral art and sculptural additions for the sake of the beauty of armor.  All this could only interfere with the battle, and therefore, such impractical things could only have a ceremonial purpose, but were not intended for battle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  <strong>So what is a Viking horned helmet for?</strong> </p><p>  As the reader has probably already understood, here we are also dealing with a myth.  There was absolutely no need for a Viking horned helmet.  Indeed, in the entire history of archaeological excavations, such an artifact belonging to the Scandinavian soldiers has never been found.  More than a thousand of the most diverse helmets were found: pointed, blunt, with scaffolds and visors.  However, there was not a single horned one among them.  There are several similar helmets that belonged to other nations, but not a single Norman.  They, of course, were not fighting, but served in some ritual events.  After all, the main function of the helmet is the effective protection of the warrior's head from enemy attacks.  It was this goal that has been pursued over the centuries by blacksmith designers.  The greatest effect can be achieved only by having the helmet surface as smooth as possible.  The sword, which has fallen on the horn, will not slip off safely, but may tear off the helmet from its head, turn it into an uncomfortable position for the owner, or even lead to its split.  In fact, the helmets of medieval Scandinavians were similar to the famous helmet of St. Wenceslas (in the second photo), helmets with a half mask were also presented, which were called by the modern archaeologists the name ‚ÄúGjernmundby‚Äù - at the place of discovery (image in the third photo). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <strong>Where did the legend of the horned helmet come from?</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="horned helmet" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/286028.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An interesting story has occurred with this element of Scandinavian defense.  Surprisingly, the horned helmet was not attributed to the Vikings by the latest writers, directors, or simply the philistine consciousness.  These were made by their own contemporaries.  It is worth recalling that these warriors, who instilled fear throughout Europe in the X-XII centuries, were pagans.  They regularly destroyed and robbed the coastal settlements of the continent.  Catholic churches and monasteries, which at that time were the main strongholds of culture and education, were often plundered.  The barbaric and tough behavior of the Vikings was not something especially new for the then Europe.  But the blasphemous treatment of Christian shrines made them in the eyes of the clergy not just enemies, but literally the children of the Devil.  So why was the Viking horned helmet portrayed in this situation?  It is in spiritual images that they first appear with horns on their heads, which has become a transparent allusion to their essence.  They soon found such an image throughout the continent.  Therefore, the question of why the Vikings need a horned helmet can be answered as follows: they did not wear such armor, this is just a legend. </p>
