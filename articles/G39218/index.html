However, in order to remove the phone‚Äôs battery and protect electronic components from the destructive effects of liquids, you must have knowledge on how to disassemble iPhone 4.  However, not every owner of a branded device has the technical means in the form of a specialized mobile tool.  Nevertheless, the situation requires decisive action. </p><h2>  We solve the problem without using a professional tool </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to disassemble iPhone 4" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/393577.jpg" width="550"></div></h2><p>  However, without a thin Phillips and flat head screwdriver, all your attempts to carefully dismantle the smartphone panel are obviously doomed to failure.  However, even with the aforementioned tool, difficulties in disassembling can still not be avoided.  The fact is that already at the first stage of dismantling you will need to unscrew the two pentalobe screws.  The five-pointed sprocket (profile of bolts that fix the lower end part of the housing) can be easily twisted if you feel the ‚Äústable‚Äù stop of the screw faces. </p><h2>  Forced retreat, or How to disassemble iPhone 4 without consequences </h2><p>  Attention: any slipping of the tool, useless rotation (removal of persistent chamfers) with excessive force, as well as shaking hands are strictly unacceptable in the process of extremely responsible business - dismantling.  All that you can achieve under such working conditions is mechanical damage to the case (deep scratches, chips and peeling) and loose screws. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Removing the cover and disconnecting the battery </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to disassemble iPhone 4: photo" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/393578.jpg?1399754397998" width="550"></div></h2><p>  Sequencing: </p><ul><li>  After unscrewing the pentalobe bolts, slide the back of the panel up, and then lift it. </li><li>  The battery cable is closed with a protective cover.  Loosen the screw and using an old bank card, gently pry the connector lock. </li><li>  Pull the tab on the battery liner. </li></ul><p>  This is the first stage of the described process ‚ÄúHow to disassemble iPhone 4‚Äù. Now your device is not <span>short-circuited</span> . The battery is removed. </p><h2>  Dismantling the main camera </h2><p>  Further manipulations: </p><ul><li>  Pull out the SIM tray. </li><li>  Unscrew the two horizontal bolts located at the top, as well as the two lower ones closer to the left edge.  Remove the protective steel plate. </li><li>  Remove the vibration motor (upper right corner ‚Äî screw). </li><li>  Disconnect the connector of 5 loops. </li><li>  Take a camera. </li></ul><h2>  Removing the system board </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to disassemble an iPhone 4 s" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/393579.jpg?1399754454225" width="550"></div></h2><p>  This is the most critical part of the practical guide, covering the issue of how to disassemble iPhone 4. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  A protective strip is located near the connector pad of the battery.  Having unscrewed two fixing screws, remove it. </li><li>  Disconnect the system cable from the board and move it to the left. </li><li>  Now at the bottom of the phone on the right, unscrew the mounting bolt of the polyphonic module.  Having disconnected a <span>coaxial cable,</span> dismantle a plastic detail. </li><li>  In the middle part of the system board (closer to the middle of the case) there is a fixing screw, which must be unscrewed in order to free the motherboard of the smartphone. </li><li>  Gently pry the ‚Äúheart of the iPhone‚Äù and remove it from the case frame. </li></ul><h2>  Important ‚Äúlittle things‚Äù </h2><p>  Now it remains to remove the ‚Äúhinged‚Äù parts, and the question of how to disassemble the ‚ÄúiPhone 4‚Äù, the photo of which you see in the understated version, can be considered practically resolved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to disassemble iPhone 4" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/393580.jpg?1399754516335" width="550"></div>

    <ul><li>  At the bottom of the phone, unscrew the two screws holding the bottom cable. </li><li>  To the right, gently pull out (twist!) The microphone located in the end cavity of the case. </li><li>  Disconnect the flex cable for the Home button and remove it. </li><li>  Now dismantle the system connector. </li></ul><p>  By the way, it is in the little things that the processes of dismantling the iPhone 4 and the modification of its receiver with the significant letter ‚ÄúS‚Äù differ.  However, the essence of the question: <span>‚ÄúHow to disassemble iPhone 4</span> S,‚Äù is identical to the described process, not counting a few bolts and some dimensional differences in the details. For example: </p><ul><li>  The upper part of the smartphone is simply ‚Äústrewn‚Äù with a variety of small details.  Therefore, utmost attention is an essential element in such a crucial process as the final stage of disassembling the iPhone device. </li><li>  The audio unit is fixed to the internal end screw. </li><li>  <span>The front camera is</span> simply pulled out of the grooves of the chassis frame. </li><li>  The speaker, buttons and sensor are removed, in general, elementary.  It is only important not to make sudden movements and be extremely careful. </li></ul><h2>  The final stage of work <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to disassemble iPhone 4 Chinese" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/393596.jpg?1399754571648" width="400"></div></h2><p>  The screen module is not recommended to be affected.  Even if you detect a clear moisture in the internal area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe display, you are unlikely to be able to eliminate the unpleasant liquid penetration factor at home.  If your iPhone gets completely wet, a visit to a specialized workshop can simply not be avoided.  If, however, during disassembly, you did not find traces of water, well, all you have to do is thoroughly wipe the connector pads with alcohol and assemble the device in its original state. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Now you know how to disassemble iPhone 4.  The Chinese clone, by the way, is much more difficult to dismantle, since some structural elements are fixed on an adhesive basis, which at times increases the risk of damage to the removed part.  However, this is a separate topic of the story.  Successful iPhone disassembly! </p>
