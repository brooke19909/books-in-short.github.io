Sechenov.  However, in 2009, in June, according to the order of the Minister of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation Tatyana Golikova, he was removed from this post.  As the media wrote about this, his resignation was due to the opposition of the rector of MMA to the reform of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, as a result of which the Academy would lose a number of clinics under its subordination.  By the way, Mikhail Aleksandrovich Paltsev at that time was also vice-president of RAMS.  According to another version, the minister‚Äôs decision was related to a personal conflict between her and the rector.  The resignation order was signed on July 19, 2009, and on July 23, Mikhail Alexandrovich Paltsev demanded public explanations from Golikova, since she had no good reason for such a move.  He even sued the ministry, because he did not see any guilt.  Another version appeared in the press - the rector was ‚Äúinconvenient‚Äù and ‚Äúinsubordinate‚Äù, as were several other heads of higher education institutions, who were also dismissed during 2009.  He did not succeed in reinstating himself as rector, but since 2015, he has been appointed the Chief Scientific Secretary of the RAS. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fingers mikhail alexandrovich" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1577411.jpg" width="340"></div>

Mikhail Alexandrovich is a public person, always ready to communicate with the press.  Reception days are organized for everyone who wants to meet with him once a month.  You can come, chat and make up an opinion about what kind of person Mikhail Aleksandrovich Paltsev is.  His contacts can be clarified in the reception of the executive secretary of the Academy. </p>
