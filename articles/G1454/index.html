    <h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  <span><span><span>If desired, guests can rent rooms in this hotel with or without breakfast.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>They feed the guests in the complex</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Michalis Apartments 3 *</span></span></span> <span><span><span>(Greece)</span></span></span> <span><span><span>, the</span></span></span> <span><span><span>court,</span></span></span> <span><span><span>according to the reviews, is not bad.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The food in the dining room at this hotel is fresh and delicious.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The restaurant of the complex earned not too good reviews mainly for the uniformity of the menu.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>During the rest, the dishes served at the hotel are simply annoying for many guests, and they prefer to eat in the cafes located next to the hotel.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The food in these establishments, judging by the reviews, is very good.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>If you wish, you can take, for example, eggs, ham, toast, cheese for breakfast in the hotel's dining room.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Of the drinks, guests are usually offered only tea, coffee and juice from bags.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Breakfast in this complex is not very diverse.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>But such a drawback are the dining rooms of most inexpensive</span></span></span> <span><span><span>hotels in Hersonissos.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>For three-star hotels in Greece, this is generally quite typical.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Beach Hotels </h2><p>  <span><span><span>Hotel</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Michalis Apartments 3 * is located</span></span></span> <span><span><span>on the second coastline.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>To the nearest beach (urban), its guests have to get about 7-10 minutes.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>It is the last</span></span></span> <span><span><span>narrow stone strip without a promenade, above which expensive and cheap restaurants are built solidly.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Sunbathing and swimming on this beach is not too convenient.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>In addition, sea urchins live in the rocks in this place in the water.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Therefore, swimming on this beach is only in special shoes.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Otherwise, you can seriously injure your legs.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Thus, the coastline near the hotel is not too convenient for relaxation.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Therefore, many guests of</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Michalis Apartments 3 *</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">prefer to visit other beaches in Hersonissos.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">If desired, tourists can, for example, go</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">to the C</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">reta Maris</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">hotel</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">for the port.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Here is a very convenient beach, awarded the blue flag of UNESCO for its cleanliness.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The coastline at this place is covered with coarse sand.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Hedgehogs are not found in the sea.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Most tourists believe that Crete is more suitable not for lovers of beach holidays, but for those who want to gain new experiences, sightseeing in a rented car, or just have fun.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">However, the</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">weather in Hersonissos,</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">as already mentioned, is usually hot.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Therefore, a visit to the beach next to the hotel, of course, in any case will not be superfluous.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Entertainment near the hotel </h2><p>  <span><span><span>The infrastructure of the city of Hersonissos near the</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Michalis Apartments 3 *</span></span></span> <span><span><span>hotel</span></span></span> <span><span><span>is very well developed.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>If desired, guests can directly outside the hotel gates to visit all sorts of cafes, bars, clubs.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>If you go from the hotel a little down to the sea, you can see a small restaurant</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Akrogiali.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Here, judging by the reviews, deliciously cooked seafood.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The choice of dishes in this restaurant is wide, but they are not too expensive.</span></span></span> </p>
