"International" in St. Petersburg was the last on the 5th Frunze-Primorsky line (purple). </p><h2>  How was the station built </h2><p>  The construction of the station began in the late 80s.  Then funding stopped, for a long time the fenced area stood idle, surrounded by a spontaneous market.  The active construction of the Mezhdunarodnaya metro station in St. Petersburg began in 2011 and ended a year later. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sdelanounas.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Laconic luxury" class="if uuid-2362812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2362812.jpg"></div><p>  At first it was planned to make a ground-type station, but the state of the soil did not allow to implement such a project. </p><h2>  Metro "International", St. Petersburg </h2><p>  "International" is the 67th <span>metro</span> station in <span>St. Petersburg.</span>  Project architects - N. Vinogradova, Y. Romanova and N. Romashkin-Timanov. </p><p>  The plans of the St. Petersburg authorities to extend further the Frunze-Primorsky line and build 3 more stations beyond the "International".  It is assumed that the deep-seated station will become an interchange and connect the 5th line and Koltsevaya. </p><h2>  Lobby design </h2><p>  According to St. Petersburg tradition, the lobby of the Mezhdunarodnaya metro station, St. Petersburg, the Kupchino district, is small.  Ticket vending machines are installed in the lobby, there is an information desk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A pleasant surprise is the presence of a stand that displays information about the nearby streets - Bucharest and Bela Kun.  The history of the Romanov village is briefly described, on the site of which the Kupchino district arose, as well as the Farforovsky overpass and the neighboring village named after  Shaumyan. </p><p>  The mosaic decorates the walls of the lobby, which was performed by A. Bystrov.  This is a well-known artist in St. Petersburg, the head of one of the workshops of the Institute.  Repin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.metrowalks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Station lobby" class="if uuid-2362575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2362575.jpg"></div><p>  Opposite the escalators, the ‚ÄúBirth of the Universe‚Äù panel, made of pieces of smalt, is placed in the lobby.  The panel became the embodiment of the author's ideas about the origin of the world, so in the mosaic picture you can see the Olympic gods, the Parthenon and the Colosseum, Icarus soaring into the sky.  The laconic palette of blue and white colors fits well with the ensemble of the St. Petersburg metro. </p><p>  4 escalators descend to a depth of 65 m, the travel time is about 3 minutes. </p><h2>  Interior decoration </h2><p>  The "international" metro station in St. Petersburg is both strict and luxurious. </p><p>  The underground part is bright and airy.  The floor is gray and the walls are white marble.  Two rows of columns separating the central hall from the landing platforms are lined with antique gold-colored brass sheets.  Each column is surrounded by three rows of handrails made in the same style. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The decorative decoration of the underground station is a panel from the Atlas mosaic, located at the southern end of the central aisle.  Near the panel there is a place for creating a transition to the Ring Line.  Already installed 2 stairs with a handrail of golden color, as in the hall, but so far the stairs end in a dead end. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mosaic decoration station" class="if uuid-2362593" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2362593.jpg"></div><p>  The hall is well lit with fluorescent light, giving the impression of a fine day.  Lamps, according to the tradition of the St. Petersburg metro, are located behind the cornices. </p><p>  The underground metro station is equipped with information stands, comfortable oval benches are located on the platforms. </p><h2>  Exit metro </h2><p>  According to modern tradition, the exit from the Mezhdunarodnaya metro station is built into a shopping and entertainment complex of the same name. </p><p>  On an area of ‚Äã‚Äã46 thousand m2 there are a food store, a fitness club, restaurants and fast food cafes, offices, a shopping gallery and a cinema with 7 halls, as well as an arcade game complex.  There is also a parking lot for 270 cars in the shopping center. </p><p>  The project of the Mezhdunarodnaya metro station in St. Petersburg provided for another exit integrated into the lobby of the residential complex, but this option was not implemented. </p><p>  From the metro lobby through the shopping pavilion, access was made to Bucharest and B.
