    <p>  Kirillovka, the private sector of which, perhaps, never lacks vacationers, is located in one of the resort regions of Ukraine.  This is a small <span>urban-type settlement of</span> Akimovsky district in the Zaporizhzhya region, located on the shores of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov. </p><p>  Not everyone knows that, in addition to warm water and a gentle sun, there are also Molochny and Utlyuk estuaries, known in narrow circles of tourists for their healing mud. </p><p>  This is actually a wonderful corner of Ukraine, which boasts a very good geographical location and a suitable atmosphere for a summer vacation with the whole family.  There are no industrial enterprises on its territory, therefore there is always clean, uncontaminated air.  It should be noted that the infrastructure is also very well developed here - public transport runs regularly until late in the evening, and there is definitely no shortage of shops, <span>cafes, bars, restaurants</span> and institutions providing household services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For those who have never been to the village of Kirillovka (Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov), a map sold in almost every kiosk will show the location of the main camp sites, dispensaries and hotels.  That is why even the most scattered will not get lost.  Also in the village is the health resort of the same name, which has been functioning for many years. </p><h2>  Section 2.

On the highway Kharkov - Simferopol there is a direction indicator in the direction the traveler needs.  You can also focus on the deer pedestal, which is located at this intersection.

    <p>  In general, there are relatively young recreation centers on Fedotova Kosa (there are more than 150 of them) and 2 children's health centers with different territories.  Each base differs not only in the number and types of rooms available, but also in services. </p><p>  Today, the resort is famous for the largest <span>water park</span> in <span>Ukraine</span> called ‚ÄúTreasure Island‚Äù, an equestrian theater, a water slide, a Ferris wheel, several night and dance clubs, a safari and an amusement park.  Fedotka is a paradise where many people go for a decent rest, entertainment and fun, although this place is especially popular among young people. </p><h2>  Section 6.

    <p>  One of the most popular camp sites located on the famous Fedotova Spit is the recreation center "Coral Island".  There you can actually relax relatively inexpensively and comfortably.  The advantage of the location of the base is that it is located on the very shore of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov and has its own ennobled beach.  Vacationers have the opportunity to settle in 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-bed one-room and two-room suites, in apartments, in standard rooms or choose a more budget option. </p><p>  Another famous recreation center - "Pearl" - is located in the center of the spit, in one of the busiest places, where children‚Äôs attractions, shops, and a market are also located.  The guarded and well-lit area is equipped with cozy and comfortable lodging rooms for luxury, junior suite and standard.  In the economy category, 2-, 3- and 4-bed rooms are offered. </p><p>  There are many more wonderful recreation centers on the territory, such as the Cote d'Azur, Madrid, the Twinkle, the Sun, the Enthusiast, etc. </p><p>  Many experienced travelers claim that this is where you should go on vacation.  Kirillovka, the private sector of which is famous throughout the country, it turns out, can be proud of larger places to accommodate guests. </p><p>  The pricing policy is almost the same, which means it‚Äôs worth choosing, taking into account only your own desires.  Cost of living: from 150-200 hryvnia per day. </p><h2>  Section 7. For lovers of outdoor activities </h2>
