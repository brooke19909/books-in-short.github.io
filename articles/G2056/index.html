The environmental situation in Almetyevsk leaves much to be desired, so it is important to choose a hotel in a place surrounded by a forest zone, remote from the center.  Let it not bother you that you have to overcome some distance to the place of work or training.  The town is small, for example, from the Voskhod Hotel (Almetyevsk) the road to the business center takes only 5 minutes by car. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  What can help minimize the negative impact of bad ecology on our body?  Of course, being in places where there is a sufficient amount of green space, away from the gassed motorways, in a quiet and calm park area.  It is in such an ecologically clean corner that the Voskhod hotel is located in Almetyevsk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="almetevsk.flamp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="interior interior" class="if uuid-2602742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2602742.jpg"></div><p>  Distinctive features of the hotel is a comfortable number of rooms, high-quality service and good value for money.

Some felt that the staff was not welcoming enough, the pathos blew from the interior, and the placement itself was mediocre.  Others complained about the lack of kettles in standard rooms, old televisions. </p><p>  The guests really liked the clean and comfortable rooms that did not require repair, high-quality and satisfying food (the pastries were especially tasty).

For accommodation in a room with increased comfort, it is worth booking a junior suite or suite, if you plan to only stay at the hotel, a standard room is also suitable.
