By that time, <span>the Government</span> consisted of ten people: four Cadets, two Octobrists, one progressist and Socialist-Revolutionary, one representative from the Zemsky Council and one non-partisan member.  The composition of the Council consisted mainly of Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks.  They believed that their body was completely unprepared for governing the state, and therefore should limit itself to oversight of the actions of the Government.

    <p>  So, the dual power in Russia in 1917 is a system of government, in which power was distributed between two bodies: the Provisional Government and the Council of Workers 'and Peasants' Deputies.  Purely theoretically, such a scheme assumed mutual control and the prevention of ‚Äúexcesses‚Äù that would benefit only certain social strata.  In practice, everything turned out not so good. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Causes </h2><p>  By the way, why did dual power appear in Russia in 1917?  The reasons for this are pretty commonplace.  First, we have already noted that all the political forces in Russia at that time longed for power, but they resolutely did not succeed in negotiating with each other. </p><p>  In addition, there was a complete reluctance to bear responsibility for their actions.  Isn't that a familiar situation?  For example, no one could decide to lead the country out of the war, although its futility has long been understood by all sectors of society.  While the dual power in Russia in 1917 existed, practically nothing was done for the real transfer of land to the peasants, which they had been waiting for since 1861.  Naturally, all this set the people against the Provisional Government and the Council. </p><h2>  Relations between the Council and the Government </h2>

Both of them were similar: in the first case, the deputies believed that it was impossible to make concessions at all, in the second - that all managerial initiatives should be gradually intercepted.  But in reality, it was completely impossible to ignore the Council, since it relied on the support of the armed people.

In addition, the promised proclamation of a democratic Republic also did not happen.  Not least of all, this was due to the fact that the Provisional Government sought at all costs to concentrate all state power in its hands. </p><h2>  What was the state structure in the first time after the February Revolution? </h2>

The year 1917 is in the yard, in the country there are a lot of unresolved social and economic problems.  There were resources for their solution, almost all social strata were for the new authorities, since the tsarist government did nothing at all in recent years, quickly and decisively bringing the country to a crisis.  But why did the Provisional Government fail? </p><h2>  Management errors </h2><p>  The solution of the most pressing issue of land was postponed until the last, until the convocation of the <span>Constituent Assembly.</span>  Therefore, one should not be surprised that for the majority of the population the Government has again become hostile and alien.  The tension grew, after which the <span>crises of the Provisional Government began.</span> </p><p>  On April 18, P. N. Milyukov, who at that time was the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in a message to the Allies, said that Russia, in spite of everything, intends to ‚Äúfight to the bitter end‚Äù.  Thousands of people went out to protest, not wanting to send their near and dear ones to the war disgusting everyone.  Milyukov and Minister of Defense A. I. Guchkov were immediately dismissed.  Already in early May, the Provisional Government included several Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries. </p><h2>  Coalition government </h2>

However, even this could not solve all the problems.  Under such conditions, extremely favorable conditions arose for the people to support Bolshevism.  On June 3, 1917, Lenin V.I. spoke at the First All-Union Congress of Soviets, who by that time had already returned from exile.

    <p>  He said that his party, seeing the mess in the country, is ready to take all power into its own hands and put things in order.  Thus, the dual power in Russia in 1917 more and more rapidly began to lose the support of all segments of the population.  No one liked the policies of the Government and the Council. </p><h2>  The direction is to dictatorship! </h2><p>  The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries were especially hard hit, as they "collaborated with the bourgeoisie" in the person of the Provisional Government.  In the working environment, the Bolsheviks have more and more supporters.  The events of June 18 demonstrated this particularly vividly.  On this day, the Council planned an action in support of the Provisional Government.  The Bolsheviks immediately reacted to such a clear threat by convening workers for a "spontaneous" rally. </p><p>  In St. Petersburg alone, at least five hundred thousand people took to the streets, who ‚Äúcarried to the masses‚Äù the slogans known to everyone: ‚ÄúAll power to the Soviets!‚Äù, ‚ÄúDown with the capitalist ministers!‚Äù, ‚ÄúDown with the war!‚Äù. </p><h2>  Failures at the front </h2>

Just ten days later, it completely drowned, Russia's losses were enormous.  According to scattered archival reports, we can conclude that about 60 thousand soldiers died.

    <p>  On July 8, the Cadet Central Committee decided to completely withdraw from the ‚Äúcollaborationist government‚Äù, which at that time was already in full swing negotiating with the nationalist parties of Ukraine, agreeing on the conditions for this newly-fledged country to leave Russia. </p><p>  Soon, thousands of demonstrations raged on the streets of St. Petersburg again under the slogans of transferring all power to the Bolsheviks.  This time the situation was complicated by the fact that among the people there were many armed soldiers and sailors.  In general, dual power in Russia in 1917 existed largely due to the people's belief that their deputies would be able to end the war.  When this did not happen, the trust of the electorate was immediately lost. </p><h2>  Dual power sunset </h2><p>  The government made a fatal decision on the need to use force.  At least 700 people were killed, and public administration gradually begins to slide into a banal dictatorship.  <span>Martial law</span> was introduced <span>,</span> military units were hastily withdrawn from the capital, almost all radical newspapers were completely closed. </p><h2>  Second Coalition Government </h2><p>  A decree is issued on the early arrest of V.I. Lenin and G.E. Zinoviev, who at that time headed the Bolshevik party.  On July 24, a ‚Äúsecond edition‚Äù of the coalition government was formed, which this time included eight ‚Äúcapitalists‚Äù and seven ‚Äúsocialists‚Äù.  The well-known A.F. Kerensky becomes the Prime Minister of the new authority. </p>

Simply put, there was no talk of any kind of separation of power.  So, what did diarchy in Russia in 1917 lead to?  The results were disappointing: </p><ul><li>  A grand social crisis was brewing in the country. </li><li>  The army and navy were clearly not on the side of the government. </li><li>  Nobody decided to withdraw the country from the war. </li><li>  Land was not handed over to the peasants. </li><li>  The people did not wait for the necessary social and economic reforms. </li></ul><p>  In general, the dual power in Russia in 1917, the scheme of which has been repeatedly cited above, is a fine example of how weak and insecure political forces, which ‚Äúseized‚Äù themselves to power, find themselves unable to do something really useful.  The Bolsheviks captivated people's hearts because they preferred not only to rant, but also acted. </p><p>  It was they who stopped the participation of Russia in the war, although they did it through the ‚ÄúShameful Brest Peace,‚Äù which Lenin himself directly spoke about.  However, the onset of relative calm and respite for the country was worth it.  We hope you learned about the factors that forever ended the dual power in Russia in 1917. The table that we presented above describes the main reasons. </p><h2>  The Kornilov rebellion </h2><p>  After the dual power was eliminated, an attempt was made to rally all the political forces in the country in order to prevent its creeping into the chaos of the civil war.  In mid-August, the Big State Assembly was held, in which all the political forces of the country took part.  Except the Bolsheviks.  Alas, the attempt to come to an agreement failed once again: the Mensheviks advocated real reforms and coexistence with the Soviet, while the bourgeoisie insisted on the dictatorship and the final elimination of all socialists. </p><p>  Under these conditions, a military coup became possible, ‚Äúat the helm‚Äù of which stood General L. G. Kornilov.  His program provided not only the complete elimination of the leaders of Bolshevism, but also mobilization measures in the economy, the restoration of the death penalty in the navy and in the army.  The latter was necessary in order to stop the rapidly developing decomposition of troops.  Kornilov miscalculated: almost all political parties rose up against him, who were not at all impressed by the restoration of the tsarist dictatorship.  Within a week, the rebellion was suppressed. </p>

The following events are also caused by this: having finally received real power, all political parties fell into apathy.  Their members no longer needed anything, and therefore the Bolsheviks easily seized state administration in their own hands, using the full support of people tired of all this.
