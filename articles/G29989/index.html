    <p>  The desire to maintain the efficiency of the structures of military and political control in the event of an air attack threat is quite rational and justified.  The main goal of any aggressor is the headquarters and <span>communications centers,</span> military and industrial facilities are hit in the second place. </p><p>  The construction of underground government residences began in many countries long before the advent of <span>nuclear weapons,</span> but the design features of most of them make it possible to withstand the atomic bombing.  <span>Hitler was</span> struck by his excessive strength in Berlin <span>'s bunker</span> (now not preserved) built in the 30s near the imperial chancellery. </p>

    <p>  Stalin's bunker in Samara (then Kuibyshev) was cut down in rock formations, work was carried out in the strictest secrecy.  To mask such a large-scale construction, they even built a hydroelectric power station, which, however, came in handy too.  Safety margin would allow today to use this building for its intended purpose. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But such an object was not one, there were several.  It is known about the mysterious underground headquarters of Hitler near Vinnitsa, supposedly built by the Germans in record time, in just a few months.  Its dimensions are so impressive that one can only assume that in fact it was Stalin's secret bunker, dug before the war and used by the enemy.  To carry out such large-scale work in the occupied territory and at the same time keep secret is almost impossible, not to mention calculations and design. </p>

    <p>  The fact that in a secret branch of the Moscow metro a situation was created in advance that completely repeats the Kremlin interior also indicates how carefully preparations for the war were made.  When visiting the Stalin’s bunker, the general, the marshal, the chief designer or another guest was sure that he was not underground, but in the “owner ”’s office, this was very important psychologically and gave confidence in the final victory. </p><p>  In the postwar years, a very real threat of a nuclear strike arose.  It would be strange if those who were responsible for the security of the Soviet leadership did not react to it.  The requirements for facilities have become even stricter, in particular, the problem of providing people in shelter with non-contaminated radiological air pollution has become an urgent problem.  Stalin's new bunker in Moscow was conceived as a place from where troops will be controlled in case of a conflict with the use of atomic weapons. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In total, the builders of the forties could not take into account, during the <span>Cold War the</span> structure was repeatedly modernized.  The dimensions of the underground facility are huge, so it takes at least an hour and a half to quickly examine it.  Its depth reaches 70 meters.  In those days, maintenance of communication and encryption equipment was much more time-consuming than today, and only six hundred electronic specialists were required, while the entire staff consisted of 2500 military personnel. </p><p>  Today, Stalin’s bunker on Taganka turned into a museum.  There are many who wish to visit the "Object 42", the mere mention of which six decades ago could have cost their lives.  Today the price is more modest - only 700 rubles.  For this money, you can inspect everything, get acquainted with thematic videos and even deal a nuclear strike in the United States, of course, make-believe.  This exercise, by the way, was repeatedly repeated by duty officers in the 50s and 60s, and each time no one told them whether it was a training launch or a combat launch. </p><p>  It is known that in Moscow there is another Stalin's bunker, in the Izmailovo region, however, the “father of the peoples” himself never honored him with his presence.  Apparently, it was built as a reserve, and it is possible that its purpose was completely distracting.  In any case, the quality of work and materials is so high that any of these objects is quite suitable for use today.  And how many of them were built - a mystery to this day. </p>
