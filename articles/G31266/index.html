Almost Africa, but still Europe</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tenerife (Spain) is an island.  It is the largest among the seven resort "Canary", and often called the "land of eternal spring."  This is not surprising, because the weather prevails here, characteristic of the ‚Äútime of love‚Äù - not less than +20 degrees in winter and not more than 25 in summer.  Different people come here.  But the island accepts everyone - and lovers of a drink, a walk, a snack, and those who want to retire to a beautiful romantic place and meditate.  For everyone there are resorts.  If the cosmopolitan Las Americas and Los Cristianos are suitable for fun partying youth, then Puerto de la Cruz provides a romantic pastime among the picturesque cliffs and greenery.  In short, a trip to the Canaries is always a great vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tenerife Spain" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/275454.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Spain, Tenerife.</strong>  <strong>Two capitals</strong> </p><p>  This <span>Spanish island</span> has always been very important for sailors plying between America, Africa (to which there are only three hundred kilometers) and Europe.  Therefore, it is unique for its alloy of different cultural traditions.  This is evident in its population, cuisine, vibrant "fiesta" and vibrant carnivals.  There are two capitals - the former, La Laguna, and the current - Santa Cruz.  The latter is located in the very north of Tenerife.  Spain is a country of beach holidays, and the capital of the island also boasts a wide beach.  In addition, there is a port where cruise ships arrive.  Therefore, the shopping streets of the capital provide tourists with an excellent opportunity for shopping, for example, in the famous chain shopping center "English Court" (El Corte Ingles).  There is a Canary History Museum with collections of mummies of the first inhabitants of the islands.  It is also worth visiting the Cathedral of Our Lady of the 17th century, known for its collection of art objects.  Santa Cruz is a bustling and interesting city.  But the quieter La Laguna is included in the UNESCO list.  It is not located near the sea, but at the foot of the Anaga mountains.  Its central square is built up with houses of the 15th century.  Tourists can buy traditional crafts at the local market and visit the Museum of Anthropology. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holiday Spain Tenerife" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/275467.jpg" width="570"></div>

They are very different from each other in natural conditions.  The fact is that it often rains in the north of the island, but the south boasts a warmer, subtropical climate.  The watershed between the two zones is <span>Teide National Park.</span>  There is the volcano of the same name, the third highest in the world (more than three thousand meters).  You can get to its top - how to climb a marked path on foot, or climb a <span>cable car.</span>  To the north of here is the Orotava Valley, or ‚ÄúTenerife Gardens‚Äù.  Spain is a wine-making country, and underground volcanic activity makes the local soil good for growing this berry.  There are many cellars and tasting rooms, as well as a wine museum.  They prepare the ‚Äúdrink of the gods" on the island in the traditional way, which has not changed much over several hundred years.  To the south of the park, there is such a landmark as the Guimar Pyramids.  These stepped structures resemble temples built by the Mayans or the Aztecs, but it is still not known who built them and why. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain tenerife reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/275468.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Spain, <span>Tenerife.</span></strong>  <strong><span>Reviews</span> about beaches and the sea</strong> </p><p>  Tourists who have been here call <span>vacation on the island</span> very comfortable, unhurried and truly quiet.  Many people like the <span>black sand of the</span> local beaches - they say that although it can ruin a bright swimsuit, the sensations of sunbathing on it are the most indescribable.  Although there are golden, white and mixed beaches.  All such recreation areas are concentrated mainly in the south of the island, but more picturesque bays with lush vegetation are in the north.  However, swimming is practically impossible there, because the cliffs are too steep and it is impossible to enter the sea.  But all the hotels there have pools, so swimming with contemplation of the beautiful scenery is provided to you. </p>
