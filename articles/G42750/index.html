He is the most recognizable symbol of the country, as it is individual and unique.  Let's look at what the state flag as a whole and the Russian flag in particular represent, we learn about the significance of the tricolor in our symbols, as well as about the history of the flag of the Russian Federation.  But before that, let's get acquainted with the general information about this symbolism. </p><h2>  What is a state flag? </h2><p>  As a rule, it is a certain proportion of the cloth, which can be made of fabric of one or more colors.  The national emblem or emblem is often placed on the flag.  With the help of colors and the images contained on it, the socio-political structure of a given country can be reflected. </p><h2>  Flag value for state </h2><p>  In ancient times, to determine at a great distance the belonging of soldiers, a settlement, a ship to a particular country was a big problem.  To solve it, a flag was created.  Then, in a conspicuous place, a panel of bright colors began to serve as the best means of identification. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of the flag of the Russian Federation" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30048/722239.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The flag of the country as a state symbol is extremely important for the upbringing of patriotism, love for one‚Äôs homeland, a sense of blood and spiritual unity with previous generations, people who defended its sovereignty.  He connects the life of every citizen with the fate of his country and is of great importance in international relations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many Russians are wondering what the <span>flag of the Russian Federation</span> means <span>.</span>  There is no unambiguous official interpretation on this subject.  Attempts are being made to associate its colors with the values ‚Äã‚Äãadopted in ancient times, the events of recent centuries in the territory occupied by the Russian Empire, as well as recent processes. </p><h2>  What is the flag of the Russian Federation today </h2><p>  The main symbol of the country is made in the form of a rectangular cloth.  It consists of three strips located horizontally equal in width.  The top is <span>white, the</span> middle is blue, and the bottom is red.  The ratio of width to length is 2: 3. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the history of the flag of the Russian Federation" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30048/722219.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The history of the flag of the <span>Russian Federation</span> in its current form begins in August 1991, when the white-blue-red-tricolor, which was used in the pre-revolutionary period <span>,</span> was raised again in Moscow over the White House, where the <span>Supreme Council of the RSFSR</span> met.  Legislatively its application was fixed in November 1991. Then the width of the flag to its length was treated as 1: 2.  The proportion was changed to 2: 3 by a presidential decree in December 1993. In the "Regulation on the State Flag of the Russian Federation" all important nuances are indicated.  Later, on December 25, 2000, the President of Russia signed a law containing the description and status of the flag.  This document is still valid and is constitutional. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The history of the creation of the flag of the Russian Federation </h2><p>  During the reign of Alexei Mikhailovich, the father of <span>Peter the Great,</span> in 1668, tricolor was used as symbolism to designate the first warship called the Eagle.  And although the colors were the same, the flag pattern was different.  To this day, historians have not found its exact image.  But it is safe to say that <span>this is a prototype of the</span> modern flag of Russia. </p><p>  After this, the son of Alexei Mikhailovich, Emperor Peter the Great, used this tricolor on his yacht.  It was called the flag of the Moscow Tsar.  Unlike the first version, the prototype of the modern symbolism of the Russian state, it was almost identical to the modern version.  It also consisted of three equal bands: the upper strip is white, the middle is blue, and the bottom is red.  But still there was a difference.  In the middle of the panel was depicted a golden double-headed eagle.  Moreover, the flag was not a symbol of the whole state, but only Peter the Great. </p><p>  As you know, in past centuries the merchant fleet played an important role in the life of the country.  It was a bridge between the Russian state and other countries.  Therefore, a symbol was needed that would mean the Russian fleet.  In 1720, the tricolor became the official flag.  True, only the country's merchant fleet.  It is completely identical to the modern flag of Russia.  However, it did not have the same comprehensive significance.  It was used during the holidays (by decree of Alexander the Third from 1883). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the state flag of the Russian Federation" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30048/721693.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As a national flag, a white-blue-red tricolor was approved in 1896 before the coronation of Nicholas II.  But in Soviet times, it was replaced by a plain red cloth with gold sickle, hammer and star. </p><p>  The history of the national flag of the Russian Federation in its present form continued in November 1991, when identical white-blue-red stripes were recognized as official components in the main element of national symbols.  This was then recorded in a provision approved by a presidential decree in December 1993.  A special federal law that establishes the legal status and procedure for using the flag of Russia was signed by the President on December 25, 2000. </p><h2>  <span>The meaning of the colors of the</span> Russian flag </h2><p>  State symbolism of the country has some allegory.  Description of the <span>flag of the Russian</span> Federation should begin with its colors.  Let's look at what it means. </p><p>  Once white color was associated with nobility and frankness.  Blue - with honesty and fidelity, impeccability and chastity.  Red symbolized masculinity, courage, generosity and love.  Later, the interpretation of scarlet as a symbol of continuity, the solidarity of the Slavic peoples, spread. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of the flag of the Russian Federation briefly" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30048/721704.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The history of the flag of the Russian Federation has preserved evidence of various options for explaining the choice of tricolor colors.  According to one of them, he showed the unity of the Orthodox Church, the sovereign government and the people, where the white bar was a <span>symbol of faith, the</span> blue - power, and the red symbolized Russian people. </p><p>  At the beginning of the last century, it was believed that the first strip meant freedom, the second pointed to the patronage of the Virgin, and the latter denoted a power.  Today, as before, there are opinions that the colors of the Russian flag are associated with concepts such as faith, hope and love. </p><h2>  Flag usage </h2><p>  The symbolism of the country in its current form was legally restored in 1991.  The adopted decrees show us the importance of the flag of the Russian Federation for the life of the country and society, as well as its role in international legal relations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the history of the flag of the Russian Federation" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30048/721711.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  So, the flag should be constantly raised on the buildings of <span>government.</span>  They are decorated with other objects in the days of national holidays.  His image is placed on cars, planes and ships of the country's top leaders.  In accordance with the ritual established by the President of the country, every day he must rise in military units and formations.  The law provides for other options for using this official symbol of the state. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The role of the flag of Russia is extremely important for the life of the modern state and its future socio-political development, positioning the country in the world.
