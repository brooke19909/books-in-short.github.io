    <h2>  Model description </h2><p>  A magnificent cozy <span>knitted cardigan,</span> made with large wide braids, launched all over the knitted fabric in different directions - an unusual accessory, as it creates folding and additional volume.  This volume is the effect of such a model as a Lalo cardigan.  We begin the description of the work with the fact that the seemingly huge work is not really so great, since the model is made of fairly <span>thick yarn.</span>  The braids used as the main motif of the pattern change direction from the center of the back, and the shelves are connected in a mirror image. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Yarn and knitting needles </h2><p>  For work, choose a model 42-44 sizes with approximate volumes of 85-66-92.  One-color Lalo cardigan is best made from medium-thick <span>yarn: Alize</span> Lanagold <span>yarn</span> (100 g / 240 m) in one fold looks great in braids.  She proved herself to be a good quality thread, moderately voluminous, high-quality spun, glides perfectly on the knitting needles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cardigan lalo photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/975863.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Experienced craftsmen, having mastered knitting a cardigan in one color scheme, perform work in an exclusive version with a smooth transition of color, called the gradient.  But the transition should be really smooth.  For example, the Lalo cardigan, the photo of which is presented, wins visually and increases the cost of the model. </p><p>  Here, novice masters can expect unpleasant surprises - sharp color boundaries will not decorate the model.  To achieve a high-quality transition, they use thin yarn for knitting, the footage of a 100-gram skein of which is 1600 m. A fine-woolen thread from the manufacturer of Semenovskaya Yarn, for example, the Lydia series, is good.  Having picked up 2-3 colors, you can make imperceptible transitions from one color to another, gradually changing them.  Usually they are knitted with a thread of 7-8 folds, and successive gradual changes on one thread give an excellent result - a light virtuoso <span>gradient. Volumetric braids</span> assume sufficient looseness of the knitted fabric, therefore, No. 4-5 are considered the optimal size of knitting needles. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Performance Features </h2><p>  Many masters <span>knit a</span> Lalo <span>cardigan with</span> one whole knitted fabric without side seams to the armhole, and others - by performing individual parts (backs, shelves, sleeves). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to tie a cardigan lalo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/976113.jpg"></div>  Different masters choose different ways of doing their work.  We offer a traditional method of knitting parts with their subsequent assembly.  Beginners knitters will be more understandable and simpler.

    <p>  The basis of the cardigan pattern is <span>knitting volumetric braids</span> of 32 loops, alternating with tracks consisting of 2 wrong loops.  Lalo's cardigan is knitted from 14 braids, 6 of which go to the back, 4 to the half of the front.  Sleeve with an okat, it is made of 3 braids.  The collar is a continuation of the front braids of the shelves. </p><h2>  Knit cardigan Lalo </h2><p>  Each knitter, using her own experience, chooses the optimal pattern, focusing on size.  To execute the model of the declared size, we choose the main pattern motif of the braid of 32 loops (16/16), which we will overlap on the 30th row of the repeating rapport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting cardigan lalo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/976102.jpg"></div>  To achieve more prominent braids, you can overlap them through fewer rows, but since our example is presented to gain the skill in performing the model, we will adhere to just such a pattern: in every 30th front row, all braids overlap on the workpiece.  They do it this way: 16 loops are removed on a non-working knitting needle, which is carried out for work or in front of it, the remaining 16 loops are knitted, and then 16 loops are made from an additional knitting needle.

    <p>  A feature of the figure is the separation of the direction of knitting of braids from the center, i.e., the left side of the back is tied to the slope of the braids to the left, and the right part - with a slope to the right.  The desired slope is achieved by transferring the loops on the non-working needle behind the canvas or in front of it.  The braids are directed to the left, if the loops are removed before work, to the right - the knitting needle with loops is placed behind the knitted fabric.  So, how to tie a Lalo cardigan? </p><h2>  Back </h2><p>  This part, like all parts of a cardigan, is knitted from the bottom.  We do the loop calculation: 6 braids with 32 loops + 5 tracks between them with 2 loops + 2 edge = (6 * 32) + (5 * 2) +2 = 204 loops. <br>  Having typed them on the knitting needles, they make a scatter of loops, starting to knit like this: 1 hem, * 32 persons., 2 out.  (repeat 5 times), * 32 persons., 1 edge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted cardigan" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/976130.jpg" width="408"></div>

    <p>  Having knitted to the armhole, they gradually decrease 34 loops (or one braid + 2 track loops) on each side.  As a result, the upper back will consist of 4 braids.  Decrease scheme: in the first row, 8 loops, then in each second row, 2 loops are reduced 13 times.  Further, the canvas is made right before the end of the height of the armhole and closes one row. </p><h2>  Before </h2><p>  Braids for knitting the left shelf are performed with a right slope, i.e., the loops of half of the braid during overlap remain at work, the right - with a left slope (additional knitting needle in front of the canvas). </p><p>  Each half of the front is formed by 4 braids, the last of which, when the corresponding height of the canvas is reached, leaves with decreases and 3 braids remain in the upper part. </p><p>  Having tied the canvas to the shoulder line, the loops of the two braids are closed, and the third is left open, gathered on a pin, as they will be knitted later and form a collar. </p><p>  The number of loops for knitting a shelf is 136. The spread of loops is as follows: 1 cr., * 32 persons., 2 out.  (repeat 3 times), * 32 persons., 1 cr. </p><p>  The armhole is knitted similarly to the execution pattern on the back, closing 8 loops once and 13 times 2 loops each. </p><h2>  Sleeve </h2><p>  A sleeve consisting of 3 braids is formed with a ridge.  The braids of the left sleeve are performed with the right slope, the right - with the left.  On the knitting needles 102 loops are knitted and knit like this: 1 cr., * 32 persons., 2 out.  (repeat 2 times), * 32 persons., 1 cr.  Without additions, they knit about 25 cm, then they begin to form a sleeve, adding purl loops along the edges.  On average, the canvas is enlarged on each side, adding one loop 12 times in each 4th row. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cardigan lalo description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/975855.jpg"></div>  After knitting to the required height (approximately 45-46 cm), the reduction begins to form: 4 loops once, 3 - 2 times, 1 - 3 times, after which the sleeve fabric will be 3 braids, and the number of loops correspond to 102. Directly knit 10-16 rows (depending on height), then proceed to knit okat: in each 4th row, decrease the 1st loop 8 times, then in each 2nd row - on the 1st loop 15 times, 2 loops - 12 times.  The remaining 30 loops are closed.

    <h2>  Lalo Knit Cardigan: Collar </h2><p>  The model fits with the collar, in which the remaining open hinges of the central braids of the two shelves participate.  They continue to knit to the required length to the center of the back, then close the loops, sew together and sew to the neck.  It remains to carefully sew the parts with a knitted seam. </p><p>  Thus, this interesting model is implemented - Lalo cardigan.  Photos of the original cardigans made by the designer house emphasize the sophistication and simplicity of this designer item. </p>
