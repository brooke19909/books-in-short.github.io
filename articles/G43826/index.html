    <p>  Surely you've heard more than once about the PS3.  But what is it?  The game console Sony PlayStation 3 is one of the representatives of the seventh generation game consoles (the <span>Xbox 360</span> and Wii also belong to this generation).  But do not let the word "gaming" mislead you.  Using this console, the user can, in addition to games, watch movies, surf the Internet, listen to audio tracks, etc.  And this means that the Sony PlayStation 3 game console is a real multimedia center.  In this article, we will take a closer look at this miracle of technology, talk about its features, capabilities, etc. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  As the old proverb says: ‚ÄúThey meet by their clothes ...‚Äù Therefore, we will begin our review with the appearance of the console.  The guys from Sony tried their best.  The console's design is soft and stylish, so staying indifferent to the PS3 is simply impossible.  The console is made in high-tech style, which only once again emphasizes its high-tech. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  PS3 comes in a variety of colors.  There is a white, and black, and even silver version.  Therefore, you can probably find a color that you like.  In addition, there are bundled collector's editions of the PlayStation 3. In them, along with the PS3, you can find the game.  It is noteworthy that in such publications the console design is made in the manner of the game. </p><h2>  Specifications <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Playstation 3 price reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33088/755281.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Now let's move on from the appearance to the "inner world" of our console.  The game console Sony PlayStation 3 has a relatively powerful filling.  The PS3 has a modern eight-thread processor with a power of 3.2 GHz.  In addition, the console uses a graphics processor (video card) RSX, which is sometimes called the "Synthesizer of Reality".  The video chip is capable of operating at a frequency of 550 MHz and at the same time has 256 MB of memory.  Such technical characteristics allow the console to reproduce an excellent picture without any lags and sagging, thus providing a comfortable gameplay. </p><p>  The main optical medium on the PS3 is a Blu-ray drive.  But at the same time, the Sony PlayStation 3 game console is capable of reading DVDs, CDs, and even SACDs. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The game console Sony PlayStation 3 has its own operating system.  You can download <span>updates, drivers</span> , etc. to it without any problems.  The software is very easy to manage.  It is understandable on an intuitive level, and even a small child can figure it out.  All functions are available for operation immediately from the central screen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Game console Sony PlayStation 3 customer reviews" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33088/756440.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The PS3 has a built-in browser, using which you can surf the Internet without getting up off the couch.  In addition, there is a player thanks to which you can watch various films and even listen to music.  PlayStation 3 has its own services.  One of these is the PlayStation Store, where you can purchase games and other multimedia. </p><h2>  Gaming peripherals </h2><p>  The main device for controlling the PS3 is a gamepad called <span>Dualshock 3,</span> which comes with the console.  <span>The joystick is wireless</span> and can charge up to 30 hours without recharging.  He also has a special USB cable, using which, you can connect Dualshock to the console and thus recharge it. </p><p>  The gamepad is the perfect gaming device.  And you understand this during the process.  Acting with the joystick, you fully feel what is happening in the game.  Although, if you play for the first time, you may experience discomfort (especially in shooters).  But in just an hour you get used to it, and the joystick, without exaggeration, becomes part of the gamer himself. </p><p>  In addition to the gamepad, there are other devices for the game.  These include the PlayStation Move.  Using Move, you can control the console using gestures.  This is quite interesting and funny in games such as boxing, bowling, archery, etc.  But for this, in addition to Move, you will need a special camera called the PlayStation Eye, which recognizes gestures.  Unlike the gamepad, the PlayStation Move and Eye are not in the standard kit, so they will have to be purchased separately. </p><h2>  Games <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Game console Sony PlayStation 3" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13387/755659.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Now let's move on to the most "sweet" - games.  Sony PlayStation 3 game console has an extensive base of games.  Over almost 10 years of its existence, more than 600 projects have been launched.  Moreover, games continue to be released to this day.  Despite the fact that a new generation of consoles has already been released, PS3 plan to support at least 5 years. </p><p>  Also, one cannot fail to say about the main reason for buying a PS3 - exclusives.  Heavy Rain, God of War, Gran Turismo 6, Metal Gear Solid, Uncharted, The Last of Us - all this can be played exclusively on Sony Playstation 3 (PS3).  Prices for games bite - and, perhaps, this is the main minus of the console.  But since the PS4 was recently released, the previous generation of consoles fell significantly.  So now is the best time to buy a PS3.  You can learn more about prices further. </p><h2>  PlayStation 3: price, reviews <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony playstation 3 ps3 prices" class="if" height="236" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33088/756438.jpg" width="420"></div></h2><p>  To purchase a PS3, you will have to pay about $ 280 (14,000 rubles).  As for the average cost of games, it varies from 30 to 40 dollars (depending on the project itself). </p><p>  For the CIS countries, the price is quite large.  But it is fair to say that promotions are often held in the PS Store.  Therefore, buying a digital version of the game at a discount price, you can save a lot.  In addition, there is a special <span>PS Plus subscription.</span>  Those who purchased it get new games every month.  PS Plus is a great deal for new users.  With it, you can play most of the exclusives of "PS 3", while paying <span>pennies.</span>  Therefore, if you just purchased a PS3 and you don‚Äôt have a game, the best choice is to purchase a PS Plus subscription. </p><p>  Most of the users are completely satisfied with their prefix.  Basically, they praise PS 3 for their amazing graphics, surround sound, lack of lags, a convenient gamepad, a huge base of exclusives, etc.  However, most users are not satisfied with the high price of games and the console itself. </p><h2>  Relevance </h2><p>  Many potential buyers are interested in the issue of the relevance of "PS 3".  Like, the next generation of consoles has already been released, and "PS 3" is no longer relevant.  This is not true.  Firstly, Sony officially announced that PS 3 will be supported for at least 5 years.  This means that for at least another 5 years games will be released on the model of the old generation.  Do you doubt it?  You can give a historical example.  PlayStation 2 was released in 2000 and was supported until 2013.  Secondly, it makes sense to buy "PS 3" to get acquainted with excellent exclusive games.  According to Sony representatives, they do not intend to port projects from PS 3 to PS 4.  Therefore, in order to play such masterpieces as Uncharted, Heavy Rain, MGS and more, you will have to purchase an ‚Äúold curling iron‚Äù.  Thirdly, not everyone can afford the new PS 4 (especially with the current dollar rate).  The only salvation for such people is the purchase of PS 3.  After all, after the release of a new generation of consoles, the PlayStation 3 has significantly decreased in price.  Therefore, right now is the best time to purchase a third "curling iron". </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  As a result, we can say that "PS 3" is an excellent console that will appeal to any gamer.  Excellent features that allow you to play at maximum settings without lags, a lot of high-quality and exclusive projects, a convenient joystick and much more.  Isn't that what you dreamed about?  By far, the gamer's best friend is the Sony PlayStation 3 game console. Customer reviews confirm this. </p>
