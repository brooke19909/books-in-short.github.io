High demand for housing in Moscow remains in all segments, but in terms of liquidity, it is apartments that occupy the first places.

The answer cannot be unambiguous, since an operation of this level requires taking into account many nuances affecting the format of the transaction, the procedure for executing the contract, the approach to choosing the object itself, etc. </p><h2>  Preparatory analysis </h2>

    <p>  Before signing the necessary documents and making settlements with the owner of the apartment, it is necessary to find out a number of facts, the knowledge of which will make sure that the transaction is clean.  First of all, this is the trustworthiness of the owner: his sanity and competence are the basic basis, in accordance with which the purchase of an apartment is carried out.  Documents in this case can be the following: </p><ul><li>  Gift agreement. </li><li>  Certificate of psycho-emotional state of the owner. </li><li>  Permits (from children, relatives, other owners of real estate). </li><li>  Will. </li></ul><p>  At this stage, it is not so much important to determine the correctness of the direct legal rights to the apartment, but to analyze possible indirect factors that may become a reason for terminating the transaction in the future. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Apartment Check </h2>

    <p>  At this stage of preliminary preparation for the transaction, it is important to assess how clean the property itself is in the legal and technical terms.  It is known that large flows of changing owners in megacities complicate the "biography" of housing.  Therefore, any realtor, explaining how to buy an apartment in Moscow, advises you to carefully check the information about repairs, redevelopments and the condition of communication networks. </p><p>  In addition, documents of title, including certificates from the passport office and BTI, must be checked.  There are cases when the sold apartments are pledged by credit organizations, therefore, a thorough audit of the legal status of real estate will be useful.  The same applies to the technical condition of the object: it is important not only to know how to buy an apartment in Moscow without legal risks, but also to get it in the form in which the seller claims.  Often, serious defects in repair are already discovered during operation, so a comprehensive analysis is a prerequisite for preparing for a transaction. </p><h2>  Unified State Register Check </h2><p>  One of the main sources of reliable information, on the basis of which the buyer can independently verify data on a particular object, is the state register (USRP), which records the rights to real estate and transactions with it.  Inquiries are issued even without informing the owner from whom the purchase of the apartment is planned.  Documents from the Unified State Register are official and contain information about the owner of the apartment.  Also from the extract you can find out the legal grounds on which the seller became the owner of the home. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Clearance transaction </h2>

    <p>  The procedure from the point of view of filling out purchase documents can be divided into two parts: fixing a payment calculation and drawing up a contract.  It is recommended to pay in non-cash format.  In cases where housing is purchased from individuals, the calculations are confirmed by both an act and a receipt, in which all the data on the financial transaction are noted, that is, who, to whom and how much money has been transferred. </p><p>  The second part is perceived by most citizens as the execution of a contract with a notary public.  Unfortunately, this is not a completely correct understanding of how to buy an apartment in Moscow without the risk of legal problems in the future.  In fact, the purchase transaction can be fixed in the usual written form, but it must be assured in the metropolitan Rosreestr.  And then, in addition to the contract, notarial certificates and an extract from the <span>house book are</span> presented <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Resale and new building: features of the purchase </h2>

    <p>  Both options involve certain risks during the execution of the transaction.  If you plan to purchase a secondary housing, then special attention should be paid to the legal history of the object.  The older the house, the higher the likelihood that the property had a large number of owners, so the current status of housing should be analyzed in detail. </p><p>  Not so simple with apartments in new buildings.  Those who want to become the owner of real estate, having drawn up the rights of a participant in <span>shared construction,</span> must initially make sure the reliability of the developer.  The mandatory list of documents that the buyer needs to familiarize with includes a permit for construction, property rights to the site, and a project declaration.  Despite all the disadvantages and risks of cooperation with developers who did not complete the construction at the time of the transaction, buying an apartment in a new building has two significant advantages: the price of such objects is on average 25% lower, and the history of housing operation is completely clear. </p><h2>  Purchase without start-up capital </h2>

    <p>  The first thing people who do not have enough money to think about buying a house to think about is mortgage loans.  Unfortunately, in its pure form there are no loans without down payments today.  Most of the programs are focused on providing in the form of collaterals of existing real estate, but here there are some nuances.  For example, buying an apartment on a mortgage, as a rule, is impossible without a stable income and a clean credit history. </p><p>  In some cases, families may use maternity capital.  Help from state-owned banks is becoming a good and reliable help in improving housing conditions, but even the buyer of the apartment will have to invest up to 15% of the value of the property. </p><p>  An installment can also be an alternative to a mortgage.  Today, this purchase option is more likely to apply to marketers' tools than to banking services, however, on the Moscow real estate market it is quite possible to get a six-month installment plan on the condition of making 50% of the cost.  Of course, buying an apartment on a mortgage involves significantly longer payment periods, but the package of documents for obtaining a loan is more extensive. </p><p>  If we compare programs at interest rates, then installments will be less attractive.  So, if the full payment term is provided for less than 10 years, then the size of the additional investment may exceed 15%.  In the case of a mortgage, interest rates are much more profitable. </p>
