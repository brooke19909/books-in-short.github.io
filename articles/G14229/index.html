    <h2>  Wrist Watch.  Concept and types </h2><p>  Before moving on to the main topic of our conversation, we need to deal with its main <span>theoretical</span> components.  A watch is a small device with a strap showing the current time, as well as some other data related to this category (date, day of the week, stopwatch, etc.). </p><p>  A watch is divided into three types: </p><ol><li>  Mechanical. </li><li>  Quartz. </li><li>  Electronic. </li></ol><p>  Our task is to consider the last view.  A wristwatch is a device in which a clock is used by a generator that converts its <span>periodic oscillations</span> into special signals that repeat after one second, minute or one hour, respectively.  To purchase such a device, you need to know its functional components. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Functional characteristics of electronic watches </h2><p>  Under the functional characteristics understand the combination of mechanisms and parts that determine the operation of the device and ensure its protection.  Electronic watches have the following characteristics: </p><ol><li>  <em>The dial</em> .  The main component in general of any watch.  It shows time and other additional information.  In our case, the dial will always be electronic, may vary in size, color of the displayed numbers. </li><li>  <em>Power source</em>  Simple models use a regular battery, while more advanced models use a battery. </li><li>  <em>Glass</em> .  This component is located on top of the watch and protects its internal parts from mechanical stress.  Glass can be plastic, mineral, sapphire. </li><li>  <em>Shockproof</em> .  This characteristic shows the survivability of the watch with strong or weak shaking of the device. </li><li>  <em>Water resistant</em> .  The parameter shows the degree and quality of the tightness of the device, protects it from penetration into the water and moisture. </li><li>  <em>Additional options</em> .  These include the backlight, alarm clock, stopwatch, heart rate monitor, etc. The more expensive the watch, the more such options. </li></ol><h2>  Price categories </h2><p>  The price of the device determines the quality and availability of additional options.  If you are ready to give an impressive amount, you will get not just a watch, but also a small wrist computer that can show the weather, make calls to friends, and monitor your health.  A vivid example is the well-known <span>Apple Watch</span> or Android Wear. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For the average amount of money you can buy a regular accessory that will be made at a decent level and will not leave any <span>defects</span> upset for its buyer.  But cheap electronic watches, on the contrary, are inexpensive, but require great care in handling, since budget materials can make themselves felt in cases of neglect.  Despite these peculiarities, such devices are very popular in the consumer goods market and are in great demand.  It's time to talk about them. </p><h2>  Cheap electronic watches.  Pros and cons </h2><p>  When it comes to inexpensive goods, there are always doubts and concerns even when thinking about buying.  But do not rush, because these devices have a lot of advantages.  Here is some of them: </p><ol><li>  <em>Saving</em> .  This is the main and <span>undeniable</span> plus - in any case, the buyer gives a little money and thereby does not particularly reduce his budget. </li><li>  <em>Rationality</em> .  Often, electronics manufacturers complement their devices with the latest technological innovations, which not everyone needs.  For example, a person is unlikely to need the option of measuring his heart rate if he only needs to find out the time and set the alarm. </li><li>  <em>Efficiency</em>  This concept should be attributed not so much to the watch as to the purchase itself.  For a small price you can buy a good accessory that can satisfy the basic needs of the buyer. </li></ol><p>  It‚Äôs probably not worth talking about the minuses, since it is quite clear that any cheap product has minimal or incomplete functionality, as well as an increased likelihood of an early failure. </p>

    <p>  Having the necessary knowledge, we can begin to consider the most <span>popular</span> inexpensive models.  As a rule, this is a cheap Chinese electronic watch. </p><h2>  Yazole </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The watches of this Chinese company cost about 300 rubles.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">At the same time, the manufacturer was able to maximally serve its customer.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Here you can find the full calendar, stopwatch, chronograph, auto date.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The display is made using LEDs that enhance image quality.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">In addition, this watch still has good shock resistance and water resistance.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The sporty design, although unusual, is well suited for both children and adults.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">This is a good solution for those who do not want to spend a lot of money, but at the same time want to get something original and functional.</span> </p><h2>  Xonix </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">This is also a Chinese manufacturer.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">He makes watches more expensive, so their price varies around 1800 rubles.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">If you look at the picture, you can immediately notice their stylish design.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">They have a round dial, a <span data-mce-mark="1">metal</span> case, a smooth rubber strap.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">In terms of functionality, the Xonix watch is slightly higher than its previous competitor, since it has a diving mode and is able to respond to changes in the time zone.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">This model is well suited for those who are looking for a more familiar and versatile watch appearance (the previous device does not meet such requirements).</span> </p>

But, unfortunately, these devices do not have advanced features.  They cost only the display of time, date, a brief calendar, stopwatch, backlight and alarm clock.  Nothing else can be found here, which is offset by a long service life. </p>

    <h2>  What to choose? </h2><p>  Of course, the choice always depends on the possibilities and preferences.  If there is a good amount of money and you want to buy a multifunctional device, then you should resort to expensive models.  But there are people who need only a watch and nothing more.  In this case, you should look at the Belarusian watch.  If you want something more, it is best to take one of the Chinese models or a <span>cheap electronic watch on hand from Casio.</span> </p>
