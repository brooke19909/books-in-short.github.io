    <h2></h2><h2></h2><h2>  Leather </h2><p>  There is a pretty simple way to make a new bag out of an old bag.  It just needs to be painted.  This is especially true for leather things that very quickly lose their attractive appearance.  To do this, just buy a special paint in the store and carefully, according to the instructions, paint the product.  The bag will shine in a new color, and again will look like brand new. </p><h2>  Transformation Steps 1. Cleaning </h2><p>  It is worth noting that creating a new bag from old bags is not so fast.  In order to transform the product, you will need to go through several stages.  So, the first is a complete and thorough cleaning of the product.  If the bag is made of leather or a substitute, then it must first be wiped with a damp cloth to remove dust.  You can then rinse with a mild soapy solution.  If there are greasy spots on the bag, you can remove them with chalk.  To do this, it is necessary to grind, densely sprinkle the stain and leave it in this form for a day.  To give the bag shine, you can lubricate it with a cotton swab dipped in glycerin.  If the <span>bag is varnished,</span> all of the above methods for its transformation will not work.  Such a product can only be wiped thoroughly with a damp cloth.  As for suede, it can be cleaned with an ordinary shoe brush with a short bristle, the spools can be carefully cut with a clerical knife.  To give it a new look, you can wipe such a product with a cotton pad soaked in a solution of ammonia and water (1: 4 ratio). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2></h2><h2>  Transformation Step 2. Replacing the Lining </h2><p>  A new <span>bag from an old bag</span> can only be obtained after replacing the lining.  To transform your pet in this way, it is enough to carefully cut off the old lining, leaving a small allowance for stitching, about 1-1.5 cm. Now, following the example of the old one, you need to cut out the new inside of the bag.  It can consist of two parts, when the fabric just sews along the sides, but you can also make the bag bottom and sides.  To do this, you will need to carve out a little more detail.  It is also good to provide several small pockets, they are very useful for storing various little things.  When the lining is completely ready, you need to remember to wrap the edges that will be sewn.  Now the product is attached to its bag.  To do this, you need to sew the lining with a <span>blind stitch</span> to the left fabric.  Everything, the inside of the bag is replaced! </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="from the old bag to the new" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/346704.jpg?1393852141544" width="400"></div></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2>  Transformation Stage 3. Update </h2><p>  How else can a <span>bag</span> change <span>?</span>  Old handles also need to be removed <span>from old bags</span> .  After all, they wear out first.  To do this, you can come up with something original, for example, make a pen from a wire beautifully entwined with a cord.  It can also be a rope thread, a self-woven handle made of strips of fabric, etc.  If the bag is classic, you just need to sew a new handle from leather or dermantine.  This is not difficult to do, because you will need a strip of leather or a substitute that folds in half, tucks at the ends along the entire length and stitches.  Next, the finished handle is inserted into the old accessories - everything is ready! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Transformation Stage 4. Decoration </h2><p>  How can a new bag come out of old bags?  It can simply be re-decorated.  Rhinestones, beads, various beads, new accessories: chains, brooches, old beads, buttons are perfect for this.  However, it is worth remembering that it is better not to overdo it when decorating your product, because everything is good in moderation. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bag from an old leather jacket" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/346706.jpg?1393852162911" width="600"></div></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2>  Alteration 1. Bag Butterfly </h2><p>  What to make from an old bag?  Of course, a new bag!  To do this, you need only imagination and some auxiliary tools.  So, for example, you can make a beautiful clutch from an old rather voluminous handbag.  To do this, you must first go through the first stage of the transformation described above, then you will need to get rid of the lining.  Now the creative process begins.  You can try to make a butterfly bag.  To do this, use a sewing machine to put a vertical line from the center of the bag down, so do it on both sides.  However, you need to refuel not a thread, but a special thin elastic band that, after all the manipulations, will just fold nicely and you get a bag-like bag for yourself.  It is worth noting that the elastic can be either the color corresponding to the bag, or completely contrasting, which will create the effect of decorating the product.  The field of this is hemmed with a lining cut out on the structure of an already new bag.  It remains only to decorate your beauty at will. </p><h2>  Alteration 2. Quilted bag </h2>

    <p>  Another way how a new bag from old bags may appear.  To do this, you need to completely cut the old product into pieces and think about what you want to see in the end.  Now I want to tell you how to make a fashionable quilted bag today.  To do this, you need to cut out the details of the new bag from the old pieces - front and back side.  It is important to remember that you need to leave allowances for seams, about a centimeter and a half.  If the bag will be voluminous, and not just a trolley, you must also cut out the sides and the bottom of the product.  Now you need to make the front and back quilted.  To do this, a tracing paper is used, which is neatly tucked at the very edges of the product (it is important to remember that marks remain on the skin and the substitute from the needle, so that marking is strictly forbidden on the front side) and stripes are marked along which the line will be sewn.  Then everything is sewn on a typewriter.  You should get such a <span>chessboard</span> (classic or in the form of rhombuses).  Now the tracing paper is removed.  Next, you need to sew all the details of the product: the bottom, sides and main sides.  It is also important to tuck a little fabric on top so that the zipper does not go along the top of the bag.  Lightning, a lining are sewn in, pens are attached (accessories can be bought at any store for needlework and creativity).  The new bag is ready! </p><h2>  Alteration 3. Bag from the jacket </h2><p>  A bag can also be made from an old <span>leather jacket.</span>  Here, in general, everything is simple to do, because it is much more difficult to remake the product than to do it again.  It is necessary to cut out all the whole pieces of the old jacket and after that determine the size of the new handbag.  After all, old jacket seams on the face of a new product will not look very beautiful.  So, at least two identical pieces of material should come out, from which already at this stage you can make a bag-bag.  It will be quite simple to sew the skin along the three sides of the product, sew the appropriate lining, attach handles (both from the same skin and contrasting ones - from fabric or even a rope).  You can also sew in a zipper.  Everything, a simple and easy-to-use handbag, is ready! </p>
