    <h2>  Protaras Hotels </h2><p>  The resort welcomes tourists with a large number of modern hotels.  Here you can stay in hotels of different categories and classes.  There are both luxury hotels on the coast, and modest "treshki" away from the sea.  Basically, all apartment hotels are located on the first coastline.  Despite the fact that most pensions are located along the seashore, they do not "stand on one another", as in the famous resorts of Turkey.  Hotels are isolated from each other, a certain seclusion adds to the indented coast.  Hotels are located in the so-called mini-coves, and Antigoni Hotel 3 is no exception. </p><p>  The best hotels can be found in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãFig Bay, it got its name because of the huge number of fig trees that grew nearby.  But the center of Protaras is by no means worse than the coast, many cozy hotels are located there, an example of such a hotel is Antigoni 3. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews and recommendations of tourists </h2><p>  Going on any trip, you need to be prepared.  To make your plans come true and dreams come true, you must read the reviews and impressions of other tourists. </p><p>  Antigoni 3 <span>(Cyprus) reviews</span> are positive.  Most vacationers like the local atmosphere of friendliness and cordiality.  The hotel staff is cheerful, open and always ready to help.  What is important for Russian tourists, many hotel staff speak excellent Russian, despite the fact that Europeans mostly relax there.  On average, there are not many of our compatriots in Antigoni 3 - 20-25% of the total number of vacationers. </p><p>  All guests who have returned from vacation, note the excellent location of the hotel.  It was very convenient for many to get to the sea (only 200 meters), and to the city.  The proximity of the shops and restaurants of Protaras cannot but rejoice.  Hotel Antigoni 3 (reviews of tourists indicate this) is an excellent option for its category.  There is also a bus stop just a 10-minute walk from where you can reach Ayia Napa.  For just 1 euro you can drive to the bustling resort. </p>

    <p>  Tourists who traveled with children write that the hotel is very calm, there is everything necessary for the children.  Many are delighted with the infrastructure of the hotel, the kids club and the playground.  Some noticed an unusual children's menu. </p><p>  As for nutrition, the majority of holidaymakers were quite satisfied with the variety and quantity of dishes.  Many tourists were delighted with buns, muffins and puff pastries of local production.  According to the guests, when the hotel‚Äôs menu was annoying, and it was very rare, nearby restaurants came to the rescue.  In addition, the hotel always tried to surprise its guests, very often interesting culinary shows were held, where anyone could participate, as well as thematic dishes were prepared.  For example, one day - Greek cuisine, the other - Italian, etc.  Agree that this is very good for a three star hotel. </p><p>  Reviewers were satisfied with the city and local entertainment venues.  There are a lot of souvenir shops and shops in Protaras.  There you can buy a variety of souvenirs, gifts and all kinds of trinkets.  Nearby is a supermarket where tourists buy locally produced goods. </p><p>  As for the hotel service, there are no serious complaints about the work of the staff.  Minor flaws did not affect the impression of rest. </p>

    <p>  Despite the small territory of the hotel, there was enough space and sun loungers near the pool.  For some, the pool turned out to be small, then the sea came to the rescue nearby.  According to the reviews left by the guests, we can conclude that this is far from the most important thing.  Most tourists disappeared on the sea or on excursions, which the hotel offers a lot.  Some traveled on their own, especially since all the most interesting of the hotel is nearby - a fountain show, a church, etc. </p><p>  According to tourists, the three stars in Protaras (Antigoni 3) cannot be compared with the same category of hotels in Turkey.  The hotel boasts high quality services, varied food and an interesting entertainment program.  Russian tourists put this hotel a solid four.  Many of them would return here again, especially since the attitude towards our compatriots is special - Russian-speaking staff (which you do not often find in European countries), Russian channels, etc. </p>
