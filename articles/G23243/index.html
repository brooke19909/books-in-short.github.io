  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A brief history of the development of electric lighting</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the development of electric lighting dates back to 1870, when an incandescent lamp was invented, which gave light with the help of electric current.  The history of the development of electric current began much earlier, when the experiments of the famous scientist Volta ended with the creation of an <span>alkaline battery.</span>  And the very first lighting devices that operated on electric current were created at the beginning of the 19th century.  They tried to use them for street lighting, but they were too expensive and uncomfortable. </p><p>  The coup was made by an engineer from Russia <span>Pavel Yablochkov,</span> who on December 12, 1876 opened the ‚Äúelectric candle‚Äù, which with the help of electricity became a convenient source for lighting.  An important refinement in the incandescent lamp created by Yablochkov was invented by the famous American <span>Thomas Edison.</span>  He placed the device in a vacuum shell, which protected the contacts with the <span>electric arc</span> from oxidation, so his lamp could give light for quite a long time.  With its help, the history of the development of electric lighting received a new powerful impetus.  On October 21, 1879, he turned on the first light bulb, which was able to burn for two days. </p><p>  With the light hand of Thomas Edison, the light bulb became a commercial product and became widespread already at the beginning of the 20th century.  In the future, the history of the development of electric lighting has already begun to move forward thanks to the vigorous activity of scientists and inventors, since each new invention symbolized a new round in the development of the lighting industry. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1901, Cooper Hewitt demonstrated a low-pressure mercury lamp. </p><p>  In 1905, the first lighting lamp with a tungsten spiral was made in Auer's workshop. </p><p>  In 1906, the scientist Kuh invented a high-pressure mercury lamp. </p><p>  In 1910, an important key breakthrough was made in opening the halogen cycle. </p><p>  In 1913, the inventor Langier demonstrated to the public a gas-filled lamp, which later received his name. </p><p>  In 1931, the scientist Pirani made <span>a</span> low-pressure <span>sodium lamp</span> . </p><p>  In 1946, Mr. Schulz hit everyone with a xenon lamp. </p><p>  In 1958, halogen incandescent lamps were born. </p><p>  In 1962, the first LED with a red emission spectrum was created. </p><p>  In 1982, the world saw low-voltage halogen lamps. </p><p>  In 1983, compact fluorescent lamps were invented. </p><p>  In these dates, the history of the development of electric lighting is shown not only in the form of advanced scientific achievements, but also in the form of inventions embodied in the final products of mass consumption.  In modern times, the mass production of a wide variety of electrical light sources, including LEDs, which have received final recognition in history, is already well-established.  Their advantages are a huge <span>service life,</span> high luminous intensity, tiny sizes and practically inexhaustible potential for energy conservation.  However, so far only the history of the development of electronics can boast of the widespread use of LEDs. </p><p>  LED technology in electric lighting in the near future should finally win its rightful place.  The future is seen in the competition for dominance between LED and fluorescent light sources.  The fluorescent lamp, which today is the most popular source of light, owes its position to the respected Soviet scientist S.I. Vavilov, who gave a powerful impetus to the development of such lighting and created the foundation of lighting science.  It was under his leadership that a phosphor was developed that transformed the ultraviolet radiation spectrum into a spectrum that is clearly visible to the human eye.  A good future also awaits a xenon lamp. </p>
