Why?  Because their manufacture requires much less time than knitting, and to learn how to knit with this device is much easier.  Someone will say that things made with a hook do not have the same softness and elasticity as with knitted items.  But this is not so.  It all depends on the method of knitting, the chosen yarn and the craftsmanship of the needlewoman.  Let's look at several options with which crocheting <span>blouses</span> for newborns will turn into a fascinating activity for you, and the result will meet the highest requirements for children's clothing.  Where to start?  Best if this is the easiest option.  But do not be discouraged, simple - does not mean ugly.  Below is a detailed description of the model for a boy who looks very gentle, stylish and original. </p><h2>  Crocheted blouse for a newborn baby boy </h2>

    <p>  This sweater is a universal model.  It is enough to change the blue color to pink, and it will easily turn into clothes for the little princess. </p><p>  Despite the fact that <span>this jumper</span> looks very elegant, even a beginner needlewoman can knit such a one.  The basic knitting pattern is double crochet, the neckline and bottom edge of the product are crochet.  The application on the sweater can be any.  In this case, it is the crown. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you want to knit such a sweater for very young children, then you can make an additional clasp on the shoulder or on the back.  This will facilitate the process of dressing the child.  Jackets, crocheted for newborns made in accordance with all the rules, must first of all meet the requirements of convenience and comfort. </p><h2>  Operating procedure </h2><p>  In this example, the sweater is designed for ages 7-9 months.  We begin to <span>knit a sweater</span> from the back (from the bottom of it).  To do this, you need to tie a chain of 30-40 loops and continue knitting with double crochet.  Having reached the neckline, we leave 15 middle columns untied and continue knitting each shoulder separately.  For a smooth outline of the neck in each front row, we do not knit one extreme column.  We do this until the desired shoulder width is reached. </p><p>  Similar to the back we knit a shelf, only the neckline will be deeper.  Having finished with a back and a shelf, we pass to knitting of sleeves.  Since we did not make a cutout for the armhole on the shelf and back, knitting a sleeve will not be difficult.  We will get a model with a half-sleeve. </p><p>  Knitting of the sleeve begins with the cuff, also with double crochet.  To do this, we knit a chain of 10-13 air loops.  After 2 cm, it is necessary to make an increase on both sides of the canvas.  To do this, in one loop we knit <span>two double crochet.</span>  Before the end of the sleeve, additions must be made several more times in each 3rd row.  The second sleeve is knitted similarly to the first. </p><p>  Such a blouse with a crochet for newborns can be made even by a mother who first took a hook in her hands.  They will be an indispensable thing in the wardrobe of a baby. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Assembly and decoration </h2><p>  We put the finished shelf and back face to face and perform shoulder seams.  Then sew the sleeves.  And only then we sew the sweater on the sides.  The last step will be the seams on the sleeves. </p><p>  Now you can proceed to the finish.  For her we will use knitting with crochets.  We knit the bottom of the sweater, neck and cuffs in a circle with 3 rows of single crochet.  In the photo, the binding is made in blue, but you can use any to your liking.  A <span>knitted crown was</span> used as an application on the chest <span>.</span>  If you are still not very good at knitting, then you can use ready-made thermal stickers.  This decor looks very impressive. </p><p>  If you crochet this model of a blouse for newborns, then most likely you will often hear the rave reviews of others that you will agree, it is very nice. </p><h2>  Universal version of a blouse for the baby </h2><p>  Now we will consider how one more variant of a blouse is carried out, which fits quite simply and is suitable even for beginners.  For it, you will need 1 skein of yarn (this is for a child up to 7 months), for an older age, 2 skeins of yarn will be needed.  In the first photo you can see what the future blouse looks like before the side seams are fastened, and in the next one there is already an assembled option. </p>

    <p>  As in the previous case, knitting starts from the back.  The decorative strip on the lower edge of the product in this case is performed immediately.  It can be any openwork pattern to your taste.  Further knitting continues with crochet.  In the same way as in the previous version, the neck is tied.  Cutouts for armholes are also not made.  In this model, there is no need to perform shoulder seams, since a fastener is provided at this place.  In the photo she is clearly visible, she is turquoise. </p><p>  Sleeves are knitted after the back and the shelf are ready and fastened together.  For them, along the edge of the product, in the place where the sleeve should be located, a number of columns without a crochet are knitted.  Further, in the 3rd, 5th and 8th rows, you need to make reductions, leaving the extreme columns untied. </p><p>  The next step involves the implementation of side seams and seams on the sleeves.  The following photo shows the already assembled and trimmed blouse crocheted for a newborn knitted by a loving mother.  The execution scheme, as you already understood, is slightly different from the previous one, but it is also very simple to manufacture. </p>

    <p>  The back is knitted in the usual way, but the shelf consists of two parts made in mirror image.  Knitting sleeves is also not unusual.  Do not forget that when making side seams, you must leave a hole for the ties. </p><h2>  Blouse for the princess <strong></strong></h2><p>  The next option is for little princesses.  Such a crocheted blouse for a newborn girl will be very soft, delicate and elegant.  In whatever color you make it, it will look great. </p>

And it is not necessary to use thin threads for knitting.  Even made of a rather thick yarn, such a crocheted blouse for a newborn (knitting scheme is given below) looks gentle and elegant.

    <p>  The knitting pattern is quite simple.  The sleeve in this model runs from top to bottom.  For him, we knit a chain of 10 air loops and continue knitting with crochets.  Having tied half of the sleeve, we proceed to the openwork pattern.  To do this, in the first row of lace, we knit three double crochet, then a ring of 3 stitches, then again three double crochets.  In the second row, in a ring of air loops we knit 3 double crochets.  In each subsequent increase the number of double crochet columns by 1. And in the spaces between the columns we make air loops.  Thus, the sleeve will acquire the desired shape.  Having knitted the desired length, we finish knitting with crochets.  The back and shelf follow the pattern of the sleeve.  The lower curly edge is obtained as a result of using an openwork pattern and tying using the pico technique.  To do this, you need to knit a chain of 5 stitches in the last row through an equal number of single crochet stitches and fasten it to the same stitch. </p>
