    <h2>  Cost of living at the Dayi Diamond Hotel </h2><p>  As already mentioned, this hotel is positioning itself as an economical option for a great holiday in Turkey.  Indeed, the price of accommodation in it will pleasantly surprise you.  So, for a seven-day stay in a double room you will need to pay about 20 thousand rubles.  This price fully includes food and some drinks. </p><h2>  Dayi Diamond Hotel 3 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  For many people, when planning a vacation, it is important to clearly understand what awaits them at the chosen hotel.  Therefore, we bring to your attention several generalized reviews of tourists who stayed at Dayi Diamond. </p><p>  In general, most travelers think the hotel is well worth the money.  So, very many appreciated the location of the beach - across the road, literally 150 meters from the hotel.  Everyone liked the sand on the beach and the gentle entrance to the sea.  This was especially welcomed by tourists who came to rest with young children. </p><p>  Another indisputable advantage of the hotel is its friendly and helpful staff who are trying to quickly solve problems.  Some employees speak excellent Russian. </p><p>  As for food, here the opinions of tourists are divided.  So, some vacationers believe that the food was quite acceptable for a three-star hotel: a fairly varied menu, all fresh, delicious pastries.  The other part of the tourists was not satisfied.  In their opinion, the choice of dishes could be diversified a little more.  Also, many did not like that only watermelon was offered from fruits.  Vacationers bought everything else at the nearest supermarket. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dayi diamond hotel mahmutlar 3" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/469848.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Some were a little disappointed with their hotel rooms.  According to them, furniture and sanitary ware are far from new, and sometimes something works poorly.  Others are sure that for the level of a three-star hotel everything is quite tolerable. </p><p>  The largest number of negative reviews concerned housekeeping.  Many guests were surprised that upon booking the hotel they were provided with information on daily room cleaning and regular linen changes.  In fact, it turned out that if you want your room to be tidied up, you must inform the reception in advance. </p><p>  The local animation made a good impression on holidaymakers.  So, the smallest guests of the hotel danced with pleasure at the children's disco.  Adult guests enjoyed the show program designed for them.  There were various funny contests, and belly dancing, and a fire show, etc. </p><p>  All tourists, without exception, appreciated the location of the Dayi Diamond Hotel.  After all, it is located in the center of the village, close to a variety of shops.  Also, near the hotel, a market unfolds twice a week, where you can buy fruits, vegetables and various sweets, as well as clothes and various souvenirs. </p>
