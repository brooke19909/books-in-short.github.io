The advantages of most hook techniques are the ability to change the direction of knitting, the presence of only one loop, as well as the specifics of the fabric itself. </p><p>  When crocheting, the fabric in most cases is slightly stiffer than when working with knitting needles.  It does not collapse into a tube, does not shrink and does not deform so much, so during crocheting flat parts they can be applied to the pattern and add / reduce, focusing on the drawn contours. </p><h2>  Children's dresses and their specifics </h2><p>  Many girls become interested in crocheting when they become moms.  Children's things are very small and from start to finish they can be made literally in the evening.  In addition, children's proportions are significantly different from adults and when knitting clothes, you do not need to rack your brains on how to tighten the product or make a round of the sleeve of the correct shape. </p>

    <p>  In this article, we will talk about how to crochet a yoke for a children's dress.  A coquette is the upper part of clothes (dresses, sweaters, sweaters), which has a different color, style of performance or in any other way is separated from the rest of the product.  There are several types of coquette: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Round. </li><li>  Quadrangular (or square). </li><li>  Tied in a flat cloth. </li><li>  Consisting of individual fragments. </li></ul><h2>  <span>Crochet</span> for a <span>children's</span> <span>dress:</span> knitting in a circle </h2><p>  Such a coquette looks the most festive.  Her knitting is not difficult, especially if there is a suitable pattern and the craftswoman has the skills of circular knitting.  However, it often happens that the <span>crochet</span> pattern of a children's <span>dress crocheted</span> does not fit with the chosen yarn, the number of rows indicated is not enough or the craftswoman simply does not like the proposed pattern.  In this case, you have to connect a fantasy and start experiments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet crochet basics for baby dresses crochet" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1156857.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <p>  A crochet for a children's dress, crocheted in a circle, can be based on the pattern of any circular napkin.  Just need to take into account several points: </p><ul><li>  A small sample should be tied to calculate the number of loops per 10 cm of canvas. </li><li>  The first row of coquette will be a row of napkins, which are 6‚Äì9 cm distant from the center.  The diameter of the finished neck then will be 12-18 cm, depending on the age of the child and the model of the dress. </li><li>  Do not choose wipes with too large patterns, as there will not be enough rows on the children's yoke for its embodiment, and in unfinished form it will look ‚Äúcropped‚Äù. </li></ul><p>  The diagram below shows a very successful coquette. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="circular yoke diagram" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1156855.jpg" width="600"></div>  It contains enough rows for knitting even with a thin thread, and if desired, you can continue the expansion or interrupt knitting in any row.  If necessary, you can tighten the neck by threading the lace in the indicated places.  Also on one of the sides are button loops.  If you plan to knit a solid, one-piece coquette, then the first row must be closed in a ring and then knitted in a circle.

The figures below show a knitting pattern for a quadrangular coquette for children's dresses (crochet) and a finished dress with such an element. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet pattern of a children's dress crochet" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1156856.jpg" width="239"></div>

    <p>  Concepts such as square and quadrangular coquettes should not be confused.  The first fits very simply: the canvas is divided into four parts (four corners) and loops are added, forming right angles.  An angle of 90 degrees is formed by knitting three loops from one loop of the previous row.  The resulting fabric is perfectly flat, but its significant disadvantage is protruding shoulders. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet for baby dress crocheted" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1156861.jpg" width="333"></div>  The layout of the quadrangular coquette has a slightly different principle of expansion: four acute angles are formed, about 60 degrees each.  In this case, the resulting part is more consistent with the anatomical structure of the human body.

    <p>  By the way, for the same reason, the round yoke pattern in the previous paragraph does not represent an ideal circle. </p><h2>  Straight coquette: solid web </h2><p>  If you want to save time and effort as much as possible, you can use the simplest way to knit a children's coquette: tie it evenly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheting a yoke of a children's dress" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1156858.jpg" width="273"></div>  For reference, you can draw a pattern or simply calculate the required number of loops.  Crocheting a coquette of a children's dress is possible by compiling separately connected fragments into one fabric.  It will also need a pattern.

    <h2>  How to fit coquette for dresses </h2><p>  Some coquette knit as an independent product, which is then sewn to the details of the dress.  This primarily applies to sleeveless dresses or holiday dresses. </p><p>  The coquettes connected together with the rest of the fabric can also be used for summer models, although they are more often used for knitting dresses with sleeves.  A crochet yoke for a children's dress, crocheted according to this method, allows you to very naturally fit the sleeves into the cut of the dress, avoiding the need to knit the sash and sew it.  Externally, dresses with flirts look as if they were connected according to the raglan method (in fact, this is it). </p><h2>  Methods of connecting yoke to the product </h2><p>  The crochets described above for children's dresses can be crocheted in two ways: </p><ol><li>  Top down. </li><li>  On the contrary - from the bottom up. </li></ol><p>  The first method is used more often.  Its specificity is that you can start knitting with a small chain of air loops and by the method of expanding the fabric go to the subsequent knitting of the parts of the front, back and sleeves.  To do this, the yoke, knitted to the required size, is divided into four canvases and the knitting of each of them continues.  Quite often, the front and back are knitted together with one fabric, connecting them using a circular row. </p><p>  To continue manufacturing <span>dresses with a yoke,</span> connected from below, all finished parts (front, back and sleeves) are connected in series using a circular row.  Then continue knitting coquette, observing the principle of contraction of loops.  To do this, you can even use the same schemes, most importantly, save the number of cutting loops in each row (because they are added to the schemes). </p><p>  The described basics of crocheting crochets for children's dresses with crochet can serve as an aid for the manufacture of dresses of any model: from a warm winter product to an airy elegant dress. </p>
