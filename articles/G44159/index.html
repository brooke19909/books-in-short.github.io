  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mixing console: overview, features, purpose, selection</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A mixing console is an electronic device for working with audio signals: summing, controlling, processing, correcting and converting several <span>audio sources</span> into one.  More modern models are equipped with equalizers, filters and <span>effect processors.</span>  They surprise with their versatility and compactness, the ability to control through a computer.  At the same time, it is possible to save all the settings for the compositions, which undoubtedly makes the remote control an indispensable tool for sound engineers.  The remote control is the main component of concert sound, removing noise and tuning incoming signals. </p><h2>  Application </h2><p>  Depending on the areas of use, mixing consoles are divided into several main types: </p><ul><li>  Studio </li><li>  concert </li><li>  broadcasting; </li><li>  DJ </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.istockphoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="For sound engineers" class="if uuid-2804849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2804849.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, this classification is very conditional, since there are varieties of such devices used exclusively for musical accompaniment and vocals (for example, for karaoke parties) or simple and inexpensive remote control switches for home use. </p><h2>  Varieties and types </h2><p>  There are digital mixing consoles and analog.  Each of these species has both supporters and opponents, since both options have obvious advantages and disadvantages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, analog signal processing is considered more preferable by professionals, since in digital models signal processing is carried out in two ways - to digital and vice versa, and this definitely affects the quality of the processed sound. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.istockphoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="For concert venues" class="if uuid-2804863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2804863.jpg"></div><p>  Also mixing consoles come with built-in and separate power amplifiers.  A remote control without a power amplifier has such significant disadvantages as cumbersomeness and the need to pull cables to the <span>speaker system,</span> which is not always convenient.  The advantage of remotes with built-in amplifiers in their mobility and operational work. </p><h2>  Choose </h2><p>  Before you connect a mixing console, you must also know that they differ in the number of outputs and inputs.  Studio and concert mixing consoles for professionals usually have more than 6 Aux buses, at least 32 inputs, at the inputs there is a powerful equalizer and 4 or more subgroups.  In addition, they feature long-stroke and high-precision faders.  And compact mixers have more meager equalizers, a small number of channels and often lack faders. </p><p>  According to the type of power, the mixing consoles are divided into active and passive.  The former are equipped with built-in preamps, which makes it possible to work even with a weak signal, amplifying it to the required level, while the latter consists of elements that do not require power sources for operation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Below is an overview of mixing consoles from different manufacturers with their characteristics and purpose. </p><h2>  Behringer XENYX Q802USB </h2><p>  This model of an inexpensive and portable remote control belongs to the class of universal.  At the same time, if you connect it to a computer, the mixer will allow you to work at a professional level.  According to the description of the Q802USB mixing console, it is clear that this is one of the most compact models not only in the Behringer line, but in general among similar devices in the audio market. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Equalizers and channels" class="if uuid-2804811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2804811.jpg"></div><p>  It is equipped with only six channels, 2 of them are monaural and 2 are stereo.  This, of course, is not enough to summarize the sound at large events, but it is quite enough for small holidays, such as a corporate party.  Also, 6 channels are enough for sound recording, and the ability to directly connect to a PC allows you to flexibly manipulate the signal at the software level. </p><h2>  Characteristics of the mixing console Q802USB </h2><p>  Despite its small size and simplicity, this device provides the owner with very extensive possibilities for controlling sound: </p><ul><li>  remote control with ultra low noise level; </li><li>  2 microphone preamps XENYX; </li><li>  for external FX devices - FX send through the channel; </li><li>  Neoclassical ‚ÄúBritish‚Äù three-band equalizer for musical and warm sound; </li><li>  built-in stereo USB / audio interface for direct connection to a computer; </li><li>  extremely robust construction and high-quality components guarantee durability; </li><li>  1 stereo aux return as a separate stereo input or for FX applications; </li><li>  main mix output with separate controls; </li><li>  CD / tape inputs; </li><li>  weight - 1.2 kg. </li></ul><h2>  Ergonomic design </h2><p>  Soundcraft's Ui12 is a digital mixing console.
