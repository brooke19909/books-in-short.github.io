Especially in order to deal with it, people buy special clothes, shoes, accessories.  Some even look for phones and multimedia players that make sports jogging more enjoyable and comfortable.  And there are many such examples.  It even got to the point that there is a special fitness bracelet that allows you to check how many physical exercises a person has performed and how many calories he has spent. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Parish </h2><p>  In general, these bracelets at the time became very popular, having won a huge number of fans.  However, due to the rarity (and, probably, for the marketing effect), these gadgets were not so cheap - about $ 100-150 per copy.  Although this is a relatively low cost relative to other gadgets, not everyone can afford to buy such a ‚Äútoy‚Äù.  Especially when you consider the inhabitants of the countries of the "third world".  But what about those who also want to keep track of their calories? </p><p>  The way out was proposed by the innovative Chinese gadget company Xiaomi.  She launched her Xiaomi Mi Band fitness tracker at a revolutionary price of $ 25.  This move has undoubtedly become a landmark for the market of trackers - and the company went through massive sales around the world.  It even got to the point that the bracelet was redeemed before its new lots end up in the store.  And all this due to the high quality and low price of new items. </p><h2>  Concept </h2><p>  In fact, the whole concept of the model is just based on the availability and wide functionality of the device.  After all, the Xiaomi Mi Band (a review will prove this) can not only track the number of steps a person has taken per day.  In fact, we have a multi-purpose assistant who also ‚Äúwatches‚Äù your mobile - synchronizing with it, receives alerts and signals about them;  allows you to wake you up in the morning with the help of vibration imperceptible to others;  monitors the quality and duration of sleep based on the movements of your hand.  All this can be a small device that fits easily on your wrist and costs $ 25! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Moreover, do not forget about the classic approach of Xiaomi, expressed in products like the Mi4 smartphone or the Mi Pad tablet - to make beautiful and high-quality devices that people will like.  The same principle is 100% preserved in the fitness tracker, as evidenced by the design of the device.  About him - hereinafter. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  It would seem, how can you surprise a user with a bracelet?  What should be present in the ergonomics of the device so that it ‚Äúhooks‚Äù, makes working with it pleasant and comfortable? </p>

    <p>  Having developed the Xiaomi Mi Band fitness tracker, the manufacturing company resorted to several interesting solutions, making it really interesting in every sense.  The ‚Äúmind‚Äù of the bracelet is placed in a special metal core with protection, which we will discuss in more detail later.  This ‚Äúelectronic brain‚Äù is attached to a special strap made of a material that is especially resistant to mechanical damage.  Of course, it is adapted for prolonged wear and has additional protection against sudden disclosure due to a special locking mechanism. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The strap can be changed if you want your Xiaomi Mi Band fitness tracker to look different - there are several color combinations on sale. </p><h2>  Assembly and kit </h2><p>  When buying a device, you get it in a Xiaomi branded box.  If you already had a product from this company, then you know that the box is made of simple cardboard with the emblem of the developer in the form of two letters - Mi. </p><p>  Opening the package, you will find the core, strap, charging cord and instructions.  Of course, the recharge cable is also suitable for connecting to a PC to track information from the tracker, set settings and reset data.  At one end, the cord has a USB output, while at the other there is a connector for connecting the core by placing it inside a special slot.  In order to understand what is at stake, we recommend that you look at the photo. </p>

    <p>  There are no problems in starting work with the gadget immediately after opening the box.  As the reviews describing the Xiaomi Mi Band fitness tracker show, in some cases the model is discharged - so you need to put it on recharge.  More on how the gadget consumes energy is also a little further. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The ‚Äúmind‚Äù of the bracelet is controlled using special software installed on your PC, as well as a smartphone or tablet.  In the last two cases, it can be a mobile application on Android or iOS, through which the connection and further synchronization of the device will go through.  In general, the interaction of gadgets is possible thanks to Bluetooth technology. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The software has a convenient interface, which even a child can figure out.  Here everything is arranged in the form of tabs that perform different tasks.  Firstly, here you should indicate your physiological data - your gender, height, weight, etc. - so the bracelet will be able to more accurately calculate your needs and characteristics during physical exertion.  Secondly, in the specified application you can see detailed statistics.  It will show the number of steps you have taken and the distance you have traveled in a day.  This means that a person using the Xiaomi Mi Band fitness tracker can set his own goals and ‚Äúminimums‚Äù for physical labor.  The gadget will ‚Äúmake sure‚Äù that you carry out your tasks every day. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The energy source for a small metal box (the so-called ‚Äúcore‚Äù of the bracelet) is a miniature battery installed inside.  It will not work to remove it - it is completely closed from the outside. </p><p>  The small size of the battery does not mean that you have to constantly charge your bracelet - no, nothing like that.  In fact, the device is very economical - it consumes very little for all its functions. </p><p>  As customer reviews describing the Xiaomi Mi Band fitness tracker show, on average, the device is discharged every 1-1.5 months.  It will be possible to find out that the bracelet needs to be connected to power through the appropriate light signals - three indicators are lit on the gadget, which can glow in different colors. </p><p>  Before working with the tracker, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the different signs and signals that the device can send in more detail. </p><h2>  Protection </h2><p>  The developers of Xiaomi Mi Band (Black) claim that the bracelet can withstand the ingress of moisture and dust at a level to make it comfortable to use in everyday life.  In particular, if you wash your hands and some moisture gets on your device, nothing will happen.  But we do not recommend swimming with the tracker - with a longer contact with water, the gadget may fail. </p>

    <p>  The core is reliably protected from falls and mechanical shocks by a massive strap surrounding it.  It provides for a special recess in order to place the filling box described earlier in it. </p><p>  When Xiaomi Mi Band 1S (or the 1st version) is assembled, connecting it with a rubber base looks very organic and pleasant - the best sign that designers from China have done their best. </p><h2>  Generations </h2><p>  It should be said that the gadget is supplied to the market in various versions, which at the time of publication of the article are two - the first generation of the tracker and the second (Xiaomi Mi Band 1S).  The difference between the two, of course, is in the functions.  A newer version of the gadget can also read the heart rate of the person who wears the bracelet, and can also be used as a key to access the smartphone (valid only on Xiaomi models). </p><p>  Rumor has it that Xiaomi Mi Band 2 will also be on sale - an even newer version.  True, what capabilities will be endowed with this modification, no one knows.  Of course, with its entry into the market around the gadget an incredible stir will rise, which again will make the company famous. </p><p>  However, for success, along with the new Xiaomi Mi Band 2, you will need to offer something really worth the attention of all fans of electronic devices.  To do this is also not easy. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  A gadget that has such a low cost has certainly become a mass product.  This can be evidenced by how many reviews are left about the work of Xiaomi Mi Band Pulse on various sites with descriptions of such devices. </p><p>  It should be noted that we managed to find only positive recommendations about the Mi Band - the model has no serious flaws.  This is an affordable, albeit high-quality device that performs all the tasks assigned to it.  The device is implemented as simple as possible, due to which we can talk about its reliability.  Finally, it was assembled by Xiaomi - the electronics giant, which has already managed to establish itself on the good side in the world market. </p><p>  And as the review dedicated to the Xiaomi Mi Band showed, the gadget is really interesting not only to fans of such devices, but also to ordinary athletes: runners, for example, or people leading an active lifestyle.  Purely, in order to know how many steps they took per day, only one such device on your wrist is required. </p><p>  Again, if something is not clear, the instruction will help you in working with the Xiaomi Mi Band.  It is offered with all devices in different languages, depending on the country where the bracelet was sold. </p>

    <h2>  Device Conclusions </h2><p>  What can be said as a final assessment of the Chinese bracelet?  It should be noted that such products incline users to the fact that products from manufacturers from the Middle Kingdom are not such a bad decision.  If we do not talk about various companies without a name, or low-quality fakes of other well-known brands, manufacturers from China can make decent products.  Here, take at least the same Xiaomi as an example.  Mi Band (the instruction will not reveal this information to you, of course) is just a single product from a whole line of gadgets.  If you find out customer reviews about all these devices, you yourself will be surprised: how did one manufacturer manage to find a solution to perform the tasks of so many people?  And new products only confirm this, strengthening the position of the developer in this area. </p><p>  And what will the new version of Mi Band show?  We will know this very soon. </p>
