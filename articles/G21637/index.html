  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in Istanbul</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Istanbul is one of the most beautiful cities in the world.  This Turkish metropolis combines the oldest buildings with new business centers.  There are a huge number of attractions without which it is impossible to imagine a vacation in Istanbul.  Numerous palaces, mosques, monuments - all this and much more is opened to tourists who come here. </p><p>  Not one vacation in Istanbul is complete without a visit to the museum of Hagia Sophia - Hagia Sophia.  According to ancient legend, the basilica was first created on this site in 325 by Konstantin, but already in 404 it was burned.  Justinian later began her recovery.  He wanted the church to amaze with its magnificence, therefore, on his order, silver, gold, precious stones, ivory were brought for its decoration.  After five years of ongoing work, the church was ready, and Justinian consecrated it.  Unfortunately, several years later an earthquake occurred that partially damaged the temple.  Then came the long years of wars, the invaders plundered and destroyed the church, until in <span>1453,</span> Sultan Mehmet II decided that now it would be a mosque.  To the main building of St.  Sofia was attached 4 minarets.  After such a reconstruction, it became known as the <span>Hagia Sophia</span> Mosque <span>.</span>  In 1935, it was abolished and became a state museum, where the memory of two religions is preserved.  So in one building are Christian icons and Muslim paraphernalia.  Almost all tourists spending their holidays in Istanbul come here to see one of the <span>most beautiful places on earth.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another unique monument of ancient architecture can be called the <span>Basilica Cistern,</span> which is located a hundred meters from the church of St.  Sophia.  The beginning of the construction of an underground reservoir dates back to the 6th century.  Its original function was to provide fresh water to temples and residents of Istanbul.  For several centuries, the tank stood untouched, which led to its desolation.  In 1987, it was open for tourist excursions.  Today you can stroll through the reservoir, an area of ‚Äã‚Äã10,000 square meters, which is more like a palace in its appearance. </p><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter whether the holiday in Istanbul is connected with visiting religious shrines or not, but it is simply impossible to walk quietly past the Blue Mosque.  An amazing feature of all temples in Turkey lies in their extraordinary beauty and rich decoration, which is admired not only by believers, but also by connoisseurs of architectural creativity.  It was built in 1616 by the young Sultan Ahmed 1. This name of the mosque is associated with the fact that inside it is lined with blue tiles.  Its domes are decorated with precious stones, prayers are engraved on them.  The mosque is surrounded by six minarets, although 4 usually build them.  This choice of builders is associated with a legend according to which Ahmed 1 asked to make all minarets gold, but the master went to the trick because of a lack of money.  In Arabic, the words golden and six are very similar.  The master built 6 minarets, telling the Sultan that he simply did not correctly hear his order.  <span>The Blue Mosque</span> is valid.  A visit to it by tourists is possible only in the absence of service in it. </p><p>  Last-minute tours to Istanbul are very popular among travelers, as they allow you to enjoy the beauties of this city at a very affordable price.  This city is not a beach resort; rather, it will appeal to those people who want to get to know the history of the country.  A special peak is his visit, when last minute packages to Istanbul are quickly sold out, occurring in early May and until October.  At any time of the year, the city will be interesting for its tourists with its monuments and buildings.  Istanbul attracts the attention of tourists to itself, regardless of the time of year.  Have a nice rest! </p>
