Moreover, this wonderful place is not so far away.  But how to get there?  Even those tourists who arrived by car on the Black Sea coast, prefer to leave their iron horses in the parking lots - there are too many winding turns in the path.  The most convenient and fast transport that allows you to get to the mountain resort is the high-speed train Russian Railways "Lastochka".  Adler - Rosa Khutor - not her entire route.  The train leaves from Sochi.  Along the way, she makes a detour to pick up passengers from Adler Airport directly to the mountain resort.  Then she calls in to the seaside town itself, to the train station.  In this article we will tell you what opportunities vacationers in Adler and Krasnaya Polyana have to take advantage of this train. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tripsmile.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Swallow&quot;. Adler - Rosa Khutor" class="if uuid-2236216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2236216.jpg"></div><h2>  What are the cons of Swallows and how were they fixed? </h2><p>  The most important inconvenience experienced by passengers is the lack of early and evening flights.  Those who came from Adler on the Swallow to Rosa Khutor risked staying there for the night.  Passengers simply took the last train by storm.  Those who went to the <span>intermediate station</span> Esto-Sadok were forced to go to the final stop “Rosa Khutor” in order to catch the train.  Since December 2017, a new train schedule has entered into force.  It is still far from ideal, but there are noticeable improvements over the old one.  Firstly, the Sochi – Adler – Rosa-Khutor “Swallow” route has already run eight.  This helped unload train trains.  Secondly, from last summer a direct train “Lastochka” was launched, following from Krasnodar to Krasnaya Polyana.  In addition, in the ski area itself there is a train delivering passengers from the Imereti resort and the <span>Olympic village</span> to Esto-Sadok. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="nicehumor.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://nicehumor.ru/sochi-roza-hutor-lastochka-tsena.php"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ticket price" class="if uuid-2236250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2236250.jpg"></div><h2>  New schedule for the Swallow train (Adler - Rosa Khutor) </h2><p>  It takes only 48 minutes to travel from the Black Sea coast to the ski resort on this <span>high-speed train</span> .  The first train leaves from <span>Adler</span> train <span>station</span> at 7:58.  He arrives at the terminal station at 8:46.  This is the most convenient flight if you want to devote to the mountains all day.  Failed to catch the first train?  It doesn’t matter: already at nine in the morning the second starts.  In addition, vacationers have the opportunity to take the Krasnodar - Rosa-Khutor train.  The “Swallow” in Adler makes a nine-minute stop and leaves for the mountains at 11:10.  Almost immediately, an electric train from the airport follows in the same direction.  From the train station in Adler, she leaves at 11:19.  Then comes the lull.  The first afternoon “Swallow” leaves for Rosa Khutor at half past one.  Then another train follows at 14:38.  The last train leaves for Krasnaya Polyana at 18:06.  This is the main drawback in the schedule.  Those who come to the sea for an excursion on a tourist boat risk not getting to their mountain hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": 30, " data-source="http://irecommend.ru/content/elektrichka-adler-roza-khutor-40-minut-i-ya-na-meste"><img itemprop="image" alt="Train: inside view" class="if uuid-2236259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2236259.jpg"></div><h2>  Rosa Khutor - Adler: schedule </h2><p>  The first train to the sea leaves at ten in the morning.  And by eleven, vacationers in the mountains can get to the beach.  The next "Swallow" (Rosa Khutor - Adler) leaves at 14:51.  Thus, those who came only to look at the ski resort, and not to ride there, can go back immediately after lunch.  For those who are late for this roster there is another one starting at five in the evening.  Eight minutes after it, the charter “Swallow” leaves for Krasnodar, stopping at Adler at 17:51.  And at six o’clock in the evening, the train departs for Adler Airport.  She stops at the city's railway station at seven.  Following her is the composition at 19:15.  The last train from Krasnaya Polyana towards Sochi leaves at 21:26.  Thus, those who wish to ski, but tourists living by the sea, can use the whole day for their pleasure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bessochi.livejournal.com" data-author=": bessochi, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train Russian Railways" class="if uuid-2236261" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2236261.jpg"></div><h2>  Ticket price for "Swallow" </h2><p>  With the introduction of the new schedule, fares have also changed.  Now the ticket for an adult following from Sochi to Krasnaya Polyana is 335.8 rubles.  Kids up to five years old travel for free, and older children - for 168 rubles.  The ticket price for the “Swallow” from Adler to Rosa Khutor is much lower.  The price of an adult ticket is 234 rubles, and a child ticket is 117. But this price is valid if you take a train at the station.  In the case when you start from the Adler airport, the ticket price increases slightly: 280.56 - for adults and 140.30 - for children.  For luggage or a bicycle you will have to pay another fifty rubles, regardless of the distance of the trip.  The Swallows (Krasnodar - Rosa Khutor) includes wagons of various levels of comfort.  Therefore, the prices for it range from 570 to 950 rubles. </p>
