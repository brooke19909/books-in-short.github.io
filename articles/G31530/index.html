Its build quality, attractive stylish design, powerful technical stuffing and intuitive interface together with unshakable stability and reliability create a favorable impression on the part of users.  Plus, in addition, in some public circles iPhone and iPad are tantamount to signs of success of their owner.  Last but not least, the high cost of devices. </p><p>  And rightly so - at a price of almost a thousand dollars for a new model of the latter in the device line, not everyone can afford the device.  Especially given the current exchange rate of the dollar against the ruble.  Therefore, fans of the ‚Äúapple‚Äù devices and go to all sorts of tricks, trying to figure out where to buy an iPhone 5S cheaper.  The same applies to 6 and 6S models. </p>

    <h2>  Order older generations </h2><p>  The way out of the situation with the high cost of the smartphone is obvious - you can purchase an older generation of iPhone.  This will save 200-300 dollars, although you will also receive a no less high-quality device from a world famous manufacturer.  It will simply be somewhat outdated from a technological point of view. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In our opinion, the optimal device is version 5S.  This is also confirmed by various reviews.  Plus, according to representatives of online stores, now there is a maximum demand for this model.  The phone is really not so far behind in its capabilities from the ‚Äúflagship‚Äù 6S, it has an attractive 5th generation design and at the same time costs less. </p><p>  It is known that the cost of devices is not fixed, so it often differs depending on where to order them.  Therefore, in this article we will consider options for where you can buy the <span>cheapest iPhone</span> 5S.  And, of course, we will try to find the most optimal way out. </p><h2>  Order in communication stores </h2><p>  The easiest way out is to purchase the device directly in the electronics store, of which a large number are available today.  It can be either giants like Euroset or Svyaznoy (where a smartphone costs 25,999 and 24,999 rubles, respectively), or some less well-known communication stores (for example, a certain Citrus store where the price is 21,690 rubles ) </p><p>  The first advantage of working with such a store is that the product is in close proximity to the customer, which makes it very easy to get to know the device.  Moreover, there are various promotions and discounts held in such stores.  With the help of price monitoring services (like aggregators of offers from shops), you can ensure that you will find out as quickly as possible where to buy an iPhone 5S cheaper.  And, accordingly, as soon as a really profitable option appears, it will be possible to place an order. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The second plus from using domestic stores is delivery.  All these stores have at least several representative offices in the capital.  Given this, the buyer can contact one of them and pick up his goods.  You do not need to use the services of intermediaries or look for additional services. </p><p>  The third advantage comes from the previous one and consists in a convenient form of settlement with the seller.  You can pay in cash or use a credit card at your discretion, without worrying about converting rubles into dollars. </p><h2>  Order in China </h2><p>  Many reviews say that some users order Apple appliances from China, hoping to get it cheaper.  Honestly, in the process of preparing the materials for the article, we were not able to find ways where to buy a cheap iPhone 5S on Chinese sites.  Most often, we are talking about a fake or a copy of the ‚Äúapple‚Äù smartphone running on Android;  or about an iPhone-like device developed by another company. </p><p>  One way or another, we were not able to find original Apple products that would be cheaper than on Russian trading floors. </p><p>  It is much easier to order accessories for mobile devices in China or smartphones on Android. </p>

    <h2>  Order in the USA </h2><p>  Finally, we came to the question that our compatriots asked many times.  Is it profitable to buy Apple equipment in America, and where to buy cheaper iPhone 5S?  After all, having visited the largest electronics store in the States - Amazon, we found a model for $ 430 (which is almost 31 thousand rubles).  Obviously, delivery costs should also be added to this amount, which would have already ‚Äúblocked‚Äù the smartphone price set in domestic stores. </p><p>  Let's go to another popular resource in the field of trade - the Ebay auction.  Here our device costs $ 250 (almost 19 thousand rubles).  The significant difference between the platforms that operate on the same market is obvious. </p><h2>  Benefits of Shopping in the States </h2><p>  If this is true, then by ordering a smartphone at auction, you can really save some money.  Given that we are talking about the Buy it now form (order at a fixed price), we can conclude that the savings will be even greater if you use the auction form and really bargain for the cost of the device.  So, perhaps this is the answer to the question of where to buy an iPhone 5S cheaper. </p>

    <h2>  US Order Disadvantages </h2><p>  True, this form of purchase also has a lot of negative aspects.  Firstly, you need to take care of the payment - opening a PayPal account in dollar terms.  Secondly, you need to develop a delivery plan, and for this you should contact the intermediary company and, after finding out the conditions of their work, place an order at the address they define.  Thirdly, if everything works out, you need to wait until the smartphone arrives in Russia.  And only after paying for the delivery services it will be clear where it is cheaper to buy an iPhone 5S: in Moscow or at a foreign auction.  It may well be that all the same in the Russian capital. </p><p>  The feedback of those who have already passed this stage confirms: you need to think about several factors at once, so that the purchase procedure is as comfortable as possible. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  The capabilities of the Internet allow you to order a device with an ‚Äúapple‚Äù logo on the back cover anywhere, from different suppliers.  True, you can‚Äôt say exactly where to buy the cheapest iPhone 5S - it all depends on many factors.  These include: delivery price, exchange rates, intermediary commissions. </p><p>  In our opinion, given the not so big difference between American Ebay and Russian Citrus or Svyaznoy, you can think about whether you need difficulties with ordering from the USA?  After all, you might give this difference just in favor of the delivery company.  Because of this, the expediency of such a purchase is simply lost. </p>

    <p>  And, on the other hand, acquiring a smartphone in a domestic store, according to reviews on the website of some stores, is much easier and faster.  Perhaps if you look where to buy an iPhone 5S cheaper - in St. Petersburg or another regional center - you will be able to find an even more affordable option. </p><p>  Therefore, advice - follow the promotions and sales of Russian stores: here you can purchase the specified device more profitable and faster than in America.  And time will be spent much less. </p>
