Here, the mysterious atmosphere of ancient myths goes well with the beauty of nature, convenient beaches and good service.  Without a doubt, many hotels and pensions have been built on the coast, so travelers always have a choice.  And often the gaze of a tourist stops at a small cozy hotel Omirikon <span>Hotel Apartments</span> 2 *.  Of course, before paying for a room, you should find out more about the chosen place. </p><h2>  General information about the hotel: infrastructure and location </h2><p>  As you know, when choosing a hotel, many people are guided primarily by its location.  Hotel Corfu Omirikon Hotel Apartments 2 * is located on one of the most beautiful coasts of the island of Corfu, in the cozy resort village of Gouvia.  This location is considered convenient by tourists, because in walking distance not only the beach (the distance to the coast is about 200 m), but also cafes and shops.  The city of Kofu, the capital of the island, is located only 8 km from the hotel, so many travelers spend time in the busy resort.  The airport is 10 km away, which is also a bit. </p>

    <p>  It‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that this hotel is small - it consists of one three-story building.  But the hotel area is relatively large and, as the travelers themselves say, very beautiful, because it resembles an ever-flowering Mediterranean garden.  Everywhere, emerald lawns, flowering bushes, bright plants and tall trees, in the shade of which you can hide from the heat, delight the eye. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Omirikon Hotel Apartments 2 * (Corfu): description and photos of rooms </h2><p>  As already mentioned, this is a small hotel, even rather a boarding house, consisting of 11 rooms.
