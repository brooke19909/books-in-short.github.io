    <h2>  History </h2><p>  This blessed land was mastered by people a long time ago.  Archaeologists have discovered the remains of dwellings that date back to the V millennium BC.  But the settlement on the site of modern Bishkek arose in the 7th century after the birth of Christ.  It appeared at the crossroads of the Great Silk Road and the road leading from the central Tien Shan.  However, the settlement was not called Bishkek, in Jules, and Kyrgyzstan on the world map did not yet appear.  By the sixteenth century, the <span>Great Silk Road</span> had lost its significance.  The cities standing there began to vegetate, the inhabitants began to leave them.  This fate befell Jul.  The whole area between the rivers Alamedin and Ala-Archi turned into a pasture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1825, the Kokand Khan Madali founded Pishpek fortress here.  In 1860, the Russians began the siege of the stronghold, and two years later destroyed it to the ground.  However, barracks for the garrison were built in its place, and people continued to settle under the protection of the citadel.  The settlement received the status of a city in 1878.  In 1926, Pishpek was renamed Frunze, in honor of the Soviet military commander and a native of the city.  But with independence in 1991, the city was returned to its old, at least slightly changed name. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bishkek Kyrgyzstan" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/448934.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is Bishkek on a map of Kyrgyzstan </h2><p>  The city of Frunze did not immediately become the capital.  He acquired this status only in 1936.  And before that, he was the administrative center of the Kyrgyz Autonomous Region.  Why does the city have such a name - Bishkek?  The capital of Kyrgyzstan, according to one version, is named after the legendary hero who lived in this area in the XVIII century.  Bishkek-Batyr gained fame as the Kyrgyz Robin Hood.  And the word "Bishkek" itself is translated as "a club for whipping koumiss."  Today it is almost a millionaire - in 2014 its population was 901 thousand inhabitants.  The city is located in the north of the country, only twenty-five kilometers from the Kazakh border.  Even in summer, there is no heat.  After all, the city is located in the foothills of the Tien Shan at an altitude of 800 meters above sea level.  Forty kilometers to the south lies the majestic Kyrgyz ridge. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Regular flights are made daily from Moscow to Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan).  From Domodedovo, airplanes of the Kyrgyzstan Airlines take off, and from Sheremetyevo-F - Aeroflot.  In addition, you can fly to Bishkek from Novosibirsk aboard the S7.  The international airport of the capital of Kyrgyzstan is called Manas.  It is located twenty-three kilometers from the city.  The most convenient way to get from the airport is by taxi - this type of transport is relatively inexpensive.  Bishkek is also a developed railway junction.  By train here you can get from Kazakhstan.  This is a convenient transshipment point to get to other cities of the country: Kar, Osh, Balykchi, Naryn or Karakol. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bishkek districts" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/448936.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><h2>  Public transport </h2><p>  Small minibuses with 10-12 seats ply the city itself.  It is enough to wave your hand in front of the approaching car, transfer the money to the driver and name your drop-off point.  You can rent a car, including with a driver.  Even more affordable transport - trolley buses and buses.  But they stop running at nine in the evening.  It is important to know that after independence, the street map of Bishkek is very outdated.  You need to know the new name of your destination.  But the people in Bishkek live responsive, and if you get lost, do not hesitate to ask passers-by for directions.  With the hospitality characteristic of Eastern people, you will not only be prompted on the right path, but also lead to the right place.  Although it is difficult to get lost in the city, the streets are laid in a checkerboard pattern for better ventilation and holding irrigation ditches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is bishkek" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/448947.jpg" width="400"></div>

The offseason does not last long.  You can admire the spring, flowering of mountain poppies and tulips throughout the whole couple of weeks.  <span>Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan,</span> is located in the foothills, protected from the cold northern winds.  It is not too cold here in winter.  Even in January - the coldest month of the year - there is an average of + 2 ¬∞ C in the afternoon.  The mountain sun and cloudless weather make the city a real climatic resort.  But with the onset of twilight, the air begins to rapidly cool.  Even in the summer, in a couple of hours, the thermometer can drop from +31 to + 14 ¬∞ .  Therefore, getting out into the evening, do not forget to bring warmer clothes with you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kyrgyzstan on the map" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/448949.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Map of Bishkek </h2><p>  Back in 1938, three administrative districts were established in the capital of the <span>Kyrgyz SSR</span> : Sverdlovsk, Pervomaisk and Proletarsky.  In 1962, the latter was renamed Leninsky.  Twelve years later, the capital acquired the fourth territorial unit - the October city district.  After the independence of Kyrgyzstan, the management system changed radically.  Now the mayor is at the <span>head of the city</span> .  His power balances the kenesh.  This local government can be compared with our city council.  The kenesh and the mayor appoint akims - these are the heads of the districts.  They form and head the executive bodies of power - akimats.  Currently, the number of administrative units of the city has not increased.  There are still four of them.  But the districts of Bishkek are very large.  So, urban settlements of Chon-Aryk, Orto-Sai and Manas enter Leninsky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bishkek rest" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/448948.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Whatever the purpose of your stay in the country: trekking in the mountains, river rafting, horseback riding, rehabilitation in mud baths or mineral water resorts, linger for a couple of days in Bishkek.  <span>The capital of Kyrgyzstan</span> is a landmark in itself.  You can just wander around the avenues and squares of the city to see this.  You will certainly be surprised by the European look of Bishkek.  The fact is that the city plan, with a chess-nested street layout, was invented by the Russian military command, and the Czechoslovak artel Intergelpo was actively involved in building up in the 1920s.  Therefore, many buildings were built in the popular at that time Art Nouveau style.  Over the past two decades, the city has been decorated with new monuments.  In the central square of Ala-Too, Lenin was replaced by the original Statue of Liberty.  You need to see the Opera House, the Parliament building, the sculptural group Manas and attend the shift of the guard of honor at the State Flagstaff. </p><h2>  Museums and parks </h2><p>  Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, is not only the largest city in the country.  It is also the main cultural center.  There are many museums, theaters, there is an art gallery.  We recommend visiting the Historical Museum.  Its exposition contains a rich collection of artifacts of the Bronze Age, ancient coins that were in circulation on the territory of the Silk Road, household items and jewelry of nomadic Kyrgyz tribes.  Runic inscriptions from Talas and cave paintings from the Saimaluu-Tash camp deserve special attention.  The Museum of Fine Arts, in addition to paintings by Kyrgyz, Russian and Uzbek masters, contains in its collection an interesting ethnographic collection.  Here you can see a complete reconstruction of a traditional yurt with interior decoration, shyrdaki carpets, national clothes and shoes, ornate horse harness.  And those who are nostalgic for a bygone era will find many interesting things for themselves in the Museum of the city of Frunze.  Residents themselves call Bishkek the Green City.  Even in the greatest heat, you can hide in the dense shade of Young Guard Boulevard and Erkindik Avenue seated with silver poplars and centuries-old oaks.  You can see rare plants in the Botanical Garden, relax among the cool alleys of the Oak <span>Park,</span> Panfilov, Chingiz Aitmatov or Kemal Ataturk <span>parks</span> . </p>

    <h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  The largest store in the city - TSUM - is located on Chui Avenue.  However, the shopping process should not be limited only to them.  Cute boutiques and art galleries are scattered throughout the city, where you can buy fine souvenirs at affordable prices.  However, most of the points of interest for a shopper-tourist are focused in the center, in the square of Chui, Manas Avenues and Bokonbaev Avenues.  Antique shops, jewelry shops, fashion boutiques, shops with traditional embroidery and ceramics alternate with each other.  Mostly beautiful felt carpets ‚Äúshyrdaki‚Äù, a national headdress ‚Äúkalpak‚Äù, harem pants, ‚Äúichken‚Äù robes, jewelry, and leather goods are mainly brought from Kyrgyzstan.  Markets should not be ignored.  Bazaars of Osh, Dordoi and Ak-Emir are very colorful.  Even if you don‚Äôt buy anything, a trip there can be considered a full-fledged excursion into the world of the East. </p><h2>  What to try </h2><p>  Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan) is characterized by the fact that you can taste dishes from all regions of the country in the local restaurants and teahouses.  Get ready for the fact that you have to drink a considerable amount of tea - with this drink the meal begins and ends.  Dried fruits or baked goods are served on it without fail.  Pork in a Muslim country is not eaten, but mutton, poultry, beef and horse meat are eaten in abundance.  You should definitely try the most important Kyrgyz dish - Beshbarmak - special large noodles with young lamb meat.  The name of the dish translates as ‚Äú5 fingers‚Äù because they eat it with five fingers.  Also the visiting card of the gastronomy of Kyrgyzstan is <span>horse sausage</span> - chuchuk.  Some dishes of national cuisine can shock the Slav.  So, lamb eyes, brain and cheeks are delicacies.  Koumiss - fermented mare's milk - is a traditional drink of nomads.  They also sell shoro everywhere.  This drink resembles kvass, but is made from unripe wheat grains.  The Kirghiz borrowed many dishes from neighboring Uzbekistan, giving them their own flavor and sound.  So, you need to try the local Shurpa and Osh pilaf. </p><h2>  Neighborhood </h2><p>  What should a tourist visiting Bishkek know?  Rest to the highest standard is provided to you in the Hyatt, Dostuk, Ala-Too, Zhannat, Ak-Keme, Ysyk-Kel and other hotels.  In the vicinity of Bishkek, you should visit the "Khan's Graves" (an old cemetery), the Chon-Aryk nature reserve, and climb Mount Boz Peldek.  If the purpose of your visit is to improve your health, then you need to take a course of body wraps in a mud clinic located in the village of Kamyshanovka.  And in an hour or a little more than a drive from the city, mountain gorges are waiting for outdoor enthusiasts amid snow-capped peaks. </p>
