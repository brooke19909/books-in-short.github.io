  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Origin of the Solar System</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The solar system is unique, and its origin is today a mystery that is not open to the end, although scientists have been trying for centuries to reproduce the picture of its creation.  We can only accept or reject modern points of view on the origin of the solar system, but for humanity it will still be a mystery for many centuries.  Nevertheless, there are several scientific assumptions about its occurrence, which we will consider in this article. </p><p>  In the 18th century, the German philosopher Kant suggested that the solar system was formed from a cloud of numerous cold particles in continuous and chaotic motion.  Another scientist, the Frenchman Laplace, in 1796 suggested that the origin of the solar system is associated with a constantly rotating nebula, completely composed of gas. </p><p>  Despite <span>many theories,</span> a <span>well-known fact has been</span> unequivocally accepted <span>: the</span> bulk of the system is the Sun, and the planets that are located around it rotate in the same direction around their axes and at the same time around the star. </p><p>  Today, scientists agreed that the most likely origin of the solar system is associated with a low-temperature gas and dust mass, which was originally a cloud that revolved around the sun.  Particles entering this cloud were gradually distributed, forming disks whose thickness was thousands of times smaller than their diameter.  In constant motion, larger particles attracted smaller ones.  This contributed to the formation of large bodies, that is, planets. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Planet Earth, or rather its mass, has grown, according to scientists, over hundreds of millions of years.  Initially, its surface was very cold, and began to heat up only due to the action of radioactive elements, as experts suggest.  Scientists studying the origin of the solar system, believe that this led to the fact that the bowels of the earth melted.  In this case, the heavier elements formed the <span>core of the Earth,</span> and the lighter ones formed the surface layer, or crust.  In the same way, the process of forming <span>satellites of the planet</span> went <span>.</span> </p><p>  Interesting hypotheses of the origin of the solar system have been expressed by various scientists at all times.  In particular, the English astronomer Hoyle claims that the Sun at the time of birth was a bunch of gas and dust nebula in which there was a magnetic field.  At first it rotated at high speed, and later due to the influence of the magnetic field, its rotation began to decrease. </p><p>  Another <span>interesting theory</span> was put forward by O. Yu. Schmidt.  As the scientist suggests, the environment that serves to form the planets is a fragment of the interstellar cloud, consisting of a gas-dust mixture.  In it, as a result of random collisions of particles, numerous condensations are formed.  Large formations gradually increase in size and become denser.  That is how, from his point of view, the "embryos" of future planets are formed.  Impacts that occur during their collisions contribute to the fact that their orbits become like circles, and over time, their movement around the Sun becomes stable. </p><p>  The solar system and its origin are studied in many famous institutions of the world.  The annual international congresses that take place annually include a mandatory discussion of this issue in the program, and the leading Russian experts from the Geophysical Institute at the Academy of Sciences have already taken part in the discussions. </p><p>  An in-depth study on the topic ‚ÄúThe Solar System and Its Origin‚Äù is given an important place, and funds for their implementation are allocated from the state budget.  The moment will come, and thanks to the tireless efforts of scientists, the veil of secrecy will be opened so that the <span>population of the Earth can</span> learn even more about the origin of our amazing planet. </p>
