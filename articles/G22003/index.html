    <h2>  Negative Resort Reviews </h2><p>  It is impossible to achieve perfect organization in such a huge resort complex as Eri Beach Village 4 *.  Guest reviews indicate a number of shortcomings and negative points.  So, the most significant of them can be considered the following: </p><ul><li>  dishes in the dining room are washed very poorly, and therefore eating from it is extremely unpleasant; </li><li>  it‚Äôs very inconvenient that with double and triple occupancy only one key is given per room, and therefore quite often there are situations when someone has to wait a long time under the door; </li><li>  the elevator is in a terrible state, and someone is constantly getting stuck in it (but in most cases it just does not work); </li><li>  upon checking in, you will find only small towels in your room, and large ones are only given out after a personal request; </li><li>  on the beds are old and crushed mattresses with prickly springs; </li><li>  the shower is designed so that all the water remains on the floor; </li><li>  in order to have time to take a deck chair near the pool, you need to come in the early morning; </li><li>  due to poor ventilation, the smell of food from the kitchen is in the corridors up to the fourth floor; </li><li>  there are very few workers at the hotel, and therefore they physically do not have time to pay attention to all the guests and solve all the problems; </li><li>  Wireless Internet works with varying success (there may be no signal for several days); </li><li>  very mediocre and few animations; </li><li>  kids have nothing to do in the kids club unless they come with their toys; </li><li>  the terrible quality of local alcohol (but given that in stores it is much better, the conclusion suggests itself that it is simply diluted in a hotel); </li><li>  the hotel as such does not have a beach, but there is only a narrow strip of pebbles, which serves as an entry into the sea; </li><li>  above the sunbeds by the pool there are fairly low sunshades that everyone constantly bangs their heads on; </li><li>  it is not clear what is the meaning of a seawater pool if it stinks terribly of bleach; </li><li>  on the bathroom door there is no lock, no hook, or anything like that; </li><li>  the dining room cannot serve all residents (sometimes it is simply closed for a certain time, a crowd of tourists is left behind the door); </li><li>  the restaurant does not have enough dishes; </li><li>  the food is quite monotonous; </li><li>  strong audibility from the corridor (especially this early in the morning); </li><li>  it is strange that there are no lifeguards near the pools (but there are signs that indicate that you yourself are responsible for your safety); </li><li>  in the pool and around it is very dirty (it is very unpleasant that some vacationers climb into the water with drinks, and the staff does not make any comments to them); </li><li>  a huge flaw can be considered that smoking is allowed throughout the hotel (and despite the fact that ashtrays are installed everywhere, all butts are on the floor); </li><li>  the hotel does not give out beach towels (you need to either bring your own or take them for an additional fee). </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p> Based on all of the above, you can make a certain impression about the hotel Eri Beach Village 4 * (Hersonissos).  Reviews of tourists provide an opportunity to conclude that this is a hotel for unpretentious tourists.  Many guests complain about food, citing its monotony.  Nevertheless, everything is quite tasty and at home.  And if you take into account the assortment of dishes served, then you can eat something new every day and arrange your own variety on your own.  This is a good option for those who intend to enjoy the sun and sea, and also does not attach much importance to shortcomings.  Moreover, the prices for accommodation and related services are very affordable. </p><p>  Special attention should be paid to the rooms of the Eri Beach Village 4 * hotel (Crete).  Reviews of tourists note that the settlement is somewhat reminiscent of a lottery.  You can get into a beautiful and bright renovated room, or you can end up in a small room, the last transformations of which were carried out, probably, about 10 years ago.  It is also important to understand that at the same time more than 1000 tourists are resting at the hotel.  At the same time, the number of sunbeds by the pool and places in the restaurant clearly does not correspond to the number of tourists.  And the staff is so small that it is unable to keep track of everything at once. </p><p>  Many tourists, precisely because of their location on the sea coast, choose the Eri Beach Village 4 * hotel for themselves.  Reviews of tourists note that you will be disappointed upon arrival, because the resort has no beach as such.  If you want to soak up the sand and swim enough in the sea, you have to go to the territory of a neighboring hotel (fortunately, there is no extra charge for using their beach).  Also, due to the fact that there is a bus stop near the hotel, you can easily get anywhere in the island and appreciate all the beaches. </p>
