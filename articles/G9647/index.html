  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modern account system or where Arabic numerals were invented</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today <span>, math is</span> hard to imagine without the use of numbers and numbers.  Originally, mathematics used Roman numerals, of which there were 14, and which did not have a zero, but soon the numbers began to be depicted in the form of letters, since for many peoples they had some hidden meaning.  With the advent of Arabic numbers, zero appeared in mathematics.  Now many people are wondering where the <span>Arabic numerals were</span> invented <span>.</span>  The answer to this question must be sought from historians. </p><p>  The word "digit" is of Arabic origin and means "zero".  In India, a wall inscription was discovered, where there was a number 270, this inscription dates back to the 1st century and is the first evidence of the use of numbers.  Already in the V century, the Indians set out the decimal <span>system of calculus,</span> and a century later they freely operated with this system, as well as the concept of ‚Äúzero‚Äù, which meant ‚Äúnothing‚Äù or ‚Äúempty‚Äù.  By this time, most of the nations of the world had their own counting systems, however, only in India zero was used.  For the first time in India, the scientist Muhammad al Khorezmi used a zero-digit system, which contributed to the spread of the Indian numeral system throughout the world. </p><p>  Considering the question of who invented the Arabic numerals, one can see that the Arabian mathematicians had slightly changed the Indian numerals so that they fit their letter.  Thus, the Arab people became the first people to become acquainted with the Indian system of calculus.  And this is not surprising, because at that time in India a system was invented, according to which the numbers were written down the steps.  These steps were slightly larger than numbers, which is why, when calling a large number, we had to name the name of the step after each digit.  This caused some inconvenience, so the Indians soon began to name all the numbers of a large number without the names of their steps. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In India, where Arabic <span>numerals were</span> invented <span>, digital</span> steps have been used for quite some time.  If one of the steps was absent, the Indians instead of its name said "empty."  On paper, instead of the word ‚Äúempty,‚Äù the Indians first put a dot, and later a circle.  So zero appeared. </p><p>  This method of recording numbers, presented by India, was convenient for various calculi, so the whole world now uses it.  Thus, India can be considered a country where Arabic numerals and the decimal system of counting numbers were invented. </p><p>  It would seem that with the invention of numbers and the decimal system of counting, the first hours should have appeared.  However, it is known that the first hours were used in Babylon more than three thousand years ago, they were a dial with twelve divisions along the edges and a rod in cent.  This watch was sunny, so when the sun moved in the sky, the shadow of the rod fell on the corresponding number on the <span>dial.</span>  <span>Such watches were</span> used in the daytime, at nightfall they were replaced by <span>a water clock,</span> which is an earthenware vessel with water flowing out of it one drop at a time.  The vessel had divisions on the walls, therefore, with a decrease in the water level, one could see which division it stopped at, thus determining what time it was.  In Europe, watches were in the form of candles with divisions.  Today, historians argue about who invented mechanical watches, some argue that it was the Pacificus, others - Herbert.  In any case, the clock appeared before the Hindus invented numbers, earlier the dial had divisions with images of the zodiac signs, later letters and symbols were depicted on the dial.  After some time, Roman numerals on the watch dials began to be used. </p><p>  Thus, today it is known where the Arabic numerals were invented.  People have used the account system invented in India for many centuries, it has come down to our time and is still used today. </p>
