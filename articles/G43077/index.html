    <p>  In the case of an independent journey to the origins of Greek civilization, the opportunity opens up to enjoy the sense of ownership in the hidden corners of nature and history. </p><h2>  What is worth visiting in Rethymnon? </h2><ul><li>  <em>Archaeological sites.</em>  These are the burial places of Armenus (more than 300 burial grounds), the Monastery of Preveli, Arkadi (15th century), the ancient settlement of Eleufernus (8th century BC). </li><li>  <em>Canyons and caves.</em>  Caves of Simonelli (west of Rethymno), Ideon Andron, where, according to legend, Zeus, Geranios grew up.  Canyon Arkadios, Prasianos, Kurtaliost gorge, which will lead to the Prevelis lagoon. </li><li>  <em>Ethno-excursions.</em>  A visit to local villages and towns will reveal the secrets, traditions and myths of ancient Greece.  For example, Argyroupolis.  Built on the site of the ancient settlement of Lappa, the village has a very picturesque landscape, with springs, waterfalls, caves and a small chapel. </li></ul><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Tourists are pleased to respond to rest in Rethymnon, about the hotel itself <strong> </strong>  Joan Palace 4 *.  They mark primarily the level of service.  The quality of food and living conditions (4.6 points out of 5 possible) deserves high marks. </p><p>  The friendliness of the staff, the availability of attractions, the convenience of the hotel's location in the city center and the proximity of developed infrastructure are noted.  Hotel guests, as a wish, advise to improve the quality of cleaning and furniture. </p><p>  Holidays in Greece are not limited to beach vacations, it is important to understand the culture of this country, to immerse yourself in the life and color of the city.  Accommodation in Jo An Palace, which organically fits into the identity of the urban subculture, will help in this process. <strong></strong></p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  Tourists who visited the island of Crete and the Joan Palace 4 * hotel are eager to share about the features of their stay in Greece, the knowledge of which will enhance the impression of a holiday. </p><ul><li>  The food in the hotel is of high quality, varied.  Since in Crete the cost of food is quite high, as well as food in restaurants and cafes, booking half board can save a lot of money. </li><li>  For communication, it is better to use the Wi-Fi zone.  You can also purchase special tourist cards (for example, Good Line).  The acquisition of local communication services is an expensive pleasure, and registration as a user will take all the time of vacation (up to two weeks). </li><li>  It‚Äôs nice to have an electronic translator or a travel mini-dictionary with you.  With Russian-language service there are problems.  Mainly service is conducted in Greek and English. </li><li>  It is necessary to take care of extended insurance.  Medical services on the island are very expensive, and risks such as dental services, treatment of burns from jellyfish and sun are not always provided for by the usual insurance services. </li></ul><h2>  What tourists bring from Crete </h2><p>  What is most often brought from a trip to about.  Crete tourists?  Of course, all that is of local origin. </p><p>  This is a beautiful honey from the flowers of citrus plants.  Olives and all products derived from them - from oil to cosmetics. </p><p>  Fine leather goods can be purchased from local artisans (bags, backpacks, shoes).  High-quality fur products starting at 500 euros will be a wonderful memory of the island ... </p><p>  Local craftsmen have high-quality jewelry and applied products.  For their profitable acquisition should be removed from the city center, where the hotel Jo An Palace (Crete) is located.  The Greek Republic is famous for its winemaking.  A bottle of Metaxa, three, five, seven-year aging will be a good replenishment of the home bar. </p><p>  And of course, in memory of the rest there will be photos of unique protected lagoons, grottoes, canyons, churches and ruins of ancient cities, monuments of Greek culture. <strong></strong></p>
