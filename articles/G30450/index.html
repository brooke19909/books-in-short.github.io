After all, it is very fun and exciting.  In addition, the process helps to become a little closer to each other. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crocodile bead" class="if uuid-2468546" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2468546.jpg"></div><h2>  Elegant black necklace with blue splashes </h2><p>  The following idea is most appreciated by women, because everyone dreams of pampering themselves with such amazing beauty.  And it seems to many that it is incredibly difficult to execute an elegant necklace.  Although in reality a person only needs time and desire.  Both that, and another - things are quite accessible.  Thanks to this, it will not be difficult to make an interesting thing even for beginners who are only studying the basic rules of beadwork. </p><p>  So, in order to please yourself or someone close to you with a black necklace with blue blotches, you need to prepare black beads and beads of a pale blue or other preferred shade.  For blondes, it is better to use red, pink or silver beads, for red ones - green or orange, and for brunettes - deep blue, turquoise or burgundy.  Well, after that you can use the scheme below and make an original beadwork with your own hands. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="girlmed.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beaded necklace" class="if uuid-2468548" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2468548.jpg"></div><h2>  Necklace ‚ÄúFor a noble lady‚Äù </h2><p>  Another very attractive necklace is also worthy of the reader's attention.  For its execution, you can take durable sewing threads, and not wire, and beads of any color you like.  Or use several colors to make the product even more noticeable and bright.  In this case, it is ideal for hot summers. </p><p>  A simple diagram is presented in the following picture.  Relying on it, you will not be able to get confused when making an interesting necklace. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fi.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bead necklace" class="if uuid-2468550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2468550.jpg"></div><p>  At the end, a fastener should be attached to the product, which can be purchased in a specialized store where goods for needlework are sold or made independently.  To do this, on one side of the necklace we fasten a large bead, and on the other we make a loop of several beads, so that you can then fasten them together. </p><p>  Do-it-yourself DIY beadwork is simple, but all the friends and acquaintances will envy the result. </p><h2>  Black and Purple Blackberry Necklace </h2><p>  If the reader is not just interested in beadwork, but is a true professional in this matter, we recommend that he pay attention to the next master class.  To execute it, of course, is not as simple as the previous ones.  But the finished product also looks more vivid and spectacular. </p><p>  The step-by-step instructions presented in the video are very detailed.  Therefore, if you wish, beginners can also master it.  The main thing is that there is a desire to do something unusual. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="1uTmli1HWBw" data-url="https://youtu.be/1uTmli1HWBw" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/3/3/4/4/3344.jpg"></div><h2>  Peacock earrings </h2><p>  It‚Äôs not difficult to do one more variant of interesting, useful and very beautiful new bead crafts with your own hands.  But the products, with the correct execution of the presented graphic instructions, will turn out to be so unusual that it will not be a shame even to present them.  To whom?  For example, mom, grandmother, aunt or girlfriend for any occasion. </p><p>  But in order to make them, it will be necessary to prepare beads in the following colors: </p><ul><li>  saturated blue; </li><li>  dark green; </li><li>  swamp; </li><li>  turquoise; </li><li>  pale blue; </li><li>  yellow or golden. </li></ul><p>  And also need a few beads to decorate the tail.  The first earring is knitted according to the scheme, the second is based on its mirror image.  To make the earrings look more organic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="beaded peacock earrings" class="if uuid-2468552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2468552.jpg"></div><h2>  Original earrings - simple to use </h2><p>  Readers who are just starting to learn the basics of beadwork will definitely like the next DIY bead crafts workshop.  Photos of the finished result and the scheme are proposed below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bead earrings step by step" class="if uuid-2468445" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2468445.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, to make earrings you need beads and a thin strong wire.  You can make products by moving in a circle.  And if you take beads of the same color as the basis, then the thing will turn out to be boring and monotonous.  But if you use contrasting or related tones, for example, those that are shown in the photo, you can create something very original, unusual and, most importantly, beautiful. </p><p>  For example, the following combinations are considered the most advantageous: </p><ul><li>  blue, cyan, turquoise, silver; </li><li>  black, gray, white; </li><li>  black, deep blue, pale purple, white; </li><li>  dark brown, caramel, bright blue. </li></ul><h2>  Earrings "Juicy Watermelon Slices" </h2><p>  Another handmade DIY beadwork (does not require a master class).  After all, it is carried out very simply, you just need to follow the proposed scheme. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="watermelon slices earrings" class="if uuid-2468553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2468553.jpg"></div><p>  Such amusing earrings for an adult respectable lady, of course, will not work.  But for a young fashionista, such a thing will be to her taste.  That is why it can be done with a little helper.  So that she learns herself to perform simple manipulations with beads and wire.  By the way, we recommend making a pendant as a set for ‚Äúwatermelon‚Äù earrings. </p><p>  It can be done according to the graphic instructions above or made a little larger.  And you can do not skibochka, and a circle of watermelon.  To do this, you need to collect six beads on a wire and fasten them into a ring.  Then attach a new row of beads to them, followed by a few more.  Depending on what size you want to make a watermelon slice. </p><h2>  Poppy bead </h2><p>  Recently, DIY beadwork has become very popular.  Flowers among them are presented by options for both beginners and professionals.  There are interesting orchids, roses, daisies, life-size sunflowers, as well as many other flowers of amazing beauty.  In the current paragraph of the article, we invite the reader to consider step-by-step technology and make an amazing poppy with their own hands. </p><p>  It is very easy to do.  After all, we presented a video of the master class with step-by-step execution.  Try it, and you will succeed. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="TvHppFHth9M" data-url="https://youtu.be/TvHppFHth9M" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/3/2/2/4/3224.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting flower of six petals </h2><p>  In this paragraph, we propose to pay attention to another unusual version of the flower, which can be used to decorate the headband, elastic band for hair or any other useful and very beautiful thing.  To make it very simple, you just need to follow the graphic instructions below.  The color of the beads can be taken alone, or you can make the middle of a contrasting shade.  In other words, it all depends on one‚Äôs own preferences. </p><p>  Well, the diagram can be seen in the following figure.  It includes the execution of six petals, which are then connected using simple actions.  According to the scheme, the DIY "Flower" made of beads with their own hands is very simple.  And risking to do it, this can be seen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="simple bead flower" class="if uuid-2468551" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2468551.jpg"></div><h2>  Funny DIY bead picture </h2><p>  We are used to making various animals, flowers, jewelry and more from beads.  But in reality, experienced needlewomen can perform amazing paintings using only beads, canvas - a special fabric, a needle with a thread and a hoop - a special tool of a rounded shape for tensioning the fabric.  The finished image with a skillful and thorough approach will turn out to be incredibly realistic and surprisingly beautiful.  Moreover, not only landscapes or animals can be embroidered with beads, some needlewomen make interesting icons, from many of which you simply can‚Äôt take your eyes off. </p><p>  Therefore, we recommend our reader, if he has not yet tried his hand at this branch of needlework, to rectify the situation and make the following picture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="bead picture" class="if uuid-2468554" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2468554.jpg"></div><p>  A funny cat is made of beads in four colors: dark gray, <span>light gray, blue</span> and white.  Moreover, we advise a beginner to start from the very top of the product, since this part of the picture consists mostly of a blue hue.  Therefore, it is possible to train on it, and then proceed to the execution of more complex elements - the ears and face of the cat. </p><h2>  Original baubles </h2><p>  Baubles are bead crafts that every girl makes in childhood.
