    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The opening of the hotel in 1907 was very solemn.  Immediately they began to call him the greatest in the world.  Its construction cost a fabulous amount for those times - $ 12 million.  The famous American architect G. Hardenberg built a skyscraper (by the standards of those years) with a height of twenty floors.  It is made in the style of a French chateau and has a rich interior - gilding, marble, mosaic, mirrors.  The building is lit by 1,650 chandeliers. </p><p>  This is the second hotel built on this site and having the same name.  The previous building was demolished in 1905.  In 1943, the Plaza Hotel (New York) acquired <span>Conrad Hilton,</span> paying almost seven and a half million dollars for it.  He immediately began the reconstruction, which cost six million dollars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Plaza New York Address" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1145961.jpg" width="500"></div>

Its owner was the current presidential candidate, billionaire Donald Trump.  In 1988, he bought the Plaza Hotel (New York) for $ 407.5 million.
