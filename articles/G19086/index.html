Devices in the <span>form of LED strip</span> can be used as a night lamp if you attach them under the furniture.  They create a soft diffused light that does not irritate the eyes, but is bright enough not to stumble at night. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Furniture light" class="if uuid-2524628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2524628.jpg"></div><p>  As <span>external lighting, LED lamps</span> with a motion sensor on batteries are used in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe front door, along driveways and garden paths.  In addition to its direct purpose, lighting, such lamps will warn about desired and unwanted guests, as well as scare off intruders. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The main advantage of LED lamps with a motion sensor on batteries is their autonomy.  They do not need to pull the wires, so such a lamp can be installed completely anywhere.  With a high intensity of the light flux, such lamps are light and compact.  They are very economical due to the use in the design of LEDs.  The latter consume 5-7 times less energy than incandescent lamps, and their service life is about 100 thousand hours.  Thanks to this, the LED lamp with a motion sensor on batteries will last a long time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Additional energy savings are created thanks to the motion sensor.  The lamp burns only the necessary period of time, which saves up to 30% of energy, compared with ordinary lighting.  Devices designed for outdoor lighting and bathrooms have a sealed enclosure that protects them from moisture and dust, thereby also extending the life of the device.  The LED luminaire with a motion sensor on batteries for furniture is suitable for installation in a limited space of cabinets.  It does not heat up, does not emit harmful substances and does not emit ultraviolet light.  The luminaires are easy to operate and maintain.  It is only required to periodically wipe them from dust with a dry cloth and change the batteries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Night lamp with motion sensor" class="if uuid-2524617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2524617.jpg"></div><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The most serious drawback of such lamps is the disruption of the motion sensor.  As a rule, they are caused by incorrect settings of sensitivity and range.  The sensor can be triggered by heating appliances, pets, movement behind thin doors or windows.  Rechargeable luminaires require periodic replacement of batteries or their recharging.  Sealed models designed for <span>street lighting</span> or bathrooms, it is almost impossible to repair in the event of a breakdown.  The design of such lamps is quite simple, however, it will be problematic to restore the tightness of the housing.  Moisture and dust that gets inside the device will quickly disable it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.lithiumbatteries.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Furniture light" class="if uuid-2524761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2524761.jpg"></div><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  Lighting devices with a motion sensor consist of an LED, a motion sensor, a photocell, a battery and a housing.  The design, as well as the number of LEDs, can be different.  Some devices have a regulator of the intensity of the light flux and the color cast of the light.  Such devices can be used as a night lamp.  The motion sensor captures the temperature or wave fluctuations of the surrounding space, when an object is detected, the circuit closes and the light turns on.  The angle and range of recognition of the object is adjustable.  The photocell is designed to measure the level of illumination.  With sufficient natural or artificial light, the lamp does not light. </p><p>  As the battery using batteries of type AA or AAA.  Some models can be recharged from USB or a network, they use rechargeable batteries.  A charging cable is usually included.  The design of the case is quite diverse.  There are models in the form of a tape, linear, rotary, classic square and round.  Nightlights with motion sensors often have an original design.  Compactness and light weight allow you to mount fixtures with double-sided adhesive tape.  Rechargeable models often have a magnetic strip for easy removal.  The magnet is attached to the surface with adhesive tape or screws, and the lamp itself is held by the force of a magnetic field. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wall light with motion sensor" class="if uuid-2524623" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2524623.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of sensors </h2><p>  In household models, three types of motion sensors are used: </p><ul><li>  Microwave  The device emits high-frequency electromagnetic waves.  It is highly sensitive and can recognize an object behind subtle obstacles.  Sometimes it mistakenly triggers a movement outside a door or window.  Due to the fact that electromagnetic radiation is a danger to humans, such devices are rarely used in residential premises. </li><li>  Ultrasonic  The sensor picks up changes in reflected ultrasonic waves.  It recognizes the object even in warm winter clothes in a very dusty room.  However, if a person walks in quietly, the device may not work.  Ultrasound is completely harmless to humans, but animals are sensitive to it and can behave uneasily.  Such devices are suitable for installation in spacious rooms, on stairs, in the porch, for street lighting. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.ifihomes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Street lamp" class="if uuid-2524629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2524629.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Infrared  This is the most popular type of sensor in household fixtures.  It reacts to changes in room temperature and is completely harmless to humans and pets.  The lamp with an infrared sensor is suitable for small rooms, pantries, walk-in closets, cabinets.  The sensor may erroneously respond to heating appliances and pets.  If a person is dressed in tight clothing that does not allow heat to pass through well, the device may not work. </li><li>  Universal.  Such devices combine several recognition principles, which increases their efficiency and reduces the risk of errors. </li></ul><h2>  Types of fixtures </h2><p>  Lamps with a motion sensor can be divided into 2 large groups: for outdoor and indoor lighting.  The former are distinguished by a high degree of weather protection. </p><p>  Depending on the design features, lighting devices with a motion sensor can be divided into pendant, ceiling, wall and table. </p><h2>  Care and maintenance </h2><p>  Caring for the device is quite simple, you should periodically clean it from dust and change the batteries.  In order for the lamp to last longer, it is important to avoid overloads that arise due to incorrect adjustment of the distance and angle of detection, as well as to remove foreign objects from the range of the device: hinged furniture, curtains, indoor plants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.safield.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rechargeable lamp with motion sensor" class="if uuid-2524612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2524612.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews of LED lamps with a motion sensor on batteries are mostly positive.  However, some users report erroneous sensor triggers in the daytime and on pets.  Household models with an infrared sensor do not recognize a person in outerwear. </p><p>  Rechargeable luminaires with a motion sensor are an indispensable thing when lighting inaccessible places where there is no way to conduct electrical wiring.  They are compact, economical and safe.  In household models of luminaires for indoor lighting, an infrared motion sensor is most often used.  Luminaires for outdoor lighting have a high degree of protection against dust and moisture and an ultrasonic sensor.  Battery-powered luminaires are used for basic lighting and illumination of corridors, hallways, stairs, bathrooms, dressing rooms and furniture. </p>
