    <h2>  Leisure activities </h2><p>  Cheap hotels (and the Larco hotel is one of them), as a rule, does not have many additional amenities, such as its own SPA-salon, casino and night club, like many resort complexes.  But, however, here you can find what to do with yourself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel has a nice well-tended sun terrace with sun loungers and umbrellas, as well as a swimming pool.  The hotel itself has a bike rental desk, table tennis, a games room and a fitness center with modern exercise equipment.  Lovers of relaxation, both soul and body, will like the sauna.  But the most important entertainment is, of course, the beach.  Many guests are advised to go to the one that is located behind the San Remo Hotel - there are good comfortable sunsets, and there are places where you can snorkel. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Most tourists, going on vacation in Larnaca, pay special attention to the issue of nutrition.  Well, the hotel restaurant offers several options - OB (accommodation only), BB (breakfast), HB (half board) and all inclusive. </p><p>  Guests say they feed well here.  Breakfast is standard, European - fresh bread from which you can make toasts, eggs in various variations, coffee, teas, milk and juices, jams, several types of cereals, sausages, vegetables, fruits, etc. </p><p>  Lunches and dinners are more diverse, in addition, dishes are not repeated every day, which cannot but rejoice.  Pork, fish, beef, poultry, potatoes, couscous, spaghetti, baked and fresh vegetables, beans, rice, salads ... this is just a small list of what is served here - you can list for a long time.  But everyone will find a dish to their taste.  People who came here on vacation in Larnaca recommend paying only for breakfast if you want to please yourself with variety while eating at local taverns and restaurants.  Of which, by the way, there are many, and in most prices are more than reasonable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  Now we can talk about the apartments that Larco 2 * has (Cyprus).  The hotel has 55 rooms.  The most inexpensive are 2-seater, an area of ‚Äã‚Äã15 square meters.  m. The real price is about 10,000 rubles per week for two people.  There is a choice - either in the room there will be one large bed for 2 guests, or two standard ones. </p><p>  Inside there is everything you need.  Own plumbing unit with a bath, shower and toilet, a living area with a work desk, a TV with satellite channels, a radio, as well as a climate system (heating + air conditioning) and a private balcony. </p><p>  By the way, the same number will cost about 30,000 rubles if you order "all inclusive." </p><h2>  Family rooms </h2><p>  Cheap hotels often accommodate guests with children.  There are also budget apartments for them.  This is a studio with a large double bed, and one extra for a child.  Inside there is everything that was listed above.  Of the additional ones, there is a telephone for internal communication with the reception (a free ‚Äúcall-alarm‚Äù service is available). </p><p>  But most importantly - in such "family" studios there is a kitchen.  With an electric kettle, fridge, toaster, cutting table and stove.  These apartments are available for booking by any tourists, not only those who intend to come with children - but they will cost the same for both one and the other category of guests.  Week of stay - 14 tons  For three adults, the price is a little more - about 18-19 tons. </p>

    <h2>  Other apartments </h2><p>  This is not all the rooms that Larco Hotel 2 * (Larnaca) has at its disposal.  There are still options that will appeal to connoisseurs of space.  Their area is 22 square meters.  m., and a distinctive feature of these rooms is the availability of a separate bedroom.  A kitchen, a balcony, a bathroom and everything that was listed earlier are also inside.  The price of accommodation is 18,000 rubles per week (for two).  For three adults, the cost will be 22-23 tons.  And for four - 25-26 tons.  This, by the way, is the most profitable option.  Since in this case, each guest will pay only 6,250 rubles per week of stay.  And this is Cyprus, Larnaca!  Larco Hotel therefore has become so popular - thanks to its price.  But for such a cost it is difficult to find an option even in Russian resorts, which can be said about abroad. </p><p>  The last apartment, which I would like to say, is designed for 2 adults and 2 children (age of at most 4 years).  These rooms have a separate bedroom, a kitchen and a living room.  The price of a week stay is 20-21 tons. </p>

    <h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Another feature of this hotel is its attitude towards guests.  The staff at the hotel are welcoming and friendly.  And the fact that employees speak 7 different languages ‚Äã‚Äãis especially pleasing!  Among them are Greek, Bulgarian, English, Polish, Romanian, Ukrainian and Russian.  So no one should have a problem with the explanation. </p><p>  Hotel Larco Hotel Apartments 2 * is clean, neat and well maintained.  The numbers are the same, even if there is no surplus in them.  The apartments are cleaned daily, linen and towels are changed regularly, every two days.  And guests note the fact that the maids do not come in the morning, but in the afternoon - when all the guests relax on the beach.  The waiters in the hotel restaurant are polite, they serve quickly, the cook always prepares tasty and fresh dishes, and also speaks Russian. </p><p>  Settle in from 14:00, but if guests arrived earlier than this time, then they can arrange immediately - but in the event that "Larko" (hotel) has free places for tourists.  Cyprus is a popular resort, especially in the midst of the holiday season, so it is better to choose a flight that would be as close as possible to the designated time. </p>

    <h2>  It's important to know </h2><p>  It is interesting that guests who have booked at Larco Hotel 2 * (Cyprus, Larnaca-Town) for at least 7 nights can request a free transfer - both from the airport and to it. </p><p>  The hotel has several networks with Wi-Fi, so you need to ask at the reception in advance about which one you need to connect to.  It depends on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãaccommodation in the hotel. </p><p>  And when booking, you will need to provide your credit card details.  The property is hosted by American Express, Visa, Master Card, Maestro and Western Union.  A certain part of the funds may be blocked in the account until the arrival of guests as a guarantee of their arrival. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2><p>  About the rest in Larnaca, during which I happened to stay at the Larco Hotel, the guests respond positively, for the most part.  The main advantages are the beach in the immediate vicinity, and, in general, a convenient location.  The center is a 15-minute walk away.  There are, of course, nuances - some consider the number of rooms obsolete, the apartments are not too spacious, and the shower device is not very convenient.  But in contrast to all the minor flaws, an extremely favorable price is set.  You can book rooms at really low prices.  Which are even less - if you reserve apartments in advance of your trip, or in the so-called ‚Äúlow‚Äù season, when there are very few tourists in Cyprus. </p><p>  By the way, almost everyone who has stayed at this hotel notes its advantage in the form of its proximity to <span>Mackenzie Beach.</span>  Transparent sea, soft loose sand, lack of algae - an ideal place for relaxation, which, moreover, was awarded the EU Blue Flag for cleanliness. </p>

    <h2>  What else do guests say? </h2><p>  As already mentioned, guests resting here recommend paying only for breakfast.  Since in the immediate vicinity of the hotel there are countless not only restaurants and taverns, but also shops.  You can look into the Petros market - there are low prices and a good selection of products.  And another automatic machine with drinking water - for 2 liters only 10 cents.  And for 5 - only 20. </p><p>  If you need a car - it is better to take it at the rental point of the hotel.  A deposit of 200 euros (then returned), the rental fee (gasoline for your money) is much more profitable than in other rental locations.  In addition, while in Cyprus, it is really better to explore the resort on their own "wheels."  Of course, there are different routes for public transport, and guides can show a lot of interesting things, but you can see a lot more on your own. </p><p>  Tourists are also advised to book apartments with windows facing the front of the hotel - they are quieter. </p><p>  In general, this is an ideal hotel for people who dream of a budget, but a pleasant vacation.  Numerous positive reviews, as well as the promise of tourists to return here again, are the best evidence of this.  If you want to make sure of this yourself - you should go on vacation to Cyprus and stay at this hotel. </p>
