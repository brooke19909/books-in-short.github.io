Some travelers praise great hair dryers.  Therefore, you do not need to bring this device from home with you.  As for cleaning, in general, there were no special complaints about this.  So, according to our compatriots, sometimes the maids forgot to change a dirty towel or take out the trash.  However, it was worth contacting the administrator at the reception, as the problem was solved almost instantly.  A minor minus was considered by some guests as the absence of free internet in the rooms and in the whole of the hotel.  The cost of this service cannot be called low.  Free Wi-Fi is available only in the lobby.  However, the connection speed here, as noted by travelers, is extremely low. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="le meridien dahab resort 5 dahab" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1013764.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, according to them, it is very beautiful here.  In addition, the territory of the hotel complex is quite large.  There are many places for walking and relaxing holidays. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  As for food at the Le Meridian Dahab Resort hotel, here the opinions of most tourists coincided.  So, most travelers as a whole were satisfied with it.  According to them, the buffet restaurant has always had a fairly large selection of dishes from beef, fish, chicken, seafood, salads, snacks, fresh fruits and vegetables.  In addition, you could always taste delicious desserts.  However, as our compatriots note, the administration and the hotel chef should think about how to diversify the menu for every day.  So, even having plenty to choose from, a few days later tourists noted that they were tired of eating the same thing all the time.  However, it is certainly impossible to stay hungry here. </p><p>  Tourists had no complaints about drinks at this hotel.  But some guests complained that at dinner the waiters sometimes did not have time to bring them the ordered drink on time.  As a result, guests had to eat dry food.  The opportunity to take a drink here is not provided for by the internal rules of Le Meridien Dahab Resort. </p><p>  In addition, our compatriots advise, if possible, to come for lunch and dinner at the opening of the restaurant.  The fact is that if you come closer to the end of the meal, then you may not get some dishes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="artificial lagoon" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1013759.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of travelers, the beach vacation offered by the Le Meridian Dahab Resort hotel has its own characteristics.  So, first of all, it is worth paying attention to the fact that you need to go down to the sea along a large number of steps.  Accordingly, on the way back they will have to overcome them in the opposite direction.  Many tourists, especially people of advanced age, this feature can frighten.  However, as our compatriots note, it is not worth worrying about this.  The fact is that you can always call the reception and ask for a transfer to the beach.  In this case, a small open-top car will be waiting for you at your case, which will take you to the sea and then take you back. </p><p>  This hotel does not have a sandy beach.  You can swim here from the pontoon and the pier, going into the water along the ladder.  At the bottom there are a lot of corals and sea urchins, so it is strongly recommended to get special rubber shoes. </p><p>  Aqaba Bay, according to many travelers, cannot boast of such luxurious coral reefs, which can be found, for example, off the coast of Sharm El Sheikh.  However, you can watch the underwater inhabitants here.  To do this, it is enough to ‚Äúarm‚Äù with a snorkeling mask and sail a little to the side of the pier. </p><p>  As for the hotel's beach itself, it is quite large.  There are many sun loungers and parasols, there is a bar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the territory of the hotel" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1013756.jpg" width="600"></div>
