Seasonal discounts, special offers for the holidays, bonus and club cards - this is not a complete list of what you can get by often visiting the same store.  The Austin store is no exception to the rule.  Bonuses on the <span>map (how to check, find out a</span> little lower) will allow you to get a pretty significant discount on your next visit to the outlet.  Buyers find this quite profitable. </p>

    <p>  How to check bonuses on the Austin card?  This is not so difficult to do.  If you are a member of the Austin club, you can check bonuses by card number without even leaving your home.  How?  Find out now. </p><h2>  The essence of the program </h2><p>  The chain of stores of stylish clothes for the whole family from the Austin brand offers all its customers to join a club.  To confirm membership, a club card was issued.  There points are awarded for each purchase made.  The number of bonuses is not the same and depends on the amount left in the store and on which card a member of the club has. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Such bonus plastic is not registered, and in order to accumulate more points, it can be transferred to friends, relatives or neighbors of your choice.  When making each next purchase, the accumulated units can be spent.  They are allowed to pay only 30% of the cost of the thing you liked, if enough points have accumulated. </p><p>  And how to check how many bonuses on the Austin card?  You can do this in four ways, which only adds to the popularity of the club card. </p>

    <h2>  How to join the program? </h2><p>  Since Austin is a club bonus card, you can check the balance of funds on it only by becoming a member of the program. </p><p>  To become a member of the club, you will not need anything special.  It is enough to make a purchase for any amount you want, fill out a short application form and present it to the cashier along with any document proving your identity.  Of course, you must be of legal age. </p><p>  Another way to join the program is to register on the official website of the Austin online store. </p><h2>  Types of cards and scoring rules </h2><p>  Before talking about how to check bonuses on the Austin card, you need to find out what exactly they are awarded for. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Bonuses are conventional units.  In the future, with their help, you can partially pay for purchases made at retail outlets of this network.  To receive them, you need to present the card to the cashier at the time of payment for the goods.  Points will be awarded throughout the day. </p>

    <p>  Their number depends on which card you have available: </p><ul><li>  "Bonus".  Such a card is issued to any customer at his request.  In this case, the purchase amount does not matter.  The holder of such a card will be credited with 25 units of bonuses for each full 500 rubles spent in the distribution network. </li><li>  Bonus Plus.  This plastic is issued to customers who make a purchase worth 15 thousand and 1 ruble (or more) with one check.  This card entitles you to receive 35 bonuses for every five thousand rubles spent.  Bonus Plus can also be obtained after accumulating the necessary amount in exchange for a Bonus card. </li><li>  "Super Bonus."  It is issued upon accumulation of 30 thousand Russian rubles or making a one-time purchase for this amount.  Such a bonus plastic entitles you to receive 50 units for every five hundred spent. </li></ul><p>  Have you forgotten your Austin store card at home?  Bonuses on the map (how to check - below) can be spent without the presence of plastic itself.  To do this, just tell the cashier your phone number specified during registration.  Wait a bit.  You will receive an SMS with a code, a one-time combination.  It should be reported to the cashier and he will authorize. </p>

    <h2>  Validity </h2><p>  You need to not only know how to check bonuses on the Austin card, but also do it regularly.  The fact is that the accumulated points have a statute of limitations and burn out if they were not used up to a certain point. </p><p>  In fairness, it should be noted that points are saved for quite a long time - a whole year, even a little more.  To be more precise, the bonuses accumulated over the year can be spent until March next year.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if you made a purchase in May or December.  The first of March next year they will burn.  For example, points earned in January or February 2016 are canceled on March 1, 2017.  And bonuses accrued for a purchase made in February 2017 will wait for your decision until March 2018. </p><p>  There are also bonuses that are accrued in accordance with a specific promotional offer.  They have special storage conditions.  For example, for a purchase of 700 rubles, 700 bonuses can be offered.  But you can spend them only for 10 days, after which they are automatically canceled. </p><h2>  Check account </h2><p>  As you already understood, Austin is a bonus card.  Check bonuses and find out their number in several ways. </p>

    <p>  The easiest way to do it this way is: register on the official website of the stylish clothing store, authorize and go to the "Bonuses" section.  Here you will find all the necessary information, view the status of your personal account. </p><p>  And how to check bonuses on the Austin card?  Very simple.  At the next visit to the store, just ask the cashier and show him your card. </p><p>  If you made a purchase, save the check.  It also reflects up-to-date information on the number of points accumulated earlier and on how much is accrued for the last acquisition.  You only need to add together 2 amounts. </p><p>  If you didn‚Äôt go to the store and the Internet is not at hand, you can simply dial the number of a single help desk.  It's free, and the phone number is on the back of the bonus plastic.  The call center operator will answer the call.  He will need to inform your card number and in a couple of minutes you will receive the required information. </p><h2>  Where to spend the Austin bonus? </h2><p>  Since the card is a club card, you can spend bonuses exclusively by making purchases in the Austin trading network.  One point unit is equal to one ruble.  After they accumulate enough, you can spend.  There is only one rule: the total amount paid with points cannot exceed 30% of the value of the purchased item (taking into account all current discounts). </p><p>  There are several more limitations.  Bonuses cannot be used to pay for the delivery of goods, exchange them for "live" money and take advantage of the discount in the Austin Discount network. </p>
