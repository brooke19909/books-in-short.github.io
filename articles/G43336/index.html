    <p>  A radar detector is a special device that notifies the driver that a radar is used nearby to determine speed.  Thus, the owner of the vehicle manages to slow down and passes a controlled section of the road without any problems.  In addition, the function of the radar detector is to create interference that precludes accurate determination of vehicle speed. </p><p>  Among existing products, a significant <span>share of the market is</span> occupied by South Korean models under the show-Mi brand.  For 15 years now, the company has been launching devices on the CIS market warning of speeding violations, which have been repeatedly recognized by experts as the best in their segment. </p>

    <p>  One of the most popular models produced by this company is the Sho-Me 525 radar detector. Let us consider in more detail its characteristics and features, its advantages and disadvantages, taking into account the opinions of customers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  This is a budget radar detector used to identify all types of radars in the service of the traffic police.  The device distinguishes between the work of Iskra, Falcon, Binar, Vizir, Radis, Arena, Chris-P and more modern laser video detectors for violations of Amat and LEADS.  This is a compact model that does not take up much space on the windshield.  The length of the Sho-Me 525 is 10.6 cm, the width is 6.7 cm. Weight is only 115 g. Unlike many models on the market, this device is capable of detecting one of the most formidable radars - Strelka, which it only automatically measures the speed, but at the same time conducts video recording of the car with the determination of its number. </p><h2>  Ranges </h2>

The radar detector can also recognize modes with short-term operation of the radar Instant-On, POP, F-POP.  As mentioned earlier, it detects radiation from laser detectors.  The viewing angle, like most modern detectors, is 360 degrees.

    <h2>  Modes </h2><p>  As you know, the abundance of different-frequency radiation within the city is simply huge.  A large number of signals can easily confuse a sensitive radar so that it will fire at every corner.  That is why some models, including the Sho-Me 525, are equipped with the ‚ÄúCity‚Äù mode, in which the sensitivity of the devices decreases, thereby reducing the number of false positives.  In this model, 2 such modes are set right away, tuned to different levels.  Conversely, on a country road or motorway, when the probability of catching an extraneous signal is extremely low, the sensitivity of the radar detector should be maximized in order to catch the signals issued by the traffic police speed locks.  It is for working in such conditions that the ‚ÄúRoute‚Äù mode is intended. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Model Features </h2>

As a signal receiver, superhetardine, a processed hetordin and a mixer are used, which made it possible to improve the detection characteristics of short-pulse signals.  A biconvex sensitive capacitor lens is used to detect laser signals.

The instruction states that when a radar is detected, an audible alert is activated.  If two or more signal sources are detected, priority is given to laser signals and only then to radar signals, including the Strelka complex. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Complete with the device are Velcro, power cord and bracket for mounting on the windshield with suction cups. </p><h2>  Mounting methods and inclusion </h2><p>  There are 2 ways to mount the Sho-Me 525 radar detector. The instructions say that it can be installed on the <span>dashboard</span> with Velcro or attached to the windshield with suction cups. </p><p>  In the first case, the <span>protective film is</span> removed from the Velcro <span>.</span>  One stick on the bottom of the radar detector, leaving the serial number open.  The other is attached to the dashboard at a previously selected and cleaned place from dirt and dust. </p><p>  In the second case, put the suction cups on the bracket and attach them to the windshield (the bracket can be bent if necessary).  They don‚Äôt put on the device, insert one end of the power cord into the radar detector and the other into the cigarette lighter.  In this case, the radar detector will turn on, and the self-testing phase will begin, which can be determined by a series of sound and light signals.  At the end of the self-test, the P / L icon will turn yellow on the display. </p><h2>  Volume control </h2><p>  Since an excessively loud <span>sound signal</span> can interfere with the driver or annoy, there is a need to make it quieter.  Conversely, a person with a hearing loss is required to set it to the maximum in order to respond to the signal in time.  You can adjust the <span>sound volume</span> using the side wheel: for this, you need to turn it left and right until it starts to arrange.  If necessary, you can completely turn off the signal or turn on the automatic muting mode. </p><h2>  Display brightness control </h2>

Often during the so-called ‚Äúfield trials‚Äù the technique does not show itself in the best way and produces results that are far from expected.  Therefore, drivers are primarily interested in how the Sho-Me 525 radar shows itself in practice. Reviews indicate that during the tests this model performed very worthily.  The tests were carried out both by ordinary car enthusiasts and by experts from thematic magazines.  The Sho-Me 525 anti-radar was tested in urban areas and on highways.  Drivers note that the number of false positives is insignificant, but the device reacted quickly to existing radars at the traffic police posts, warning in advance about the operation of the fixing equipment.  The censure was caused by the work of the radar detector to detect the Strelka complex.  Experts note that he does not always respond to this option of video fixators, you can not rely completely on the radar detector in this matter.  However, most marketed radar detectors work the same way. </p>

    <p>  However, one control measurement is not all.  No less important is how the Sho-Me 525 radar behaves over time. Reviews indicate that this technique performs well throughout its entire life cycle.  The number of devices that fail before the end of their service life is small. </p><p>  Ambiguous opinions on the quality of attachment of the suction cups.  The number of drivers who claim to be firmly and thoroughly attached to the windshield is approximately the same as the number of people who say that they are constantly falling off.  Therefore, in any case, additional Velcro fastening, which comes with the kit, will be most welcome.  Drivers who have repeatedly used the radar detector and traveled with it over distances of several thousand kilometers, note that the device often mistakenly responds to truck radios and constantly squeaks in the vicinity of trucks.  At the same time, fans of driving on empty tracks note that with the purchase of a radar detector the number of fines that they had to pay annually fell sharply.  Thus, the Sho-Me STR 525 anti-radar pays for itself in a few months. </p><p>  How much does this device cost?  The cost of the device differs significantly depending on the place of purchase of the Sho-Me STR 525 radar detector. The price of this device at the end of 2014 ranged from 3-4 thousand rubles, devices of other brands with similar functions cost about the same.  Most owners note that this device is ideal in terms of cost-quality ratio, and there is no point in overpaying for more sophisticated models. </p>
