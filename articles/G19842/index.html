One of the branches of philosophy - ontology - is the doctrine of the existing (being), its searches.  By being should be understood a philosophical category, which means everything that does not depend on <span>human</span> consciousness <span>.</span>  <span>Being</span> has several types - social, individual and being of nature.  Social being is a set of principles and laws by which society exists and develops.  Individual being is a system of principles and laws, according to which an individual person lives.  It also includes everyone‚Äôs <span>inner world</span> .  Everything that exists, with the exception of man, belongs to the being of nature.  Therefore, ontology as a doctrine of being considers its various aspects. </p><p>  A person is surrounded by numerous objects, things that have various properties.  They form the so-called surrounding world.  People may have different ideas about this world, but they all acknowledge that it exists realistically, this is its being. </p><p>  The philosophical concept of being is the connection of diverse objects with different properties, among themselves and with everything else that exists in the world.  Therefore, ontology is the doctrine of existence (being) as a single system, all of which are closely interconnected, thereby creating unity, integrity.  At the same time, the world is discrete, divided, but it has a clear structure. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  We can say that ontology as a doctrine of being is a metaphysics of being, that is, scientific knowledge of the principles of being and supersensible principles. </p>

    <p>  What is included in the concept of cultural ontology </p><p>  Ontology, being a special section of philosophy, describes universal and universal laws.  In particular, its subsection is the ontology of culture (this is a special object of analysis that does not come down to nature, society, reality, but represents a space where the meanings of being are transmitted, transmitted through symbols and signs). </p><p>  <span>The cultural space</span> cannot be described, guided by the laws of the development of society and natural life.  This space is characterized by special ontological characteristics, because it is a product of human creation.  Culture is one of the models of the world with which you can describe the structure of relations in society. </p><p>  Thus, the ontology of culture is a subsection of philosophy that studies the place that culture occupies as a sphere of human activity in the spiritual and material aspects. </p>

    <p>  Material, spiritual and artistic culture </p><p>  The concept of "culture" should be understood as a combination of values, both material and spiritual, the ways of their creation, the ability to preserve them and use them for the further development of mankind, to betray to their descendants. </p><p>  It is generally accepted that the ontology of culture is a material, spiritual and artistic <span>culture.</span>  <span>Material</span> represents the <span>objects of labor,</span> housing, clothing, vehicles <span>, means of production</span> , etc. But this type of culture is represented not only by certain objects, it includes the knowledge, abilities and skills of the person involved in the production process.  The physical development of man is also part of this culture.  Thus, it is associated with communicative and transformative activities. </p>

    <p>  Spiritual culture is art, religion, education, science and the level of implementation of its achievements in everyday life and production, traditions, customs, rituals, medicine, the degree of development of the needs and interests of people in the material and spiritual planes.  This can also include relationships between people, as well as the relationship of a person to himself and nature, emerging in the process of activity.  Therefore, it can be argued that spiritual culture unites various types of activities - communicative, cognitive, value-orientational, transformative. </p>

    <p>  Art culture is the world of art, which is characterized by interaction with society and other types of culture.  This type of culture is a product of human artistic activity.  Art culture is closely interconnected with all types of art.  It includes the following components: art sciences, art production, art criticism, ‚Äúconsumption‚Äù of works of art (by listeners, spectators).  These components are formed and developed around their center - art. </p><p>  Thus, the ontology of culture is a branch of philosophy that considers issues related to the fundamental principles of the existence of culture, the scientific and theoretical problems of its essence. </p>
