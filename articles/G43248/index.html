A historical monument protected by UNESCO is second only to Versailles and the Eiffel Tower.  This is a whole complex of structures, occupying the territory of the whole island. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="48.6360167" data-lng="-1.511114799999973" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/6/4/7/13647.png"></div><h2>  France business card </h2><p>  The island of Mont Saint-Michel in France, which has a conical shape, is located in the north of the country, in Lower Normandy, near the border with Brittany.  Having become the hallmark of the state, it is famous for its ancient architecture and a very picturesque location.  Mont Saint-Michel is a truly unique corner surrounded by the sea and the ramparts.  The island rises above sea level by almost 80 meters, standing out against a flat coast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.picturesboss.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fortress island" class="if uuid-3043796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3043796.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Initially, the island of Mont bore the rather gloomy name Mont Tombe, which translates as "grave mountain".  According to legend, the archangel Michael ordered believers to build a church on granite rock.  Its construction began in the XI century and was completed only after 5 centuries.  Made in the form of a grotto, it has long served as a defense against the Viking invaders who ravaged the surrounding territories. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The powerful ramparts around the island made it possible to withstand the enemy sieges.  The fortifications of the monastery consisted of two rings: the inner one protected the abbey, and the outer one the city itself.  Only the local monastic community survived on the entire coast, which was later expelled from the dwelling place by the soldiers of Duke Richard I. The Norman ruler took revenge on the monks for keeping in touch with Brittany.  Soon, the Benedictines, members of the Catholic monastic order, who founded the famous Abbey of Saint-Michel and became the full owners of the island for several centuries, moved here.  Over a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãland appeared a whole complex of structures, the architecture of which was dominated by two styles - Romanesque and Gothic. </p><p>  At the end of the 18th century, the fortress island of Mon turned into a prison for political prisoners.  Then a straw hat factory is housed here.  In 1874, Mont Saint-Michel was declared a historical monument, and after almost 100 years it was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p><p>  Monks come back here, and since then the island has been considered a place of pilgrimage, where thousands of people hurry in their hearts who sincerely believe that all requests will be heard by the Lord and that secret wishes will be fulfilled. </p><h2>  Modern city </h2><p>  Below, at the very foot of the cliff, a tiny town is conveniently located, in which about 30 people live.  Its inhabitants are engaged in agriculture, raise sheep, and also serve numerous guests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="global-geography.org" data-author=": Gerhard Huber, "><img itemprop="image" alt="The main street of the city" class="if uuid-3043708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3043708.jpg"></div><p>  Behind the main gate, the Grand Rue begins, a tourist-clogged street that houses an incredible number of souvenir shops.  If you climb along the fortifications along an old staircase, you can reach the fortress, which rises on a steep cliff.  A few hours should be allocated for her inspection.  But most often, guests arrive here in the hope of catching a tide that lasts about 60 minutes.  At this time, the abbey is cut off from the mainland.  The exact schedule for high sea level rises can be found at the entrance to the castle island of Mont Saint Michel or at the hotel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Miracle construction built on a rock </h2><p>  The Abbey of Saint-Michel is a very unusual architectural monument.  The talented builders who lived during the Middle Ages took into account the pyramidal shape of the rock, surrounding the cliff with buildings.  Standing at the very top of the church rests on crypts - underground rooms that form a kind of platform that can withstand the weight of the structure.  Realizing such a project was possible only with the help of highly accurate engineering calculations.  This is the epitome of architectural excellence! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.france-accommodation.me.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Abbey of Saint Michel" class="if uuid-3043745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3043745.jpg"></div><p>  The location of the premises of the abbey on the island of Mon was influenced by the harsh rules of the life of the monks, who devoted themselves to prayer and work.  The rooms of the ministers of the church were planned taking into account the monastic privacy. </p><h2>  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who have become acquainted with an amazing masterpiece created by human hands are enthusiastic about the trip to Mon Island.  Without fear, they climb a steep slope to see with their own eyes a grandiose complex whose beauty is bewitching.  On earth, perhaps this is the only place where the monastery, located on top of a granite rock, emerges from the depths of the sea.  The purest sea air and the vast expanse of the ocean attract thousands of guests who admire the architectural work.  Here you can wander all day, discovering something new every time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.destination-normandy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A fortified island-town surrounded by water" class="if uuid-3043811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3043811.jpg"></div><p>  The greatest interest for travelers are the fortress walls.  An impenetrable rock was cut off from the land by high waves, and the builders who lived during the Middle Ages showed real miracles of ingenuity, overcoming nature itself. </p><h2>  Indescribable feelings </h2><p>  According to visitors to the island of Mon, it is very difficult to describe the sensations that you experience here.  The closer the walled city, hovering between the earth, the sea and the sky, the brighter the impression.  But everyone receives the most inexpressible emotions during the tides, when giant waves with a run break up on the rocks.  Their speed can be compared with the speed of a horse galloping at full speed.  And it is best to observe a natural phenomenon at a safe distance. </p><p>  And during low tides (the most powerful in Europe), exposing the foot of the mountain, the water goes almost 18 kilometers!  And then the sea coast is a sandy strip of gray shade, along which people walk.  True, it is worth warning that it is not recommended to wander alone, without an experienced guide, in quicksand, so as not to stay here forever. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.straitstimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tide on the island" class="if uuid-3043760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3043760.jpg"></div><p>  Where the miniature island of Mont Saint-Michel (Normandy) is located, time seemed to stop.  In one of the most fabulous places on our planet reigns a unique atmosphere of the Middle Ages, which all guests of France want to plunge into. </p>
