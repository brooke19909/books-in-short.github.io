    <h2>  Weather in August </h2><p>  This time is not considered a great season to relax.  And if you are going to Thailand in August, be prepared for the fact that you can meet a series of cloudy days.  However, this is not always the case.  Sometimes rains are not observed at all.  And tourists enjoy a wonderful vacation.  In other cases, rain will wet guests once a week.  But, of course, it is impossible to exclude those cases when there is much more rainfall.  Still, August in Thailand is a season of heavy rains. </p><p>  In other words, this time is not at all the most favorable for relaxation.  However, one should not consider the trip to Thailand in August as terrible as some tour operators describe.  As mentioned above, a series of beautiful dry days often falls out at this time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You will not meet in August the terrible heat that occurs in winter or spring.  Dangling clouds and dense clouds protect from scorching heat.  This weather is very conducive to the study of attractions, excursions.  Most people who visited Thailand in August and during the dry season, argue that it is the end of summer that is the most comfortable time for a good rest. </p>

    <p>  And this is not surprising!  After all, sultry heat is not observed.  But at the same time, the air temperature warms up to 25-32 ° C during the day.  And nights pamper guests with indicators of 25-26 ° .  The sea welcomes tourists very hospitably.  It is quite hot and resembles “warm milk”.  But sometimes it can foam and storm.  At this time, guests are advised to swim in the pools. </p><h2>  <span>Holidays in Thailand</span> in August </h2><p>  The capricious weather is fully compensated by the offers of the hotel owners.  To attract guests and not remain completely without profit, they reduce the cost of living.  Various entertainments become quite accessible.  Thus, a vacation in Thailand in August costs tourists almost 2 times cheaper than in dry sultry weather. </p><p>  Discounts apply to excursions.  In August, you can purchase various souvenirs at extremely competitive prices.  Pleased with low cost food. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Things to do? </h2><p>  In the summer, a very small number of tourists are eager to get permits to this amazing land.  Thailand (August, as previously written, the rainy season) is considered at this time not the best place to relax.  That is why you will not meet many guests here.  This fact will especially please people who want to relax from the bustle of the city, to feel the atmosphere of calm. </p>
