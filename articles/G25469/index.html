    <p>  Every year the city hosts an incredible number of various holidays, festivals and fairs that tourists like to visit. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  To see the ancient city of Alcudia, you need to drive three kilometers inland.  There you can see the castle ruins, which are a historical monument.  Once upon a time, it was this fortress that served as a defense of Mallorca against pirate raids.  Currently, excursions are brought here, including from the HSM Hotel President.  The most popular are two-hour walks. </p><p>  Alcudia resort is located in the bay, most of which is occupied by magnificent beaches bordered by pine trees.  For this reason, the local coast is appreciated not only for its beauty and warm sea, but also for its clean and healthy air. </p><p>  The pearl of the resort can be called the Albufera Nature Reserve, where countless birds live.  Every year, birds flock to Mallorca from all over Europe to nest.  The reserve is closed to visitors by car, only walking is allowed on it. </p>

    <p>  Albufera is an amazing place for diving and surfing.  The underwater world here is very diverse: exotic fauna and flora delight even experienced divers.  If you come to HSM Hotel President, be sure to visit Albufera. </p><p>  Resting on the island, it is worth a trip to its capital, Palma de Mallorca.  The city is rich in historical sights, but of particular interest to tourists is the Dragon Cave, consisting of a string of mysterious halls and grottoes.  Legend has it that pirates once hid their treasures here. </p><h2>  Hotel HSM President: reviews </h2><p>  Mallorca is a beautiful island on which a large number of good hotels are built.  These include the HSM Hotel President <span>(Mallorca).</span>  <span>Reviews</span> about him are very good, which indicates his compliance with his four-star status. </p><p>  The hotel is in a good quiet location, away from the hustle and bustle.  Here at night you will not be disturbed by noise and music.  Near the complex there are several more hotels, but this does not bother.  A little further begins the residential area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city. </p><p>  I would like to note that the HSM President Hotel SPA is not an ordinary hotel.  The fact is that by some miracle it was built in the rock and has many levels.  At first, the staircases seem confusing, but you quickly get used to them.  In fact, the complex does not have its own territory, since it is closely adjacent to the cliff, and its front part faces the roadway.  The road is not very busy, but still, going to the sea, do not forget about the safety rules so as not to get into the <span>blind spot of</span> drivers. </p>

    <p>  The entire hotel consists of many levels, and even pools are cascaded.  Such an original building gives the hotel a certain charm.  Perhaps the complex will not appeal to those tourists who need a vast territory for walking, it simply is not here.  You can go beyond the fence of the hotel and walk along the promenade along the sea.  With very small children in wheelchairs, it is also not very convenient to pass the steps.  Otherwise, the original design of the complex does not cause any inconvenience. </p><p>  According to tourists, the hotel rooms are small.  They are equipped with good, but not new furniture, which is in good condition.  The only thing vacationers complain about is uncomfortable beds, which could be replaced.  All the equipment in the apartment is working, but even if problems arise, the reception staff will solve them very quickly.  As for cleaning, it is of high quality.  Maids take out the trash daily, change towels and clean the rooms. </p><p>  Special attention deserves food in the HSM President Hotel 4 *.  Food reviews are only positive.  This is not common.  As a rule, not all guests are satisfied.  And here we can confidently say that the food is organized at a decent level. </p><p>  Tourists have the right to independently choose the appropriate mode.  As a rule, vacationers opt for All Inclusive or half board.  The buffet in the restaurant pleases with abundance and variety.  Seafood and meat are served daily.  So many seafood is not in every hotel you can try.  For breakfast in the restaurant you can order bacon, pancakes, eggs, scrambled eggs, rolls, jams, cereals, meat dishes.  In addition, champagne is served in the morning.  There are always a lot of fruits and delicious desserts on the table.  Soups are offered for lunch, and ice cream is a must. </p><p>  All food in the restaurant is quite suitable for children.  There is no separate diet menu, but there is always something suitable on the buffet. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has its own beach, located next to the complex.  To get on it, you must cross the road.  The coast has fine sand cover, and the beach itself is very small.  If you do not rest in the high season, then there will be enough space on the shore for everyone, but with a strong filling of the hotel, there are not enough sunbeds for everyone.  However, this nuance is not so important, since a huge municipal beach, which always has places, is located a little further down the coast.  All the beaches of Alcudia are sandy with a shallow entry into the sea, which annually attracts a huge number of families with children. </p><p>  The hotel has a convenient location, it is quite convenient to get to the city center from it.  Walking takes about half an hour, and by taxi - no more than five minutes.  The cost of a taxi is about 6 euros.  You can rent a car in the complex to see not only Alcudia, but also Palma de Mallorca.  You can park your car at the hotel parking lot for the night.  Local guides offer different excursions to local attractions that are worth a visit, or go on a trip by your own municipal transport.  Mallorca is an amazing place with unusually beautiful nature and interesting historical places that are certainly worth a look. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Concluding the conversation about HSM President Hotel 4 * (reviews are given in the article), I would like to note that this complex can be a great place for a beach-sea vacation.  Great location, excellent food, beautiful nature - the main components of a good and successful vacation. </p>
