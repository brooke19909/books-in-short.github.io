  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Shymkent city: attractions, excursions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The city of Shymkent (Chimkent) is the cultural and economic center of Southern Kazakhstan, with about 800 years of history.  Its population is approaching 1 million people, and together with the suburbs it is almost 2 million. Being one of the oldest settlements in the country, it is an alloy of modern architecture and ancient sights. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="42.34168469999999" data-lng="69.590101" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/7/6/0/4760.png"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Speaking about the attractions of Shymkent, it is necessary to take into account the turbulent history of the city.  According to archaeological research, traces of the life of various historical periods were found in the settlement: in the II millennium BC, representatives of the Andronovo culture, in the I millennium BC.  e.  - Scythian-Sarmatians, from the first centuries of our era - Turkic-speaking nomads and settled peoples of Central Asia.  However, the construction of a permanent fortified settlement (caravanserai) dates back to the 12th century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.voxpopuli.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old Shymkent" class="if uuid-2569210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2569210.jpg"></div><p>  Located on an important commercial stupa connecting the cities of Central Asia with the Great Steppe, Shymkent for centuries has been the subject of disputes between various khanates and nomad tribes.  This often led to a military confrontation, adversely affecting the development of the village.  The city was destroyed several times.  Particularly catastrophic was the invasion of Genghis Khan.  However, every time it was restored, like a Phoenix bird.  For this reason, not so many sights were preserved in Shymkent of the medieval period. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After entering the Russian Empire in the 19th century, the series of wars ended, and the city gained a second wind.  New quarters, administrative buildings, religious and cultural facilities were built.  In the Soviet period, Chimkent acquired modern features.  After gaining independence, the national administration allocates significant funds to the preservation and enhancement of cultural traditions. </p><h2>  Art and culture </h2><p>  Until the end of the XIX century, Shymkent was a typical Central Asian city that grew around the citadel.  There was no architectural planning.  Close streets are chaotically intertwined with each other, sometimes forming real labyrinths.  This area is called the Old Town.  After joining the Russian Empire to the north, the construction of the New City began according to the developed rectangular-quarter plan. </p><p>  In the Old Town, among the attractions of Shymkent, the District Head House and Koshkar Ata Mosque stand out.  On Ordabasy Square stands a monument in honor of the great biys of the Kazakhs - Aiteke bi, Kazybek bi, Tole bi.  Around its base there are fountains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.yukle.mobi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shymkent city" class="if uuid-2569224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2569224.jpg"></div><p>  Favorite street for walking is Kazybek bi.  Built in the 19th century, it is replete with greenery and historical sites.  This is, first of all, the Central Park, the theme park "Ken Baba", a puppet theater (formerly St. Nicholas Cathedral), a museum of local lore, old buildings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, tourists are advised to visit: </p><ul><li>  Zoo. </li><li>  Independence Park. </li><li>  Abay Park. </li><li>  Arboretum. </li><li>  <span>Gulag Museum.</span> </li><li>  Ugam National Park. </li><li>  Theatre of Drama. </li></ul><h2>  Mausoleum of Arystan Baba </h2><p>  Arystan Baba was the spiritual leader of the Sufis in the Iasi region.  For his educational activities and righteous life he was awarded the title of saint.  According to popular legend, he was an associate of the Prophet Muhammad and lived for 400 years.  Among his students was the great Sufi poet, mystic, philosopher Khoja Ahmed Yassawi, especially revered in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. </p><p>  The Arystan Baba Mausoleum was built after the death of a saint in the 12th century in the ancient city of Otrar.  The complex consists of a tomb, a mosque, a minaret and various rooms surrounded by a wall.  The inside of the dome is engraved with alabaster and geometric patterns.  The main entrance, made in the form of a high arch and crowned with turrets, faces Mecca. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ontustiktravel.kz" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mausoleum of Arystan Baba" class="if uuid-2569214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2569214.jpg"></div><h2>  Ethnographic Park "Ken Baba" </h2><p>  Ethnopark was opened in 2001 on the site of a pioneer camp.  Large amounts of money were spent on its arrangement - 65 million tenge.  The builders did a great job.  They managed not only to build new facilities, but also to preserve green spaces.
