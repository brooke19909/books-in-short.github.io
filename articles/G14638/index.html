    <h2>  The practical and magical role of the doll </h2><p>  In early autumn, the selected part of the collected grain was put in a specially stitched bag.  They were especially careful about capricious buckwheat.  The bag was called "kitty."  He was from the canvas, with ties at the top.  He was given the appearance of a <span>chrysalis.</span>  <span>The doll was</span> placed in the <span>Red corner of the</span> hut; in the spring, the contents were carefully removed.  They were mixed with another grain and sown on the field with the wishes of a good harvest.  Later, the craftswomen began to sew such dolls on purpose, decorating them with symbolic embroidery. </p><h2>  Modern attitude to the mascot </h2><p>  After a while, they began to put several types of grain in the dolls at once, as well as other things that were considered talismans.  The amulet began to give at Christmas and Christmas time.  Each housewife was happy with such a gift as the Zernovushka doll.  With their own hands, the craftswomen tried to sew them for all relatives. </p><p>  The amulet today will be a wonderful gift for people close to you for the New Year holidays or Christmas.  The main thing is that the gift should be presented with sincere wishes for good, health and good luck.  Next, let's talk about <span>how to make a</span> Zernovushka <span>doll</span> with your own hands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What was the name of the amulet in different parts of the Russian land </h2><p>  The doll Zernovushka in different parts of Russia had different names.  It all depended on which cultures were more valued by the inhabitants.  In the southern part they loved buckwheat more and stuffed a doll with it.  Accordingly, her name was - Buckwheat.  Where millet was most respected, she was nicknamed Krupenichka.  In the northern regions, they gave her the name Zernovushka and filled her with oats. </p><h2>  Master class number 1: how to make a doll Zernovushka do it yourself </h2><p>  It is worth noting that making it is not as difficult as it might seem at first glance.  Making a Zernovushka doll begins with the selection of beautiful fabrics, because you should like the talisman.  Only in this case will it work. </p><p>  To sew a doll you will need: </p><ul><li>  <span>Two-thread fabric</span> to create a pouch (10 by 12 cm). </li><li>  Cotton for a skirt (5.5x10 cm), for sleeves (3.5x2 cm), for a scarf (12x17 cm). </li><li>  Flax for an apron (65.5 cm) </li><li>  Braid. </li></ul><p>  Sew a regular bag from a two-thread.  Pour the pre-prepared filler into it.  It should not be stuffed very tight.  Tie on top.  Drag it with a thread just above the middle.  The little doll‚Äôs body is ready, you can proceed to sewing clothes. </p><p>  First make a skirt.  Sew it from cotton by sewing a rectangle on the short side and put it on the doll.  Make an apron from a piece of flax.  You can decorate it with embroidery in advance, and then stretch the threads, thus creating a fringe.  Tie a skirt and an apron with thread. </p>

    <p>  Next, we sew the doll's hands.  To do this, take two cotton rectangles.  We bend and smooth the edges so that it does not spill.  For this you need to take two squares of white calico.  Fold it two times with a ‚Äúscarf‚Äù, and pull the corners to the middle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Connect the sleeve and palm by winding them together with a thread.  Similarly, make a second hand.  Wrap both sleeves around your neck. </p><p>  Decorate the head.  Wind a piece of lace to it.  Take a flap of the same cotton from which the skirt is sewn and cut out a triangle.  Tie it on your head like a scarf. </p><h2>  How to sew a Grain doll (a very simple way) </h2><p>  This workshop is so simple that even children of primary school age can handle it.  Take two types of cotton: white and colored, knitting threads, and filler.  From a colored fabric, cut a circle with a radius of 16.5 cm. Thread the needle and sew a circle around the perimeter with simple stitches.  Pull it a little and fill the filler.  Now you can completely pull off the formed ball and sew it up. </p>

    <h2>  Male hypostasis Zernovushki - a rich man </h2><p>  A rich man appeared later Zernovushki.  He can be considered her youngest relative.  They made such a talisman with a specific purpose - to attract money into the house, that is, so that it would be possible not only to live well, but also to save money.  The amulet was filled not only with grain, but also with coins or banknotes.  The peasant‚Äôs clothes were sewn smart, dapper.  It should have been bright fabrics, beautiful braid, embroidery. </p><p>  In the house, a rich peasant had to find a place for himself.  He was often rearranged and tried to understand whether he liked this or that corner.  A sure sign was that the doll began to blend in with its surroundings. </p><h2>  Game rag doll Pea </h2><p>  After a while, the amulet doll migrated to the nursery.  The needlewomen began to sew a prototype of Zernovushka - Pea.  A doll for games was stuffed with peas or beans.  Our ancestors were wise, although they did not know that such a filler develops fine motor skills in children.  They acted intuitively, and only after a while scientists proved that the child‚Äôs intellect ‚Äúlives‚Äù at the fingertips.  After all, when massaging a pillow with a filler, the lobes of the brain that are responsible for the baby's speech are involved. </p><p>  These dolls were fun not only for little girls.  They were played by boys up to 7-8 years old (while the child walked in a shirt).  As soon as he began to dress up in portals, games with dolls ceased. </p><h2>  Than it is possible to fill the Grain (filler value) </h2><p>  Each housewife filled the doll depending on the needs of the family.  For the amulet, they took the largest and always integral elements.  Inside the talisman, do not put chopped grain, cereal.  Each filler had its own meaning: </p><ul><li>  Corn - the health of the smallest inhabitants of the house (children and pets). </li><li>  Peas symbolize friendship and peace in the family. </li><li>  Millet - protection from the evil eye. </li><li>  Pumpkin seeds are laid by those who want replenishment in the family. </li><li>  Sunflower seeds are a symbol of solar energy.  Bring health to all the inhabitants of the house. </li><li>  Buckwheat symbolized wealth. </li><li>  Beans - for replenishment in the family. </li><li>  Rice - for cash profit. </li><li>  Pearl barley is a symbol of satiety. </li><li>  Oats were laid for the health of all family members (horsepower). </li></ul>

    <h2>  Additions to the grain amulet </h2><p>  In addition to crops, you can put in the amulet: </p><ul><li>  Rose petals - for passionate love between spouses. </li><li>  Nuts and acorns - to prolong youth. </li><li>  Money is only the largest bill. </li><li>  Garlic for health and protection from the evil eye. </li><li>  Wormwood to protect against evil forces.  Helps from nightmares. </li><li>  Mountain ash - protects the family. </li><li>  St. John's wort, chamomile - for health. </li><li>  Clover and caraway seeds for good luck in business. </li><li>  So that the family had money - a bay leaf. </li><li>  Children's amulet - the root of sunflower and rosehip berries. </li><li>  Mac - brings good luck and success in all matters. </li><li>  You can put coins of three, five or seven pieces. </li><li>  Lavender - for those who want to increase the family. </li><li>  Birch leaves - to get married next year. </li></ul><h2>  Secret ingredient </h2><p>  There is another magic ingredient that not everyone knows about.  This is ash from a fireplace taken from a house in which everything is safe.  If you have such acquaintances, ask them for some ashes.  Instead, be sure to leave some small gift.  With this ingredient you can improve your financial situation. </p><p>  Do not put wax inside the amulet.  It is used in black magic and only bad things are sealed to them.  Also, the Zernovushka doll should not be filled with earth; do not put nails and hair in it.  Some people believe that chernozem is suitable for a talisman as a symbol of fertility, but this can never be done.  Another thing that in no case was put inside such a talisman as the Zernovushka doll is a photo. </p><h2>  How to strengthen the amulet </h2><p>  In order to enhance the effect of the talisman, take salt.  A pinch should be squeezed between the palms of your hands and any prayer known to you should be read.  You can also in your own words ask her for help in what you need.  Pour salt into a talisman. </p><h2>  Other folk amulet dolls </h2><p>  Mascot doll mascots have been around for hundreds of years.  Most often, the image of a woman was taken as the basis.  Dolls were divided into amulets, games, ritual.  Last did not play.  They were sewn especially for girls of marriageable age and kept in chests.  Then they gave on the wedding day with the wishes of love and peace in the family. </p><p>  While the children were small, toys were sewn to them by mothers, sisters, grandmothers.  A girl at age 5 could make a diaper doll herself.  It was a piece of cloth rolled up with a ‚Äúrolling pin‚Äù.  He was covered with linen cloth.  Breasts were made from tightly packed balls.  They attached a braid of thread to her and sewed clothes from variegated fabric. </p><p>  Gradually, the pupae became more difficult.  They judged the girl‚Äôs skills as needlewomen by their appearance.  Teenagers often took doll carts with friends for a get-together.  These toys were treated very carefully.  In the hut they were kept in caskets, chests, boxes.  Children were not allowed to scatter them around the house and leave them on the street. </p><p>  Using the technique of motanka, dolls were also created, which kept the inhabitants of the house from troubles and diseases.
