  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The main methods of scientific knowledge in philosophy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To obtain new knowledge, science uses generally accepted methods that every person uses every day, both at home and at work.  Among the various methods of reasoning, one can single out analysis, design, prediction, abstraction, and so on.  The methods of scientific knowledge in philosophy distinguish between <span>empirical and theoretical</span> levels.  Moreover, observation and experiment are the main sources of empirical knowledge. </p><p>  Observation and experiment are specifically <span>scientific methods of</span> cognition.  Observation is a method of obtaining knowledge in which a person watches what is happening without personal intervention in the reality.  On the contrary, experiment is a method of obtaining empirical knowledge based on independent selection of conditions and the ability to direct the flow of the process with their help. </p><p>  Specifically, scientific methods of cognition are used in two fundamental levels of science - empirical and theoretical.  Both are closely interconnected and are used together in any study.  So, in order to start an experiment, it is necessary to set some goal, an interesting fact, that is, something that can be verified using various techniques.  Indeed, simple information statistics, sampling, collection of material based on observation, etc.  After collecting the facts, the stage <span>of information processing</span> begins <span>,</span> involving the deduction of laws, characteristics, sequences, laws, and so on, it is here that the methods of scientific knowledge in philosophy are most actively used.  Based on a specific practical base, science as such is founded, because any theory should be confirmed in practice, because the purpose of scientific research is to clarify objective, <span>true knowledge.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the theoretical justification of the experiment, the scientist must use theoretical thinking, which also has its own varieties.  In ancient times, the doctrine was used by thought experiments, through which the study of possible behaviors of idealized objects was carried out.  To date, the thought process has replaced mathematical thinking, which can reduce the time it takes to process information and obtain patterns at times.  Also, scientists can not do without a philosophical view of any process.  Indeed, it is precisely the methods of scientific knowledge in philosophy that make it possible to familiarize him with a vision of the general picture of the world. </p><p>  In addition, the methods of scientific knowledge in philosophy were especially important in the critical stages of scientific development.  Hypotheses and generalizations of scientists have always accompanied the most valuable scientific discoveries and achievements.  <span>Philosophical methods</span> contribute to a more accurate description and understanding of the reality of the process being studied. </p><p>  All scientific achievements are actively used in practice.  This is ensured by the principles of scientific knowledge: <br>  - the use of the total experience accumulated by mankind for the entire period of its existence, <br>  - deriving patterns using inconsistencies, hypotheses, concepts, abstractions and other methods, <br>  - strict subordination and organization of scientific knowledge, <br>  - the truth and objectivity of scientific knowledge, <br>  - science - a body of knowledge, a huge system that combines many scientific methods. </p><p>  The principles of scientific knowledge are important for the further development and deepening of the knowledge base.  The methods used in private sciences vary, but often overlap.  The most important apparatus that drives science in any field is mathematics.  Calculations using first calculators and then computer programs have greatly accelerated the ability to process information.  Scientific and technological progress affected not only the acceleration in the processing of information, but also the possibility of creating a unified, easily accessible scientific base.  On the Internet, anyone today can find the necessary information on a topic of interest.  This is important primarily for scientists, since it greatly facilitates the search for old and latest information. </p>
