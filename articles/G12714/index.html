First in France, then in Italian lands.  She was a participant in the revolution in European countries in 1848, the Franco-Austrian war and many other events. </p><p>  Fate treated her badly.  Having lost her native home as a child, she was never able to find peace and comfort when she got married.  The struggle for power by violent means forced her and her family to seek refuge either in England or in Austria.  After the capture of her duchy by Piedmont, she lived the rest of her life in Venice. </p>

    <h2>  Pedigree </h2><p>  Maria Teresa of France was born on September 21, 1819 in the territory of the <span>Champs Elysees</span> (France).  Father Charles Ferdinand had the title of Duke of Berry.  He was killed by one of the Bonapartists when the girl was five months old.  On her father, she was the granddaughter of Charles the Tenth, the future king of the French, and Maria Theresa. </p><p>  Mother Mary Carolina bore the surname Bourbon-Sicilian.  In her line, the girl was the granddaughter of King <span>Francis the First,</span> who ruled Sicily, and Mary Clementine. </p><h2>  early years </h2><p>  After Charles the Tenth abdicated due to events in France, Louise Marie Teresa of France and her family went into exile.  They settled in Austria. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the death of Charles Ferdinand, another child was born in the family - the boy Count de Chambord.  He was considered a possible contender for the throne in France. </p><h2>  The situation in Italy in the first half of the 19th century </h2><p>  Italy remained a fragmented state.  In the twenties of the nineteenth century, organizations began to appear to unite it.  In Sicily, forces were formed in the struggle against the ruling Bourbons.  An organization of carbonarians also emerged, which over time went into politics and began to fight against Austrian rule. </p><p>  The revolutionary struggle spread to the middle of the century throughout Europe.  The heroine of an article with a family that she created with Karl, a representative of the Parma Bourbons, was drawn into this confrontation. </p><h2>  Marriage to Charles the Third </h2><p>  At the age of twenty-six, Maria Theresa of France became the wife of Charles, who was the Crown Prince of Lucca.  The event took place on 10/10/1845 in one of the castles of Austria. </p>

    <p>  As a result of the death of the Duchess of Parma, who did not leave any heirs, Charles II annexed her territory.  So Louise and her chosen one became the princes of Parma.  However, the rule of the duke was short-lived, since a couple of months later, in 1848, the revolution began. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The couple were forced to flee their lands, as a result of which the prince was captured, where he spent several months.  The agreement on his release was agreed upon by the British government.  Having freed himself, he made a considerable journey from Milan to the island of Malta, then to Naples, and finally reached Livorno.  After their reunion, the family sought refuge in England and Scotland. </p><p>  In the last month of the summer of that year, the Austrian army crushed the revolution in Parma and restored Charles II to the throne.  However, the princess and her family continued to live in the UK, as the military conflict did not stop. </p><h2>  Children </h2>

    <p>  Married to Charles the Third, Maria Theresa of France (whose biography is presented to your attention in the article) had two daughters and two sons: </p><ul><li>  Margarita (1847-1893) married Carlos, who was the duke of Madrid and the contender for the throne of Spain, gave birth to five children. </li><li>  Robert the First (1849-1907) - for five years he was the Duke of Parma.

During his life he was married twice, but had no children. </li></ul><h2>  Duchy </h2><p>  In 1849, Charles the Second renounced power, and his son, Charles the Third, sat on the throne.  At this time, Maria Theresa of France and her family lived in the UK.  The husband arrived in Parma to take power, but began to manage the possessions (Parma and Pianchenci) three months later.  His rule, which stood out for its extravagance and violence, was interrupted by death in 1854. </p>

    <p>  After the assassination of the duke, power passed to his underage son, Robert the First.  Mother acted as regent.  Like most rulers of Italian states, she could not escape the Franco-Austrian war of 1859.  At this time, she and her children had to live in Venice, being protected by Austria. </p><p>  In 1860, the Duchy of Parma subjugated Piedmont.  From that time until the end of her life, Louise lived abroad.  The son was only the titular duke of his former lands. </p><p>  The Dowager Duchess of 02/01/1864 did not become.  It happened on the territory of Venice.  They buried her in a family crypt located in the monastery of Kostanjevica (at that time the Austro-Hungarian Empire).  Next to her are her grandfather Karl the Tenth, brother Henry, aunt Maria Theresa, uncle the Duke of Angouleme.  Today this territory belongs to Slovenia. </p><h2>  Titles </h2><p>  So who is Maria Teresa?  Over the many years of the existence of the monarchy in Europe, there were a lot of princesses and queens with that name.  Only titles and years of government can help figure out who is in question. </p><p>  The titles of Louise Maria belonged to the lands of France, Lucca and Parma.  At one time, she was a crown princess, princess, duchess, regent, and dowager duchess. </p>
