Therefore, do not consider the offer as fraud.  The studied plastic simply has a number of features and nuances.  Which ones?  We will learn more about this later! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ways of registration </h2><p>  Reviews on the card of Sovcombank "Freebie" emphasize that getting such plastic is not difficult.  Almost every adult citizen has the right to do so. </p><p>  You can get a "Freebie": </p><ul><li>  making a request via the Internet; </li><li>  in Sovcombank; </li><li>  through special services of registration and issue "Freebies". </li></ul><p>  Most often, plastic is either ordered on the Web, or they get acquainted with it in the design windows.  The latter are placed in large shopping centers with high traffic.  But Sovcombank also offers customers an installment card. </p><h2>  Primary requirements </h2><p>  Reviews on the <span>credit card</span> Sovcombank "Freebie" are positive because it is easy to issue.  The main thing is to meet some requirements.  There are not so many of them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card freebie Sovcombank reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2082587.jpg"></div>

    <p>  To get a freebie card from a client, you need: </p><ul><li>  the presence of official employment (at least 4 months of work in one place); </li><li>  fixed income; </li><li>  age from 20 to 75 years; </li><li>  citizenship of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  registration in the card issuing region for at least 4 months. </li></ul><p>  It's all.  Additionally, the applicant must have a telephone.  It doesn‚Äôt matter which one - stationary or mobile.  Better to have a second.  It‚Äôs easier to work with plastic. </p><p>  Another nuance that is emphasized in the reviews of Sovcombank "Freebie" card is the presence of a good credit history.  If a citizen is an unscrupulous payer of loans, they may well be denied plastic clearance.  Fortunately, this does not happen too often. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Documents for registration </h2><p>  To obtain the studied plastic, a minimum of documents is required.  Among the mandatory securities are: </p><ul><li>  passport; </li><li>  SNILS. </li></ul><p>  This will be enough.  A statement of income may be required from Sovcombank's client.  But according to reviews, such situations are rare.  All contributions to the FIU are checked according to the insurance certificate.  In this way, the bank can verify the solvency of citizens. </p>

    <h2>  Personal clearance </h2><p>  Need a Sovcombank "Freebie" card?  Reviews about the installment plan are varied.  Among them there are good opinions and not very. </p><p>  Customers generally respond positively to the procedure for issuing a Freebie card.  To personally receive a document, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Collect a package of certain papers.  They were mentioned above. </li><li>  Contact Sovcombank or a special card issuing service. </li><li>  Fill out the application form. </li><li>  Get an installment card on hand. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Then it remains only to activate it - and the thing is done.  Everything is simple, clear and very fast. </p><p>  Nevertheless, sometimes reviews of Sovcombank customers about the "Freebie" card are not the best.  Some note that employees of a financial institution literally impose installment cards to their visitors.  And this fact repels some.  Many Sovcombank employees are too persistent.  They not only talk about the interest-free loan program, but also strongly encourage them to design plastic.  Fortunately, such complaints are not too common. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Internet and card issuance </h2><p>  Often, reviews of users of the Sovcombank card "Freebie" emphasize that the design of plastic via the Internet does not cause any trouble.  The fact is that it is precisely this scenario that occurs in the vast majority of cases. </p><p>  To get a "Freebie" via the Internet, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Open halvacard.ru website in a browser. </li><li>  Click on the "Get Halva" button. </li><li>  Fill out the application form.  This will require a minimum of information. </li><li>  Click on the "Checkout" button. </li><li>  Coordinate the delivery address with the operator.  The customer will be called after sending a request for processing. </li><li>  Get the plastic.  For delivery, courier services are used. </li></ol><p>  Omsk user reviews on Sovcombank "Freebie" card distinguish the simplest profile among the positive aspects of plastic design.  In other regions of the Russian Federation, the receipt of a card via the Internet is similar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="freebie card Sovcombank customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2082591.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Terms of use </h2><p>  What are the terms of use for freebie holders?  Before you issue these or those cards, you need to find out how beneficial they are.  From some plastics there are some losses. </p><p>  But not from this offer!  User reviews on the map of Sovcombank "Freebie" (St. Petersburg, Moscow or other cities - this is not so important) highlight a rather large benefit from the service. </p><p>  The fact is that each client is offered the following conditions for using the card: </p><ul><li>  installments - up to a year; </li><li>  plastic action - 5 years; </li><li>  maximum loan amount - up to 350 000 rubles; </li><li>  cashback - 1.5%; </li><li>  interest on loans - 0%; </li><li>  interest on loans in arrears - 10%; </li><li>  penalty - 0.1% of the overdue amount per day; </li><li>  early repayment without fines; </li><li>  delivery - 0 rubles; </li><li>  service is free; </li><li>  delivery and card production - no fee. </li></ul><p>  Very tempting.  Some say that "Freebie" can be used as a debit plastic due to cashback.  But what‚Äôs the catch? </p>

    <h2>  Card feature </h2><p>  In Saratov, the Freebie card of Sovcombank receives generally good reviews from users.  However, as in all other regions of the Russian Federation.  Nevertheless, some are wary of this proposal.  After all, there must be a catch in something! </p><p>  And there is.  The "Freebie" card from Sovcomb can not be used in all stores.  It is allowed to pay only in certain networks.  In ordinary retail outlets, an offer from Sovcombank is useless. </p><p>  Accordingly, it is far from always possible to feel the benefits of ‚ÄúFreebie‚Äù.  Many emphasize that the effect of this plastic is comparable to the work of the "Conscience" installment card.  If you believe some reviews, then the proposal under study is useless for those who do not buy from Sovcombank partners. </p><h2>  Partners </h2><p>  And where then can you pay with the plastic studied?  User reviews of Sovcombank card "Freebie" indicate that this offer only works in specific retail outlets.  But you can pay with plastic in Russia and Belarus.  It is very pleasing. </p><p>  In total, more than 1,000 partner stores are allocated at the "Freebie".  For instance: </p><ul><li>  Kari </li><li>  Hoff </li><li>  "M Video"; </li><li>  "The Snow Queen"; </li><li>  Pyaterochka; </li><li>  "Chocolate Girl"; </li><li>  "Lamoda"; </li><li>  Yulmart; </li><li>  Lego </li><li>  Insiti </li><li>  Rostelecom </li><li>  Beeline; </li><li>  Woolhouse </li><li>  "Eco window". </li></ul><p>  A more accurate list can be found using the official website of the freebie card.  In the corresponding section, customers see partner stores for their region. </p>

    <h2>  About limits </h2><p>  Reviews of holders of the Freebie card in Russia often indicate that problems may arise during plastic processing.  In particular, due to credit limits.  What is it about? </p><p>  If you believe the description of the program, then the maximum loan is 350 thousand rubles.  But in practice, getting such a limit is almost impossible.  Customers draw up "Freebie" cards with restrictions of 15-20 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The fact is that the amount of lending directly depends on the size of the citizen's salary.  The higher it is, the more chances there are for a large limit of funds for freebie plastic.  Managers say that they do not give out loans above 2 salaries of a person.  Therefore, one should not count on a large loan amount. </p><p>  In connection with the listed features, "Freebie" is useless for some.  Especially considering the fact that the main partners of Sovcombank can either immediately buy goods for their money without any problems, or there is not enough loan issued.  And for people with high incomes in installments in principle, there is no need. </p><h2>  Other reviews </h2><p>  What else do the freebie holders say?  Reviews about this plastic are mixed.  But more are positive than negative.  Indeed, in general, this proposal is not a hoax.  And every interested and employed citizen will be able to issue this card for himself. </p><p>  Many emphasize the unstable operation of the Freebie mobile application from Sovcombank.  In addition, some are not happy with the commission when replenishing a plastic account at banks.  It is only 100 rubles, but even such a payment repels some. </p><p>  In addition, some cardholders cite the fact that goods paid for with a Freebie card have an overvalued cost.  And stock products do not allow working with the studied plastic.  The bulk of discontent is found in Belarus. </p><p>  Also among the disadvantages of plastic "Freebie" highlight the possibility of its adjustment without the knowledge of the holder.  If the client does not use the card for a long time, the limit on it can be reduced by 40%.  It is impossible to restore the previous loan amount. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  We found out what reviews on modern-day Sovcombank card are left by modern customers.  Many believe that it is worth filling out this plastic when there really is a need for it.  Just do not take an installment card. </p><p>  In Russia, the plastic "Freebie" is officially called the "Halva".  It is under this name that citizens can see an offer from Sovcombank.  But for the benefit of its use, the card was called "Freebie." </p>
