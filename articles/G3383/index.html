It all started with the MIUI 7 firmware version. So, on the devices of this company, a new Mi Drop Xiaomi application has appeared.  What is this utility, how to use it, is it possible to remove it?  The article will give answers to these and other questions. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Drop Xiaomi - what is it? </h2><p>  In short, this program provides users with the ability to easily and quickly send and receive different files: pictures, videos, music and so on.  The application works through a Wi-Fi connection.  Both devices (the one that sends the file and the one that receives it) must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.  Each of them must also have access to the Mi Drop program. </p><p>  However, not only Xiaomi device owners can use this service: the application can also be downloaded for free on Google Play and owners of smartphones of other companies on OS Android.  You can use the service without an internet connection.  The process of transferring and receiving files will be considered using the example of the Redmi 4A device. </p><h2>  What is Mi Drop on Xiaomi Redmi </h2><p>  The developers assure: transferring files via Mi Drop is faster than Bluetooth 200 times.  In fact, this application is an analogue of SHAREit from Lenovo and AirDrop, a program for devices from Apple.  How to enable Mi Drop on Xiaomi?  You can start using the program by clicking on the application icon, which is located on the smartphone‚Äôs desktop (for example, in the photo below it is located in the fourth row). </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Mi Drop on the desktop &quot;" class="if uuid-3083565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/3083565.jpg"></div><p>  If the user wants to share the file, you must click "Submit".  Receive a file from another device - "Receive". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Application menu" class="if uuid-3083563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/3083563.jpg"></div><p>  Or even simpler: after selecting a file from the gallery, player or file manager, you should click "Submit".  Several options will be offered, Mi Drop - among them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="File Transfer via Mi Drop" class="if uuid-3083570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/3083570.jpg"></div><p>  At this point, on the second device you need to go into the program and select "Receive."  After a few seconds of searching, pairing between the devices will be established: the device icon with its name will appear.  You need to "tap" on it - and the file will be transferred. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Recipient Icon" class="if uuid-3083571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/3083571.jpg"></div><p>  In fact, the program interface is very simple, and file transfer pleases with high speed.  Even interrupted data transfers can be resumed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Data rate" class="if uuid-3083573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/3083573.jpg"></div><p>  Is it possible to transfer files to a computer using Mi Drop?  Consider this issue. </p><h2>  How to transfer data to a PC? </h2><p>  Is it necessary to download Mi Drop Xiaomi to a computer if you need to send files from it to your phone?  No, in this case it‚Äôs still easier than when pairing two smartphones.  To transfer data, there is no need for this program on Windows.  File uploading is done using Mi Drop on your mobile device.  The most important condition is that the PC and mobile device must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.  So, again, Mi Drop will ‚Äúbuild a bridge‚Äù between the two devices, without using an Internet connection. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Computer Connect Feature" class="if uuid-3083566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/3083566.jpg"></div><p>  To send files to a PC, as seen in the photo above, you need to click "Connect to a computer" in the application (located in the side menu of the program).  Next, the FTP service will start - and the program will issue an address consisting of several digits.  As you can see in the photo below, this address will need to be entered in the address bar of the explorer or browser.  The root system of the device, its folders and files will be immediately available. </p><div class="photo" data-original="migeek.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="PC connection process" class="if uuid-3083558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/3083558.jpg"></div><p>  If the smartphone has a Micro SD memory card, the program will offer a choice: make pairing with the device‚Äôs external memory or internal.  A huge plus of this feature is that you do not need to always carry a USB cable with you.  Thanks to the Mi Drop application, transferring data from the device to the PC is easy and simple. </p><p>  Is the data transfer process possible if the computer has the macOS or Linux operating system?  Yes, for example, using an FTP client, FileZilla.  In the ‚ÄúHost‚Äù window, you will need to enter the FTP address and click ‚ÄúQuick Connection‚Äù.  FileZilla will connect to the server - and the user can manage the phone‚Äôs memory. </p><h2>  Can I remove Mi Drop? </h2><p>  It is possible, but since this utility on Xiaomi smartphones is part of the firmware, it will reappear the next time the device is updated.  Moreover, to remove it, root-rights are needed.  Those who do not have them should not get rid of the application: it does not take up much space in memory, and the processor "does not bother".  Nevertheless, if the user decided to remove the program, he needs to find MiDrop.apk via the file manager along the path / system / priv-app. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, Xiaomi Drop Xiaomi - what kind of program is it and what are its advantages compared to analogs?  Although this application originally appeared on devices with MIUI 7 and above, the owner of any device can download it. </p><p>  Xiaomi Drop Xiaomi - what is it?  This program allows you to exchange files between mobile devices.  It is also possible to transfer data to a PC.  The application is free and contains no ads.  Moreover, if the data exchange has stopped for any reason, it can be resumed.  Therefore, there is no need to waste time and start all over again.  Another application supports multi-selection, transferring multiple files at a time.  Here, the speed of data exchange is much higher than via Bluetooth.  Thus, you have many reasons in favor of choosing this application. </p>
