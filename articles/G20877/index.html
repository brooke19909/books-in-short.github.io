What is so unusual about him?  Why does it receive a huge number of visitors daily? </p><p>  Well, of course, first of all, this is because the station was built in the business part of Moscow, which means that the number of employees who are constantly striving for their business simply cannot be insignificant.  Tourists are also attracted to museums located on the surface, for example, the Jewish Heritage and the Holocaust and the Second World War, the Diamond Fund of Russia and the well-known Victory Park. </p><h2>  Section 1.

    <p>  According to the initial project, construction was to be carried out on the section "Victory Park - Kuntsevskaya" not one, but two stations at once. </p><p>  The second was to be the Minsk station.  As a result, construction began precisely from the Slavyansky Boulevard station.  In 2005, they decided to revise the project, as a result, they left only one stop of the metro, and the architects wanted to move the entrances closer to the northern part of Kutuzovsky Prospekt. </p><p>  Thanks to this redevelopment, it was possible to significantly save money and reduce the length of the plot by as much as 900 meters.  Further construction of the station was postponed until about 2006.  When the Victory Park-Kuntsevskaya section was opened in 2008, the Slavyansky Boulevard station was still under construction, and the trains passed through the station without stops.  And from prying eyes, the construction was covered with shields, they were removed only in August, and on September 7, the station was solemnly opened.  It was named in honor of the Slavic Boulevard, which is nearby. </p><h2>  Section 3. Metro station "Slavyanskiy Boulevard".  Characteristics </h2>

    <p>  Few people know that initially they wanted to decorate it with black natural stone.  Now, as everyone who has noticed, the interior style of the station can be described as Art Nouveau, and it is very similar to the design of the <span>Paris Metro.</span>  So, the track walls are made of <span>green marble</span> and additionally decorated with stainless steel.  The floor is made of black marble.  At the edges of the platform, this stone was treated with a heat-resistant coating. </p><p>  Large recesses were made in the ceiling, forged ornaments, designed in the form of branches and leaves, are now spread in them.  The luminaires on the track walls were positioned at such an angle that they remarkably illuminate the entire station.  The coffered arch visually increases the distance to the ceiling, giving the impression of additional space. </p><p>  In addition, the platform is decorated with elegant metal trees, on top of which there are lanterns, and three rook-shaped benches.  Similar details give the station a great resemblance to a real boulevard. </p><p>  Truly the center of Russian technology is Moscow.  M. "Slavyansky Boulevard", by the way, is also not inferior, it was designed in accordance with the requirements of modern passengers.  For example, today mobile communication is working stably here, there is an opportunity to go online. </p><p>  As a rule, the lobby opens at 5:40, and they work until late at night - until 1:00. </p>
