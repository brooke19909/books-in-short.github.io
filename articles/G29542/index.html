    <h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  I wonder if everyone guessed what should be in the box with such an interesting name?  Basically, such a box consists of three main departments, in which the first curl of the child, the first tooth dropped out, and also a tag from the handle, which was attached to the newborn in the hospital, will be stored.  These are the things that are most often the most valuable for every mom.  However, it must be said that it is still better to provide another fairly large compartment for other small things.  After all, women can also store the first dummy crumbs or the first bottle.  For these things also need to provide space. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself mom‚Äôs treasure box" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/363653.jpg?1396264097642" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  Option 1. Out of the box </h2><p>  It is worth noting that you can create boxes of "Mother's Treasures" in various ways.  A master class on creating them from a ready-made box is what we will talk about now.  So, the easiest, probably, way is to make such a box from a ready-made big box.  But for all the little things you need a separate place.  This is where you need to work.  To do this, you need to make certain beams in the middle of a large box.  How many of them will depend on the desire of the lady.  However, the ideal option: three small departments for the above details and one large for various things that will be filled with the box as the child grows older.  To make partitions, it is necessary to cut strips of the required height (according to the size of the box), as well as length, from very hard cardboard.  How will they be attached?  It is enough just to bend them around the edges by about 2-3 cm. These same bent places will be attached to the main box with glue.  That's all, the foundation is ready. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mom's treasures box mk" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/363660.jpg?1396264145005" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Option 2. From cardboard </h2><p>  Another way how to make ‚ÄúMother‚Äôs Treasures‚Äù boxes: the master class suggests using rather thick cardboard, which, however, will bend along the edges without any problems.  So, the box will be completely independently created.  To do this, you need to find a pattern for the base of the box and transfer it according to the indicated dimensions to the cardboard.  What will be the cut out base?  It will be the bottom (1 part), walls (4 parts), folds on the walls (4 parts).  However, it is best to cut the box out of solid cardboard and simply bend it in sections, rather than glue it.  Still, it will be more reliable.  A box can also be made immediately with a lid, for this the base on one side needs to be oblong, because the wall will go into the lid (the same size as the bottom).  That's all, it remains only to cut the product and bend along the necessary lines, and glue it with reliable glue.  The base is again ready. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make mom's treasure box" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/363654.jpg?1396264160931" width="527"></div></h2><h2>  Decoration </h2><p>  But that is far from all.  What else can be done to look beautiful boxes "Mother's treasures"?  The master class involves finishing them.  How can this be done?  First of all, paste over with beautiful paper.  To do this, you need various beautiful pieces of paper better than pink or blue (depending on the gender of the child).  They can be either monophonic, or in a cage, strip, circle - various, but always those that will please the mother herself.  With this paper you need to paste over the box not only outside but also inside.  However, it is better to cut out not a single piece of paper, but separate pieces and stick them without climbing on the folds.  So the box will look perfect for a long time, and the folds of the box will not get jammed.  Now it remains only to decorate the product "mother's treasures."  <span>A handmade box</span> created can be decorated with applications from various children's magazines, you can stick a baby‚Äôs photo on top and design it beautifully, you can decorate everything <span>using quilling</span> or scrapbooking.  In fact, there are a lot of options, you just need to choose what mom likes. </p><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  So, the main box is <span>done.</span>  <span>How to make a</span> box ‚ÄúMother‚Äôs treasures‚Äù, it is already known, by the same principle you need to make small boxes, which will be placed in the main.  So, you will need three small caskets (they will be placed on top and will be the same size) and one large (which will be narrow and long).  They are also better to paste over with beautiful paper.  However, on top of each of the boxes will contain the words ‚ÄúFirst Curl‚Äù, ‚ÄúLittle Tag from the hospital‚Äù, ‚ÄúFirst tooth‚Äù and ‚ÄúCute little things‚Äù (this is an approximate option, you can call them anything you like, even with a bit of humor).  From above, small boxes are finished in the same way as a large one, i.e.  in the same technique to sustain the style.  That's all, the boxes of "Mother's treasures" are almost ready.  The master class is completed, but here each mother can add something from herself and make her treasure store completely unique and inimitable. </p>
