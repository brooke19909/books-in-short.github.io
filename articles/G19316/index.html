They are on jackets and jeans, on bags and backpacks.  In any hardware store, a line of these products is necessarily represented.  In the article we will carefully consider what these fasteners are, who makes them and what types are produced. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The Japanese entrepreneur Tadao Yoshida founded the company for the production of such fasteners in 1930.  At that time it was a very bold step, since people had never seen anything like it before, they were frightened by such "lightning", they did not know how to use it.  This was not a novelty, because instructions on two sheets of how to use such fasteners were preserved.  They were very rude and bulky.  People did not love them.  But Tadao significantly transforms them.  It was with the advent of YKK lightning that everything changed radically. </p>

    <p>  The company changed its name several times, but subsequently the comfortable YKK took root.  These three famous letters are located on all sliders of fasteners.  What do they mean?  This name appeared only in 1946, when the company San-es Shokai buys another - Uozu Tekkousho KK. So this abbreviation appears. </p><p>  Almost 90 years have passed since then, the factory has expanded to 70 plants around the world.  The quality of the equipment proved to be during the strongest earthquake, when all Japanese enterprises stopped, only YKK worked.  The company cooperates with world brands of sportswear, jeans, jackets.  By the way, the word zipper was coined by Bertram Rock.  This is a well-known shoe manufacturer, he really liked the sound that the zipper made when closing.  Zzzzip over time develops into a household name - zipper. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of YKK zippers </h2><ol><li>  <em>Metal Zipper.</em>  As the name implies, these zippers are made of metal.
