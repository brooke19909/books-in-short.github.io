  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Carbon steel</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Carbon steel - an alloy of iron and carbon - occupies about 80% of the total volume of metal products.  The material is characterized by satisfactory mechanical properties, relatively low production costs.  The density of steel (from 7.7 to 7.9) * 103 kg / m3. </p><p>  The alloy is well subjected to pressure and cutting.  It should be noted that the material surpasses the alloyed alloy in these properties.  At the same time, carbon steel is less technologically advanced in <span>heat treatment.</span>  Due to the high critical quenching rate, the alloy is cooled in water.  This, in turn, leads to significant warping and deformation of products.  In order for <span>carbon steel to</span> have the same strength as alloyed alloys, it must be tempered at a lower temperature.  In this regard, <span>higher stresses</span> are preserved <span>,</span> which reduces the structural strength of the material. </p><p>  Carbon steel can be of two types: high-quality and ordinary quality. </p><p>  The second type is represented by rolling products: channels, pipes, corners, sheets, beams, bars and others.  In carbon steel of ordinary quality, the content of non-metallic inclusions, harmful impurities is permissible.  A certain degree of gas saturation of the material is allowed. </p><p>  In accordance with the set of properties and purpose, carbon alloys are divided into groups A, B and C. </p><p>  The first group (A) is used in the manufacture of parts without the use of hot processing.  Thus, the material retains mechanical properties. </p><p>  Steel from group B is used in the production of parts using hot processing (for example, rolling, forging, welding).  In this case, the mechanical properties and initial structure change.  For these parts, chemical information is important.  Depending on the information, the hot processing mode will also be determined. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Steel from group B is used for the manufacture of welded structures, critical parts. </p><p>  It should be noted that the method of processing a metal material affects the thermal conductivity of steel.  So, any impact on the product by pressure increases the ability to conduct heat to a less heated part of it from a more heated area. </p><p>  Carbon steels of these three groups of ordinary quality are intended for the production of various metal structures, lightly loaded devices and machine parts.  This type of material is applicable in cases where the performance of the products is ensured by rigidity.  Carbon <span>steels with</span> ordinary quality are widely used in the construction industry for the construction of reinforced concrete structures.  Individual alloys of groups B and B are well subjected to cold working and welding.  In this connection, these steels are widely used in the manufacture of frames, welded trusses, building metal structures, as well as fasteners, some of which are subsequently cemented. </p><p>  Steel is also divided into high-, medium- and low-carbon. </p><p>  The latter are characterized by high ductility and low strength in the cold state.  Typically, these <span>low carbon steels</span> are made in the form of a thin sheet.  Carbon and silicon are contained in small quantities, as a result of which these alloys are soft. </p><p>  Steel medium carbon (numbers 4 and 3), are very durable.  These alloys are used in the production of gears, shafts, pulleys and other parts of agricultural and freight equipment, as well as railway wheels, rails and other products. </p><p>  High-carbon steels (numbers 6 and 5) and with a high manganese content are used in most cases in the manufacture of high-strength wires, springs, springs and other parts that require high elasticity and wear resistance. </p>
