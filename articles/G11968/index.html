    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Based on the comments of experienced travelers, we can conclude that Admiral 5 * (Bulgaria, Golden Sands) is a pretty good place to relax.  Reviews indicate a number of positive points: </p><ul><li>  excellent location - the very center of a busy resort, but in close proximity to the sea; </li><li>  beautiful views from the windows of rooms located on the upper floors (the picture becomes especially beautiful at night, when the whole city is illuminated with colorful lights); </li><li>  very large rooms; </li><li>  if you have any problem in the room, then by contacting the reception, you can count on its speedy resolution; </li><li>  there are no cases of theft in the hotel, and therefore it is not necessary to spend money on a safe (even maids will not take a tip if you leave them in any place other than the edge of the bed); </li><li>  excellent quality of wireless Internet both in the territory and in the room; </li><li>  the hotel has a very tasty, satisfying and varied food; </li><li>  good animation for both children and adults; </li><li>  swimming in the pool, you can enjoy the sea; </li><li>  the restaurant serves real fruit juices, not powder; </li><li>  some workers speak Russian well. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The Admiral 5 * hotel (Bulgaria) is characterized by a number of shortcomings and shortcomings.  Golden Sands is a fairly budget resort, and therefore you should not count on an ideal vacation.  According to the reviews of tourists, the following negative points can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  a huge minus can be considered the lack of an iron in the room (but it can be brought on request); </li><li>  fairly high prices for drinks in the hotel bars (as an option, they can be bought in neighboring stores); </li><li>  employees often forget about the birthday, and therefore, in order to get the proper compliment, you have to remind yourself several times; </li><li>  the bathrooms in some rooms have a very unpleasant smell, which can be caused by a clogged sewer; </li><li>  despite the fact that there is a lot of greenery in the territory, it is not high, and therefore there are no areas with a dense shadow; </li><li>  due to the fact that the hotel has a lot of families with children, the area is very noisy; </li><li>  paid sunbeds and umbrellas on the beach (if you do not want to spend money, you can sit right on the sand). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  If you want to spend your vacation in a warm family atmosphere, then pay attention to the Admiral 5 * hotel.  Bulgaria is a fairly popular destination, and therefore it is constantly developing.  If we talk about this hotel, then recently it has been completely updated, but because here you will not find relics of the past.  Buildings, rooms, territory - everything looks very beautiful and modern.  The staff works very diligently, however, leisurely (but this can be considered a national feature of the Bulgarians). </p><p>  Resting in this resort hotel, you should not order a comprehensive three meals a day.  It is enough to stay at breakfasts, which will please you with an abundance of fruits, vegetables, cheeses and other goodies.  As for lunch and dinner, they may seem too modest to you.  The best way to get to know traditional local cuisine is to eat in the many cafes and restaurants located in the neighborhood. </p>
