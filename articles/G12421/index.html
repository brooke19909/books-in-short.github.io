It is chosen by tourists and tour operators.  Why tour operators?  Yes, because with Corfu, customers almost never return unhappy.  The island is densely populated with tourist attractions with different interests: there are great places for shopping, and many natural phenomenal uniqueness, and other temples, and beautiful cities with monumental architecture.  The largest portions of tourists are taken by the capital city of Kerkyra (the second name is Corfu) - this is a bulky and majestic metropolitan city with medieval architecture, but with a pleasant touch of some Italian cosiness, colorfulness. </p><p>  In addition to attractions, tourists are attracted and fascinated by the wonderful climate, this place is also called the "island of eternal spring."  The weather here is permanently warm, without extreme cold snap and sultry days.  The nature is very beautiful, odorous orange trees, olive groves, vineyards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="El Greco Hotel 2 * Greece Corfu" class="if" height="229" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1595275.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Even the shortest notes about Corfu cannot be supplemented with information about its inhabitants.  These people are admirable.  No, they are not drummers of labor, not heroes and not leaders.  But, the percentage of happy people on the island is off scale.  Either the matter is in an amazing, forever warm climate, or in beautiful nature, or in the fact that these islanders are mostly descendants of the Ancient Greeks and Gods.  The true cause is not known.  But almost all the tourists coming to Kerkyra wonder why the local people are so friendly, healthy, welcoming, always ready to help.  And in Kerkyra, there are also more long-livers in Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  El Greco Hotel 2 * (Corfu).  general information </h2><p>  This small resort is located on the shores of the beautiful <span>Ionian Sea</span> in the town of Benitses on the island of Corfu.

    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  El Greco Hotel 2 * has a very good location.  Not only is it located on one of the most picturesque islands in the world, it is also only 12 km from the capital, the city of Kerkyra (or Corfu). </p><p>  And the colorful resort village of Benitses is just a kilometer from the hotel. </p><p>  From John Kapodistrias International Airport, the hotel can be reached in 20 minutes.  The distance is some 10 km. </p><p>  The legendary Perulades Beach with its famous sheer cliffs is about 50 km from the hotel.  The most popular and justified time to visit this natural attraction is evening.  The sunsets in this area are simply fantastic. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The famous landmark - St. Spyridon Cathedral is only 15 km away.  Spiridon of Trimyphus is the patron saint of the island.  His relics are kept in the temple.  This is a holy place often visited by pilgrims and believers. </p><p>  And El Greco Hotel 2 * is located just 10 meters from Benitses public beach.  But, most guidebooks advise you not to stop on this beach, and if possible visit some more famous coastal corners - Paleokastrice, St. Gordios.  Maratia, the most expensive and fashionable sandy beach of the island is 20 km from the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="El Greco Hotel Corfu 2 *" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1595278.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The main options for moving from a hotel to different parts of the island are taxis, buses, scooters, bicycles or rented cars.  It makes sense to rent a car to visit distant sights, visit different beaches, appreciate the most picturesque, breathtaking views. </p><p>  Bicycles are only suitable for short distance walks.  The terrain on the island is hilly, with two-wheeled transport in some areas it is not very comfortable to move around, and there can be no talk of any relaxing pokatushki at a distance of 10 km. </p><p>  Taxi is the best option for groups of tourists up to four people, where the company does not find a brave person who can deny himself a glass of the most delicious local wine in the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The most budgetary option for transportation is buses.  The bus network is quite branched, there are no problems with getting to any place on the bus.  Near the hotel El Greco Hotel 2 * (Corfu) there is a bus stop. </p><p>  For example, you can take a bus to the Mouse Island of Pontikonisi, which is just 3 km away.  This is a tiny but very beautiful piece of land where another famous monastery is located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="El Greco Hotel 2 * Corfu" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1595274.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Orientation </h2><p>  Hotel El Greco Hotel 2 *, due to its excellent location, near the capital and on the seashore, is an ideal option for tourists who like to combine a beach and an informative vacation. </p><p>  Also, the prices at the hotel are very affordable.  However, the range of services and the quality of the rooms attract not only very budget tourists who are not able to pay for accommodation in rooms of 4 * and higher hotels, but also for tourists with average solvency.  Often travelers who are financially able to afford accommodation in a relatively expensive hotel do not actually live in luxurious apartments if one of the goals of their trip is to visit attractions.  After all, such active tourists spend most of their time on excursions, on beaches, in restaurants, possibly doing water sports or shopping. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="El Greco Hotel 2 * Reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1595279.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Therefore, the hotel is categorically not suitable for tourists who like a passive vacation on the hotel, leaving it only for visiting the beach.  For such tourists, the hotel has a very modest range of services, no spa, animation, a la carte restaurants and other attributes of Turkish-style hotels. </p><h2>  Classification and description of numbers </h2><p>  In total, El Greco Hotel Corfu has 2 * 59 rooms, or rather 43 rooms and 16 apartment-type apartments.  Room categories: single / double, Triple, Economy, Standard, Apartments.  The room may be with sea or street view.  Most rooms have sea views.  All rooms except Economy have a large balcony or terrace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="El Greco Hotel 2 * Corfu" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1595283.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This concept of nutrition is by no means poor, it is more likely to be justified for this region.  Relaxing in Corfu at the all-inclusive hotel with a varied, but quite unitary and standard meal is a real blasphemy.  After all, the local cuisine is so spicy, rich and unique.  Culinary traditions are very curious.  Various salads, moussaki, casseroles, pastries, wines, sauces and wines on the island make hearts and taste buds tremble even among the most inveterate gourmets. </p><p>  On the island of Corfu and in the village of Benitses there are many local family restaurants and taverns, where fresh seafood, freshly taken from the native element, local and crunchy vegetables, olives are so fragrant, and portions are pleasantly large.  Thousands of taverns on the island, of course, among them dubious places can happen.  So, choosing a place to eat, you should ask local residents or simply track down the spy method, the code is most often followed by local people for food. </p><h2>  Service, a set of services at the hotel </h2><p>  In El Greco Hotel 2 * (Greece, Corfu), guests can take advantage of the following additional services: </p><ul><li>  access to the pool on site.  The pool is open around the clock.  Sun loungers and umbrellas are free.  The pool has a bar; <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="El Greco Hotel 2 *" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1595282.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  free Wi-Fi throughout; </li><li>  safe at the reception; </li><li>  Free on-site parking </li><li>  24-hour reception </li><li>  telephone in the room; </li><li>  currency exchange; </li><li>  laundry service at extra charge </li><li>  rent a car, bike, scooter, call a taxi or order excursions for an additional fee </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="El Greco Hotel 2 * Corfu" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1595276.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  Hotel El Greco 2 * is located just 10 meters from the beautiful beach of Bernitses.  This beach is rightly awarded the European Union's Blue Flag for its unique purity and crystal clear sea water. </p><p>  This beach is public, like everyone else in Corfu.  Entrance to it is free, but the rental of umbrellas and deck chairs is paid.  The entrance to the sea is pebble, gentle. </p>

    <p>  But seriously, while being in Kerkyra, visiting only the beach closest to the hotel for the whole vacation is a tourist sin of the highest standard.  After all, the coast of Corfu is his true pride.  At the disposal of tourists a whole "beach all inclusive."  Almost all beaches have the prestigious Blue Flag award.  Kerkyra is a small island, but in the north it is washed by the Adriatic Sea, and in the south the Ionian.  Literally 2 hours before the gambling adventurer, a traveler can swim in two seas. </p><p>  Diving enthusiasts make sense to go to the beach of Paleokastrice.  This is a rocky, mystically beautiful region.  Lush living creatures, as in warm tropical waters, the underwater world in these places will not demonstrate.  But his trick is the most beautiful underwater cliffs, grottoes and caves. </p><p>  The beach of St. Gordios is quite large, mostly sandy, the beach of Maraitiki is the most pathos and demanded among wealthy tourists, Roda, Sidari and Acharavi are more in favor among travelers with children. </p><h2>  El Greco Hotel 2 *.  Reviews </h2><p>  The hotel has very high ratings from active tourists, their reviews are mostly positive, even enthusiastic.  Most of all they praise low prices, clean rooms, a very convenient location, beautiful sea and good weather, friendly staff.  The authors of negative and neutral reviews had some complaints about the size of the pool (however, for such a price it‚Äôs good that it is generally available), diverse food, and a narrow beach. </p>
