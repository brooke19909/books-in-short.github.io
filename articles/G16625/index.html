Anyone who understands such lamps may notice that phosphorus is part of the body.  Due to the presence of a phosphor, this bulb can be a bright emitter when compared with conventional incandescent lamps with the same power.  Therefore, the consumption of electricity will be minimal. </p><h2>  Features of work </h2><p>  It should be noted that manufacturers often add special additives to the phosphor in order to change the effect obtained.  Lamps, as a rule, are created either in the form of a straight tube with a ring, or in a regular straight form. </p><p>  The first option is made from a special container.  It is created from glass and a socle.  The second option is made of a cartridge and a glass-type tube.  It can be either straight or spiral.  It was this view that was called the compact fluorescent fluorescent lamp.  Devices are created in two versions: with thread and pin type. </p><p>  The threaded version is suitable for a conventional cartridge, in which incandescent lamps were previously installed.  The pin is used only in devices that have a special base. </p><p>  Inside the tube are gases and mercury.  Due to the fact that mercury is located here, these lamps are considered unsafe to use.  The product works by means of a phosphor glow.  When a current is supplied, the tungsten element is heated, a discharge accordingly appears and a glow begins using a mixture of gases.  It occurs in the ultraviolet spectrum.  Considering that the inner surface of the flask has a phosphor into which phosphorus enters, the flask glows after interacting with it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fluorescent lamp" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2216591.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Base types </h2><p>  <span>Fluorescent fluorescent lamps,</span> unlike incandescent devices, should not be directly connected to the electrical network.  For this, ballasts are used.  They regulate the supply of electricity.  Devices are divided into two types: with an external device, as well as built-in. </p><p>  We are talking about ballast equipment of a mechanical or electronic type.  Ballasts can be built in both the cartridge and the lamp itself separately.  If we take devices that have external characteristics, then there are two types: with two and four socles.  If we are talking about the latter, then such devices are connected using either a special device or a throttle.  The pin base can only be connected using the last element. </p><p>  Often, lamps of this type are used for chandeliers and lamps.  There are also models that have plinths with integrated electronic ballasts.  The base is created with a thread that does not exceed a certain diameter (standard or small). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of fluorescent lamps" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2216593.jpg"></div>

It is used for domestic, public and industrial lighting.  In order to illuminate the building at night and create bright advertising posters, it is precisely such devices that have a different color effect.  They can highlight showcases on which fresh meat is installed.  For such needs use lamps that have a pink tint.  Often, such a highlight improves the appearance of the product being sold. </p><p>  In order to disinfect the room, hospitals use radiation from a fluorescent lamp (55 cm or more in length) that has UV radiation.  The fact is that, unlike a quartz device, this one does not have a strong glow.  If we are talking about large trading floors, offices and other premises, then fluorescent lamps are also used to illuminate them. </p>

    <h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Luminescence fluorescent white light, like any other, have their advantages.  For example, they received a huge level of efficiency, long service life, excellent light output, low temperature of a glass bulb, when compared with an incandescent lamp.  Several color shades are also sold. </p><p>  If we talk about the shortcomings, it should be noted that such devices are too expensive.  If they are broken or deformed, there is a danger that a chemical infection will occur.  If the load on the network changes, the lamp will flicker.  The device will not work at temperatures below zero, so it should be said that such devices are demanding on this indicator. </p><p>  If we talk about load differences in the electrical network, then with regular surges this will reduce the life of the unit.  It should be noted that lamps cannot be used with a dimmer.  Unfortunately, this will only cause damage.  It is best to use conventional switches, which will save a long life, but this is only if the person will properly operate the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="55 cm fluorescent lamp" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43230/2217405.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Marking </h2><p>  A photo of fluorescent fluorescent lamps with markings can be seen in the article.  But what do these numbers mean?  Domestic manufacturers have their own system for marking. </p><p>  Often it consists of four or five letters mixed with numbers.  If at the beginning is the letter "L", then this means the type of lamp itself - luminescent.  The second letter indicates the characteristic of the color, what shade the device shines with.  The third - increased work efficiency or improved transmission of shades.  The fourth letter indicates the design of the device.  And the last digit indicates power. </p><p>  It should be noted that any 36 W fluorescent lamp has certain indicators.  In addition, there are many shades of fluorescent white fluorescent lamps.  The price of products is different.  Lamps are sold for 36 rubles, and for 500 rubles.  It all depends on the size, manufacturer and purpose of the lamp. </p>
