Especially popular among travelers is Central Dalmatia.  Here you can choose a hotel for every taste and budget.

    <p>  Fresh, clean air and tar aroma literally get drunk, as noted by those who came to this hotel for the first time.  Urban residents especially feel the healing properties of air.  The park itself is very picturesque and has the opportunity to take a walk along its paths in the cool shade of tall pines during the hours when the beach becomes unbearably hot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel buildings </h2><p>  Built in 1979 in accordance with GOSTs adopted in the Soviet Union, the buildings of the building resemble a Soviet sanatorium more than a hotel.  So tourists from the CIS countries speak of him.  Although it was renovated in 2002, only the reception and Superior and Deluxe-Suite rooms look modern. </p><p>  Tourist economy rooms are more like rooms without air conditioning in provincial hotels, but for those who come to enjoy the sea, the sun and the country, such trifles do not matter.  Saving on the number, you can qualitatively pass the time outside it. </p>

    <p>  Spending a <span>vacation in Croatia</span> in a budget hotel does not mean leaving disappointed.  The country is so rich in sights and picturesque that it is simply a sin to sit in a room and complain about old furniture or lack of air conditioning. </p><p>  The location of the hotel allows you to spend quality time.  Trogir can be reached on foot, and for the laziest there are buses, a taxi and a boat that leaves the pier on the beach every 20-30 minutes.  A boat trip is only 15 kunas, and a fresh breeze and a beautiful view of the coast will give pleasure. </p><p>  Split, the main city in the region, can be reached by public transport in 10‚Äì20 minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, Central Dalmatia, which originates from the city of Sibenik, located in the north of the region, and to Gradac on the south side, is the most picturesque resort place in Croatia.  It is here that the main famous monuments of antiquity are located and, of course, the most beautiful coast of the whole Adriatic. </p>

    <p>  Medena Hotel Trogir 3 * although not a high category, but the area where it is located will overshadow any shortcomings when living in it.  For example, in the nearby town of Omis there is an old pirate fortress, which offers such a stunning view that you want to stay in it forever. </p><p>  The city of Split and the airport, too, as they say, are at hand - only 7 km from the hotel.  If you rent a bicycle (registration directly at the reception of Hotel Medena 3 *), you can take an interesting walk to the main city of North Dalmatia and its surroundings.  This will not depend on transport and make stops at the behest of the soul. </p><p>  If the kitchen in the hotel for some reason did not like or wanted something unusual, you can always choose a restaurant or cafe in Trogir or on the way to it. </p><h2>  Hotel kitchen </h2><p>  Since tourism brings huge profits to the treasury, much attention is paid to its development here.  High-quality service, the availability of entertainment for all ages and tastes, comfortable hotel rooms and the proximity of the beach, a clean coast and sea, a variety of attractions and an active sports life, beautiful nature and excellent food - all this is a bait for tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Hotel Medena 3 serves three buffet meals a day.  Sophisticated and spoiled tourists note that the food in this hotel is monotonous, but healthy.  Such clients prefer to eat outside the resort in numerous cafes and restaurants located both on the right and left sides of the entrance - you can choose any.  The average cost of lunch is almost the same everywhere, so during the trip you can visit everything to try as many national dishes as possible. </p>

    <p>  Those guests of the hotel who are not very finicky say that the Medena Hotel (Croatia) has a good selection of dishes, so you can alternate them so that they do not repeat.  Drinks at the hotel‚Äôs restaurant and bar are more expensive than shops and the market, so it‚Äôs better to buy local wine there. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  This coast has repeatedly received the blue flag of quality, symbolizing the cleanliness and beauty of beaches, service culture and developed leisure infrastructure all over the world. </p><p>  Among them there are areas with sand, but large or small pebbles predominate.  Since pine forests stretch along almost the entire coast of Central Dalmatia, they create a natural shadow that is better than any beach umbrella. </p>

    <p>  The most popular, as always, are hotels on the first line from the sea, and Medena Hotel 3 * (Croatia) is one of them.  Reviews of vacationers note that not only the beach (pebble), located 150 meters from it, is its plus, but the beautiful pine park in which it is built compares favorably with other hotels.  Walking along paths to the sounds of cicadas and seeing the azure strip of the sea ahead is a real pleasure. </p><p>  You should know that sun loungers and umbrellas on the hotel beach are paid.  If someone does not like the rocky bottom on this stretch of coast, then just a dozen meters away is the next beach, also accessible to everyone. </p><h2>  Sports grounds </h2><p>  Medena Hotel 3 * (Central Dalmatia, Trogir) is not well suited for people who, even on vacation, do not miss the opportunity to lead an active lifestyle, but nevertheless they can find entertainment for themselves.  So, there are 6 real, well-equipped courts, so you can not only stretch your legs, but also organize real tournaments.  Golfers will be disappointed, but in order not to lose their shape, they can hone their skills on the minigolf course. </p><p>  Most lucky for football and volleyball players.  In any hotel there are special venues for these team games; they did not pass them by in this hotel either. </p><p>  For those who just want to get involved in sports, schools are opened where you can take tennis, golf courses, learn to dance, scuba dive and go through the basics of windsurfing. </p>

    <p>  When booking a room, you should carefully familiarize yourself with its contents, since many of them do not have air conditioning, which in the heat of +30 degrees does not please at all.  It is better to take more expensive apartments than spoil your entire impression of Croatia. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Hotel Medena, having a category of only 3 stars, offers a wide range of entertainment and services to its guests: </p><ul><li>  minigolf, tennis and table tennis; </li><li>  diving and tennis court; </li><li>  sauna and massage; </li><li>  darts and bike rental; </li><li>  bowling; </li><li>  first-aid post; </li><li>  children's playground and beach on the first line. </li></ul><p>  It features a hairdresser, laundry service, internet parlor and parking.  If you rent a car, it is better to do it at a hotel, not at the airport, since it is cheaper here.  The same goes for scooter rentals. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Many hotels in Dalmatia can offer their customers a rich nightlife and other entertainments, but in the ‚ÄúMeden‚Äù the entertainment itself is silent.  There is a dance floor and bowling alley, and all nightclubs, attractions, concerts and in general cultural and <span>nightlife</span> are held in Split or Trogir.  Since it‚Äôs easy to get to these cities and return to the hotel, many guests have fun. </p><p>  Those who are used to taking care of themselves and taking care of their body will enjoy a sauna and massage services during the day.  The fitness center will help tone the muscles. </p>

    <h2>  Attractions near the hotel </h2><p>  Too controversial opinions about the hotel from those who rested in Medena Hotel 3 * (Croatia).  Reviews of attractions located close to it, on the contrary, are always the most enthusiastic. </p><p>  So, from natural monuments, you should definitely visit the Cetin gorge, along which the river of the same name flows.  It formed amazingly beautiful grottoes and waterfalls, the highest of which is 48 meters.  This is a favorite place for those who want to take the most beautiful views of Croatia with them, and those who prefer rafting and kayaking to the beach. </p>

    <p>  Once the Romans erected several defensive fortresses on the top of the gorge, the ruins of which can be observed today. </p><p>  If you go on an excursion to Trogir, then you should pay attention to several objects: </p><ul><li>  The cathedral built in 1123.  It is perfectly preserved and still accepts believers.  Outside, the walls of the cathedral are painted with images of the apostles, and the interior was created by the disciple of the great Donatello - Nicola Florentinets. </li><li>  The old part of Trogir also cannot be missed.  Wander through the narrow streets, feel yourself in the Middle Ages, then sit on the street in a cafe and drink a cup of coffee to return to the 21st century.  Here, numerous shops offer various souvenirs and crafts of local craftsmen at very reasonable prices, so that rarely anyone leaves without a purchase. </li></ul><p>  Anyone who wants more impressions should go to the larger and richer Split.  It will take more time, but the experience is worth it.  Here it is worth inspecting: </p><ul><li>  The aqueduct, built during the Roman Empire by decree of Diocletian.  It is perfectly preserved, therefore makes a strong impression. </li><li>  The palace of the emperor Diocletian, who at one time was the largest in Europe.  Its area is 4500 m <sup>2</sup> .  To our time, only a small part has been preserved of it, but it also gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow magnificent the building was. </li><li>  The Temple of Jupiter is another architectural masterpiece that has come down to our days since antiquity. </li></ul><p>  For the sake of the impressions that <span>Croatia sights</span> leave behind <span>,</span> you can choose a vacation in an economy-class hotel, although if you take into account that Medena is a state resort, it can be called very decent. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of vacationers, the Hotel Medena 3 * is suitable for people who prefer a quiet relaxing holiday by the sea without too much fuss and noise.  Fans of entertainment and noisy parties will be disappointed. </p><p>  This hotel provides middle-income people with the opportunity to relax in one of the most beautiful countries in Europe, so there are always customers here. </p>
