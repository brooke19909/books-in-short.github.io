Sometimes corporations suffer from a lack of customers, sometimes they experience incredible success.  A huge contribution is made by the founder, who, together with his brainchild, experiences all the ups and downs. </p><p>  <span>Konosuke Matsushite</span> had to overcome a difficult path <span>.</span>  This is the founder of Panasonic, whose production country is Japan.  In 1918, he decided to create a corporation that would be engaged in the development and production of equipment. </p><h2>  Founder </h2><p>  But any story of the company begins with its founder.  Panasonic, whose manufacturing country is Japan, was created, as already noted, in 1918.  Then Matsushita turned 24 years old.  It is unlikely that the young man assumed that in the future his brainchild would turn into a corporation known for its technology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gigazine.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Founder of Panasonic" class="if uuid-2815263" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2815263.jpg"></div><p>  Konosuke was born in 1894.  His family was not poor, as they owned small property.  Matsushita had seven brothers and sisters.  But at some point, the well-being of the family was shaken, and at 9 years old the boy had to go to work.  Because of this, he was deprived of a good education. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of Konosuke's first works was a service at a bicycle store.  Even then, the father predicted that his son would soon be able to hire people with education.  But while Matsushita was fond of electronics and various inventions.  Working in one of the leading companies at that time, he dreamed of starting his own business.  So there was a small company, "Matsushita Danki."  Then no one knew about Panasonic, whose country of manufacture was Konosuke's homeland. </p><h2>  About company </h2><p>  At the moment, Panasonic Corporation is a large corporation originally from Japan, which is engaged in the production of household appliances and electronic goods.  The headquarters of the company is located in Osaka.  In 2011, it was one of the 50 most successful corporations in the world. </p><p>  Few people know, but the company got its current name only 10 years ago.  Until that moment, she was named after her founder, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.  But Panasonic is the brand name of the company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panasonic Headquarters" class="if uuid-2815255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2815255.jpg"></div><h2>  Company work </h2><p>  Panasonic's Japanese technology is world famous.  Now the company has more than 600 enterprises.  Among the most popular are: </p><ul><li>  Panasonic with its home appliances designed for the mass market. </li><li>  Technics, producing audio equipment, including professional musical equipment. </li><li>  Lumix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe most famous brand of digital cameras. </li></ul><p>  Some enterprises operate in individual regions.  So, National remained popular in its homeland, but with its household appliances never went beyond Japan.  But Quasar is a home appliance division in North America. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Company production </h2><p>  In the CIS countries, not all Panasonic products have become popular.  But the most common options still turned out to be eminent and are used by our compatriots. </p><p>  For example, for home, you can purchase home audio and video equipment, photo and video cameras, telephones and multifunction devices.  You can often find appliances for the kitchen: bread machines, slow cookers, microwave ovens, etc. The manufacturer also offers products for beauty and health: electric shavers, hair dryers, toothbrushes, etc. </p><p>  Household appliances include irons and air purifiers, air conditioners and batteries are popular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ynicio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The work of Konosuke Matsushita" class="if uuid-2815271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2815271.jpg"></div><p>  Panasonic products (Japan) for business turned out to be no less popular.  The manufacturer offers data storage systems, telecommunication products and computer solutions.  There is also a whole range of professional equipment: video cameras, audio systems, etc. But such products are not so popular because they are designed for narrow specialists. </p><h2>  Audio and video equipment </h2><p>  In this segment, TVs have become the most popular.  Of course, Samsung is far from Samsung, but it obviously does not try to defeat the Korean manufacturer.  Nevertheless, among Panasonic products there are a large number of devices that are suitable for any buyer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The cost of TVs can also be different.  For example, you can buy the TX-77EZR1000 - a model from Panasonic for 999,990 rubles.  It has 4K resolution, a diagonal of 77 inches and a huge number of new-fangled "chips": image formation, playback modes, local dimming technology, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kristalova.lupa.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panasonic TVs" class="if uuid-2816576" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2816576.jpg"></div><p>  But this does not mean at all that the manufacturing country of Panasonic focuses only on buyers with high incomes.  There are also budget TV options - TX-32ER250ZZ for 15 thousand rubles.  This is a simple model, with a diagonal of 32 inches and a resolution of 1366 √ó 768. </p><p>  But to the audio and video equipment include not only televisions.  Sound systems are of good quality.  A good option would be SC-UX100EE for 10 thousand rubles.  This is a budget version of the mini-player that runs at 300 watts and plays many popular formats. </p><h2>  Headphones from Panasonic </h2><p>  Headphones also turned out to be a successful and popular product of the company.  The devices come in different models: droplets, wireless, gaming, for sports, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestproducts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacuum Headphones Panasonic" class="if uuid-2815297" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2815297.jpg"></div><p>  Vacuum headphones turned out to be the most popular, since it was the manufacturer who made the emphasis on them.  They come in different shapes and colors, and their cost ranges from 300 rubles to 3-4 thousand.  Buyers note good sound and durability. </p><p>  <span>Panasonic headphones</span> also come with a microphone.  Among them there are both vacuum and full-size models.  And despite the excellent sound of the speakers, problems occur with the microphone.  Some users have complained that this part of the headset often breaks. </p><h2>  Cameras &amp; Camcorders </h2><p>  Another popular Panasonic product.  The country of origin is focused on photo makers, as well as ordinary users.  Therefore, in the product catalog you can find ordinary ‚Äúsoap dishes‚Äù and professional video cameras. </p><p>  For 15 thousand rubles, you can get the HC-V260EE.  This is a model of a video camera that shoots in HD resolution.  This is one of the easiest cameras for family shooting.  There is everything that is necessary for the amateur: simple setup, good quality of the clips and easy operation. </p><p>  But for professionals, the company prepared the HC-X1 for 210 thousand rubles.  This is a camera that shoots videos in 4K resolution.  It has excellent zoom, fine-tuning, standard modes and great sound.  The device can record videos and take photos. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panasonic Camera" class="if uuid-2816577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2816577.jpg"></div><h2>  Smartphones from Panasonic </h2><p>  In this segment of the company so far has not been able to achieve success.  But every year she tries to produce a variety of phone models that could interest the audience. </p><p>  The Eluga line has become popular.  In 2018, the Eluga I7 model was released.  This is a smartphone familiar to everyone, without an outstanding design.  Inside, a fairly standard "filling" for everyday tasks.  The model works with a 4000 mAh battery.  The camera here is also the simplest, which can upset some buyers who hoped for a famous lens. </p><p>  But the most <span>popular smartphone,</span> after which everyone learned that Panasonic, in principle, is engaged in the production of products in this segment, was the Lumix CM1 camera phone.  It will cost the buyer $ 1,000.  It is easy to guess that the main ‚Äúfeature‚Äù of the device was his Leica DC Elmarit camera. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Smartphone Panasonic" class="if uuid-2816578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2816578.jpg"></div><p>  The manufacturer also did not forget to install a powerful processor inside, since a powerful system was needed that would cope with high-quality images.  This all works with 2 GB of RAM, which is now too small, as well as with 16 GB of internal memory, which may also not be enough to store pictures. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  But most of all about products of a particular manufacturer can say reviews.  Depending on the popularity of a product, their number may be different, but in general, you can get an overall picture of the quality of the product. </p><p>  Panasonic TVs receive a lot of positive feedback.  Recently, many successful smart models have been released, which turned out to be of high quality and suitable for customers.  Their cost can vary from 15 thousand to 200-300 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Lumix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe division of the company that has most attracted the attention of users around the world.  Lenses and cameras under this brand are becoming iconic, and many professionals prefer Panasonic.  It is probably impossible to find a user who would be dissatisfied with photographic equipment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.photobyrichard.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leica Lenses" class="if uuid-2815277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2815277.jpg"></div><p>  Positive user reviews also affected the company's phones.  The devices proved to be durable and in some cases served more than 10 years.  Office phones turned out to be of high quality. </p>
