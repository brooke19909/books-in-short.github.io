  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to draw up an inventory of investments</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is known that accountants often have to deal with documents of various kinds.  They must constantly possess all the necessary information, deliver reports and securities on time.  Sometimes an accountant needs to overcome considerable distances in order to bring certain documents.  It is known that if you do not do this within a clearly specified quarterly period, then penalties will not take long.  It turns out that the accountant must not only have time to calculate and complete everything, but also work as a courier and take all the documents to the specified authorities, of which there are many.  How to keep up with all this? </p><p>  Especially for such cases, there is a lifesaver for all accountants and other people who are looking for reliable ways to deliver documents to other authorities.  This, as a rule, has a name - an inventory of investments.  What is this operation and what is it? </p><p>  You come to the post office, fill out the proposed forms in which you write down the names of all the documents you want to send.  The mail worker carefully checks that all documents are in stock.  After that, with it, you seal the envelope and draw up your valuable letter.  Then write the address and send it as intended.  In order for your nerves to be completely calm, you can fill out the act of receiving a letter.  The addressee, having received your message with <span>securities,</span> must confirm receipt by signature.  This form will be sent to you personally in the same way - you will find a confirmation of delivery in your inbox. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Naturally, for a long time, many did not dare to trust postal workers to transfer securities or simply important securities.  The reason is simple: everyone remembers the mass of cases with the loss of a letter.  However, this operation is now clearly visible.  If you made an inventory of investments in a valuable letter, and then sent it to the specified address, this will not happen to you.  It is this procedure that protects you from various kinds of incidents. </p><p>  So, how is the inventory drawn up in a letter?  As a rule, the standard form 107 is used. It can be downloaded on any website, printed and filled out at the office, but it is more correct to do this directly at the post office.  By the way, the list of investments contains the following columns, which you must fill out: ‚ÄúList of investments in‚Äù - 1 line, where you should write a standard phrase - ‚Äúvaluable letter‚Äù, 2 line - ‚ÄúWhere‚Äù, where you write the address of the organization to which you send this message.  3rd line - ‚ÄúIn the name‚Äù.  In it you write the name and initials of the person to whom the message is intended, that is, this is the name of the recipient. </p><p>  Then in the form 107 there will be a table consisting of 4 columns.  1 - this is the serial number of the document, 2 column has a name - ‚ÄúName of objects‚Äù - here you will have to write down the knowledge of each document.  3 column contains the number of documents - here you indicate 1 sheet, 2 or 3 sheets.  And the fourth will contain the value in rubles.  So, in each line, you write the name of the document in the column "name ...", then the number of sheets in 3 columns, and the price in 4. Everything is quite simple. </p><p>  After filling out the table, write - "The total result of the value", for example, 3 sheets, 300 rubles.  Sign in the "Sender" column.  Then, in the ‚ÄúChecked‚Äù line, the employee posts writes his initials, after previewing the package of documents that you send.  And only after that the letter is sealed.  On the envelope, you again write the address, on top of the mail employee notes - ‚ÄúValuable letter‚Äù.  That, in fact, is the whole procedure. </p><p>  Why do I need an inventory of investments?  The fact is that if the letter does not reach its destination, then you can confirm the fact of sending using checks that will be issued to you by mail.  In addition, the inventory of the attachment will be registered in the database of the post office, the services of which you used.  And then you can prove your innocence if the documents do not come to this or that organization on time.  Although this will not happen: an inventory of investments is a reliable way to transfer valuable documents from the sender to the recipient. </p>
