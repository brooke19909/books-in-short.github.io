But most of them are still prompted by fantasy. </p><h2>  What is scrapbooking? </h2><p>  If you try to define this type of handicraft, then the name itself can be translated as "book of clippings."  And initially the products in this technique were just more like collages from pictures, photographs and drawings.  The word scrapbook itself translates to scrapbook. </p><p>  Later, this type of creativity was somewhat modified.  Only the idea remained basic: the creation of objects (usually made of paper or cardboard), with which you can save the story of family, love, friendship or personal life. </p>

A creative person will find ideas for inspiration everywhere! </p><p>  You can decorate the product with badges, emblems, pebbles, dried plants brought from tourist trips.

    <p>  This technique is suitable for work done in American or European styles, for shabby chic products - airy, romantically elegant, exquisitely luxurious.  Yes, and in the heritage, the so-called ‚Äúheritage‚Äù style, and vintage, or otherwise - distress, based on artificially aged details, it is very appropriate. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Very often make out photo album applications.  Often use this technique in other products, where the main style is scrapbooking.  Ideas for inspiration for beginners: postcards decorated with applications, greeting wall newspapers, posters, panels, boxes and wallets, napkins for nightstands, photo frames. </p><h2>  Volumetric application </h2><p>  It is possible to use an envelope as a part of applications.  Then the product acquires an additional function: they put money into it as a gift, a letter or tickets to the theater, on a camping trip and the like. </p>

    <p>  But sometimes the master uses an application of paper, gluing parts not completely on the base, but only partially, using gaskets that hold the middle of the application and the part itself.  Then it will rise above the surface, creating volume. </p><p>  As a gasket, pieces of thick cardboard or cardboard rings glued to the edge are used. </p><p>  The inscriptions made in the technique of volume application look beautiful.  The wizard does not cut out the letters of the inscription, leaving the bottom part.  Then the letters are folded up, and contrast paper is laid down under the holes. </p><h2>  Stamping </h2><p>  Usually this technique is rarely dominant in work, but it is secondary, coupled with others. </p><p>  Stamping is the creation of original creative effects using stamps, inks and applicators.  To work in this technique requires a special device.  It is called a stamp, or seal. </p><p>  This device is most often purchased in stores or made to order in special workshops.  But you can make wonderful stamps yourself at home in order to be able to make a creative little thing in scrapbooking style. </p><p>  For beginners, the ideas of stamps can be quite simple: triangles and circles, zigzags and squares, from which it is easy to create a colorful ornament.  The desired pattern is cut out on the half of the potato so that the printed part protrudes above the rest of the surface.  Unfortunately, such a stamp is short-lived - the potato dries, losing its elasticity and shape. </p><h2>  Sublimation </h2><p>  This technique is very close to stamping.  It is based on the fact that the master transfers drawings to the product from printed materials - newspapers and magazines.  To do this, the selected picture or photograph is applied with the colorful side to where it is planned to receive the image, and on the reverse side they are moistened with solvent using a conventional swab. </p><p>  And if the drawing you like is not found on the paper, but even on the Internet?  Then transfer it easily using the sublimation technique. </p><p>  The desired picture is first mirrored in some image manipulation program - flipped from left to right.  Then print it on special paper - for sublimation, thermal transfer, freezer or photographic glossy.  Further, the transfer algorithm practically repeats what has already been described: impose a pattern and moisten with a solvent. </p><p>  As already mentioned, this technique is used in combination with others, for example, with applications.  You can create wonderful things in scrapbooking style.  Ideas for a photo album include, for example, a book of fairy tales.  On the sheets carry illustrations of the necessary works.  Then on a fabulous landscape place a photograph of the baby. </p><p>  You can also tell those creative people who love scrapbooking ideas for inspiration: for sure no one has a photo album with pages where the pictures are attached to the background of Martian or lunar landscapes!  With the help of sublimation, there is the option of creating a variety of background images on the pages: exotic landscapes, grandiose events, historical temporary paintings and others. </p><p>  You can also create a postcard, booklet, baby book. </p><h2>  Vintage </h2><p>  In another way, this direction is called distressing.  Masters very often resort to this method of working on crafts in scrapbooking style. </p>

    <p>  Vintage, or distress, is the artificial aging of pages, clippings, photographs.  Typically, this technique is used to give a special touch to the individual details that make up the scrapbooking item. </p><p>  In addition to aged photos, clippings from old newspapers or magazines are used to create a retro page in this direction.  If there are none, they are found on the Internet and printed out, and the <span>paper</span> itself is <span>wrinkled,</span> giving it a yellowish ‚Äútemporary‚Äù hue, tearing the edges. </p><p>  Logging, which is used in vintage, can very well be done manually.  Only the text that the master will write must be sustained in time: using ancient letters, ornate phrases, Old Russian words.  Calligraphy is also worth taking care of.  You can write both in written letters and imitate an old typewriter. </p><p>  Keys and locks with a touch of rust look wonderful here, metal mechanisms from old watches, beads and colored feathers. </p><h2>  Embroidery scrapbooking </h2><p>  Often, instead of glue, craftsmen use a sewing needle and thread.  However, paper products ‚Äúdo not like‚Äù touching a sewing needle.  But if this technique is partially used in the work, for attaching some details - buttons, bows, bells, tassels and the like, then this craft looks luxurious and unusual. </p>

    <p>  Sometimes masters use embroidery in products made in the style of scrapbooking.  Ideas for inspiration - postcards from cardboard, which depict embroidered hearts, insects, fruits. </p><h2>  Crafts made from postcards </h2><p>  If anyone remembers, then our grandmothers and great-grandmothers made lovely boxes and <span>boxes from postcards,</span> sheathed their edges with a sewing seam, and then connecting the walls with threads, grabbing the details for this same basting.  Having successfully selected postcards on the subject, you can create a real masterpiece in the style of scrapbooking.  Ideas for inspiration, as already mentioned, can be drawn from the past.  And to create in this technique not only a box, but also a luxurious vase, a stand for a table lamp, a wall "pocket" for small things. </p>

    <p>  However, this craft will be difficult to attribute to scrapbooking, as it does not have the most important point - the presence of clippings and photos.  Therefore, you need to stick something on them before you start stitching the parts.  Only then can it be called the beautiful word ‚Äúscrapbooking‚Äù.  Ideas for inspiration: the baby‚Äôs photo is located on one of the walls of the box, which is cut from a card with a picture of a blossoming flower;  the face of a smiling girl is glued instead of the face of the Snow Maiden;  the physiognomy of a little boy peeps out of the porthole of a rocket.  Such crafts can not be called otherwise than scrapbooking. </p><h2>  Embossing Design Ideas </h2><p>  The most interesting direction in scrapbooking is the creation of voluminous convex paintings.  For their manufacture using an application of grains, seeds, shells, cones and other natural materials.  Also, masters resort to working with cotton and sintepon. </p><p>  Decorating crafts with pieces of lace, buttons, rhinestones, beads and small low beads, bows is very appropriate in this technique. </p>
