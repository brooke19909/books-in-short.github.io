    <p>  The founder of the clan, Dokhturov Kirill Ivanovich, arrived in Russia from Constantinople during the time of Ivan the Terrible.  This noble family name is included in the genealogy books of 3 provinces: Oryol, Tula and Ryazan.  The future general Dokhturov was the son of Sergei Dokhturov, who retired with the rank of captain of the life guard of the famous <span>Preobrazhensky regiment.</span>  The future general from infantry received a military education at the highest class educational institution - Page of His Imperial Majesty Corps.  He began serving with the rank of lieutenant, the Life Guardsman of the elite <span>Semenovsky regiment</span> - this was in 1781.  In 1784 he became a lieutenant-captain, in 1788 - a captain. </p><h2>  Brilliant career </h2><p>  For being wounded, he did not leave the battlefield in the battle between Sweden and Russia near the fortified city of Rochensalm, and later near Vyborg, he was awarded the Golden Sword.  He always showed miracles of courage and military talent, but especially D.S. Dokhturov distinguished himself after the Napoleonic invasion.  Having escaped from the encirclement, the general from infantry Dokhturov took command of the 6th Infantry Corps on himself, passing 60 miles a day, broke away violently </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the general from infantry dohturov took" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/566869.jpg" width="220"></div>  pursued by the French.  His corps united with the First Army, whose commander was Barclay de Tolly.  On his instructions, D.S. Dokhturov led the defense of Smolensk and fought back 10 hours from the brutal attacks of the French, thus giving the main forces the opportunity to withdraw to Moscow.  In the famous battle of Borodino, under his command was the center of the Russian army.  After wounding Bagration, the general from the infantry Dokhturov assumed the role of commander of the Second Army, defending the left wing with <span>bagration flushes.</span>  He firmly established himself in position, bringing the troops upset after Bagration‚Äôs wound to the battle formation.  In the report, M.I. Kutuzov noted the continued firmness of D.S. Dokhturov and the fact that he, having assumed the command, further did not surrender a centimeter of his positions.

Dokhturov also commanded the center.  But his most important merit in the campaign of 1812 was the defense of Maloyaroslavets.  The fact is that Napoleon‚Äôs troops mercilessly plundered and ruined everything that was located along the Smolensk road, along which they went to Moscow.  The French had to retreat in a different way.  And, heroically defending Maloyaroslavets for a day and a half, the brilliant Russian general from infantry Dmitry Sergeyevich Dokhturov did everything to direct Napoleon to the legendary Smolensk road, the retreat along which finished an invincible army.  "Smolensk road" has become a common noun and means a humiliating and complete defeat.  For the battle near Maloyaroslavets, Dmitry Dokhturov was honored to become a knight of the Order of St. George of the second class.  The Russian hero was distinguished in all subsequent battles with Napoleon: </p><ul><li>  near Dresden; </li><li>  <span>"Battle of the Nations" near Leipzig</span> ; </li><li>  siege of Magdeburg and Hamburg. </li></ul><p>  After many wounds received, the general left for treatment in Bohemia in 1814, but in 1815, during his second campaign against France, he returned and commanded a significant part of the Russian army (the right wing). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian general from infantry" class="if" height="474" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/566870.jpg" width="572"></div>  Married Dokhturov D.S. was on the sister of <span>Prince Obolensky, a</span> representative of one of the best Russian families.  Numerous injuries could not but affect the general‚Äôs health, and, having retired after the French company, he died when he arrived in Moscow.  Obviously, the hardships of the road affected.  The hero was buried in the monastery of the Moscow Patriarchate - Ascension David Desert.
