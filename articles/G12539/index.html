    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Makopse village is located in the coastal zone of Lazarevsky district.  The administrative center is 16 kilometers away.  From the west, the village is washed by the waters of the Black Sea, from the east it is surrounded by the Caucasus Mountains.  The distance to the city of Tuapse is about 30 kilometers.  The whole village is stretched along the coastal zone and, as mentioned above, is conditionally divided into the Upper and Lower Makops.  Not far from it there are small villages - Vishnevka and Golubaya Dacha. </p><p>  A railroad runs along the coast.  On it, you can get by train to both Tuapse and Lazarevsky and Sochi.  If you need to go to Nizhny Makops, it is best to go out at the Druzhba station. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in makops" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1944513.jpg" width="600"></div>

It was then that a railway was laid here, a platform was built, near which the train stopped to pick up passengers.  But the locals do not agree with this assumption.  They claim that the Upper and Lower Makopsse have existed since time immemorial.  Earlier there lived tribes of Circassians, who gave the name to this village. </p><p>  Translated from the Adyghe language, the word "makopse" means "hay river".  Meku is mowed grass, and dogs are a river.  The history of the origin of this particular settlement has not been studied, but one thing is certain: after the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878, the Greeks moved here from Turkey, who bought these lands and accepted Russian citizenship. </p>
