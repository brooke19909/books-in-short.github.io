    <p>  Gourmets who want to visit places where they offer not just delicious food, but a high class service, in Tula there is where to turn around.  One of the iconic places is the Respect restaurant, which is called the most status and respectable in the city. European cuisine is presented here, and the institution itself also has a bar and a summer terrace. This is an expensive restaurant, but visitors always note the high class of service and quality of food, and also an interesting location in an old mansion in the city center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The restaurant "Library" is very popular due to its unique design and excellent cuisine.  It attracts not only the concept of a book restaurant with a thematic style, but also real French cuisine with a chef from France.  It serves Burgundy snails, foie gras, onion gratine and other dishes that you expect to find in a similar institution. </p><h2>  Author's Restaurants </h2><p>  Today, any major Russian city boasts several experimental restaurants with unique author's cuisine.  In Tula, such a place is “Fox hole”, where they prepare dishes mainly from meat using their own technologies, and also serve authentic tinctures and fruit drinks.  Of the positive reviews - delicious and inexpensive cuisine, large portions.  Of the negative - it is crowded and noisy. </p><p>  The so-called public-format restaurants are not a new phenomenon in Europe and the United States.  These are democratic institutions with the most diverse cuisine, affordable and attractive for everyone, regardless of social status, wealth, age or preference.  Such a plan is the relatively new <span>Tula restaurant Public.</span>  Reviews praise the varied and for the most part delicious cuisine, as well as impeccable service. </p><h2>  Cheap family restaurants </h2><p>  In addition to pretentious and expensive establishments, there is always a need for small quiet places for family leisure.  Are there any restaurants in Tula?  Yes, for example, “Plate” and “Guests”. </p>

    <p>  “Plate” is represented in the city by two institutions, but what is more popular is that in the Gostiny Dvor shopping center, largely due to the open balcony.  The food here is tasty and inexpensive, there is a business lunch.  The restaurant “Guests” is more respectable.  Tula appreciates the fact that the institution is aimed at guests with children - there is a children's menu and high chairs.  And on weekends, the restaurant awaits a more adult audience and offers unobtrusive live music. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And the little gourmets of Tula like the Chocolate Cafe.  There is a huge selection of sweets and pastries, but you can have a tight lunch or dinner.  For children there is a play corner and high chairs. </p><h2>  Beer Restaurants in Tula </h2><p>  This is a very popular format of establishments in recent years.  Usually you can try non-standard types of beer and eat not just an appetizer, but a full-fledged dish from the chef. </p><p>  One of the most popular places of this kind is the “Pyotr Petrovich” brewery.  Foam drink lovers who have already been here celebrate really tasty beer.  There are many varieties, so guests are offered tasting sets.  In addition to beer, praise the cuisine - hearty, delicious and varied dishes at an affordable price. </p><p>  There are restaurants in Tula and stylized as German pubs, such as Muller and Frau Marta, but they are less popular among residents.  But the sports bar “Soviet Sport” is a good example of a good beer house.  However, this is not just a place where you can watch the broadcast of the match behind a mug of foamy drink.  The local chef is really interested in keeping the fans full.  The menu is small, but all the dishes are of high quality and delicious. </p><h2>  Banquet rooms and restaurants for special occasions </h2><p>  One of the most interesting places in this segment can be considered the restaurant "Sudar".  Tula is an old Russian city, and “Sudar” successfully plays on this topic.  This place is made in accordance with the Russian noble style - beautiful decoration of halls, traditional Russian cuisine, grace and charm of an old noble estate make the place popular for wedding ceremonies. </p>

    <h2>  Restobars </h2><p>  The format of the restobar is far from new in the world, but a wave of interest in such informal institutions is gradually rising in Russia.  In the afternoon and on weekdays it is a more democratic restaurant, and in the evening and on weekends - a noisy bar where people come to drink and chat.  But a good cuisine, albeit not with an extensive menu, is an indispensable attribute of this format. </p><p>  Among such establishments in Tula, the “Check in” bar can be noted.  The menu here is standard for restobar - salads, steaks, burgers.  Visitors praise grilled dishes and note the democratic prices. </p><p>  Similar places with a cozy atmosphere, delicious dishes and an excellent bar are the Tower and Chile Bar. </p>

    <p>  Another tasty place on the city map is the restaurant “Spices and Joys”.  Locals advise to book tables in advance, as it is always crowded here.  And no wonder - the food is tasty, the portions are large, and the service is sincere.  By the way, this is the number 1 restaurant in the city according to TripAdvisor. </p><p>  And in the restaurant complex “Aida” you can try Azerbaijani cuisine, 50 types of barbecue and many meat dishes.  However, reviews caution to take salads and pay attention to paid entry on days with live music. </p><p>  Of course, this is far from all the institutions of the city, on the map of Tula there is a wide variety of different <span>restaurants, bars, cafes</span> with excellent cuisine and a pleasant atmosphere. </p>
