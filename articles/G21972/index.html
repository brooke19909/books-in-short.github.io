Modern buildings, motorways and beautiful <span>parks of Moscow</span> appear <span>,</span> where you can take a walk in any season.  Each season, they are beautiful in their own way.  Each resident of the city chooses his own, the only square where he feels cozy and comfortable.  In this article we will introduce you to the most beautiful parks in Moscow. </p><h2>  Park them.  Gorky </h2><p>  It was founded in 1928.  It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than one hundred hectares.  Here are located: amusement park, attractions "Miracle Castle", a video show.  When the rides close in winter, the largest outdoor ice rink in the capital is flooded in the park.  On holidays, popular artists perform here, discos, festivals, various shows are held. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful parks in Moscow" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1027679.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you do not really like extreme rides, then you can use the services of a boat station, where it is easy to rent a catamaran or a boat.  Tennis enthusiasts can enjoy their favorite sport in the equipped areas.  In addition, there are shooting galleries, bars and summer cafes. </p><p>  The most beautiful <span>parks in Moscow,</span> to which this one undoubtedly belongs, pay special attention to the leisure of little guests.  Pony riding, horseback riding, "old" carriages and cycle cars are organized for kids.  This park is always crowded and fun, so if you prefer calm walks, Neskuchny Garden will be more suitable for you.  It is nearby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Boring Garden </h2><p>  According to the townspeople, all the beautiful <span>parks in Moscow</span> are ideal for photo shoots.  And this can be done in summer, winter, early spring, when the square "wakes up."  Beautiful parks in Moscow in the fall are covered with yellow-burgundy decoration and become even more attractive. </p>

    <p>  Neskuchny garden is amazingly picturesque.  The park is located on the right bank of the Moskva River and is considered the oldest green space in the capital.  This is a nature reserve.  Newlyweds come here with pleasure.  And everywhere here you can meet couples in love. </p><p>  The romantic atmosphere of this park is created through a combination of unusually beautiful old architecture and amazing natural landscapes.  There is still a legend associated with the arched bridge, which is located here.  It says that in order for the union of two people to be strong and long, the young must hold hands and go under the bridge.  And if you kiss here, then nothing will be able to separate the lovers.  Everyone can conduct an experiment. </p><h2>  Museon </h2><p>  Beautiful parks in Moscow are very different.  The Museon is located near Gorky Park.  Here you can take a walk in silence, read your favorite book, comfortably sitting on special ottomans or sunbeds, visit concerts, exhibitions, master classes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, in the Museon, everyone can do hatha yoga, visit the open-air sculpture exhibition.  I would especially like to say about the 60-meter fountain, whose width is 14 meters.  It is sometimes called a ‚Äúdry‚Äù fountain, because the edge of the water is located on the same level with paving.  He is especially beautiful in the evening when more than four hundred special lamps illuminate him.  This spectacle attracts a huge number of people to the park who want to see this action with their own eyes. </p><h2>  Sparrow Hills </h2><p>  It is good to hide in the summer heat in the shade of sprawling trees.  But many people love beautiful Moscow parks in the fall, when they are painted in a variety of shades, and fallen leaves rustle underfoot. </p><p>  This park is located on top of the Sparrow Hills.  It offers an unforgettable panoramic view - the Moscow River, Novodevichy and Andrievsky Monasteries, the Luzhniki Stadium.  In addition, from here you can see the beautiful skyscrapers of Moscow City and the Shukhov Tower.  In addition to vacationers, the park is often visited by artists who are inspired by the beauty of these places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful parks of Moscow where you can take a walk" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1027684.jpg" width="550"></div>
