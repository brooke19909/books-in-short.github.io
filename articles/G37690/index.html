Products decorated with them can be found in the closets of every fashionista and become the favorites of many designers. </p><p>  But still, what is it?  How did this decor element appear, how is it used, and how can you decorate your things with it? </p><h2>  Definition </h2><p>  A sequin is a small shiny disk, often made of colored metallized foil or plastic, used to decorate women's clothing, accessories and to decorate theater costumes.  Necessarily has a hole for sewing to the fabric.  The shape can be not only round, there are square, oval sequins, as well as in the form of flowers or leaves.  They are not only flat, but also concave. </p>

    <p>  There is evidence that <span>Indian saris</span> were decorated with small rounds of pure gold as early as 2500 <span>BC,</span> similar discs were found in Egyptian tombs.  Some theories claim that a sequin is a descendant of small coins that were sewn onto clothes.  This was done not only in order to demonstrate his wealth, but also to keep it to himself and in sight all the time.  It was also believed that the brilliance of precious metals drives away evil spirits.  Therefore, it cannot be said that soldering is a modern invention.  But, of course, over time, it changed greatly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sequins embroidered outfits of crowned persons, and in the 1920s.  they were at the height of fashion.  But wearing a <span>sparkling dress</span> was not easy - because then the shiny discs were made only of metal, and the weight of the costume was significant.  Soon light sequins of gelatin appeared, but as soon as they were heated or wet, they melted. </p><p>  This was a serious drawback, so the search for the optimal solution continued.  In the 40s of the XX century, sequins based on a film for photography appeared, and in the 60s - from vinyl. </p><p>  In Russian, the name "sequin (sequin)" comes from the French word paillette - "gold". </p><h2>  How to sew on sequins manually </h2><p>  How to decorate the simplest t-shirt or dress?  Of course, adding her shine.  But not so simple.  Do you know <span>how to sew sequins</span> manually so that they lie flat and are securely fastened?  It is worth spending some time to understand the process and not redo everything twice.  For work you will need: </p><ul><li>  Sequins. </li><li>  Beads. </li><li>  Thin needle. </li><li>  Strong thread.  Its color should not be selected to match the tone of the fabric, but to match the sequins, so that it is as invisible as possible.  Sometimes use a transparent kapron thread. </li><li>  Base fabric (felt in the example). </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  <span>Marker for fabric.</span>  If you need to sew sequins in a certain order, it is better to first outline the outline of the pattern. </li><li>  Clasp for brooches (optional). </li></ul><h2>  Master Class </h2><p>  Sequins can be sewn in two main ways: with and without bead.  Using the example of a charming <span>felt brooch,</span> we will consider both methods. </p><ol><li>  Secure the thread with a bundle from the inside.  In the photo it is made very large so that it can be seen. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew sequins manually" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/709068.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Bring the needle to the front side, thread the sequin and bead. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew sequins manually" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/709069.jpg" width="600"></div>  You get a loop that secures both elements in place. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sequins beads" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/709070.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Pull the thread and again make a knot on the wrong side.  This is necessary so that each solder is fixed separately.  So, if the thread breaks somewhere in the process of socks or washing, all your spangles will not sprinkle one after another. </li><li>  Now we fix the decorative element without a bead.  We bring the needle to the front side, put on the sequin and make a stitch from the center to the edge. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="master class soldering" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/709071.jpg" width="600"></div>  Repeat the operation, otherwise the circle will move.  For greater reliability, make three stitches. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="master class soldering" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/709072.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Now we close all the free space with sequins, make another heart for the wrong side, sew the fastener and you can collect the brooch. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric with sequins" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/709073.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  Brilliant exit </h2><p>  Fabric with sequins allows you to create luxurious outfits that attract the eye.  But also from it you can make small decorative elements that diversify even a simple everyday thing, such as this sweater. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric with sequins" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/709075.jpg" width="304"></div>

This is caused not only by the fact that it is difficult to work with fabric, but also by the fact that a complex cut will overload the image and distract attention from the sparkle of sequins. </li><li>  Carefully lay out the fabric before starting to cut.  Be sure to place the sequins in one direction and face down.  You cannot cut two parts at the same time.  Also, in the process, you will have many fragments of sequins, so put a cloth or film for easy cleaning and put on glasses so as not to damage your eyes.  Leave at least 2 cm as a seam allowance.  Sequins quickly blunt the scissors, so do not use your loved ones. </li><li>  Thin soft sequins can be stitched with a thick sewing needle. </li><li>  If the sequins are made of dense material, it is better to mark the seams and cut them along this line so that the sewing process is quick and there are no broken needles.  But do not cut the thread that holds them, but cut the plastic round pieces themselves.  It is also advisable to wear glasses when working. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric with sequins" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/709074.jpg" width="500"></div></li><li>  Sew slowly in a zigzag seam.  Never use an overlock. </li><li>  If bald patches form along the seam line, cut the sequins from a spare piece of fabric and wash them by hand where necessary.  If some sparkles are bent and stick out, cut them with small scissors. </li><li>  When ironing the seams, be extremely careful: the sequins are made of plastic and can easily melt, so set the iron to a low temperature and use a cotton backing. </li><li>  Most likely, the seams will be unpleasant to the touch, so make a lining. </li></ul><h2>  Sparkling floristry </h2><p>  Flowers from sequins can be of different levels of complexity: from luxurious for evening and dance costumes to basic, with which you can decorate a children's headband. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sequin flowers" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/709076.jpg" width="570"></div>
