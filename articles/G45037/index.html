Purity of faith and freedom</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Beginning in the fourteenth century, change begins in Europe.  The medieval ascetic nature of life changes to secular.  This is due to the growth of cities and the increasing influence of merchants, bankers, artisans, artisans.  A man at this time began to be regarded as a free person. </p><h2>  Ideals of purity </h2><p>  In Catholicism, many sought to see not the licentiousness of the monks and the Papal Curia, but the purity of their behavior, close to the commandments of the Gospel.  But in fact this was not.  Most of all, people were outraged by the sale of indulgences, which in Latin means "condescension."  For money, without praying and fasting, without judging oneself, one could buy forgiveness from the monks for committed sins.  It was also not clear where this money was going, as artisans and bankers were good at saving and counting.  And there is a movement that, like a fire of fire, will sweep the whole of Northern Europe and which will be called the Reformation, that is, the renewal of the Church.  The Reformation in Europe, the renewal of Christianity, will be laid in Germany by Luther. </p><h2>  Tempting ideas and thoughts </h2><p>  Martin Luther (1483‚Äì1546) came from a poor family, where flogging was the main educational moment.  But this intelligent, capable and deeply religious person went to the monastery to comprehend Christian wisdom, read the Bible in the original, study the works of the best preachers.  To his horror, he quickly figured out how far the Church and the Pope, whom he simply deified, were from the <span>commandments of Christ.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the beginning of the reformation in Europe, the renewal of Christianity" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1054882.jpg" width="342"></div>  The authority of the Pope was absolute, and for him there was no judge on earth.  In papal palaces feasted, behaved loosely, and all this penetrated into the monastic environment.  The monks ate sweetly, drank fine wines, did not stick to fasts, took exorbitant money from the population, owned rich lands.  This could not be reconciled with the <span>gospel commandments.</span>  And he created a new doctrine that marked the beginning of the <span>Reformation in Europe, the</span> renewal of Christianity.  His main ideas were:

    <h2>  France </h2><p>  From France, Jean Calvin (1509-1564) arrived in Geneva, hiding in an independent Protestant Geneva.  A lawyer by training, he began to study theology, as well as the works of Luther, and became a Protestant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reformation in Europe Christianity Update Grade 7" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1054143.jpg" width="372"></div>  He successfully performs in the city with sermons.  In his work, Calvin is stricter than Luther, approaches the Christian teaching.  He considers it necessary to eliminate all pomp and adornment in the church, to prohibit dancing and singing, loud laughter, that is, entertainment: a person must save the soul.  In France, he, an exile, has supporters called the Huguenots.  Bloody reprisals and religious wars are waged with them (1562-1594).  This continues the beginning of the Reformation in Europe, the renewal of Christianity.

    <h2>  England </h2><p>  The ideas of reformism penetrate into England.  Henry VIII (1491-1547) actively supports them, becoming the head of the <span>Church of England</span> and destroying the power of the Pope, giving him the authority of the bishop of Canterbury.  All religious services - baptism, weddings, funeral services - are performed by Anglican priests in English, regardless of Rome.  Moreover, they have the right to start families, which was completely impossible in Catholicism.  There were no other deviations from Catholicism in England.  The people actively support the reforms of Henry VIII, smashing the monasteries.  It was in England that the beginning of the Reformation in Europe, the renewal of Christianity.  England was the first to leave the power of the Pope. </p><h2>  Netherlands </h2><p>  In Flanders, Protestants are fighting the occupying forces of Spain.  Wealthy bankers, poor townspeople, and artisans are equally unwilling to give money to the church.  They founded their Protestant state, dropping the power of Catholic Spain in the 16th century. </p><p>  The destruction of medieval institutions marked the beginning of the Reformation in Europe, the renewal of Christianity.  Briefly, it can be stated that a person is saved by faith himself, regardless of the church.  Only scripture should serve a person as support and support.  This was the beginning of the Reformation in Europe, the renewal of Christianity.  Grade 7 should represent that a painful split has practically occurred, preserved and fully entrenched to this day.  But today it is perceived naturally. </p>
