  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sociology of personality</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sociology of personality is a field of sociology that <span>studies the ways,</span> mechanisms, strategies of individual interactions and relationships in society.  Sociology of personality studies the structure of the whole society, sociocultural processes (associated with the process of adaptation in society and socialization).  Also, the sociology of personality is understood as a set of sociologically oriented <span>theories of personality</span> (psychologized, role-based, cultured, etc.). </p><p>  The concept of sociology of personality expresses the integrity of the individual‚Äôs qualities and stable character traits: from the relations of groups and the system of ties, institutions and communities, from his socialization and upbringing into a certain culture, from his activity and stay in a certain situation and socio-cultural environment. </p><p>  The formation and formation of personality is considered in different concepts of education, socialization and upbringing.  These strategies for studying personality, which differ in their conceptual design and methodological grounds, took shape as a whole in the non-classical (neoclassical stage, inclusive), the process of sociological development, which is associated with the ‚Äúdawn‚Äù of topics in sociology and personality issues. </p><p>  An individual (person) simultaneously occupies different positions in society, and is doomed to the sequential or simultaneous fulfillment of roles in society, the loss or acquisition of one or the other. </p><p>  <strong>The object, subject and functions of the sociology of education</strong> . </p><p>  The sociology of education, as a science has its own object and subject. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The object of the sociology of education is the field of social reality in education.  And her subject is relations in the field of education. </p><p>  A number of sciences study the educational system (philosophy, psychology, sociology, pedagogy).  The object of study in all these disciplines is education. </p><p>  Parenting is a process of regular and targeted impact on the physical and spiritual <span>development of a person.</span>  Its purpose is to prepare for cultural, social, industrial activity. </p><p>  Functions: </p><p>  Descriptive - its implementation occurs through the description and systematization of the research materials received regarding education in articles, books, etc. </p><p>  Theoretical - enrichment, increment, expansion of knowledge of sociology about such a social phenomenon as education. </p><p>  Ideological - the formation of sociological ideas and views on education. </p><p>  Information - the collection, systematization, accumulation of sociological information about how the educational process is going on, checking how effective these or other methods and techniques. </p><p>  Transforming - development <span>of a social</span> management system and various methods of influence of more effective social technologies in education for educational management. </p><p>  Predictive - the development of social forecasts of possible changes in the process of education, and what may be the results. </p><p>  Functions in their entirety establish the <span>social role of the</span> sociology of education, its significance and place in society. </p><p>  This science operates in the following main categories: the social environment of education, the micro and macro environment of education, objects and subjects of education, <span>social relations,</span> personality, person. </p><p>  The biographical method in sociology is a multimethodological approach that develops in sociology.  This method is aimed to explore the individual history of a person‚Äôs life, subjective representations of a person about his own life and surrounding reality, expressed in the form of an individual-subjective narrative.  The specificity of the biographical method is its focus on the subjective interpretation of aspects of the life of the organization, group (for example, family), and the individual. </p>
