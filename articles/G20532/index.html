    <p>  Probably, the birthplace of the future communist leader played an important role in the development of his party career.  Mikhail Georgadze, secretary of the Presidium of the <span>Supreme Soviet of the USSR</span> in the future, determined his choice of profession from a young age, enrolling in the mechanization department of an agricultural technical school.  He worked as a tractor driver, and then as a foreman of a tractor brigade. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tbilisi period </h2><p>  The Communist Party of the Soviet state paid great attention to the southern republics.  Georgia specialized mainly in subtropical crops.  High rates of fulfillment of the five-year plan of 1946-1950 were an incentive for the further growth of agriculture. </p><p>  In 1952, to the post of deputy.  M.P. Georgadze is appointed Minister of Agriculture and the Department of Supply of Agricultural Products of the Georgian SSR.  A certain role in this decision was played by the fact that he was a native of Georgia, which meant he had to know the state of affairs ‚Äúfrom within‚Äù.  Career quickly went up.  Two years later, Georgadze headed the Ministry of Agriculture of the GSSR.  In 1954 he became the second secretary of the Communist Party of Georgia, after Mzhavanadze the second state person in the republic. </p><p>  In the spring of 1956, meetings in defense of the "bright" name of Joseph Stalin took place in Gori, Tbilisi and Sukhumi.  They were triggered by a report by N.S.  Khrushchev at a closed meeting dedicated to exposing the "cult of personality." </p><p>  Several hundred thousand people were aggressive, demanding that the head of the government of the republic speak to the people.  Comrade Mzhanavadze arrived on the square, talked for a long time, promising to support the people and not give Stalin an insult.  At the request of members of the government, Marshal of the People's Republic of China, Zhu De, a participant in the <span>Twentieth Congress of the CPSU,</span> spoke on Lenin Square <span>.</span>  From the march to the <span>monument to Stalin,</span> he refused.  The Secretary of the Communist Party of Georgia Mikhail Georgadze went to the monument with two Chinese members of the delegation, one of whom made a speech.  Speeches from Georgadze were not heard. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Moscow period </h2><p>  Not even a year had passed before the Georgian leader was recalled to Moscow.

    <p>  The list of dignitaries convicted of bribery was replenished with new names.  The "Georgadze case" appeared.  The Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, who had sat in the Kremlin since the time of Stalin, turned out to be a great lover of luxury and art.  In the historical chronicles of <span>Igor Bunich</span> , a whole list of the riches found in the hiding places of Georgadze's cottage is given: whole piles of jewelry, diamonds and diamonds, 100 gold bars (20 kg each), $ 2 million and 40 million rubles, valuable paintings by famous artists, among which canvas by Leonardo da Vinci. </p><p>  Investigators were most surprised by the toilet bowls found in the house made of the highest grade gold. </p><h2>  Leaving life </h2><p>  In November 23, 1982, Georgadze committed suicide.  Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR passed away before the end of the investigation.  He was 70 years old. </p><p>  Soon his widow, Tatyana Ivanovna Georgadze, hurriedly left for Tbilisi. </p>
