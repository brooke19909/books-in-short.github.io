    <h2>  Why is there a limit on cash withdrawals at Sberbank ATMs? </h2><p>  This bank, like other similar institutions, ensures that its customers' money is always safe.  Such a security measure is a worldwide practice to limit the withdrawal of large amounts of money by scammers.  Indeed, thanks to this, it will not be possible to immediately withdraw all the money that is on the bank account in one day, and if the card is stolen, the client will have time to block his card. </p><p>  Considering the level of such restrictions, it is necessary to note the different level of cards.  For example, the <span>limit on cash withdrawals</span> at Sberbank ATMs for one card may differ from the basic restrictions of other types of cards.  First of all, this is due to the level of their security.  Gold and platinum status cards are considered more secure than instant or standard types.  Some of them have special integrated chips, which also contribute to increased security. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  You also need to consider that the amount of money that is on the card accounts of a higher class is always an order of magnitude higher compared to various standard student or social cards. </p><h2>  Is it possible to change the established restrictions? </h2><p>  The limit on cash withdrawals at <span>Sberbank ATMs</span> can be changed if it does not suit you.  To do this, you must apply in writing to the service department in the prescribed form, which will be issued to you there.  If you consider the application and make a positive decision, you will change the base limit. </p><p>  Moreover, if you want to reduce it, then a positive result is more likely.  And if you want to increase the limit, then there may be various nuances, using which the bank can refuse you.  After all, it cannot be fully asserted that all banks set such restrictions only in order to protect their customers. </p>

    <p>  Such limits are a great way to avoid the quick extraction of cash resources, which the banking system has been missing so much lately.  After all, while the money of the cardholders is in the bank, the financial institution can manage it for their own purposes.  This is mainly the issuance of various types of loans. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What is the limit for cash withdrawals at Sberbank ATMs? </h2><p>  There are no unified conditions: each card offer has its own conditions that differ from the level of cards issued, as mentioned above. </p><p>  Consider specific credit card limits and three levels of regular debit cards. </p><h2>  By credit card </h2><p>  Plastic cards that imply the presence of credit funds on them, such as Visa Classic, MasterCard Standard, Visa Credit Momentum, MasterCard Credit Momentum, are the most common issued by this bank.  The limit on cash withdrawals at Sberbank ATMs from a credit card of this level is 50 thousand rubles per day.  And if you have a Visa Gold or MasterCard Gold credit card, then you can withdraw up to 100 thousand rubles for the same period of time.  That is, the higher the level of the card, the less restrictions are imposed on it. </p><h2>  By debit cards </h2><p>  Next, we consider the conditions for such types of cards that do not fulfill the functions of lending. </p>

    <p>  The first on the list with the biggest restrictions will be, as already obvious, instant.  The limit on cash withdrawals at Sberbank ATMs using the Maestro card as well as the Electron (Maestro or <span>Visa Electron)</span> is equal to, as is the case with simple credit, 50 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Next in the list are standard-level cards Visa Classic and MasterCard.  You can withdraw up to 150 thousand rubles per day from them.  That is, the restriction on the operation is at a level that exceeds three times the previous level. </p><p>  If we consider the limit on cash withdrawals at ATMs of Sberbank "gold-class" (Visa Gold or MasterCard Gold), then it is equal to 300 thousand rubles.  This amount can be withdrawn within 24 hours. </p><p>  Whether such conditions are good or not, everyone can make a conclusion for himself.  On the part of the state, such restrictions are also a way to prevent various frauds, as well as attempts to <span>launder money.</span> </p><p>  If we consider such limits on the part of their owners, then they are quite satisfied with any average Russian citizen who receives ordinary income. </p><p>  It is also convenient for the banks themselves - you can more clearly control the outflow of cash capital and notice various critical situations in time when fraudulent schemes and theft of funds from customer accounts are carried out. </p>
