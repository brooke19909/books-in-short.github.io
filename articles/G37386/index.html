  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The structure of the cells of a living organism</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It can be said that living organisms are a complex system that performs various functions necessary for normal life.  They are made up of cells.  Therefore, they are divided into multicellular and unicellular.  It is the cell that forms the basis of any organism, regardless of its structure. </p><p><br>  Unicellular organisms have only one <span>type of cell.</span>  In multicellular living organisms, various types of cells are represented, which differ in their functional value.  The study of cells deals with cytology, which includes the science of biology. </p><p><br>  The structure of the cell is almost the same for any type.  They vary in function, size and shape.  The chemical composition is also typical of all cells of living organisms.  The cell contains the main molecules: RNA, proteins, DNA, and elements of polysaccharides and lipids.  Almost 80 percent of the cell is made up of water.  In addition, it contains sugars, nucleotides, amino acids and other products of processes occurring in the cell. </p><p><br>  The structure of the cells of a living organism consists of many components.  The surface of the cell is a membrane.  It allows the cell to penetrate only certain substances.  Between the cell and the membrane is a liquid <span>intercellular substance.</span>  It is the membrane that is the mediator in the metabolic processes occurring between the cell and intercellular fluid. </p><p><br>  The main component of the cell is the cytoplasm.  This substance is a viscous, semi-liquid consistency.  It contains organoids that perform a number of functions.  These include the following components: the cell center, lysosomes, nucleus, mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes and the Golgi complex. Each of these components is necessarily included in the structure of the cell. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p><br>  The entire cytoplasm consists of many tubules and cavities, which are the endoplasmic reticulum.  This whole system synthesizes, accumulates and promotes the organic compounds that the cell produces.  The endoplasmic reticulum is also involved in protein synthesis. </p><p><br>  In addition to it, ribosomes that contain RNA and protein take part in protein synthesis.  The Golgi complex affects the formation of lysosomes and accumulates <span>organic matter.</span>  These are special cavities with bubbles at the ends. </p><p><br>  The cell center contains two bodies involved in <span>cell division.</span>  The cell center is located directly near the nucleus. </p><p><br>  So gradually we got to the main component in the structure of the cell - the nucleus.  This is the most important part of the cell.  It contains the nucleolus, proteins, fats, <span>nucleic acids,</span> carbohydrates and chromosomes.  The entire core inside is filled with nuclear juice.  All information about heredity contains <span>chromosomes.</span>  <span>The structure of the</span> cell of the human body provides for the presence of 46 chromosomes.  Sex cells are made up of 23 chromosomes. </p><p><br>  Lysosomes also enter the structure of cells.  They cleanse the cell of dead particles. <br>  Cells, in addition to the main components, contain some compounds of an organic and inorganic nature.  As already mentioned, the cell is 80 percent water.  Another inorganic compound that is included in its composition are salts.  Water plays an important role in the life of the cell.  She is the main participants in chemical reactions, as a carrier of substances and the removal of harmful compounds from the cell.  Salts contribute to the proper distribution of water in the cell structure. </p><p><br>  Among the organic compounds are present: hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, iron, magnesium, zinc, nitrogen, iodine, phosphorus.  They are vital for conversion to complex organic compounds. </p><p>  A cell is the main component of any living organism.  Its structure is a complex mechanism in which there should not be any failures.  Otherwise, it will lead to unchanging processes. </p>
