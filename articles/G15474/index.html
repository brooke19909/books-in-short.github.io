  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Audit of financial investments.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If we are talking about the <span>organization of the activities</span> of an enterprise, then, first of all, they talk about such a phenomenon as an audit of <span>accounting for financial</span> investments. </p><p>  The first question that immediately comes to mind is: for what purpose is this procedure necessary? </p><p>  The audit of financial investments aims to form an opinion on whether the accounting reports of a particular company are reliable in the direction of financial investments that were made for a short or, conversely, a long period.  The audit procedure is carried out in accordance with a specially developed methodology for accounting and taxation of financial investments.  This procedure is carried out according to those normative and legislative acts that are valid in the territory of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  What are the prerequisites for the audit of financial investments? </p><p>  First, the auditor during the audit of the assets of the company comes from their completeness.  This means that <span>financial investments, investments</span> must be made in the appropriate accounting register, as well as in all accounting reports, and this must be done in full.  In no case should there be any unaccounted financial investments. </p><p>  There are reasons for this.  Accounting, as well as reporting, notes all assets, loans, and also securities that a company or company receives for its use. </p><p>  Turnovers and balances on available accounts are also noted here.  In this case, we are talking about the synthetic accounting of financial investments.  In <span>this case, the balance,</span> as well as the turnover of the accounts of <span>analytical accounting</span> will coincide with the size of synthetic financial investments. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Turnover and account balances, as a rule, are transferred in full from accounting registers to the so-called General Ledger for financial statements. </p><p>  All investments, investments, financial receipts and write-offs must be prescribed both in accounting and in accounting documents.  For this they, in fact, exist. </p><p>  All operations related to movements of financial investments are described and taken into account there. </p><p>  The next premise is the premise of existence.  It means that all financial investments are very important for a particular organization or enterprise.  They, as a rule, exist at the time the balance is drawn up and make a profit after some time. </p><p>  In this case, the presence of financial investments has official confirmation, which is provided by the <span>primary documents,</span> as well as the results of the inventory, which is carried out on time. </p><p>  The company has the right to financial investments of this kind, and is also responsible for all risks associated with this right. </p><p>  An audit of the financial investments of the enterprise, which are reflected in the financial statements, shows that they are owned by the enterprise, and on a legal basis. </p><p>  All securities that are reflected in the balance sheet are also owned by the company.  They were obtained by him as a result of a contractual system, which, in turn, met all legal requirements. </p><p>  An audit of financial investments also has an assessment value.  This means that investments and securities are evaluated in accounting and reporting documents in accordance with the requirements that are presented to regulatory documents of this kind. </p><p>  An example is the valuation of securities in a foreign currency.  If you look at the method of acquiring such securities, then their actual value will be formed on the basis of relevant regulations. </p><p>  An audit of the financial investments of a company or an enterprise acts as a kind of monitoring, which helps to give an independent assessment of the facts, as well as identify gross violations or deviations from the norms and laws that govern accounting. </p>
