    <p>  You can set the recording duration of one segment, etc. Many functions are intended for a radar detector.  In this case, you can specify what information the device will display on the screen, the sound of alerts, the range of the signal and many other functions. </p><p>  It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the manufacturer's instructions before working with the equipment.  This will help you to understand all the functions provided in the DVR.  You can set the speed limit, determine the list of operating ranges, etc. It is advisable to consider all the possible functions and select those that are suitable for specific operating conditions of the device. </p><h2>  Radar detector </h2><p>  Considering the <span>reviews of the owners about the</span> <span>Inspector</span> <span>Cayman</span> <span>S,</span> it should be noted the statements about the operation of the radar detector.  The program provides four modes of operation of the device.  It can be ‚ÄúCity‚Äù, ‚ÄúTrack‚Äù or ‚ÄúSignatures‚Äù, ‚ÄúIQ Signatures‚Äù.  Each applies in certain conditions.  Modes with a signature function allow the device to work based on the signature base.  Users claim that the "Signature" mode is optimal for driving on city roads, and the "IQ Signature" is for the track. </p><p>  In the process of testing the radar detector, it shows high accuracy of the result.  It is in no way inferior to specialized devices, which are sometimes more expensive than hybrids.  Information is displayed on the screen and duplicated by voice. </p><p>  When driving on city roads, it was found that the presented device perfectly eliminates the interference emitted by automatic parking lots, doors of shopping centers.  New complexes are defined as well as long-running detectors. </p><h2>  Signature technology </h2><p>  <span>Reviews for the</span> <span>Inspector</span> <span>Cayman</span> <span>S are</span> provided by experts.  They allow us to understand the main difference of the presented model - the use of signature technology.  Riding in urban areas is accompanied by a large number of radio interference.  They fall into the K-band.  Radar installations emit the same radio waves. </p><p>  The signature is a kind of signature.  It describes about 10 basic parameters of existing signals.  The signal received by the device, the system will check with its base.  This allows the system to clearly determine which type of device is installed in front.  The signature will even allow you to calculate the model of the radar complex.  With such an approach, much less is determined by such an approach. </p><p>  The process of studying the signal is quite complicated.  Therefore, the disadvantage of signature devices is relatively slow processing.  However, modern DVRs have a sufficient speed. </p><h2>  Video recording </h2><p>  The new Cayman S model has a new chipset.  This flagship platform can significantly improve the quality, bit rate of shooting.  The power consumption of the device has also decreased. </p><p>  Clarity of detail during daytime recording is high.  Car license plates can be distinguished over a long distance.  The picture is not blurry, the color is accurate and saturated.  Automatically adjusts exposure.  Also in the process of movement is fixing the route and speed. </p><p>  At night, the camera adjusts the headlights of cars in the oncoming lane.  You can make out license plates, traffic signs and markings.  These features of the DVR allow you to restore the events that occurred on the road, if necessary, prove the guilt of the owner of the device. </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  Considering the <span>reviews on the</span> <span>Inspector</span> <span>Cayman</span> <span>S, a</span> large number of positive comments can be noted.  The product is marked by high quality and reliability.  Mounting to the windshield is simple.  At the same time, fixing takes place firmly, reliably. </p><p>  The video quality is high.  During the day and night, you can make out all the details on the road.  The radar detector clearly determines the location and model of the installation.  False positives are virtually eliminated. </p><p>  After reviewing the <span>reviews on the</span> <span>Inspector</span> <span>Cayman</span> <span>S, the</span> features of the presented equipment, one can note its high quality, reliability and multifunctionality. </p>
