Duderhof Heights</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Raven Mountain in Krasnoye Selo - a hill in the vicinity of St. Petersburg.  But, given the flat terrain of the area, it is proudly called a mountain.  The peculiarity of the hill is that in cloudless weather from its top a wide overview of the area opens.  So wide that not only the outskirts of the Northern capital are visible, but also tall objects in its center.  For the possession of this dominant height during the years of World War II, many lives were laid. </p><h2>  Red Village </h2><p>  After the founding of St. Petersburg, Emperor Peter I, intending to annex new lands to the territory of Russia in the south and north, began to establish the production of products necessary for military campaigns.  Various manufactories arose in the city and its environs: powder, rope, and cloth.  In Krasnoye Selo, a paper mill was built, which at first produced only cardboard and paper, but under Catherine II it was awarded the right to make special paper for printing notes (until that time there was only metallic money in the country).  At the enterprise, a settlement formed and expanded over time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fiesta.city" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.fiesta.city/spb/routes/marshrut-po-dudergofu-i-okrestnostyam/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake view" class="if uuid-3059167" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3059167.jpg"></div><p>  But not only Red Village was known for its production.  For two centuries, military exercises of the imperial army took place in its environs.  The scale of the maneuvers was so large that the Red Village was considered the largest training ground for the development of military art and the testing of new technology.  High military leadership gathered here, noble citizens, the royal family came.  Until 1811, the settlement was called the ‚ÄúPalace Village of Krasnoye‚Äù.  The status of the city was obtained in 1925. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Duderhof Heights </h2><p>  Krasnoye Selo, namely its historical district Mozhaysky, is located at the foot of two mountains: the southern Orekhova, which is 147 meters high, and the northern Voronny Gora, which is 176 meters high.  Today they are separated by a deep hollow along which the city street Sovetskaya passes, and in the XVIII century they were united and were called the Dudor Mountain.  East of Walnut Hill is the third hill - Kirchhoff.  The combination of Kirchhoff, Orekhovaya and Voronoi Gora is the Duderhof heights, widely known for fierce battles with the Nazi occupiers during the war. </p><h2>  1941 events </h2><p>  In September 1941, the rapidly advancing German army came close to Leningrad.  To enter the city, the Nazis could only destroy the defense of the Duderhof and Pulkovo heights following them.  All the forces were thrown into the defense of the city.  On Voronaya Gora in Krasnoye Selo, battery "A" stood to death. </p><p>  This special artillery formation was created by order of the commander of the naval defense of Leningrad, Rear Admiral K. I. Samoilov.  The personnel are sailors of the Baltic Fleet.  Battery guns - nine 130/55 cannons removed from the Aurora and raised to the top of the mountain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="psmirnova.livejournal.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://psmirnova.livejournal.com/560552.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the Fallen Aurora" class="if uuid-3059159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3059159.jpg"></div><p>  Beyond Raven Mountain - the dominant height on the outskirts of the city, where the Nazis frantically rushed - there was a fierce battle, because from the top of the hill you could even see St. Isaac's Cathedral.  The battery entered battle on September 6th.  The sailors successfully repelled the attacks of the superior enemy, but on September 11, all personnel were killed.  The enemy occupied a height, but found here only the bodies of soldiers and destroyed guns from the Aurora.  In memory of the feat of sailors in the postwar years, a monument is erected here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="yablor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="German documents" class="if uuid-3059179" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3059179.jpg"></div><p>  Until 1944, Voronny Gora in Krasnoye Selo was in German hands.  An observation post was organized here, hencefire adjustment was carried out during the bombing of Leningrad.  Over the years, the Nazis strengthened the heights, built numerous defensive structures.  The approaches to it were closed with solid barbed wire and mined. </p><h2>  Offensive operation of 1944 </h2><p>  The Krasnoselsko-Ropshinskaya operation, as a result of which the enemy was driven back from Leningrad by 60-100 kilometers, and many cities of the Leningrad Region were liberated, took place in January 1944.  One of the main tasks during the large-scale offensive was the liberation of the Red Village and the destruction of the observation post on the top of the mountain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yablor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg away" class="if uuid-3059180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3059180.jpg"></div><p>  Fierce battles for key strong points continued for several days.  On January 19, the Germans were driven out of this territory.  Leningrad was completely freed from the blockade.  In honor of the historical event, an artillery salute was fired in the city on January 27.  The Germans suffered a heavy defeat, but there were many dead soldiers from the Soviet side. </p><h2>  How to get to Voronny Gora in Krasnoye Selo? </h2><p>  Today, residents of St. Petersburg come to Krasnoye Selo to breathe fresh air, relax from the bustle of the city, take a walk along the slopes of the Duderhof heights, and stand silently at the war memorials. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.73438470000001" data-lng="30.08444499999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/9/4/9/13949.png"></div><p>  If you go by public transport, it is most convenient to use the train that goes from the Baltic Station.  About thirty minutes later there will be a Mozhayskaya station, this is the next stop beyond Krasnoye Selo.  Climbing to the Crow Mountain begins immediately from the railway. </p><h2>  Walk on Raven Mountain </h2><p>  Centuries ago there was a landscape park on the Duderhof Heights.  Currently, these are semi-wild, forest-covered slopes along which roads or trodden paths are laid.  Many citizens, going to the countryside from St. Petersburg, ski, ride bicycles here, admire primroses or fall foliage.  Crows and Orekhovaya are the most well-groomed heights.  When climbing on them on both paths, shields with a diagram of the territory are installed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fiesta.city" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.fiesta.city/spb/routes/marshrut-po-dudergofu-i-okrestnostyam/"><img itemprop="image" alt="View of Petersburg" class="if uuid-3059168" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3059168.jpg"></div><p>  At the foot of the mountain, <span>Duderhof Lake</span> is located <span>,</span> and from the top, if foliage does not interfere, beautiful panoramic views of the surroundings open.  It is believed that in these hills formed by glaciers, due to their exceptional location, a microclimate has been established that allows thermophilic plants to grow here.  But, obviously, they grew up here before.  And now the vegetation of Voronny Gora in Krasnoye Selo is represented by the following types of trees: maple, mountain ash, ash, linden, pine and spruce.  In these places hazel has grown, so in the autumn you can collect hazelnuts.  On the slopes of the mountain from the southern slope, pine trees have reached the age of 100-150 years.  Glades adapted for rest are few, but in the summer there are many mosquitoes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="psmirnova.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Forest paths" class="if uuid-3059158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3059158.jpg"></div><p>  A memorial cross is installed on Orekhovaya Gora, and a spring spurting from the ground is taken into a pipe and neatly lined with stones.  There is also a notification of visitors that the Duderhof Heights since April 22, 1992 have been a natural monument. </p>
