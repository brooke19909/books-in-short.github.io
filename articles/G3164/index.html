If earlier manufacturers paid attention exclusively to the screen, camera and performance, now sound has come into focus.  A top-end smartphone simply has to sound good.  Therefore, manufacturers began to massively introduce stereo speakers into their gadgets.  Only this can improve the sound quality of the device.  But before there were attempts to create a "music" phone.  But technology did not allow.  However, smartphones with stereo speakers are not uncommon now.  We will consider the most interesting and popular models of mobile gadgets with stereo sound. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expertreviews.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best smartphones with stereo speakers" class="if uuid-2986443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2986443.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 1.  Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 + </h2><p>  The first on the list is a fresh flagship from Samsung.  This unit has excellent technical characteristics.  Samsung‚Äôs top-end Exynos chipset is installed on board, it has 6 gigabytes of RAM and a 512 GB permanent drive, support for many wireless interfaces, a full range of sensors, a huge screen that occupies almost the entire front panel and much more.  But the main thing is the presence of two high-quality speakers that provide the device with excellent sound.  The most interesting thing is that one of them is located where it should be - at the end.  But the second is the spoken speaker.  When playing music, it works as usual.  With this, it turned out to achieve a stereo effect.  But only if the user holds the smartphone in front of him.  Nevertheless, the ninth ‚Äúgalaxy‚Äù is one of the best smartphones with stereo speakers.  But he is not the only one.  There are other devices.  And with a more modest price.  The time has come to consider them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.techadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="music smartphone with stereo speakers" class="if uuid-2986444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2986444.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 2.  Sony Xperia XZ2 </h2><p>  And these gadgets are already from Japan.  The musical abilities of the old Sony Ericsson are well known to everyone.  But new devices (manufactured exclusively under the Sony brand) will never face the face.  If you were looking for a musical smartphone with stereo speakers, then consider that you found it.  The XZ Series is equipped with the loudest front speakers in the world.  And indeed it is.  But the sound quality does not suffer at all from the volume.  Of course, the sound is not comparable with cool acoustics, but this is a mobile device.  In addition to the cool sound, the XZ2 also boasts cool technical features.  This is the flagship.  With all the consequences.  There is a top-end processor, a decent amount of RAM, a good built-in drive, an excellent screen, support for the latest generation LTE networks, a complete set of all the necessary sensors, and much more.  And the smartphone is just a standard of style.  It looks very beautiful.  But the price is very beautiful.  The flagship is the same.  However, there are devices much cheaper.  Let's look at them too. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ibtimes.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="inexpensive smartphone with stereo speakers" class="if uuid-2986445" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2986445.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 3.  Asus ZenFone 5 </h2><p>  Inexpensive smartphone with stereo speakers.  Although this ‚ÄúAsus‚Äù costs adequate money, it looks like a full-fledged flagship.  Probably the reason for this is a giant frameless screen with a trending "monobrow".  The device has excellent technical characteristics.  It has a productive processor (albeit not a top one), 4 gigabytes of RAM, 256 gigabytes of storage, support for all possible communication standards, the presence of all the necessary sensors and a very cool camera that provides excellent quality photos and video.  Among all smartphones with stereo speakers, this one has the most acceptable price-quality ratio.  And now about the main thing.  The device has a dedicated DAC, which provides the highest sound quality.  Therefore, the built-in stereo speakers sound clean and transparent under any conditions.  You will laugh, but in the speakers there is even some semblance of bass.  And this is incredibly pleasing.  In general, "Asus <span>Zenfon 5"</span> is one of the best devices with stereo sound.  And it‚Äôs not as expensive as the flagships.  In general, this is the first candidate to purchase.  But let's move on to other devices with two music speakers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="in.c.mi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="budget smartphone with stereo speakers" class="if uuid-2986447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2986447.jpg"></div><h2>  Number 4.  Xiaomi Mi Note 3 </h2><p>  So we got to the "national" producer.  No matter how strange it may sound, Xiaomi launches budget smartphones with stereo speakers.  And they are considered the best in their segment.  But the main thing is that they cost a penny.  For example, here is this "Mi Note 3".  Of course, the model is already a bit old, but it has stereo sound.  There is one full-fledged multimedia speaker (in the end, as it should be), but the second one is the conversational one.  The only trouble is that they can‚Äôt give out a high-quality sound.  The filling is budgetary.  Especially not the first freshness.  However, compared to modern devices with one speaker, this Xiaomi sounds much better and more pleasant.  This unit is suitable for those who do not want to spend money on a flagship, but at the same time want to get stereo sound.  The device itself has a good processor, 2 gigabytes of RAM, 32 gigabytes of free space on the drive, a good camera, support for LTE and other communication standards, a capacious battery and high-quality screen.  But do not forget about the cool sound.  However, the review on this model is not complete.  Let's move on to the next device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mobilescout.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi smartphones with stereo speakers" class="if uuid-2986449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2986449.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 5.  ZTE Axon 7 </h2><p>  Xiaomi smartphones with stereo speakers, of course, are good, but they will not provide such sound quality as the ZTE Axon 7. The model is not new, but many lovers of quality sound choose it.  By the way, this device costs no more than modern Xiaomi devices.  So, it‚Äôs worth taking a closer look at this handsome man.  The main difference from the devices of the "national" manufacturer is that there are two full speakers on the upper and lower ends of the device.  Together they are able to provide very high quality stereo sound.  In this case, the device must be kept in front of you.  Otherwise, the stereo effect will not work.  The appearance of the device is impressive.  Designers of ZTE have clearly tried.  Even two speakers do not look like an unnecessary rudiment here.  And the large and bright screen between them is ideal for watching movies.  The mobile phone is equipped with a very productive processor, 4 gigabytes of RAM, 128 gigabytes of internal storage, an excellent camera, a fairly capacious battery, a metal case and other necessary things.  And the smartphone boasts an impressive size.  This is a real phablet.  He was once the flagship.  But now his merits are in the past.  Nevertheless, he is still capable of much.  And it costs several times cheaper than modern flagships.  Which is also a plus.  However, it is time to summarize our review. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trendhunter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphones with stereo speakers" class="if uuid-2986442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2986442.jpg"></div><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  There are actually enough smartphones with stereo speakers.  And it depends only on the user what he chooses.  But if you really need high-quality sound, it is recommended to pay special attention to models with a dedicated DAC.  This will provide high-quality sound not only in the speakers, but also in the headphones. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we have sorted out the best smartphones with stereo speakers.  Among them there are products of Samsung, Sony, Asus, Xiaomi and ZTE.  Almost all reputable brands.  Among the devices there are flagships, devices from the middle price category and frank state employees.  They are all different.  Invariably one: all of them provide high-quality sound.  But it is only up to the user to decide which of the smartphones suits him best.  You can buy a smartphone from the recent past, and it will sound better than the coolest flagship.  So here it is worth seriously thinking. </p>
