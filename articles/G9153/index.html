  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Climate and factors influencing it. Sharply continental climate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is absolutely certain that everyone understands the weather, politics and agriculture, despite the fact that sometimes, by the nature of their main activity, they are far from the topics listed.  To replenish our own theoretical baggage, we will try to understand <span>what climate,</span> weather, and sharply continental climate are. </p><p>  The concepts of weather and climate are not the same thing.  Climate scientists define as weather over a long period of time.  On the recommendation of the <span>World Meteorological Organization,</span> this period is 30 years.  The climate is influenced by numerous factors, such as land and sea areas, terrain, the position of the Earth in relation to the Sun, sea and air currents. </p><p>  Only well-known climate-specific information is listed above.  Specialists use many more that are not taken into account at the philistine level.  These include pressure, the state of the atmosphere, the salinity of sea water, and a number of other data.  In principle, what has been said is enough to understand the futility of reasoning about the weather, but to find out something informative about it is simply interesting. </p><p>  The climate on Earth is extremely diverse - this is a well-known truth.  In order to characterize it somehow, a concept such as the climatic zone was introduced, taking into account the peculiarities of the atmospheric circulation of air masses.  Four main zones are distinguished for each hemisphere - tropical, equatorial, polar, moderate. </p><p>  The climate of the <span>temperate zone</span> is the most widespread on the territory of Russia and dominates over its largest area.  It is divided into four independent climatic zones - with a predominance of temperate continental, continental, sharply continental and <span>monsoon climate.</span>  Each zone covers its territory, and the weather on it corresponds to the characteristics of the climate zone. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, the sharply continental climate in Russia is characterized by low cloud cover and low rainfall.  In the zone of its influence are East and Central Siberia.  There are few clouds, precipitation mostly falls in the summer (usually in July).  Thanks to the transparent atmosphere, the surface of the earth quickly warms up in the summer and quickly cools in the winter. </p><p>  The same significant temperature fluctuations occur during the daily cycle: during the day - warm, at night - cold.  As a result of significant changes in air temperature, it is usually frosty winter and hot summer.  A small amount of snow and frost contribute to the freezing of the soil, resulting in permafrost in the northern regions.  Within the boundaries of this climatic zone is the only natural zone - taiga. </p><p>  It should be noted that a sharply continental climate is found exclusively in the <span>Northern Hemisphere.</span>  The reason for this is the fact that in the <span>southern hemisphere</span> in temperate latitudes there is practically no land and, therefore, there are no conditions for the formation of continental air masses. </p><p>  The climate is not something frozen and unchanged.  It is changing - of course, not at one moment, but gradually.  By climate change, scientists understand the steady trend of rising or falling of any of its characteristics, tracked by meteorologists over a long period of time.  So, according to experts, since the beginning of the twentieth century there has been an increase in the average annual global temperature of ground air by 0.74 ¬∞ .  And this gives scientists reason to talk about global warming. </p><p>  The study of climate and tracking its fluctuations is ongoing.  It is necessary to take into account its peculiarities, first of all, in human production activities and in agriculture.  So, for territories where the sharply continental climate prevails, it was necessary to build houses on stilts in order to avoid permafrost warming - otherwise the structure will ‚Äúfloat‚Äù.  And the impact of climate on human health cannot be underestimated. </p><p>  The cited material discusses what climate is, what <span>climatic zones</span> are located on the territory of Russia, and features that are characteristic of a sharply continental climate. </p>
