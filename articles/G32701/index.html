Due to its great distance from the Earth, it is difficult to observe with telescopes.  Its appearance is more like a small star than a planet.  But until 2006, it was he who was considered the ninth planet of the solar system known to us.  Why was Pluto excluded from the list of planets, what led to this?  Let's consider everything in order. </p><h2>  Unknown to science "Planet X" </h2><p>  At the end of the 19th century, astronomers suggested that there should be another planet in our solar system.  Assumptions were based on scientific evidence.  The fact is that, observing Uranus, scientists discovered a strong influence of foreign bodies on its orbit.  So, after some time they discovered Neptune, but the influence was much stronger, and the search began for another planet.  It was called Planet X.  Searches continued until 1930 and were crowned with success - Pluto was discovered. </p>

Observations and confirmation of the existence of an object beyond the known limits of the galaxy of another planet took more than a year.  Clyde Tombaugh, a young astronomer from the Lowell Observatory, who initiated the research, reported the discovery to the whole world in March 1930.  So, the ninth planet appeared in our solar system for 76 years.  Why was Pluto expelled from the solar system?  What was wrong with this mysterious planet?

According to preliminary data, its mass was considered equal to the mass of our Earth.  But the development of astronomy has constantly changed this indicator.  Today, the mass of Pluto is less than 0.24% of the <span>mass of the Earth,</span> and its diameter is less than 2400 km.  These indicators became one of the reasons why Pluto was excluded from the list of planets.  It is more suitable for a dwarf than a full planet of the solar system. </p><p>  It also has many of its own characteristics that are not inherent in ordinary planets of the solar system.  Orbit, its small satellites and atmosphere are unique in themselves. </p><h2>  Unusual orbit </h2><p>  Orbits, familiar to eight planets of the solar system, are almost round, with a slight inclination along the ecliptic.  But Pluto's orbit is a very elongated ellipse and has an inclination angle of more than 17 degrees.  If you imagine a <span>model of the solar system,</span> then eight planets will rotate evenly around the sun, and Pluto will cross the orbit of Neptune because of its angle of inclination. </p>

    <p>  In view of such an orbit, it makes a revolution around the Sun in 248 Earth years.  And the temperature on the planet does not rise above minus 240 degrees.  Interestingly, Pluto rotates in the opposite direction from our Earth, like Venus and Uranus.  This unusual orbit for the planet was another reason why Pluto was excluded from the list of planets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Satellites </h2><p>  Today, five <span>satellites of Pluto are</span> known <span>:</span> Charon, Nikta, Hydra, Kerber and Styx.

    <p>  In addition, Charon, discovered in 1978, is half the size of Pluto itself.  But for a satellite, it is too large.  It is interesting that the center of gravity is outside of Pluto, and therefore it seems to swing from side to side.  For these reasons, some scientists consider this object a double planet.  And this also serves as the answer to the question of why Pluto was excluded from the list of planets. </p><h2>  Atmosphere </h2><p>  It is very difficult to study an object located at an almost inaccessible distance.  Pluto is believed to be composed of rock and ice.  The atmosphere on it was discovered in 1985.  It consists mainly of nitrogen, methane and carbon monoxide.  They could determine its presence when studying the planet, when it closed the star.  Objects without an atmosphere close the stars sharply, while those having no - gradually. </p><p>  Due to the very low temperature and elliptical orbit, melting ice produces an anti-greenhouse effect, which leads to an even greater decrease in temperature on the planet.  After studies conducted in 2015, scientists came to the conclusion that atmospheric pressure depends on the planet approaching the Sun. </p>

    <h2>  The latest technology </h2><p>  The creation of powerful new telescopes marked the beginning of further discoveries beyond the borders of famous planets.  So, over time, <span>space objects</span> were found <span>that</span> are within the orbit of Pluto.  In the middle of the last century, this ring was called the Kuiper belt.  To date, hundreds of bodies with a diameter of at least 100 km and a composition similar to Pluto are known.  The found belt turned out to be the main reason why Pluto was expelled from the planets. </p><p>  The creation of the Hubble Space Telescope made it possible to more thoroughly explore outer space, and especially distant galactic objects.  As a result, an object was discovered, which was called Eris, which turned out to be further than Pluto, and with time - two more celestial bodies that were similar in diameter and mass to it. </p><p>  The spacecraft AMS "New Horizons", sent for the study of Pluto in 2006, confirmed many scientific data.  Scientists have a question about what to do with open objects.  Assign them to the category of planets?  And then in the solar system there will be not 9, but 12 planets, or the exclusion of Pluto from the list of planets will solve this issue. </p>

    <h2>  Status Review </h2><p>  When was Pluto excluded from the list of planets?  On August 25, 2006, participants in the Congress of the International Astronomical Union of 2,500 people made a sensational decision - to exclude Pluto from the list of planets of the Solar System.  This meant that it was necessary to revise and rewrite many textbooks, as well as maps of the starry sky and scientific works in this area. </p><p>  Why was this decision made?  Scientists had to revise the criteria by which planets are classified.  A long debate led to the conclusion that the planet should meet all the parameters. </p><p>  First, the object must rotate around the Sun in its orbit.  Pluto is suitable for this parameter.  Although its orbit is very elongated, it revolves around the sun. </p><p>  Secondly, it should not be a satellite of another planet.  This item also corresponds to Pluto.  At one time it was believed that he was a <span>satellite of Neptune,</span> but this assumption was discarded with the advent of new discoveries, and especially his own satellites. </p><p>  The third point is to have sufficient mass in order to acquire a spherical shape.  Pluto, although small in mass, is circular, and this is confirmed by photographs. </p>

It is located in the Kuiper belt and is not the largest object in it.  Its mass is not enough to clear its path in orbit.

    <p>  Now it‚Äôs clear why Pluto was excluded from the list of planets.  But where to rank such objects?  For such bodies, the definition of "dwarf planets" was introduced.  They began to include all objects that do not correspond to the last paragraph.  So Pluto is still a planet, albeit a dwarf one. </p>
