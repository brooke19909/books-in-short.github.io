    <h2>  Popular places for tourism in Russia </h2><p>  The climatic conditions of many parts of the country favor the development of winter tourism. </p><p>  Going to any winter resort, everyone gets the opportunity not only to cheer up, but also to breathe in the wonderful fresh air.  If you don‚Äôt have equipment riding skills, you can use the instructions of a trainer at any resort who will quickly teach you basic skills.  You can go ice skating, sledding and any other equipment that does not require any special skills, even in children. </p><p>  Ski tourism is very popular among Russians, which is explained by the appropriate climatic conditions for this over a large territory of the country.  Here, snow cover lasts quite a long time (several months). </p><p>  For example, the Urals is famous for its wonderful winter tours: skiing, horse-riding and snowmobiling.  Interesting and fascinating routes here are laid along the snowy ridge of Kraka Tau, along the floodplains of the Kaga and Agidel rivers.  Fast riding on horses, raising whirlwinds of snow, magnificent landscapes and clean air - all this is the Urals, which for winter holidays can be visited from December to March. </p><p>  Also, the mountains of the Caucasus attract lovers of adventure and extreme recreation. </p><p>  The tours in Karelia are also wonderful: racing on snowmobiles and dog sledding on endless snow cover, skiing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Winter holidays and tourism" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2219787.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Vacation abroad </h2><p>  Winter tourism is very popular in the Carpathians and in many other European resorts.  Italy, France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria and many other countries offer excellent service and excellent tracks. </p><p>  It should be noted that Germany is considered the cheapest European resort, although the routes here are not the longest, but are well suited for beginners. </p><h2>  A bit about tourism with children </h2><p>  For a winter holiday with children, the best option is a visit to Lapland.  Although Finland is notable for its rather severe climatic conditions, the winter here is magnificent and one of the most fabulous. </p><p>  According to legend, Santa Claus lives in Lapland.  Many families from all over the world come here every year to celebrate the New Year. </p>
