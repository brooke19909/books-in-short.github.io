    <h2>  History tour </h2><p>  Charming <span>Manila, the sights of</span> which surprise with its unusualness, was originally a Muslim village.  At the end of the 16th century, residents disobeying the Spanish authorities were expelled from the territory, and on June 24, 1571, a new district of Intramuros appeared, surrounded on all sides by ramparts.  After 24 years, an overgrown city, having survived several terrible wars, becomes the <span>capital of the Philippines.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There was a moment in the history of Manila when the Spaniards lost their dominance and were replaced by the British, who ruled for two years and plundered the main pearl of the archipelago.  After signing the peace treaty, the city begins to gradually recover, the first educational institutions, monasteries, temples, private palaces appear. </p><p>  At the end of the 19th century, the Spaniards ceded their possessions to the Americans, who were very cruel to the islanders.  But the most terrible test was the Second World War, during which Japanese soldiers massacred more than 100 thousand inhabitants, and as a result of the bombing, many architectural monuments were destroyed. </p><h2>  Intramuros </h2><p>  Many will be surprised by the fact that the capital of the Philippines is a very complex conglomerate consisting of 17 satellite cities, and the central one is Metro Manila.  The sights of the metropolis will delight even the most demanding tourists, and locals recommend starting the journey with the oldest district, built by the Spaniards several centuries ago. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="attracted sights" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1429799.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Each city has its own heart from which it emerged, and this district laid the foundation for the political and cultural center of the state.  Surrounded by moats and high stone walls, Intramuros, consisting of 51 blocks with seven gates, occupied an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than three kilometers.  Inside the district were hospitals, schools, barracks, temples and the governor's palace. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The special atmosphere of the historic place </h2><p>  Unfortunately, numerous wars did not pass without a trace: the main buildings were destroyed, and the fortress wall now represents ruins.  However, here you can feel the special atmosphere of colonial times, and the so-called city in the city is the place that Manila, who remembers her history, is proud of.  Sights that have survived to this day will take tourists several centuries ago.  The city‚Äôs guests will see the magnificent cathedral, the eighth in the city, the baroque church of St. Augustine, the fortress of Santiago that survived the attacks of the enemy. </p><p>  No one will be bored in the territory of the old town of Intramuros, because there are art galleries, restaurants, museums, and a huge moat is dried up and turned into a golf course.  We must pay tribute to the authorities of Manila, who preserved a piece of history that was important for residents, which could be lost forever, and turned the oldest district into the most visited place by tourists. </p><h2>  Jose Risal Park </h2><p>  Manila immortalized the name of a national hero - a fighter for the country's independence, erecting a monument of bronze and granite near the place where the Philippine patriot was executed.  The memorial is guarded by soldiers, and all political figures arriving in the country lay wreaths at its base, where Risal is buried.  In 1946, independence of the Philippines was proclaimed at the monument. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park jose risal manila" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1429801.jpg" width="600"></div>

Huge collections of exhibits will tell about the long-suffering history of the city, delight with the masterpieces of national art, surprise with new facts from the world of plants and animals.  Europeans celebrate the unique Ships of Faith hall, which presents ritual artifacts, and visitors become more aware of local rites and traditions. </p><h2>  Ninoy Aquino - main airport </h2><p>  Manila recognizes that tourism is the main source of income, and does everything to make it convenient and comfortable for those who come to glorious land, and the first acquaintance is not the last. </p><p>  The main gate of the Philippines is the only international airport.  Manila is proud of the modern air pier, bearing the name of a senator, who was killed 33 years ago.  There are four terminals inside, and when you fly home you will have to pay a small fee for using them.  Experienced tourists recommend changing the currency to local pesos in advance and not losing a receipt.  A lot of signs will not let you get lost, and free buses running between terminals will quickly deliver to the right place. </p>
