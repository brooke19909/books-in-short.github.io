    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Not without significant shortcomings, ‚ÄúSan Maritim‚Äù (hotel, Turkey).  The reviews of 2015 focus on the following flaws: </p><ul><li>  the beach located next to the hotel is strewn with stones, which can hurt your feet (if you go a little to the left, you can get on the sandy coast); </li><li>  low-quality soy sausage is served for breakfast; </li><li>  the restaurant always has long lines for distribution; </li><li>  you should not expect help from hotel guides on any issues (they are only trying to sell excursions at inflated prices); </li><li>  the rooms are equipped with old models of air conditioners that work incredibly noisy; </li><li>  the restaurant is rather dirty, and due to a bad hood there is a pungent smell of food; </li><li>  during dinner, you can see at the distribution those products that remained from previous meals; </li><li>  rare replacement of bed linen; </li><li>  weak animation; </li><li>  water in the pool smells strongly of bleach; </li><li>  the problem of mosquitoes is acute (it is worth opening the balcony for a second, as they immediately fill the room); </li><li>  no matter how many guests are accommodated in the room, there will be only 2 bath and cosmetic sets (for additional ones you have to go to the reception); </li><li>  add too much mayonnaise to salads; </li><li>  disgusting quality of local alcohol (and imported is too expensive); </li><li>  the soap from the hygiene set is some kind of stone and does not foam at all; </li><li>  poorly washed dishes in the dining room; </li><li>  the small size of the pool does not allow a full swim; </li><li>  elevators often get stuck, and therefore it‚Äôs safer to climb stairs on foot (it‚Äôs good that the number of storeys is not too big); </li><li>  it takes a very long time to wait for settlement; </li><li>  plastic cups in the bar are not thrown away, but washed and reused; </li><li>  Reception staff deliberately populate guests in poor rooms, in order to then require a surcharge for changing the room. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  A rather contradictory impression is left by ‚ÄúSan Maritim‚Äù (hotel, Turkey).  Reviews suggest that the institution is absolutely not consistent with its 4-star status.  Given the situation, the quality of service and pricing, it is rather a "troika".  If we talk about the long period of the hotel‚Äôs work, then the attrition of the interior rather than the tradition of service indicates it. </p><p>  Nevertheless, this institution is not without advantages.  What is a convenient location next to the sea and the main tourist sites of the resort village!  Also, the hotel will appreciate connoisseurs of a relaxing holiday.  If you do not like the intrusive animation, and also you like to go to bed early, this hotel is ideal for you. </p>
