What is it - MMPO?  This is one of the many statuses on which a package is on its way.  When tracking a package, which, fortunately, is now possible to produce, sometimes incomprehensible statuses will be displayed on different sites and in applications.  That's what they mean, and you need to find out. </p><h2>  Email Statuses </h2><p>  When sending a parcel to Russia from abroad or from Russia abroad, it moves to many points.  One of the starting points for the movement of a shipped package from Russia is MMPO in Moscow.  The movement of the parcel ends upon arrival at the place of delivery and delivery to the addressee.  Different statuses have their own decoding, but we will linger on IMGO. </p>

    <h2>  What is IMGO? </h2><p>  This abbreviation stands for "place of international mail exchange."  What is it - MMPO?  This is the place where the parcel is prepared for shipment from the country from which it is sent.  At MMPO, the parcel passes ‚Äúits‚Äù customs.  It is at MMPO that the so-called dispatch is created, which will allow the recipient to receive the parcel in his country.  A dispatch is a few packages grouped together.  It is created for convenience. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  MMPO in Moscow </h2><p>  There are several MMPOs in the city of Moscow: </p><ol><li>  Moscow MMPO.

    <h2>  Other MMPOs of Russia </h2><p>  There are 23 places of international postal exchange in Russia.  Of these, 5, as is already known, is located in the capital of the Russian Federation, the city of Moscow.  What is it - IMGO, we found out.  But there are such places not only in the capital.  Their location and status, many customs offices also earned the right to be called IMGO.  Here is a list of them: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Blagoveshchensk MSC.  Blagoveshchensk is a city located not only on the border of several constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but also bordering another country.  This country is China.  Therefore, the Annunciation customs also has the status of IMGO.  Address of the Blagoveshchensk MSC: Pionerskaya street, 27, index - 675000. </li><li>  Bryansk MSC is located in the city of Bryansk at 1 Rechnaya Street (index - 241950).  MMPO Bryansk MSC is due to the fact that the Bryansk region borders immediately with two states - Belarus and Ukraine. </li><li>  Vladivostok AOPP - this is MMPO in the city, which is one of the <span>largest ports in the world.</span>  Vladivostok borders China and the DPRK by sea.  Coordinates of Vladivostok AOPP: Artyom city, Portovaya street, 41. Index - 692756. </li><li>  Vladikavkaz post office.  <span>North Ossetia,</span> whose <span>capital</span> is Vladikavkaz, also borders two countries at once - Georgia and South Ossetia.  The Vladikavkaz post office is located at: Costa Avenue, house 134 (index - 362000). </li><li>  Irkutsk MSC.  The Irkutsk region has no external borders, but nonetheless, it has a place for international mail exchange.  His address: Irkutsk, Chelnokov street, house 3. Zip code - 664960. </li><li>  Kaliningrad MSC.  Kaliningrad is a ‚Äúpiece‚Äù of Russia in Europe.  Naturally, there is its own MMPO.  And it is located at: Zheleznodorozhnaya Street, 29 (index - 236960). </li><li>  Kingisepp Post Office.  Kingisepp is a city in the Leningrad Region.  The fact that this region borders on Finland is absolutely reliable.  The Kingisepp post office is located at Bolshaya Sovetskaya Street, 16. The index for this point is 188480. </li><li>  Murmansk MSC.  Murmansk has an external border with Finland and Norway.  That is why in Murmansk, on Privokzalnaya street, in building 13a, there is an MMPO (with the index 183960). </li><li>  Novosibirsk MMPO.  The Novosibirsk region borders with the fraternal Republic of Kazakhstan.  And the address of MMPO in Novosibirsk is Zheleznodorozhnaya Street, 1/1 (index - 630132). </li><li>  Find the post office.  Nakhodka is a large port of the Primorsky Territory, which, like Vladivostok, has the right to its place of international mail exchange.  The Primorsky Territory borders with China and the DPRK.  The address of MMPO in Nakhodka is 43 Nakhodkinsky Prospekt (index - 692900). </li><li>  Orenburg MSC.  The Orenburg region borders immediately with three regions of Kazakhstan, and the address of the Orenburg MMPO is Privokzalnaya Square, house 1a.  MSC Index - 460960. </li><li>  Petrozavodsk MSC, located on Shotman Street, Building 7 (index 185960) in the city of Petrozavodsk in Karelia, is also an MMPO due to the fact that Karelia borders with Finland. </li><li>  Samara MSC also borders with Kazakhstan.  The address of this MMPO is 135 Leo Tolstoy Street. Zip code 443960. </li><li>  St. Petersburg Post Office.  The Leningrad Region has an external border with the former Soviet Republic, and now a member of the European Union, Estonia, as well as with Finland.  The address of MMPO St. Petersburg post office: Pochtamtskaya street, 9 (index - 190000). </li><li>  St. Petersburg - Pulkovo AOPP.  The address of this place of international postal exchange is Pulkovo Airport, postcode 196210. </li><li>  Sortavala Post Office.  This city is also part of the Republic of Karelia. </li><li>  Sochi AOPP.  Not so long ago, the Krasnodar Territory, of which Sochi is a part, bordered the Ukrainian Crimea by sea.  Now Crimea has passed to Russia, but the IMMPO in Sochi still remains.  Its address is Sochi Airport, and its index is 354355. </li></ol><h2>  What is AOPP? </h2><p>  Having finally figured out the concept of what it is - IMGO, we can proceed to decipher the concept of AOPP.  AOPP is found, as has already become clear, only at the airport.  So, we can assume, and so it is, that AOPP is the place of international mail exchange of the aviation department of mail transportation.  Actually, this is the <span>decoding of the abbreviation.</span> </p>

    <h2>  How to track a parcel in Russia? </h2><p>  It is not difficult to track the parcel throughout Russia.  To do this, you need to know the track number of the package.  It is issued at the post office.  With the track number, you can go online and find sites that are engaged in tracking mail. </p><p>  Thus, the parcel can be tracked even without registration.  Registration provides some advantages.  For example, it will be possible to receive SMS notifications or download the program to a smartphone, which allows you not to think about how the package moves and not to watch its route on the Internet every day.  For example, after sending a parcel from Moscow to another country, the parcel may end up in Vnukovo.  This MMPO has a workshop 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Even to such trifles, you can track the parcel. </p>

    <h2>  We track the parcel in the territory of another country </h2><p>  When the parcel crosses the border of Russia, its location can be tracked using the appropriate programs.  These programs work similarly to how mail is tracked in Russia. </p><p>  For example, if the parcel is sent to Kazakhstan, after crossing the border, you can go to the Kazakh postal website and track it.  In the CIS countries, mainly sites have a Russian-language analogue, so there should not be a language problem. </p><p>  As far as abroad, in this case, smart Russian-speaking programmers have created and launched on the Internet sites with online programs that allow you to track the package in Russian.  Finding them is simple - just enter a query in the search bar of a search engine such as Google, Yandex, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Customer reviews of Russian Post </h2><p>  There are legends about the organization Russian Post.

    <p>  You can also use e-mail for information.  But this is also quite problematic.  Thus, one cannot expect a clear explanation from the employees of the Russian Post.  MMPO in Vnukovo was popularly called the ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù, and this, unfortunately, is not an exaggeration.  They also complain about the long passage of one point, where the parcel may be delayed for several days. </p>
