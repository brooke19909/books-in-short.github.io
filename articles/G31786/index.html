Road accidents happen much more often than aircraft crashes.  However, air crashes are more widespread.  Dozens or even hundreds of people die in them.  This is confirmed by the statistics of aircraft crashes in Russia. </p><h2>  Top 5 incidents by the number of victims (2006–2015) </h2><p>  Over the past 10 years, aviation <span>accidents in Russia have</span> occurred for various reasons.  In approximately 80% of cases, the human factor became the cause of the crash.  Errors were made either by crew members or ground services. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 704px; height: 357px;"><caption>  The largest disasters of Russian passenger aircraft </caption><tbody><tr><td>  No. p / p </td><td>  Airplane </td><td>  Year and place of the crash </td><td>  Death toll </td><td>  Number of survivors </td></tr><tr><td>  1 </td><td>  Airbus A310-324 </td><td>  2006, Irkutsk Airport (outside the runway) </td><td>  125 people </td><td>  78 people </td></tr><tr><td>  2 </td><td>  Tu-154M </td><td>  2006, in Ukraine, near Donetsk </td><td>  170 people </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  3 </td><td>  Boeing 737-505 </td><td>  2008, the border of the Sverdlovsk and Industrial Regions of Perm </td><td>  88 people </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  4 </td><td>  Boeing 737-500 </td><td>  2013, Kazan International Airport </td><td>  50 people </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  5 </td><td>  Airbus A321-231 </td><td>  2015, Sinai Peninsula </td><td>  224 people </td><td>  - </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Accident in Irkutsk (2006) </h2><p>  The statistics of airplane crashes in Russia over 10 years is sad.  During this period, there were several major plane crashes that claimed the lives of both adults and children.  One of them happened on July 9, 2006.  On that day, the Airbus A310-324 airliner, owned by Siberia Airlines, made a passenger flight from Moscow to Irkutsk. </p><p>  The aircraft safely reached its destination and began to land.  For some reason, it could not stop on the runway.  The plane rolled out of the runway at great speed and crashed into a concrete fence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to the collision, the airliner body collapsed.  A fire started in the cabin.  Some people survived thanks to the actions of the crew.  If the conductors had not taken the necessary measures, the statistics of airplane crashes in Russia would have been more terrifying. </p><p>  One of the brave crew members was Andrei Dyakonov.  For the sake of saving people, the young flight attendant knocked the door on the plane.  Andrei Dyakonov himself did not have time to get out of the burning salon.  He let out passengers until the last moment. </p><p>  Victoria Zilberstein, a flight attendant, performed the heroic feat.  The girl, due to a plane collision with a concrete fence, was under the rubble of suitcases and armchairs.  Having got out from under it, the stewardess began to make her way towards the emergency exit.  She opened the hatch and started letting people out.  Then she got out herself. </p>

    <p>  After the disaster, an investigation was conducted.  The statistics of airplane crashes in Russia show that airliners often crash due to some malfunctions not timely noticed by the crew.  In this case, the cause of the tragedy was the mistakes made by the pilots. </p><h2>  A plane crash in Perm (2008) </h2><p>  In the fall of <span>2008,</span> statistics on airplane crashes in Russia replenished with another tragedy.  On the night of September 14, an airliner of the Russian airline Aeroflot-Nord - Boeing 737-505 flew from Sheremetyevo Moscow Airport.  Passenger flight took place in Perm.  The flight went smoothly, but a tragedy occurred at the time of landing.  The airliner crashed without reaching a few kilometers to the airport. </p><p>  On board the fateful flight were 6 crew members and 82 passengers.  In a plane crash, no one was destined to survive.  Among the dead were 7 children.  An investigation conducted after the tragedy showed that the plane was completely operational.  <span>The plane crash</span> occurred due to crew errors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Perhaps the fatigue of the pilots played a fatal role.  Before the tragic flight, they carried out several flights and did not have time to fully relax.  One of the pilots was intoxicated.  This was confirmed by a forensic examination. </p><h2>  The accident in Kazan (2013) </h2><p>  The statistics of the crash of passenger aircraft in Russia includes an event that occurred on the evening of November 17, 2013.  From the <span>Moscow</span> Domodedovo <span>airport</span> to Kazan, an aircraft of the Tatarstan Airlines flew - Boeing 737-500.  A ticket to the ill-fated flight purchased 44 people.  On board were also 6 crew members. </p><p>  The crash occurred during the approach.  The plane crashed into the ground and crashed.  All people on the plane died.  The reason for the fall was the commission of improper actions by crew members.  Perhaps the pilots were not adequately trained.  The investigation suspected that the deceased commander of the aircraft illegally obtained a certificate of a pilot of commercial aircraft. </p>

    <h2>  Plane crash over Sinai (2015) </h2><p>  The terrorist act is one of the reasons why the plane crashed in Russia.

    <p>  The plane was created 18.5 years before the crash.  As of the crash date, the airliner was operated by the Russian Kogalymavia LLC.  After the incident, several versions of the causes of the tragedy were put forward.  Many believed that the crash was due to Kogalymavia specialists who did not properly service the plane.  The investigation showed that the crash occurred as a result of a terrorist act. </p><h2>  The most reliable airlines in the Russian Federation </h2><p>  Several dozens of air carriers are registered in Russia: Globus, Pobeda, Dexter, Kogalymavia (Metrojet), etc. To determine reliability, a company is evaluated according to various criteria.  The main one is the technical safety of aircraft, because often air accidents occur due to breakdowns. </p><p>  The European Aviation Safety Agency has compiled a rating of the most reliable air carriers operating in the Russian Federation.  The three leaders included such companies as Ural Airlines, S7 Airlines and Aeroflot. </p><h2>  Ural Airlines </h2><p>  The named company is considered the most reliable and safe in Russia.  She has been operating regular flights to different parts of the world for over 20 years.  During this period, there were no major plane crash in Russia.  Air carrier statistics are very good. </p><p>  Only a few accidents are known.  All incidents are related to engine problems.  Aircraft commanders, upon detection of malfunctions, decided to make emergency landings.  There were never any victims or injured. </p>

The tragedy claimed the lives of 78 people.  The plane crashed due to the fact that it was hit by an anti-aircraft missile.  It was launched during military exercises taking place at that moment on the Crimean peninsula. </li><li>  At the end of August 2004, a plane crashed that flew from Moscow to Sochi.  Onboard there were 51 people.  All crew members and passengers died.  The cause of the tragedy was a terrorist act. </li><li>  In the summer of 2006, a plane crash occurred in Irkutsk, which was described above.  The crew could not land.
