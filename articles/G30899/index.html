She is engaged in the study of social institutions (law, state, etc.), social relationships between subjects: individuals, <span>social institutions.</span>  Sociology as a science of society began to develop many centuries ago. </p><p>  The main stages in the development of sociology. </p><p>  1. The most ancient time.  Since ancient times, man was interested not only in the phenomena and mysteries of the surrounding nature, but also in the problems that are associated with his existence around other people.  Scientists drew attention to the existence of man in society.  The origins of sociology can be found in the discourses of sages and scholars - in their wise advice on matters of life.  The work of Aristotle "Politics" and Plato's "Laws" served as the beginning of the study of social institutions: law, family, state.  The philosophers of antiquity drew attention to the place of man in society. </p><p>  2. The Renaissance is a new stage in the development of social thought.  New studies are emerging that relate to sociology, aimed at exploring various aspects of society.  Michel Montaigne, <span>Erasmus of Rotterdam,</span> Niccolo Machiavelli, Thomas More are great scientists of the Middle Ages.  They raised the problems of human relationships.  This led to the formation of a model of society that resembles a community in which <span>moral standards</span> and order were regulated by traditions and God.  Man had a minor role in society. </p><p>  3. The Age of Enlightenment.  During this era, the views on society and the place in it of a person changed.  Denis Didro, Claude Adrian Gelvetsky - analyzed the society, why there was inequality, heterogeneity of society.  Man is an independent subject, his life, behavior depends on his efforts of will, as they reasoned. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  4. The classical stage of development (19-20 centuries).  Three outstanding thinkers can be distinguished <span>Emil Durkheim,</span> Max Weber, Karl Marx. </p><p>  K. Marx substantiated why <span>social inequality</span> appeared <span>,</span> analyzed conflicts in society as phenomena that are necessary for the development of society. </p><p>  M. Weber developed a sociological social theory.  The central point of the theory is that his relationships with other people depend on human behavior in society. </p><p>  E. Durkheim, founded a sociological school.  The existence of society does not depend on the actions of individuals.  Each individual performs its function. </p><p>  Thanks to scientists, philosophers, sociology as a science of society has its own subject, theory and the ability to receive confirmation of this theory. </p><p>  <span>The functions of sociology</span> as a science. </p><p>  Cognitive, its purpose is to study society, to understand its structure, how individuals and their groups interact.  Answers the question: in what society do we live? </p><p>  Conceptual and descriptive, it provides those who study sociology with a system of concepts, theories and description rules that reflect social reality.  How and what is being done in society?  - she answers this question. </p><p>  Estimated.  Assessment of the conformity of society (institutions, social organizations) with norms and rights of the expectations of social groups and individuals, their goals, needs.  Answers the question: is our society democratic, how fair is it? </p><p>  Explaining.  It gives an explanation of social events, phenomena, processes based on the revealed facts, patterns.  Answers the question: why is this happening in society, and not in a different way? </p><p>  Ideological and worldview.  It implements certain political and social ideals.  Answers the question: why do these or other social actions occur? </p><p>  Predictive.  Makes predictions based on the patterns of development of society and cognition of trends, creating scenarios for various events taking place in the future.  To the question: What can happen to society in the future?  - this function answers. </p><p>  Managerial.  After identifying the laws of development, creating scenarios for various events in the future, sociology can manage the events taking place in society.  She answers the question: How to more effectively manage social phenomena? </p><p>  Educational (educational).  Sociology, thanks to various advanced training institutes, educational institutions, can widely disseminate sociological assessments and knowledge.  Answers the question: What is the best way to use knowledge about society? </p><p>  So far, sociology as a science of society has aroused great interest among scientists.  These all functions interact with each other, making up a single functioning, productive system of sociology. </p>
