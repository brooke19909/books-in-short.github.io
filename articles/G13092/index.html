There are answers to these and other questions about the application. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What are iPhone Podcasts?" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/921162.jpg" width="225"></div>

    <h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  Initially, podcasts appeared during the development of Internet radio.  Literally, this means "recorded message on a specific subject."  As soon as the first messages of this kind began to gain momentum, Apple began to implement them in its operating system.  So what are iPhone podcasts?  This is definitely not a radio!  These are recorded audio and video files that are sorted by topic.  For example, a podcast called Trance music will definitely contain music tracks in a given direction.  At the same time, several podcasts from different authors may exist on the same subject. </p>

    <h2>  What are they for? </h2><p>  So what are iPhone podcasts?  Why have they been implemented if there are many different applications with online radio stations?  First of all, podcasts are not only music or music videos.  This is humor, and business, and creativity, and news.  The list goes on and on.  Secondly, you can always enable the option "Make available offline." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, what are podcasts on "iPhone" we have almost figured out.  That is, you can simply download your favorite issue and listen to it again and again even where there is no Internet network!  This is especially true for those who study foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãon podcasts.  You can always listen to lessons and assignments at a convenient time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what are podcasts on iphone 6" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/921163.jpg" width="257"></div>

    <h2>  New items </h2><p>  Many owners of "apple" gadgets have understood what podcasts are.  On the "iPhone 5s", as well as on any other, which supports iOs 7 and above, the search for new products does not take much time.  But the choice is simply huge!  It is noteworthy that by subscribing to a podcast you like, you can no longer track the release of new releases.  They automatically appear in the application, and the owner receives a notification if this option is enabled.  Podcasts are offered free of charge, not including payment for using the Internet.  After downloading, the information will be available offline. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What are podcasts on iPhone 4" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/921164.jpg" width="320"></div>

Some podcasts come out very often (once every few days), others less often.  It all depends on those who record these issues and broadcast them on the Internet.  It is noteworthy that initially the application was conceived specifically for users of <span>iPod touch,</span> so that they could listen to the podcasts they needed when playing sports or on the road for business.  But, appreciating the popularity of the application (and many on the network started releasing their own podcasts on various topics rather quickly), the developers began to work actively on preparing the program for all Apple devices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is podcasts on iphone 5" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/921165.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Functional </h2><p>  Many users have appreciated all the delights of the application and have already understood what podcasts are.  On the ‚ÄúiPhone 6‚Äù, by the way, it‚Äôs most convenient to watch video releases.  A screen with a large diagonal contributes to this, like no other.  The functionality of the application is as simple as possible.  Opening the purple icon with the words "Podcasts", the main menu of the program is displayed.  Namely: my podcasts, my stations, selection, top charts and search.  To use all this is very simple.  Especially if there is at least some experience in using other standard "apple" applications.  Functionality is usually maintained in a single style, which greatly simplifies the life of users.  Even for those who still do not quite understand what podcasts are.  On the iPhone 5, by the way, the most reviews on this application are registered from all versions of "apple" phones, tablets and even players.  Users not only willingly use podcasts, but also recommend them to others. </p><h2>  Top charts </h2><p>  They primarily display the most popular audio and video stations.  It is here that you can choose the appropriate category: business, for the whole family, health, games and hobbies, comedies, music, science and medicine, news and politics.  Some of them are further subdivided into species.  For example, the category "Health" has a number of subtopics: "Alternative medicine", "Self-help", "Sexuality", "Fitness and healthy eating."  That is, everyone can find a station for themselves to watch or listen to.  Moreover, we have already very thoroughly understood what podcasts are.  On the "iPhone 4", by the way, there are small "lags" and "glitches" when downloading, so many users recommend just listening to the selected stations online by subscribing to them. </p><h2>  Selection </h2><p>  This section of the menu contains colorful and alluring ads for popular podcasts.  Everything is sustained in the spirit of the AppStore, so it is intuitively clear where and what you need to click.  For example, those who love technology and everything related to it should pay attention to the News and Technology section in the collections.  By "tapping" (clicking) on ‚Äã‚Äãthe channel you like, you can see a detailed description of a podcast.  Everything is exactly the same as when downloading an application from the "apple" store.  First you need to read the description, then view the available issues, reviews, look for similar castes if necessary, subscribe to the entire channel or download only one issue.  And of course, share your find with friends on social networks: Twitter, Facebook, Viber, or through iMessage, telling about what podcasts are.  On the "iPhone 5s", by the way, there are fewer reviews and recommendations than on the fifth version of the iPhone. </p>
