They are classified according to the following criteria. </p><h2>  By collection method: direct and indirect </h2><p>  Direct are levied on property or income of the taxpayer (legal entities or individuals).  Direct taxes include: income tax, income tax on legal agents, mineral extraction tax, transport tax, property tax on individuals and organizations.  A feature of such taxes is that the same person is the taxpayer and taxpayer.  Indirect taxes are levied on services and goods, included in the cost of production, they are paid by consumers.  Indirect taxes include: excise taxes on specific types of goods (cigarettes, petroleum products, alcohol, cars), customs duties, value added tax.  The peculiarity of indirect taxes is that various agents are a taxpayer and a taxpayer.  In this case, the taxpayer is the buyer of the service or product (the tax is paid by him at the time of purchase), and the taxpayer is the company that produced the service or product (the tax is paid by it in favor of the state). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  By features of tax rates </h2><p>  Proportional, progressive and regressive.  Progressive - these are taxes whose rates increase as the size of the object on which they are imposed increases.  Such a system maximizes the redistribution of income, since more affluent citizens pay in the form of taxes the bulk of their income than people who are less well off.  Proportional - these are taxes whose rates are constant regardless of the size of the object.  The most striking example of proportional tax in Russia is corporate income tax.  Regressive taxes are those whose rates decrease as taxable items increase.  The use of the regressive system pursues mainly the goal of withdrawing the income of wealthy citizens "from the shadows." </p><h2>  By tax system level </h2><p>  At the level of the tax system, taxes are allocated regional, federal and local.  Federal are required to pay throughout the country.  This category includes value added tax, personal income tax, excise taxes, corporate income tax, water tax, fees for the use of wildlife and biological water resources, state duty and mineral extraction tax.  Regional taxes are introduced by the constituent entities of the Russian Federation; they are mandatory for payment only on the territory of such constituent entities.  The category of regional taxes currently includes transport tax, property tax of institutions, tax on gambling.  Local taxes are understood as those established by the provisions of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation and legal regulations of representative bodies of municipal level entities; they are mandatory for payment in the territories of these local entities.  This category includes land tax, property taxes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Let's talk about the concept and types of tax benefits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.financialexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="types of tax benefits for taxes" class="if uuid-3077473" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3077473.jpg"></div><h2>  What are tax credits? </h2><p>  A tax benefit is an advantage that is provided by a local government or a state of a certain category of tax payers, putting them in an advantageous position compared to other taxpayers.

In other words, intermediaries selling preferential services and goods must pay VAT on remuneration. </p><p>  Consider the types of tax benefits for VAT. </p><h2>  Exceptions </h2><p>  The following operations are an exception: </p><ul><li>  leasing of premises to foreign citizens or institutions accredited in the Russian Federation; </li><li>  sale of medical goods on a special list; </li><li>  the provision of a variety of funeral services; </li><li>  sale of handicrafts of artistic merit. </li></ul><p>  Thus, when selling these services and goods, neither producers nor intermediaries pay VAT. </p><p>  The Code states that VAT is not imposed on the sale of goods that are produced by organizations of persons with disabilities, among at least 80% of the members are persons with disabilities and their representatives.

This privilege can be used by organizations and individual entrepreneurs who sell goods specified in the List, but they must have a license.  You can‚Äôt refuse to use this benefit.  Entrepreneurs and firms selling medical products not listed in the List pay this tax at a rate of 18%. </p><p>  VAT is not imposed on the sale of services in the educational sector for educational organizations to conduct a non-commercial type of training-production or educational process.

Lessons are also not taxed for minor children in sections, circles and the maintenance of children in preschool institutions. </p><p>  Operations for the provision of financial loans, as well as the provision of services for their provision, are not subject to VAT.
