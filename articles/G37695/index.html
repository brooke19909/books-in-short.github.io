According to the new system adopted in Russia, part of the payments must be transferred to third-party funds for the formation of future pension savings.  Recently, a lot of private pension funds have been opened.  They all offer their own programs and conditions, so making a choice can be quite difficult.  You can do this by reading countless reviews of NPF Sberbank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf sberbank reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59178/2135675.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Fund Description </h2><p>  Reviews about this <span>private pension fund are</span> rather controversial.  However, the reputation of Sberbank plays a role, so the prevailing number of positive reviews. </p><p>  NPF Sberbank is a regular <span>non-state pension fund.</span>  He collects funds transferred by future retirees, invests them, slightly increasing, thus forming the funded part of the pension of his clients.  Upon reaching retirement age, the fund client will have two options on how to manage their savings: collect the entire amount at a time or receive monthly payments. </p><p>  Reviews about NPF Sberbank are of interest to many. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rating </h2><p>  Reliability rating is a very important indicator of the performance of a non-state pension fund.  It indicates the stability and profitability of the fund, as well as the trust of customers.  Regarding the degree of reliability, reviews of NPF Sberbank are mostly positive.  This is due to the fact that its rating is A ++, which is the highest rating rating agency. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf sberbank reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59178/2135671.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Thus, the trust in this fund is quite high.  Stability and stability only increase this indicator.  Many clients are attracted to the fund by the fact that it is supported by PJSC Sberbank, which, in turn, is the largest bank in the country.  Many lawyers believe that such a tandem guarantees the payment of funds even in the face of financial problems. </p><h2>  Profitability </h2><p>  Another important indicator of NPFs is profitability.  Often this is the factor that attracts customers.  The purpose of private pension funds is not only to save the accumulated funds, but also to increase them.  For this reason, many prefer them to the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation.  However, Sberbank specifically did not win good reviews on these indicators. </p><p>  Investors note that the yield of the fund is rather modest.  Approximately 7.5% per annum on average.  Employees of the organization, however, promise up to 12%, and this leads to the fact that customers are actually misled.  Therefore, you can find a lot of negative reviews in this regard.  Work at NPF Sberbank is very prestigious.  About this - below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="NPF Sberbank employee reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59178/2135672.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In defense of the fund, one can say that such a stable low profitability is inherent in many other organizations.  It should also be borne in mind that inflation can eat up the difference between promised income and actual.  Low profitability is also associated with the organization's policy aimed at deposit security.  Highly risky operations with deposits are not carried out.  Therefore, if the main indicator by which the fund is selected is profitability, then this is not the best option. </p><h2>  Employees reviews NPF Sberbank </h2><p>  An important indicator when choosing a fund are the reviews of people working there.  Indeed, in fact, it is they who can objectively evaluate the integrity of the organization.  Opinions of NPF Sberbank employees differ.  Someone likes to work in the fund, and they transfer their savings to this structure.  Other employees strongly dislike the policy of encouraging them to contribute to the fund of their retirement savings.  Forced, it should be noted, this is not done.  However, propaganda is carried out regularly. </p><p>  For all other items, everyone is satisfied with work at NPF Sberbank.  Reviews on this subject are available.  Management support is particularly noted.  Comfortable working conditions are created for the fund employees and a good social package is provided.  The work is stable and reliable, like Sberbank itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="job at npf sberbank reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59178/2135673.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion of an agreement </h2><p>  Many lawyers respond positively to the terms of the contract with the NPF, which is concluded with investors.  The document spells out all the nuances relating to the transfer of funds to the fund's account.  Also, the contract details all the compensations and refunds that will be accrued to the client in the event of termination of cooperation in favor of another private pension fund.  In addition, the agreement very clearly and clearly describes how payments will be made when the client reaches retirement age.  The conditions are flexible, the program is selected according to the needs of each client individually.  The fund showed very good returns in 2013. </p><p>  Reviews of NPF Sberbank confirm this. </p><h2>  Negative comments </h2><p>  You can find reviews of investors on the Internet who express dissatisfaction with the fact that they were not notified about the transfer of the funded part of their pension to Sberbank.  However, in this case, the actions of the fund are legitimate.  The fact is that he has the right to conclude agreements with employers of various organizations.  In this case, there will be no need to obtain the consent of each subordinate.  If the employee does not want to cooperate with the fund chosen by the employer, he has the right to terminate the contract and transfer his savings to another organization.  Many customers are extremely unhappy with the lack of notifications of cooperation, which is what they write in their comments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="NPF Sberbank reviews 2013" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59178/2135674.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What other reviews are there about NPF Sberbank? </p><h2>  Payouts </h2><p>  The implementation of accumulated pension payments is also an important factor.  It is too early to judge this, since quite a few investors have retired, but there are already certain complaints.  They are not critical, but it is still worth considering them when choosing NPFs. </p><p>  So, a delay in the payment of accumulated funds is considered a negative moment of the <span>non-state pension fund</span> Sberbank.  However, this is a typical situation for large non-state pension funds.  Therefore, this fact is not surprising, although it is a rather unpleasant moment of cooperation with the fund.  However, although with a delay, the fund begins to pay their investors their money.  And some institutions may delay the process of starting payments for years. </p><p>  The terms of the contract not only describe how payments will be calculated, but also describe their approximate amount.  Even the fact that when transferring from one fund to another, accumulations will suffer certain damage is not hidden.  The latter is also spelled out in the terms of the contract. </p><p>  These are the reviews about NPF Sberbank available. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews about NPF Sberbank of Russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59178/2135676.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Based on the foregoing, we can conclude that the <span>non-state pension fund</span> Sberbank is one of the ten best <span>private pension funds</span> in Russia.  He takes this position due to his reliability and stability, a long history of existence on the market and the support of Sberbank PJSC.  All this together attracts a large number of investors who show confidence in this particular fund.  From a legal point of view, it is impossible to find fault with the fund.  And stability is its leading feature. </p><p>  However, there are also disadvantages, in particular, with regard to profitability.  According to this indicator, the leading positions of the fund are disputed by other organizations.  In addition, on the Internet you can find complaints about the speed of work of fund employees.  Representatives of the company do everything very slowly, however, at the same time they give the entirety of the information of interest. </p><p>  Thus, the fund is a reliable way to preserve the funded part of its pension.  To multiply it, however, will not work out particularly. </p><p>  We reviewed reviews of NPF Sberbank of Russia. </p>
