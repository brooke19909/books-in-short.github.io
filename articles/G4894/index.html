Yes, and opinions about it differ: someone considers the capital of Holland to be free, liberated, attractive, and someone thinks that the behavior of local residents is unacceptable in the modern world.  One way or another, it is a very beautiful city with interesting architecture and many places for entertainment and relaxation.  What to see in Amsterdam if a planned or spontaneous trip to Holland is expected? </p><h2>  The main attractions of Amsterdam </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripsavvy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amsterdam Dam Square" class="if uuid-2310060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2310060.jpg"></div><p>  By far, the most significant place in the city is its central square - Dam.  This is the heart of Amsterdam, where all roads lead, regardless of where the street begins, even for tens of kilometers.  Dam Square is one of the most beautiful in Europe.  Here, in the city center, there are the most chic restaurants and fashion boutiques.  And, of course, it is in this part of the city that the largest number of the main attractions of the Dutch capital is concentrated. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="52.3702157" data-lng="4.895167899999933" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/8/9/1289.png"></div><p>  What to see in Amsterdam on Dam Square?  The sight of tourists attracts the Royal Palace, built in the XVII century.  The construction took a relatively long time, which is not at all surprising for those times - architects and workers spent tens or even hundreds of years on many large projects.  The Royal Palace began to be erected in 1648, and completed by 1665. The master of his craft, the famous Dutch architect Jacob van Kampen, supervised the construction.  Therefore, it is not at all surprising that the locals, having seen this creation, called it the "eighth wonder of the world."  The Royal Palace is a magnificent building, striking in its power and importance, built in the style of classicism.  Those who want to inspect the interior of the building can do this by buying an entrance ticket. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cultural rest: Amsterdam museums that will be interesting to visit </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.archdaily.com" data-author=": Ronald Tillerman, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam" class="if uuid-2310066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2310066.jpg"></div><p>  Vincent Van Gogh died in 1890.  Only 6 months later, his brother, Theo, also died.  The remaining works of Van Gogh, as well as letters to his brother, were preserved by Theo's wife, John.  It is thanks to this woman that the world knows about such a talent as Van Gogh.  From some letters to Theo, historians were able to write a psychological portrait of Vincent.  So, the question is what to see in Amsterdam, the answer is that you must visit <span>the Van Gogh Museum.</span>  It was built on the initiative of the son of Theo and John.  The museum has a collection of more than 200 paintings and drawings by the artist, as well as a part of letters to his brother, united in a three-volume edition. </p><p>  Every tourist, arriving in another country, wants to see something unusual in it, something that may not be found in any other corner of the world.  In addition to local color, the Museum of Tattoo deserves attention.  This extraordinary establishment was founded by the famous tattoo artist Henk Schiffmacher in Amsterdam.  The collection includes more than 40,000 exhibits, one way or another related to the art of tattooing. </p><p>  Everyone knows that Holland is the birthplace of tulips.  And it is not at all surprising that a museum was organized in its capital, the exposition of which is dedicated to these beautiful flowers.  Once here, you can feel as if in a fairy tale.  It is literally a paradise for esthete.  The exposition of the Tulip Museum contains photographs and paintings of flower beds, and even has a store. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What Amsterdam symbolizes are the canals </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amsterdam canals" class="if uuid-2310070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2310070.jpg"></div><p>  There are so many of them that most of it will be possible to visit during a walking tour of the city.  But the best option would be a boat trip.  Why do many people say that you definitely need to watch channels in Amsterdam, because they are also in other cities?  These waterways of the Dutch capital are not at all the same as in St. Petersburg and Venice.  Canals stretch through the city and go beyond it, spreading over hundreds of kilometers.  All of them are included in the UNESCO cultural heritage list.  Therefore, it is recommended to take a water trip that will make a lasting impression.  Floating through the canals, you can see some bridges.  In total there are more than 1.5 thousand. </p><h2>  Architectural monuments and churches of the Dutch capital </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.holland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New Church, Amsterdam" class="if uuid-2310072" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2310072.jpg"></div><p>  A significant and iconic place in Amsterdam is Nieuweckerk, or the ‚ÄúNew Church‚Äù.  The name is quite arbitrary, created in contrast to the Oude Kerk (‚ÄúOld Church‚Äù), which was built only a few years earlier.  Nieuwecker built in the XIV-XV centuries.  This is a Gothic temple, which is of historical value to Holland, since it is here that all the representatives of the Nassau-Oransky dynasty are crowned and rest.  If we talk about the architectural component, the New Church is an adornment of Amsterdam.  Just look once to see this. </p><p>  The list of what you can see in Amsterdam is quite large.  If you are interested in visiting the Red Light District, the place where the largest number of brothels in Amsterdam is concentrated, do not miss the opportunity to visit the Catholic Church.  This is an interesting architectural structure, the interior of which is well preserved.  The organ was restored, and paintings of the 17th-18th centuries and various church utensils were placed on the lower floors.  Even the cuisine of the 17th century, lined with Delft tiles depicting old children's games, has been restored. </p><h2>  Gourmet journey or gourmet paradise </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripexpert.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amsterdam, Five Flies Restaurant" class="if uuid-2310073" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2310073.jpg"></div><p>  When the phrase Mmm, lekker !, is learned, you can safely go to conquer eateries, cafes and restaurants of Amsterdam.  Indeed, in translation into Russian, it means "Mmm, delicious," and will certainly come in handy in the Dutch capital.  A huge number of food services scattered throughout the streets of Amsterdam, where delicious flavors break out, can confuse tourists.  But true gourmets know exactly which places to visit in the first place, and it doesn‚Äôt matter for a month or for a day in Amsterdam.  What to see and what to try?  It is highly recommended that you visit Five Flies Restaurant.  It has significant advantages over other similar institutions.  Firstly, the restaurant is a bunch of medieval houses.  Secondly, there were such famous personalities as Walt Disney, Samantha Fox and <span>Mick Jagger,</span> and even left their reviews in the guest book.  Thirdly, the restaurant is very tasty and satisfyingly fed.  The most refined gourmet will certainly appreciate the quality of service and the culinary skills of cooks. </p><p>  In Amsterdam, there are a lot of small cafes called ‚Äúbrown‚Äù.  This designation is given because of the color of the tree.  Built dozens of years ago, they are preserved in its original form.  Wooden houses that house pubs and eateries will delight you with a cozy atmosphere and delicious snacks. </p><p>  Do not miss the opportunity to visit The Pancake Bakery.  Gourmet pancakes are prepared here.  In general, in the Dutch capital, various eateries, restaurants and cafes are found at every step.  And, wherever a tourist goes, he will be satisfied with the service, and his stomach with delicious food. </p><h2>  When time is not very much: what to see in Amsterdam in 3 days? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.getyourguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amsterdam, Red Light District" class="if uuid-2310077" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2310077.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to visiting the main square of the city, in 3 days you can have time to see many more interesting things.  For example, go to the famous Red Light District.  This area is located in the old part of the city.  Here, in addition to brothels (representatives of the ancient profession occupied these buildings as early as the XIV century), ancient structures have been built, the architecture of which is bewitching, and walking tourists cannot but like.  And in the evening, when the city plunges into twilight, illumination turns on, music plays, a huge crowd of onlookers appear, eager to see the "inhabitants" of the brothels with their own eyes.  Taverns open their doors, offering a hearty dinner.  And, no matter how strange it may sound, there are temples in the Red Light District.  One of them was already discussed in the article - this is the Old Church.  And right next to her is a monument to a prostitute.  No matter how strange it may sound to us, the Dutch are not at all embarrassed by such a neighborhood. </p><p>  What to see in Amsterdam in 3 days yet?  It is recommended to go to Museum Square, where, in addition to the Van Gogh Museum, there are also others: diamonds, contemporary art and the State Museum of the Rijksmuseum.  There are a lot of them, so you will either have to devote a whole day to inspecting them (although there is still not enough time anyway), or choose depending on your interests. </p><p>  On the third day, you can go to Chinatown, which is parallel to the Red Light District.  Shops, restaurants and cafes, which are quite numerous here, are made in oriental style.  Accordingly, the eateries offer mainly Asian cuisine. </p><h2>  A weekend in the Dutch capital, or what to see in Amsterdam in 2 days? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripwolf.com" data-author=": Panoramio, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Madame Tussauds Wax Museum" class="if uuid-2310079" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2310079.jpg"></div><p>  When the reserve is only a couple of days, it is advisable to devote most of the time to visiting the main attractions located on Dam Square.  Then, depending on personal preferences, go either to the Red Light District to see the architecture of the Old Town, or to Museum Square.  To relax your soul, it is proposed to visit the Vondelpark.  This is a beautiful and very beautiful place where you can relax, enjoy the silence and have a picnic. </p><p>  On the second day, you can book a walk along the canals of Amsterdam.  When time is running out, head to the Pied a Terre bookstore.  It is one of the largest in the world, and each of its publications is devoted to the theme of travel. </p><h2>  One day stay in the capital of Holland </h2><p>  If you happen to visit this city only by travel, you should not be upset - this is enough to visit the main attractions.  What to see in <span>Amsterdam in 1 day?</span>  You should go to the capital of Holland by train, since it is much more convenient to start an excursion from the Central Station - Dam Square is very close by.  Here, the Royal Palace and the New Church will appear to the gaze of a tourist, and it will also be possible to see the National Monument.  There is still time to visit Madame Tussauds <span>Wax Museum</span> , located here.  Before leaving the city, you can have a meal in the restaurant, which in this area are quite a lot for every taste.  Including outdoor cafes with canal views. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="g2ajp-oqr8Y" data-url="https://youtu.be/g2ajp-oqr8Y" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/2/8/7/1287.jpg"></div><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  Finally, a few recommendations that will greatly simplify the life of a tourist: </p><ol><li>  If in summer the best option is to visit the parks and walk along the canals of Amsterdam, then what to see in Amsterdam in the winter?  In the cold season, you should devote time to museums.  Also, if the trip is planned in February, you can visit the stunning Carnival, which is held annually before Lent. </li><li>  Do not be afraid to visit the Red Light District, if only this does not contradict some personal principles.  This is not a criminal area, there are always many locals and tourists, especially in the evening.  The only recommendation is not to take pictures of girls offering sex services, as this is strictly monitored, and then major troubles can arise. </li><li>  In order not to waste time in vain, and not to get nervous trying to find one or another attraction, you can contact the tour desk, ordering a ticket at home.  Our compatriots also offer their services as guides.  They arrange excursions on certain routes, depending on what tourists like.  For example, there is a chance to go to the most interesting places in Amsterdam, the best boutiques of the city, as well as choose a foot or bike ride.  Offers can be found on many sites dedicated to tourism.  Many recommend going to the village of Zaanse Schans - this is an open-air museum where you can see the real operating windmills, as well as get acquainted with the history of their appearance. </li><li>  Amsterdam is a liberated city, here people don‚Äôt think that someone can think badly or say about them.  They just live and enjoy moments, often under the influence of mushrooms or marijuana.  You should be very careful and carefully choose souvenirs, and even go to a cafe, since you can stumble at all on what you would like to. </li></ol><p>  Now that you know what to see in Amsterdam on your own or with guides, as well as what to fear, you can safely send to the Dutch capital - one of the most beautiful and mysterious cities in Europe. </p>
