Cozy, warm and silent - they are ideal for a relaxing evening with a good book.  We knit slippers with needles for ourselves and our loved ones using this selection of creative ideas. </p><h2>  Model for beginners </h2><p>  To work, you need blended yarn containing at least 50% wool, with a density of 100 g per 240 m and knitting needles No. 3,5.  We knit slippers in a simple way on two knitting needles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.knittingparadise.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting slippers" class="if uuid-2488615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2488615.jpg"></div><p>  For a product of size 37-38, we collect 65 loops.  The first 16 rows are made with a garter stitch.  This is the future sole.  The next 14 rows are the front surface.  We knit the middle three loops on the wrong side so that a strip forms on the toe.  At this site we make reductions, two loops in each row.  We finish the work with several rows of garter stitch and close the loops. </p><p>  We knit the second slippers in the same way.  The back and sole are sewn with a needle so that a flat seam without knots is obtained.  If you connect the details with a hook, the seam will be felt when walking. </p><h2>  Knitted slippers on two knitting needles </h2><p>  This model fits from heel to toe.  For size 37-38 for an incomplete leg, we collect 30 loops.  Before the fingers begin, the fabric is made with a garter stitch.  We knit the tenth and twentieth loops with the facial ones in the front row and the wrong ones in the wrong one.  It will turn out a small hem, along which it will be easy to bend the workpiece.  From the beginning of the fingers we knit with an elastic band 1 x 1. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.kitsylane.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="two-pointed slippers" class="if uuid-2490162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2490162.jpg"></div><p>  In the last row of loops we pull the thread and tighten so that there is no hole left.  A neat seam connect the backdrop, as shown in the photo.  The seam on the toe is decorated to your liking. </p><h2>  Turkish slippers </h2><p>  The traditional oriental method allows you to knit slippers with a smooth toe, without noticeable decreases.  Work starts from the backdrop.  Before the start of the little finger, the canvas is even.  For slippers size 37-39, its width is about 7-8 centimeters.  These are 26 loops on knitting needles No. 3,5.  The toe is tied in short rows.  Usually these are three or four wedges in 14 rows. </p><p>  In the first row of the toe 9 loops are knitted, the work is turned over and the wrong row is performed.  In the next front row, three more stitches are knitted, the work turns over again.  Thus, in 14 rows all 26 loops will be knitted.  The first wedge formed will slightly change the direction of knitting.  When all the wedges are connected, the canvas will continue symmetrically in the opposite direction, to the heel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stitchland.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="turkish slippers" class="if uuid-2491041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2491041.jpg"></div><p>  A flat connecting seam is made in the center of the sole and back.  Turkish slippers can be knitted in another way.  To do this, the side is knitted twice as narrow, and the loops for the sole are gathered from the toe.  In the process of knitting the soles, the edge loops of the side are selected in each row, and slippers are obtained without a seam. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Japanese style </h2><p>  For the model you need yarn in two colors.  It can also be different in thickness, the yarn for the top is thinner and softer, for the main part it is dense half-woolen.  We knit these slippers with needles No. 3,5-4.  For the base we dial 41 loops.  With a two-on-two elastic band, we knit a rectangle of sufficient length to wrap the foot.  On narrow ribs we tie triangles with yarn of a different color.  To do this, in each row we reduce three loops on both sides.  We close the last three loops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hakuchogallery.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Japanese style" class="if uuid-2490393" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2490393.jpg"></div><p>  Fold the blank in half, as in the photo and connect the sides.  The vertices of the triangles can be fastened with a pompom, a button or just stitched.  It turns out slippers size 37-38. </p><h2>  Envelope slippers </h2><p>  Another oriental style model.  We knit these slippers on two knitting needles.  The pattern is similar to the letter T. In order to determine the number of initial loops, you need to attach the measuring tape to your fingertips, circle it around the ankles and again reach out to the fingers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gina-michele.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="envelope slippers" class="if uuid-2490897" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2490897.jpg"></div><p>  The first strip is a garter stitch.  Its width corresponds to the width of the foot.  In order to tie the sole, most of the loops at the edges are closed.  The central loops remain in the work, approximately as many as the rows are already knitted.  The length of this section corresponds to the length of the foot.  The workpiece is folded by connecting three narrow sides with one wrong seam.  Moreover, on the right and left slippers, the direction of the fold can be done in one direction or in different directions.  Side seams are also performed from the inside. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Scandinavian traditions </h2><p>  Needlewomen from Norway and Sweden also have their own original tricks.  In addition to traditional jacquard patterns, these slippers are distinguished by a special pattern of the model.  We knit slippers with needles No. 3,5-4 with thick yarn containing at least 50% wool. </p><p>  For the upper part, we collect six loops on two knitting needles and begin to knit the toe.  We add one loop on each side, until 18-20 loops are typed on the knitting needles.  It should be guided by the width of the foot.  Next, about 20 rows are knitted with an even cloth.  The part ends with 6-8 rows of garter stitches.  The sole is made with a simpler jacquard.  Having knitted a toe and the desired length of the sole (also 20 rows), make reductions for the heel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.patternskid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="scandinavian slippers" class="if uuid-2492209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2492209.jpg"></div><p>  The back can be connected with a separate part or continued from the heel, adding loops symmetrically.  The backdrop ends with several rows of garter stitch, as well as the upper part.  Details are crocheted.  The seam is made outside so that it is not felt when walking.  The jacquard pattern makes the fabric particularly dense and warm.  Slippers are knitted almost in two threads and almost do not stretch. </p><h2>  Slippers </h2><p>  To create such fun ‚Äúsneakers‚Äù you will need two-color yarn and a set of stocking knitting needles.  For size 37-38, we collect 48 loops and knit slippers, starting with the toe.  About 8-10 rows we carry out an elastic band 1 x 1. Then we pass to two knitting needles, continuing work with half loops.  We carry out garter stitching 40 rows, alternating sections of blue and white.  The color change occurs in the intarsia technique, the threads neatly intersect.  Broaches on the wrong side should not be.  In the next section, knitting is divided into two parts and continues to the end of the heel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dt1010.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slippers" class="if uuid-2490614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2490614.jpg"></div><p>  On the left loops of the toe we continue the sole, knitting - garter.  The edge loops of the upper part are picked up in work in each row, so that instead of a connecting seam a soft decorative scar is formed.  In the last 6-7 rows of the heel we do the reduction in two loops.  The back is crocheted with a blue thread.  On the upper part, on both sides we raise the hinges for narrow rectangular parts, into which we will pull the knitted lace.  On the edge of the upper part we embroider a decorative strip with a tambour seam.  The toe is pulled together with a thread in two additions and we hide the ends inward. </p><p>  To carefully tighten the initial loops, it is better to dial the first row with a contrasting thread and, without fixing it, go to white yarn.  At the end of the work, the contrasting thread can be easily dissolved and the white loops tightened. </p><h2>  Knit baby slippers </h2><p>  Any of the previous options can be knitted in a small size so that it fits a teenager or child.  But for the smallest children it is better to use specially selected models that fit the leg well and have no seams.  For example, you can make these soft little animal slippers for a one-year-old baby. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hobidenizi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="snail slippers" class="if uuid-2492252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2492252.jpg"></div><p>  In soft shoes, the child can freely walk on the floor and, without removing it, climb onto sofas and chairs.  Small legs will be warm all the time.  High cuffs will not allow knitted shoes to fly off their feet during active games.  On the sole you can sew fabric with a rubber coating in the form of dots so that the child does not slip on the floor. </p><p>  First, a rectangular sole is knitted on two knitting needles.  Loops for the main part are gathered along its perimeter on four spokes, and a border of cloves is formed.  To do this, we knit two or three rows of front stitch, a series of large holes (rapport * yarn, two loops together, two front *), again three rows of front stitch.  The hem folds in half, the next row of loops are knit together with the edge loops of the sole.  Again, we knit several rows of stitch and begin to decrease for the toe with two beautiful chains: one loop on each side of the foot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kadincasayfa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mouse slippers" class="if uuid-2492250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2492250.jpg"></div><p>  After eight rows of slippers will take the desired shape.  You can try on the workpiece to make sure that the leg fits freely into the hole left.  It remains to impose a double cuff.  From the place where the bend is planned, the front surface should be changed from the wrong side.  Then, on the bent side, the front surface will again be visible.  Making a children's model to the taste of the child with all kinds of eyes and ears is not difficult. </p><h2>  Marshmallow booties </h2><p>  Slippers for babies up to six months should be special.  In these shoes the children still do not go.  The so-called booties are needed to protect the legs from the cold and to accustom the baby to the feeling of shoes on his feet.  Original models are often used for spectacular photo shoots. </p><p>  We knit slippers, booties with round toes, similar to a piece of marshmallows.  The model is performed on two knitting needles from the back to the toe and vice versa.  With a garter stitch we make a rectangle of 26 loops and 61 rows.  Close the last 8 loops.  Next, alternate the white stripes of the front surface and the blue ones - the wrong side.  Only 12 strips in 4 rows.  From the edge we collect 8 loops and knit the second rectangle with a garter stitch.  The toe is pulled on both sides.  We connect the back and the sole with a flat seam without knots. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAES7Ms2H0A" data-id="ZAES7Ms2H0A" data-height="315" data-width="560"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/3/5/6/1/3561.jpg"></div><p>  It is important that the first shoes are safe.  The kid will carefully study it and will definitely try it on the tooth.  Therefore, do not get carried away by sewing on decorative buttons and beads.  It is enough to make booties bright and pleasant to the touch. </p>
