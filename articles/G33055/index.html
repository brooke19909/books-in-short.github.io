    <h2>  Doll selection </h2><p>  Most often, fashion dolls of the Monster High series are chosen.  They have wide heads that are convenient to paint.  And, unlike Barbie, they do not have the same Hollywood smile that spoils the whole image.  But if you wish, you can make both the OOAK Monster High doll and the reincarnated Soviet baby doll. </p><p>  The next challenger is Robert Tonner <span>articulated dolls</span> .  They are original, beautiful, each model has its own facial features, the shape of the eyes, lips, the size of the cheekbones.  But there is a significant drawback - their cost.  If Claudine Woolf can be bought for 1500 rubles, then the most modest Tonner Doll will cost at least 7 thousand. </p><p>  The middle ground between Tonner and Monster High - MiniFee dolls.  These are magical vinyl creations with big sad eyes and forest elf ears.  The prototype is the characters of Japanese anime.  Fans of the world of fairies customize them for fairy-tale characters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make oook dolls" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13387/1966294.jpg" width="600"></div>

The first stage is a change of hairstyle.  Factory hair is reluctant to style.  Usually they prefer to bristle in the most inappropriate way.  It is useless to fight them, so the puppeteers cut them off. </p><p>  Before removal, the head must be separated from the body.  In order not to damage it when removing, hold the toy for several minutes in boiling water until the plastic becomes elastic.  When the head is removed, the upper part of the wig is cut off. </p><p>  The remaining roots of the hair are carefully removed with tweezers.  But ‚ÄúMonster High‚Äù has difficulties with this.  To completely remove hair, a small hole will have to be made in the head, which is then sealed.  When the doll is completely ‚Äúbald‚Äù, she is ready for the next step. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make oook monster high" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59435/1965354.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Makeup remover </h2><p>  From the face, sometimes from the scalp, you need to completely remove the paint.  To do this, you will need: </p><ul><li>  Acetone or acrylic remover.  Dollhouse cosmetics cannot be defeated with ordinary nail polish remover. </li><li>  Cotton pads and sticks that remove paint. </li><li>  Mr.  Super clear.  In the people it is simply called "clergy."  This is a special spray that is treated at the very end.  It acts on the principle of a primer, gives a matte shade, does not allow the paint to eat into rubber.  Budget substitute for clergy - PVA glue or hair spray. </li></ul><p>  After the puppet make-up is completely removed, the birth of the OOAC begins.  How to make a unique image and what is needed for this is described further. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Face painting </h2><p>  Facial features, eye expression, lip shape will make the image unique.  But before embodying the ideas with paints immediately on the doll, it is better to sketch a few sketches.  Without them, you can make both the OOAK a beauty and a ridiculous misunderstanding, especially for beginners. </p><p>  When all the details are thought out, the painting begins, for which you need: </p><ul><li>  watercolor pencils; </li><li>  acrylic paints; </li><li>  eye shadow; </li><li>  brushes. </li></ul><p>  Paints are best chosen on a water basis.  In the oil, they run the risk of cracking over time.  Brushes should be synthetic and as thin as possible.  For convenience, excess hair is cut off.  First, all the contours, whites of the eyes and lips are drawn with pencils, opened by "Clear".  Only when it dries is acrylic used. </p><p>  Redrawing, or repainting is a place for imagination.  Eyebrows, eyelashes, tattoos, terrible scars and charming moles.  Puppet masters are happy to share unusual solutions, explain in detail how to make Monster High, Barbie or Minifi make-up. </p><p>  When the makeup is completed, a clear coat of Clear is applied.  It will give a glossy gloss to lips, pupils, will not allow the paint to wash off and fade, protect it from ultraviolet radiation.  The next step is to create a hairstyle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make OOAK Monster Dolls" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59435/1965347.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to do oook hair </h2><p>  Among fans of customization, a change of hairstyle is called a flashing or recruitment.  There are two options to implement it: one slow and painstaking, but better.  The second is much faster, but for beginners it does not always work out. </p><ol><li>  Take OOAK: how to do with a needle. </li></ol><p>  It will take a needle for embroidery with a wide eye, pliers, hair and time, about two days.  When everything is ready, you can proceed with the execution.  String a 1-2 mm wide strand on the needle and pierce the doll's head.  It sounds creepy, but it turns out beautifully.  Pull out the point with the pliers from the inside, take out the lock and tie a knot on it. </p><p>  So gradually flash the whole head.  Start at the edges of the temporal region, go to the back of the head, parting.  Then fill the remaining space with hair. </p><p>  2. Express flashing. </p><p>  The tool for the second method is an awl or <span>a breadboard knife.</span>  The blade from it is preliminarily taken out and changed to a <span>gypsy needle with the</span> ear up.  Pulling each strand with an awl, insert it into the doll's head.  No knots to tie.  When all the hair has been inserted, pour the ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù glue inside and massage.  This will prevent hair from falling out. </p><p>  You can either make hair for the OOAK doll yourself or buy tresses.  Home production is much cheaper.  Acrylic threads of various colors and shades are suitable.  They are silky and easy to iron. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oook how to do" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13387/1966329.jpg"></div>

    <p>  This completes the creative process.  It remains only to dress the doll and come up with a suitable setting: chairs, houses, sofas.  The creation of the KLAA is not only an art, but also a profitable hobby.  Fashion dolls are successfully sold at auctions and in stores.  Their approximate price is 100-200 dollars.  Therefore, doing puppetry is useful not only for the soul, but also for the budget. </p>
