At that time they were innovative devices.  With their help it was possible to make dry and wet cleaning in various rooms.  It is worth noting that it was the English engineer A. Braiser who made a revolutionary revolution in the world of household appliances, creating the first washing vacuum cleaner.  Having made his dream a reality, he invented a novelty that became a real sensation.  This device was immediately appreciated by customers, the demand for it has reached a high level almost from the first days of sales.  Thanks to such popularity, other manufacturers soon expanded their range with washing models. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vax vacuum cleaners" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1480243.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  About the manufacturer </h2><p>  The first <span>washing vacuum cleaner</span> was invented in 1977. It was then that Vax was founded.  Vacuum cleaners are the main products of this company.  Under the brand name Vax, devices for commercial and domestic use are sold.  The company was founded by engineer A. Brazer.  Currently, the brand belongs to a large corporation TTI Group (China).  The company has expanded its range and, in addition to vacuum cleaners, is engaged in the production of heaters, washing machines, dehumidifiers and air purifiers.  Unfortunately, these products are not sold in Russia.  Domestic buyer can only purchase TM Vax vacuum cleaners, which are sold in all major shopping centers of household appliances and electronics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The manufacturer is interested not only to fill the store shelves with his products, but also to provide maximum protection to the consumer.  For this purpose, numerous service centers have been opened throughout Russia.  Each new device undergoes rigorous testing before the start of industrial production in order to completely eliminate the possibility of factory defects.  Buyer needs come first, so the company constantly conducts surveys in order to keep abreast of market trends.  Thanks to this approach, all products fully comply with the high level of European standards. </p><h2>  Short review </h2><p>  Vax - vacuum cleaners manufactured using patented technology.  The devices favorably combine design, technical specifications and functionality.  You can use this type of equipment for general cleaning of carpets, upholstery of upholstered furniture, as well as for everyday cleaning.  Almost all models are large, quite heavy, but maneuverable, thanks to the available wheels.  The case in washing vacuum cleaners is vertical, in classic ones it is standard.  Suction power is enough for high-quality cleaning.  For example, during wet processing, the floor surface dries instantly, and carpet or furniture upholstery within one to four hours.  In the kit there are many nozzles, thanks to which you can clean up even in the most inaccessible places.  Given that such vacuum cleaners are designed for use on large areas, the manufacturer equips its models with a long power cord - 5-10 meters.  The length of service life depends on many factors.  For example, the instructions indicate that during wet cleaning only a special detergent can be used, otherwise an excess of foaming can lead to the combustion of the motor.  If everything is done correctly, then vacuum cleaners will last at least 10 years.  And this, of course, is an indicator of the quality of not only the material and parts, but also the assembly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing vacuum cleaner vax" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1480239.jpg" width="600"></div>

Vacuum cleaners for most people have become indispensable helpers.  Thanks to the opinion of consumers, you can make a real list of the advantages of these devices.  Let's list the main ones. </p><ul><li>  Excellent quality of cleaning surfaces from contamination. </li><li>  Capacity of the tank. </li><li>  Modern design. </li><li>  A wide range of nozzles. </li><li>  Cord length. </li><li>  Convenient cleaning of the dust bag. </li><li>  Long term of operation. </li><li>  Availability of service. </li></ul><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Now it's worth talking about the cons.  Unfortunately, along with advantages, they also exist.  What exactly does the Vax vacuum cleaner not suit buyers?  Most reviews helped make the following list: </p><ul><li>  After each operation, it is imperative to wash and dry the appliance. </li><li>  The problem with the purchase of spare parts. </li><li>  Lack of additional accessories. </li><li>  Repair is carried out only in centers located in large cities. </li><li>  Large sizes have Vax cleaning vacuum cleaners. </li><li>  Prices are high - in the range of $ 200-300. </li><li>  Weak maneuverability. </li><li>  Inconvenient hose design (breaks during movement). </li><li>  No locks on nozzles. </li><li>  Poor filtering. </li><li>  Fragile plastic. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner vax reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1480237.jpg" width="418"></div></li></ul><h2>  HEPA filter - advantage or disadvantage? </h2><p>  According to consumers, the most significant drawback is the filter.  For the Vax vacuum cleaner, a HEPA device is used.  However, the manufacturer positions this equipment with innovation.  But what does the buyer really get?  Unfortunately, the frequent problems of HEPA filters are no secret.  Over time, clogging, it becomes a significant obstacle to high-quality air circulation.  This, in turn, significantly reduces the suction power.  Dust and bacteria accumulate inside the filter, which can trigger allergies or other pulmonary diseases.  If it is improperly looked after, then after a certain period of time during operation of the vacuum cleaner a rather unpleasant odor will be felt. </p><h2>  Vax 7151 </h2>
