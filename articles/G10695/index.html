  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hotel Beyond Resort Karon 4 * (Thailand, Phuket): description, rating, photos and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  No matter how you love your children, sometimes you want to relax from them.  But alien children with their cries from seven in the morning, screeching in the pool and whims in the restaurant are able to exhaust the nerves of casual neighbors.  Just for such tourists, eager to take a break from the society of children, hotels designed according to the concept of ‚Äú18+‚Äù (sometimes ‚Äú16+‚Äù) are designed.  People under the indicated age simply do not settle there.  What gives a stay in such a hotel, besides freedom from voiced children's voices? </p><p>  You can calmly reveal affection for your husband or boyfriend.  At the same time, no mommy from a neighboring sunbed will be indignant: ‚ÄúHere are the children!‚Äù  Which hotel from this category to choose?  If you go to Phuket (Thailand) for a beach holiday, then definitely you will like the Karon coast.  It is the best on the whole island.  There are only two hotels on this beach with direct access to the sea.  And one of them is called Beyond Karon Beach Resort &amp; Spa 4 *.  This hotel will be the heroine of our story today. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beyond Resort Karon 4 * (Thailand)" class="if uuid-3220003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3220003.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The main resort on the island of Phuket is Patong.  He enjoys the fame of the capital of the sex industry, and in terms of viciousness is inferior only to Pattaya.  Patong Beach does not please tourists with cleanliness.  And at night, the resort does not sleep, and with it tourists who had the misfortune of staying in hotels by the street of Bangla Road bars.  But Karon Beach, just 8 kilometers from Patong, is in stark contrast to the main city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Calmness and bliss, the azure sea, palm trees and casuarins - this is what this coast looks like.  Karon's ‚Äúcalling card‚Äù is a fine sand that creaks at every step, like snow due to the high content of quartz.  In the south of the beach, where, in fact, Beyond Resort Karon 4 * is located, a coral reef is also added to all the charms, which makes it possible to snorkel and dive.  The entire strip of Karon - and it stretches for three and a half kilometers - is occupied by luxury hotels.  But they are separated from the sea by a highway with serious traffic.  And only two hotels - and one of them, "Beyand Resort" - have direct access to the beach. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="7.815950300000002" data-lng="98.29960349999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/5/1/3/17513.png"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Hotel Beyond Resort Karon 4 * was built in 1989.  But do not be afraid of the venerable age of this hotel.  In 2013, a large-scale reconstruction was carried out here.  The three-story building in the form of a horseshoe descends on the terraces.  Thus, from all the rooms you can see the sea.  Between the building and the beach are two swimming pools.  There is also a restaurant with a spacious terrace on the beach, where it is nice to have a meal with sea views.  There is a bar on the coast, and a cafe in the lobby (services are paid for). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In general, many tourists mention that the area near the hotel is small.  There is no tennis court or gym.  On the other side of the building is Karon's main street.  One has only to go beyond the gates of the hotel, and you are in the center of local life.  Several cafes located ten meters from the hotel will satisfy your hunger.  The reviews also include a massage parlor, shops, tour agencies and scooter rental offices.  The location of the hotel in the south of Karon makes it possible to walk to another famous Phuket beach - Kata. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.beyondresortkaron.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beyond Resort Karon 4 * (Phuket)." class="if uuid-3220005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3220005.jpg"></div><h2>  Number of rooms of the hotel Beyond Resort Karon 4 * (Phuket) </h2><p>  Tourists recommend that you ask for a third or last resort, when checking in, the second floor, because from the balconies of the first, because of the greenery, the sea is not quite visible, and the noise from the pool confuses peace.  By the way, when booking, carefully look at the name of the rooms.  For example, all deluxe rooms are located on the ground floor.  And the rooms with a similar name - Beyand Deluxe - on the second and third. </p><p>  Apartments of higher categories are located on the top floor.  This is a one-room premier sea view and consisting of a bedroom and a grand deluxe living room and princess suites.  All rooms have balconies.  They are so spacious that some tourists in their reviews call them "verandas."  The rooms themselves are by no means small.  Deluxe rooms, for example, have an area of ‚Äã‚Äã34 square meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Beyond Resort Karon 4 * - description of rooms" class="if uuid-3219992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3219992.jpg"></div><h2>  Room filling </h2><p>  The rooms in the Beyond Resort Karon 4 * are fully consistent with the status of a four-star hotel.  Guests are offered bathrobes, slippers.  The room has a silent and efficient air conditioning, a flat-screen cable TV, a safe and a minibar.  The filling of the latter is paid.  But the maids at the daily cleaning bring two bottles of drinking water - a ‚Äúcompliment‚Äù from the hotel.  The bathroom has a shower.  In the bathroom, guests will find a hairdryer, daily replenished cosmetics.  And in the shower gel is poured into a dispensing bottle. </p><p>  The furniture after reconstruction is new, plumbing, bedding and towels too.  What else did the guests remember?  The fact that it has a kitchenette equipped with everything necessary.  All tourists with amazement and joy mention that they had a real coffee machine in their room.  And the capsules with the drink were replenished daily.  If you read the old reviews, you can understand that the Internet connection at the hotel was not up to par.  But already those who rested at the hotel in the season of 2018, assure that Wi-Fi works fine and is in all rooms. Tourists watched movies online, chatted with friends on Skype. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Beyond Resort Karon 4 * (Thailand) operates on the BB system.  But the restaurant "He The Beach" is open not only in the morning.  Here you can have a hearty lunch and spend a romantic dinner with a la carte service.  Breakfast is served in buffet style.  What do tourists say about these morning meals?  Everyone was happy with the time allotted for breakfast - both ‚Äúlarks‚Äù and ‚Äúowls‚Äù.  As for the assortment of dishes, the guests found it monotonous.  This is not a gourmet hotel, they assure.  But you will definitely not leave hungry with breakfast.  They give sausage slices, sausages, boiled and fried eggs, yogurts.  As in all hotels in Thailand, guests are offered many fruits and fresh vegetables. </p><p>  But Beyand Resort has its own highlight in nutrition.  Tourists in Thailand constantly complain about bad coffee served in hotels for breakfast.  By the end of the holiday, many gourmets are already beginning to yearn for the right, Turkish-brewed drink.  But Beyand Resort serves surprisingly delicious coffee, as if made by an experienced barista.  Plus, in every room of the hotel there is a machine for brewing a drink. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fr.hotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beyond Resort Karon 4 * - restaurant" class="if uuid-3220000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3220000.jpg"></div><h2>  Where tourists ate throughout the day </h2><p>  Some guests had lunch and, what happened most often, had dinner in the restaurant of the Beyond Resort Karon 4 * hotel.  They say meals are worth the money.  The dishes of European and Thai cuisine served here are very tasty.  Many visitors note the quality service and the romantic atmosphere of the restaurant.  The chefs here are so experienced that even a Thai secrets training school operates. </p><p>  Budget tourists ate outside the hotel.  Most of the guests had a rest in the cafe ‚ÄúKalika‚Äù, which is 30 meters to the right of the hotel, across the road. However, the choice of catering establishments on Karon is quite wide.  But there are no dubious bars there, as in Chaweng, so you can safely go there without fear of the harassment of "night butterflies" of both sexes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.greatpacifictravels.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beyond Resort Karon 4 * (Phuket)" class="if uuid-3219998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3219998.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  As for the coast, all the guests of the Beyond Resort Karon 4 * hotel were unanimous: it is beyond praise here.  Anyone traveling to Thailand solely across the sea and the beach will be pleased.  The "singing sand" of Karon became the "calling card" of Phuket.  A wide strip of the beach allows all guests to sit on sunbeds, there is no need to occupy them early.  There are low tides on this coast, but they are weakly expressed.  Even outside the tourist season, waves are observed here only during the day, but in the morning and evening the sea is calm. </p><p>  And in the winter months there is generally grace.  No tidal currents, a light breeze freshens the air.  The entry into the water is gentle, there are no stones or fragments of coral at the bottom.  But in the southern part of Karon, where it smoothly transitions to Kata beach, there is a reef that attracts snorkelers.  So guests recommend taking a mask with a pipe on a trip.  After all, the underwater life of a coral reef is extremely interesting.  The beach has massage services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beyond Resort Karon 4 * - beach" class="if uuid-3220031" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3220031.jpg"></div><h2>  Pools and Spas </h2><p>  Tired of splashing around in the very salty Andaman Sea?  Diversify your relaxation with a swim in the fresh water-filled pools of the Beyond Resort Karon 4 * (Phuket) hotel.  There are two of them, and they are located in close proximity to each other, between the hull and the beach.  Nearby is a bar where psychedelic music is played.  Cocktails and refreshments are available there.  The sizes of the swimming pools are 16 x 7 meters.  Both tanks have hydromassage functions.  The hotel has a small spa.  It consists of a sauna and a professional massage room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Beyond Resort Karon 4 *" class="if uuid-3220002" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3220002.jpg"></div><h2>  Services in Beyond Resort Karon 4 * (Thailand, Phuket) </h2><p>  The hotel has a laundry room, where you can hand over things for washing, simply folding them in a special bag and leaving for the maids.  The reception desk is open around the clock.  The hotel offers its guests discounts on the use of the golf club and the services of diving and surfing centers.  All these establishments are located in close proximity to Beyand Resort.  When checking in, no deposit will be charged, and this is called a plus of the hotel by tourists.  The hotel also has a tour desk.  But tourists are not advised to use its services.  The same thing, but for much less money, can be found in the travel agency on the street. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In general, tourists were satisfied with their stay at Beyond Resort Karon 4 *.  In the reviews, guests praise large rooms with spacious balconies, a comfortable and wide bed, an extremely good location, peace and quiet.  Not a single guest room faces the street, vacationers fell asleep to the sound of waves.  Everyone liked the presence of a capsule coffee machine in the room, and the fact that the drink in the restaurant is also very delicious.  But at the same time, the hotel has its drawbacks. </p><p>  Among them, tourists call monotonous breakfasts, a small area.  Some guests complained about cleaning imperfections.  Other showers in the room had a hard time adjusting to the right temperature.  But all this is trifles that easily overlap with the advantages of the hotel.  An audience from Europe rests at Beyand Resort, and there are few Russian tourists.  For some, this may seem like a drawback, but most vacationers were only happy with this circumstance. </p><p>  Everyone praises Karon Beach.  There are few people in this part of the coast, although you can‚Äôt call rest boring either.  Various types of water activities are offered, from a ‚Äúbanana‚Äù to parachuting a boat. </p>
