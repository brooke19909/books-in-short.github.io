    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Those who have already visited this hotel unanimously argue that both the location and the territory of this institution can be awarded the highest rating.  The greenery, which is surrounded by the residential building of Gorgona Hotel 3 *, is excellent for relaxing.  There are many flowering shrubs, palm trees and prickly pears. </p><p>  As for the living conditions, some of our compatriots were somewhat confused by the small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rooms, however, for those who come to Crete not to stay at the hotel, but to sunbathe, swim and walk, this drawback remained almost invisible. </p><p>  The sea and the beach are just amazing.  White sand and azure warm water with the gentle sun do real miracles.  The Amu Dara Sea has one feature: there is a rocky ridge here, so when the rest of the resorts are high waves, there is always complete calm. </p><p>  Our compatriots write many kind words about the staff and about the owners of the hotel - the hostess and her son.  Their benevolence and hospitality, which, however, are characteristic of the majority of the inhabitants of Crete, make a person feel like in a family environment. </p><p>  The hotel rests the French and Germans.  There are few Russians so far.  The food in the hotel, presented by breakfast, is tasty and hearty.  Nearby taverns offer authentic Greek dishes, including seafood. </p><p>  Our compatriots were satisfied with their stay and, if possible, will return here again. </p>
