  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Canon IXUS 160: review, specifications and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Introduced along with the 165 and <span>170</span> models <span>, the Canon IXUS</span> 160 is located in the middle of the super-slim and stylish IXUS cameras.  It boasts a 20-megapixel 1 / 2.3 ‚ÄùCCD-sensor and an 8x optical zoom lens in the equivalent of focal lengths from 28 to 224 mm, however, without proper image stabilization.  The camera is capable of recording 720p HD-video and has 6 creative filters that will help revive a nondescript picture.  Other useful features, such as blink detection and an automatic timer, provide high-quality photos of friends and family.  The camera is available in silver, black, white and red and costs $ 120. </p><h2>  Ease of use </h2><p>  The Canon IXUS 160 is identical to the 165th model, with the exception of the image stabilization system, which saves about $ 35.  In this case, the situation is strange when the IXUS 155 costs less, but it has stabilization, and a 10x optical zoom is even more than 8x in the IXUS 160. </p><p>  The signature IXUS dimensions of 95.2 x 54.3 x 22.1 mm make the camera small enough to fit in a jeans pocket, and 127 g of weight means it will never become a burden.  In part, this can be attributed to the plastic case, but it is soundly assembled and does not bend.  There is a metal tripod mount, which is nice, even if such a camera is unlikely to spend much time in a fixed state.  It is a pity that the gloss is short-lived, as it is easily scratched, which is especially noticeable in the red version.  The smooth surface makes the camera quite slippery, and this is compounded by the lack of places to capture on the front or back of the camera, except for the protrusion around the LCD screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  The screen itself is quite bright, even in direct sunlight, and the color rendition is also good, but only if you look at the display at a right angle.  Tilt is limited as color and contrast vary significantly.  The problem is not that big, but it spoils the overall impression, especially if the user expects improvement compared to the camera of his smartphone.  The average resolution of the phone also gives odds to the miserable 230 thousand points of the Canon IXUS 160 screen, although this is a typical phenomenon for cheap compact cameras. </p>

    <h2>  Control Panel </h2><p>  There are several buttons near the screen, the size of which does not require sharpening the nails for their use.  These are standard keys for playing, recording video and calling up the menu, as well as a button with a question mark that calls up the help menu, where during shooting a description of the type of scene detected in automatic mode will be given.  The user will probably want to quickly take a picture rather than worry about what the camera is busy, but the help system is more useful when playing back.  Here you can get help with navigation, zooming and rotation of the image and many more useful tips that will make learning more intuitive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Canon IXUS 160: Overview of Operation Modes </h2><p>  In the center of the control panel there is a navigation wheel, inside of which there is a Func / Set button.  It provides access to the main shooting parameters, which were separated from the rest of the underutilized settings contained in the main menu.  In automatic mode, pressing the Set button saves the self-timer settings (including the user mode, which allows you to pre-set your own delay time, as well as the number of shots), single or continuous shooting (at 0.8 fps), image size and video resolution (HD or VGA). </p><p>  When starting to the top of the navigation wheel, the Canon IXUS 160 Black switches from automatic to the last used alternative mode.  In this case, Func / Set includes additional options for metering (estimated, weighted average, or spot), white balance (including custom settings), ISO sensitivity, exposure compensation, and depth of field.  The Func / Set menu also sets non-automatic shooting modes, including on-screen viewing control, which allows you to change the image tone and a timer that automatically starts when a face is detected.  Low light limits the frame capture mode to 5 megapixels, reducing noise in photographs taken with high sensitivity.  And finally, you can change the shutter release settings if you need to take night pictures with low <span>ISO sensitivity</span> and the presence of a tripod. </p>

    <p>  It is a pity that Canon decided to hide most of the modes and artistic effects in the Func / Set menu, when other manufacturers have a separate button for this.  Nevertheless, it is great that it is possible to adjust the shooting settings to get the most out of the camera and develop your skills. </p><p>  Other parameters controlled by the navigation wheel include flash settings, playback, and on-screen information, such as a histogram of the image.  Finally, the Canon IXUS 160 is equipped with an Eco system that can extend battery life through energy-saving measures, such as turning off the screen faster.  It increases battery life from 220 to 300 shots. </p><h2>  Focusing </h2><p>  Canon IXUS 160 allows you to take pictures every 1.7 s.  This was partly possible due to the fast focusing speed of the camera, which is almost instantaneous in good light and not too slow in low light.  In dim lighting, the AF can get confused in search of a target. </p><p>  But the most uncomfortable in the Canon IXUS 160 user reviews called autofocus when shooting close-ups.  The minimum focusing distance of the camera is 5 cm, but only when the lens is at the widest possible angle.  Even if you increase it a little, you will have to step back half a meter so that the camera focuses again, and a small increase in zoom requires a much greater distance.  This is a typical feature of compact devices, but it seems that the IXUS 160's ability to focus on close objects is inferior to its rivals.  AF is especially annoying when a photographer, trying to avoid getting a shadow on the subject, approaches the camera too much, and also when trying to use a larger focal length to create an attractive blurry background with a shallow depth of field. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Budget compact cameras rarely have high performance and innovative features, but Canon IXUS 160 user reviews are called even more dim than the gray majority.  In addition to a considerable number of manual settings and several really useful features, the camera is unremarkable. </p><p>  At best, the image quality is average, satisfactory only in good light, but disappointing in the room and with a lack of light.  The lack of normal stabilization only exacerbates the problem, and AF can be painful when shooting close-ups.  The buttons are large enough, and the menu structure is logical, but you have to come to terms with a slippery surface and a mediocre LCD screen. </p><p>  But the biggest problem with the camera is its price.  Of course, $ 120 is inexpensive, but even the outdated IXUS 155 can be purchased for the same amount and get 10x zoom with image stabilization.  The <span>Nikon Coolpix S3700</span> rival camera also has a stabilized lens plus Wi-Fi and photo sharing using NFC technology. </p><p>  In general, the Canon IXUS 160 does its job quite well and is easy to use, but it‚Äôs not enough to become more attractive than its direct competitors and an older model with better features. </p>
