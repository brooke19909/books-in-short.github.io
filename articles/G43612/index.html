This financial institution today is developing a large-scale network based on Russian Post.  By the beginning of 2018, it is planned to open about eighteen thousand branches at postal points, which will make it possible to strengthen the penetration of basic banking services throughout the country.  About how to get a loan at Post Bank, as well as about the opinions of consumers about the products of this financial institution, we will discuss below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get a loan in a mail bank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59178/2135722.jpg"></div>

The amount that can be obtained as part of lending for personal purposes, reaches one million rubles.  Dates are provided from one year to five years.  In order to apply, you must present your passport, as well as the number of SNILS.  An application can be submitted in several ways: </p><ul><li>  Fill out the form on the official website. </li><li>  Fill out an application at the customer center. </li><li>  Make a request at the sales desk or at a point of sale with partners of the bank. </li></ul><h2>  Customer requirements </h2><p>  The bank will not make all applicants for cash borrowed funds its customers.  For a positive decision, the applicant must fulfill the following requirements: be 18 years old, a citizen of the Russian Federation with a permanent residence permit in any region of the country, work in one place for at least three months.  You also need to think about additional documents (SNILS, driver's license, passport with marks).  Mostly loans are issued to people who carry out labor activities.  But if the applicant does not work, he can also apply for a loan, however, the conditions for cooperation with him will be more severe. </p><h2>  Preliminary decision </h2><p>  A preliminary decision is communicated to customers within a minute if the application is filled out on the site.  When it is submitted to the bank branch, it takes up to one business day.  After receiving a loan, customers can withdraw cash through an ATM or pay with a plastic card.

    <h2>  Consumer Reviews </h2><p>  Consumers who have taken a loan from this bank report both the pros and cons of this financial institution.  For example, it is reported that the staff at Post Bank is friendly enough and always trying to help with something.  Also, people like the speed of paperwork. </p><p>  But among the majority of reviews, there is such a minus that there are no cash desks in the offices of this institution, and all funds are paid by using ATMs.  People find this extremely inconvenient, as they constantly need to come with the exact amount of the planned payment, and the terminal does not always recognize bills. </p><p>  Consumers like that Post Bank provides its customers with a grace period of one hundred and twenty days.  People also appreciate that they have the opportunity to receive any information about the service immediately before applying for a loan.  Another advantage is the design of an online application without scans of documents and certificates.  In addition, based on most reviews, it can be said that consumers consider this bank reliable, since it operates on the basis of VTB. </p><p>  Among the minuses are often called the lack of a cache back.  Consumers also believe that Pochta Bank still has a very weak network of ATMs and branches, providing its customers with not the lowest interest rate along with annual service.  A number of individual comments also noted the incompetence of employees and the inconvenience in using the Internet bank. </p><p>  According to reviews, many people want to take out a loan at Post Bank, but not everyone succeeds.  Very often loan applications are rejected. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="russian post bank take credit reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59178/2135719.jpg"></div>
