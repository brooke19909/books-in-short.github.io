    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Kata Beach Resort Spa 4 * is located on the second coastline.  It is close enough to the sea - only 300 meters.  This, it is worth noting, is a clear plus, since the vast majority of potential guests put this criterion of choice at the head of all the others.  It is really important for them that the hotel is closer to the sea. </p><p>  But in addition to being relatively close to the beach, there is another advantage - the airport.  He is also close to the hotel.  However, do not worry about flying in both directions.  The distance of the airport to the hotel is 20-40 kilometers, so their noise certainly will not disturb the quiet relaxation of the guests of the resort.  And from the hotel to Patong can be reached in 15 minutes.  It will take you longer to drive to the center of Phuket - about half an hour. </p><p>  And the hotel Kata Beach Resort and Spa in <span>Phuket (Thailand)</span> is located in a very picturesque place.  It is surrounded by a beautiful tropical garden, which is unlikely to leave anyone indifferent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Close Attractions </h2><p>  Hotel Kata Beach Resort Spa 4 * not without reason is popular among travelers.  Because it is located in a place that is also beneficial not only in terms of transport accessibility.  All local attractions are located only 15-20 minutes away by public transport or car (as long as you can rent a business without problems - most importantly, do not forget about your rights).  Very close by is Dano Park, <span>Kata Beach</span> and the notorious Kata Viewpoint. </p><p>  Another hotel is located between clean and spacious beaches (Kata and Karon).  The complex is located on a hill, just eight kilometers from a variety of nightlife.  These are restaurants, clubs and numerous shops. </p>

    <h2>  Superior rooms </h2><p>  When reviewing the Kata Beach Resort <span>Resort (hotel,</span> Phuket, Thailand), one cannot but pay attention to the superior rooms.

    <h2>  Service and maintenance </h2><p>  Hotel Kata Beach Resort Spa 4 * reviews get mostly positive.  The service here is round-the-clock, and this is good news.  In addition, there are sun loungers with umbrellas near the pool (as well as on the beach, which is the property of the hotel).  Guests at Kata Beach Resort Spa Phuket 4 are also offered car rental, dry cleaning services and tour arrangements. </p><p>  There are a variety of entertainment.  For example, SPA, jacuzzi, outdoor pool and massage room.  Still, staying in these places, it is definitely worth doing water sports or diving - to appreciate the underwater world and its undoubted beauty.  But it‚Äôs not advisable to go here with children.  It is better to leave them at home if you want to fully relax, since the hotel does not provide any additional services for them (like nannies and game rooms).  No one will be able to sit with the children while their parents have fun.  But the rest for adults, relaxation here can be successful. </p><p>  In addition to the above, guests can also offer the delivery of food, drinks and newspapers to the apartment. </p>

    <h2>  Guest reviews and recommendations </h2><p>  This is the last topic that I would like to touch upon when telling about this wonderful hotel located on the island of Phuket.  Kata Beach Resort Spa 4 * was visited by thousands of guests from around the world.  And the Russians are no exception.  How do they comment on their vacation spent in the hotel complex Kata Beach Resort Spa 4 * (Phuket, Thailand)?  Reviews are mostly positive.  People say that this is a good hotel with a decent level of service.  Breakfast is hearty and fresh.  Typically, these are egg dishes (boiled, fried or scrambled eggs), sausages, ham, fried bacon, served with tea, coffee or milk.  Jam, bread, <span>butter, pineapple,</span> watermelon - all this is also included in the breakfast.  Clean the rooms every day, and really high quality, but not superficial. </p><p>  Tourists are advised to book rooms either in building ‚ÄúD‚Äù or in ‚ÄúC‚Äù.  They say that there the apartments are the most comfortable and cozy.  And in the building ‚ÄúA‚Äù it is noisy, since there is a swimming pool nearby.  By the way, it is advisable to be puzzled with the booking issue before the trip.  Preferably two months.  Otherwise, free apartments may not remain, because the hotel is quite popular and frequently visited. </p><p>  In general, this hotel is an excellent option for people who do not really find fault with the conditions and the presence of certain amenities.  The rooms have everything you need, the apartments themselves look decent and comfortable.  The restaurant serves fresh and tasty treats, and the location pleases with its proximity to the sea.  So if you want to have a good time on vacation, but there is not much money for booking a hotel, you should make a choice in favor of this complex. </p>
