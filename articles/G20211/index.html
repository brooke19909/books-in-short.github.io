    <h2>  Where did it come from? </h2><p>  The word is borrowed from Turkic languages, but in ancient times.  It was also used by the inhabitants of Ancient Russia.  For Turkic peoples, it meant ‚Äútreasury‚Äù.  After all, initially treasures accumulated jewelry and gold. </p><p>  According to the etymological dictionary compiled by Shansky N.M., Ivanov V.V. and Shansky T.V., the primary source of the studied concept is in Arabic.  In it, it is written as <em>chisaneh, chasneh</em> , which means "treasure."  Its variant is <em>chasana</em> , that is, the verb ‚Äúsave,‚Äù which also applies easily to the treasury.  After all, it determines the economic balance of the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="treasury is" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30158/1857184.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Basic interpretation </h2><p>  A treasury is state property, including budget funds, which are not distributed between enterprises, organizations and institutions.  It is used in phrases with the following words: state, military, monastic, municipal formation. </p><p>  On the other hand, the treasury is just money and valuables.  Then it is often used as an adjective.  For example, a government account or property. </p><h2>  Other meanings of the word ‚Äútreasury‚Äù </h2><p>  The first of these is a special term that is synonymous with breech.  That is, in a mortar gun the treasury is the rear end of the barrel, the place where the shell is placed.  This name arose due to the fact that the official brand was previously put on its back. </p><p>  There are still obsolete uses of the word.  So, in the Russian hut, part of the canopy was separated by a partition.  She played the role of a closet and was called a treasury or treasury. </p><p>  It was also called part of the hut of the Tatars-Mishars.  She was set aside for the kitchen. </p><h2>  From the history of Russia </h2><p>  In the fifteenth to sixteenth century in the Russian state there was such a central executive body - the treasury.  This body controlled the collection of most of the national direct taxes and customs fees.  His duties included checking the fulfillment of certain duties (for example, Yamskoy), as well as how Pushkari, pishchiki and others serve. </p><p>  This institution managed some areas of the state.  In addition, it actively organized the embassy business.  This executive body was the center of government administration.  Under him, even the formation of the State Archive took place. </p><p>  Among other things, the treasury was a reliable repository of treasures with the property of the princes.  At the head of the governing body were two treasurers, assisted by printers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance treasury" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30158/1857185.jpg" width="487"></div>

    <h2>  In conclusion </h2><p>  This word, by its definition, inspires confidence and reliability in people.  It is associated with a huge mountain, which can neither be circumvented, nor fly over nor move.  Therefore, it is used by many modern companies, using for the name.  An example is the Northern Treasury, an insurance company.  Just blindly trust the names is not worth it.  It is believed that their history should be studied. </p>
