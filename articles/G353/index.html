Many good words have been said about the work of the restaurant chef, as well as about the woman who baked delicious flat cakes with cheese and potato filling every afternoon. </p><p>  Tourists liked the location of the hotel - next to the promenade.  All important facilities are within walking distance, including a pharmacy, and inexpensive stores where you can buy not only gifts and souvenirs, but also clothes for a low price. </p><p>  Many tourists remember the musicians who come to the hotel three times a week, and especially the incendiary dance of the waiters who performed the national Turkish dance </p><p>  As for the rooms, some of our compatriots were somewhat annoyed by their small area - eighteen square meters.  But there are no complaints about the decor and design.  Some did not like the fact that in the evenings in the rooms there was the sound of a disco, which prevented children from sleeping.  And the rest I liked the hotel, many are even going to come back here again. </p>
