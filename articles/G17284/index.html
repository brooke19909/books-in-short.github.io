  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to increase the internal memory of the phone on Android: a detailed description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With each new generation of mobile gadgets, they have more memory, but the problem of its shortage does not disappear.  And the point here is not that the Android operating system is becoming more demanding, just in today's software the appetites are growing with almost every update. </p><p>  One of the vivid examples of such gluttony is applications for social networks.  The same Facebook needed 3 MB of internal memory in 2011, 30 MB in 2015, and today the program asks for almost a hundred megabytes. </p><p>  Naturally, to make them ‚Äúlose weight‚Äù is not in our power, but we can try to increase the internal memory of the phone on Android.  That is, to optimize its use as much as possible.  For owners of premium gadgets, this problem is not relevant, but for owners of budget devices, the tips below will come in handy. </p><p>  So, let's try to find out whether it is possible to increase the internal memory of the phone on Android and how to do it as painlessly as possible for the mobile device and for the user himself.  Consider the main methods and methods of implementing this enterprise. </p><h2>  Application revision </h2><p>  In this case, it is not so important where exactly you want to increase the internal memory: Samsung, Sony, LG phones or the ubiquitous Chinese.  Each firmware on the Android platform has an application manager that can be called up from the settings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to increase the internal memory of an android phone" class="if uuid-3229292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3229292.jpg"></div><p>  Having opened it, you need to press the menu button (gear or three vertical points) and select the "Sort by size" item.  The first in the list will be the most "heavy" applications that occupy a decent part of the drive.  They will just allow us to increase the internal memory of the phone after removal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Immediately it is worth warning that scratching all programs under one comb and ruthlessly getting rid of them is not worth it.  First of all, you need to pay attention to gaming applications.  Their work in no way affects the system, so toys can be safely removed.  Services from Google are better to ignore.  The only thing you can do with them is roll back updates, but not delete them. </p><h2>  Cache </h2><p>  To significantly increase the internal memory of the phone, pay attention to the Chrome browser, social network clients (especially Vkontakte) and the YouTube service.  This is the most voracious software on the Android platform.  Sometimes these applications consume memory many times more than the size of the distribution kit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to increase the internal memory of the phone" class="if uuid-3229290" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3229290.jpg"></div><p>  In order to increase the internal memory of the phone, you must click on each program in the manager and go to the "Memory" section.  There is an item ‚ÄúClear Cache‚Äù. Here you can also find out its size.  After the procedure, free space should increase significantly, especially if you did this for the first time. </p><h2>  SD cards </h2><p>  Buying an SD card is the easiest way to increase the internal memory of your phone.  After installing the drive, you can manually transfer volumetric data to it (music, video, etc.).  There is a second way - this is combining the card with the internal drive.  It works on platforms starting with version 7.0. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.theandroidportal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to increase samsung phone internal memory" class="if uuid-3229291" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3229291.jpg"></div><p>  As soon as you insert the external drive into a regular place and turn on the gadget, the system will prompt you to format it.  If this does not happen, then you must start this procedure manually through the menu - ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúMemory‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúClear (format) SD. </p><p>  After the cleaning procedure, the wizard will suggest transferring all the data from the internal disk to the card.  By agreeing, you will combine both drives, and the system will use two drives as one.  In order for the platform to work without failures and not "think" for a long time, it is better to buy class 10 SD cards. External drives with more modest performance will slow down the system. </p><h2>  Cloud storage </h2><p>  Manufacturers of mobile gadgets do not really favor memory cards, more and more often we see smartphones on sale without the possibility of installing an external drive.  Widely sought after devices from China like Xiaomi, Huawei or Meizu make the user choose between a second phone number or SD card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.getsigneasy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to increase the internal memory of an android phone" class="if uuid-3229293" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3229293.jpg"></div><p>  Is it possible to increase the internal memory of the phone without an external drive?  Easy.  At your service cloud storage.  The latter are noticeably ‚Äúwiser‚Äù and can now automatically upload your files to themselves: photos, videos and other content with data.  Naturally, all the actions of cloud storage can be limited. </p><p>  Some services go further and, when lowering a certain memory threshold on your device, they themselves delete information, a duplicate of which is in the cloud.  Similar functionality in a quality implementation can be seen on OneDrive from Microsoft.  The service gives free 5 GB to each new user and another 1 terabyte from above for subscribing to office products (Office 365). </p><p>  You can also note other services that are very popular.  These are Dropbox, Google Drive, Mega and Yandex.Disk.  Reviews about them are mostly positive and they work like clockwork - without failures and brakes.  And the prices for tariffs are quite reasonable. </p><h2>  External drives </h2><p>  If we are talking about a radical increase in internal memory, then you can pay attention to external hard drives.  The latter are connected via a USB interface and an adapter (OTG adapter).  Some manufacturers include all the necessary tools for this procedure in the package.  In other cases, the cable with the adapter will have to be purchased separately. </p><div class="photo" data-original="es.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="drive type c" class="if uuid-3229294" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3229294.jpg"></div><p>  If the variant with the adapter does not suit you, then you can look towards flash drives with the Type-C interface.  The latter fits perfectly with the standard connectors of modern smartphones and does not require any third-party adapters.  As a rule, such flash drives on the other hand have a classic Type-A interface.  Therefore, there will be no problems connecting to desktop devices or laptops. </p><h2>  Features of external drives </h2><p>  Unlike the usual flash drives, the cost of Type-C is much higher.  For example, an option for 128 GB will cost about 2500 rubles.  While ordinary drives of high capacity, you can buy rubles for 800. </p><p>  It is also worth noting the choosiness of external hard drives to the USB interface.  It may happen that your smartphone simply can not feed such a voracious periphery.  This mainly applies to models from the public sector.  In this case, manufacturers save on everything they can and on the power of interfaces as well.  For gadgets from the mid-price and even more so premium segment, this was not noticed. </p>
