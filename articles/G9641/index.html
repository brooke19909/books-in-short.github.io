    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  A number of negative moments can arise during a vacation in such an institution as the Kissos Hotel 3 * hotel.  Reviews note the following hotel shortcomings: </p><ul><li>  breakfasts are repeated day after day, and therefore annoying after a short time; </li><li>  in croissants served in a coffee shop, there is practically no filling; </li><li>  there are a lot of algae on the beach that nobody takes away; </li><li>  in spite of the fact that the birthday is provided with a bonus in the form of a cake, it is not provided even after a reminder; </li><li>  use of a safe and a refrigerator in the room is possible only at an additional cost; </li><li>  strong audibility between numbers; </li><li>  old washed towels with holes and patches on them; </li><li>  in hard to reach places do not rub dust; </li><li>  there is no makeup in the bathroom; </li><li>  the old atmosphere in the hotel (at least cosmetic repairs required); </li><li>  the air conditioner is too noisy and practically does not cool the air in the room; </li><li>  the hotel does not have its own beach area; </li><li>  cramped pools; </li><li>  to take the adapter for the outlet, you need to make a deposit of 5 euros; </li><li>  the doors that lead to the emergency staircase are constantly locked, and it is not known where the keys to it are; </li><li>  An old elevator that suspiciously buzzes and rattles during operation (it‚Äôs safer and faster to walk up the stairs); </li><li>  there is a radio in the room, but it does not work or is very fonit; </li><li>  instead of double beds, shifted one and a half are provided, which constantly disperse due to the wheels on the legs; </li><li>  when you check in, no one takes you to the room and will not help to carry heavy suitcases; </li><li>  the hotel does not have beach towels, and therefore, if you did not take them with you, you will have to buy on the spot; </li><li>  wireless internet is not working well. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  A pretty positive impression is made by Kissos Hotel 3 * (Paphos).  Reviews note that the main drawback of this institution is the outdated repair, which has not been updated for a long time.  Not in the best condition and technical equipment.  That is why this hotel is not suitable for those who like to spend most of their time on site.  Nevertheless, considering budget prices and convenient location, active travelers can safely choose a hotel. </p>
