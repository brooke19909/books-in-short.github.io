Archaeologists find household items of ancient people who lived in this territory in the IX-VII centuries.  BC  e.  On the territory of the modern Arkhangelsk region once interesting events took place, believe me, she has something to tell us. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  On the territory of the <span>Arkhangelsk region</span> , sites of people from the Paleolithic times were discovered.  The region has an impressive history, during which many events took place in the world, civilizations arose and collapsed.  We will consider the <span>history of the Arkhangelsk</span> region briefly. </p><p>  The entire territory of the region is dotted with rivers and lakes, the largest of them are the Northern Dvina, Onega, Mezen and Pechora.  About 2.5 thousand lakes, the largest of which are Lacha, Kenozero and Kozhozero.  In ancient times, all settlements were located near water bodies.  The rich fauna and flora attracted our ancestors here.  The remains of these ancient settlements are still found by archaeologists and paleontologists. </p><p>  The first written mention of the region can be found in the charter of the times of Prince Svyatoslav Olgovich (1137), who collected church tithes from local residents. </p><p>  After the Mongol-Tatar invasion of the territory of this northern region, a mass migration of the population of Russia began, in connection with this the number of Slavs in these lands increased significantly. </p><p>  In the XIV century, according to the annals, the land of the Arkhangelsk region belonged to Novgorod and was called Dvinskaya.  However, in the XVI century.  they recaptured her.  The territory became part of the Moscow principality.  It was at this time that a new city was built at the mouth of the Northern Dvina - Novo-Kholmogory (Arkhangelsk). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The importance of the region greatly increased during the time of Peter I, who organized extensive shipbuilding there. </p><p>  After the civil war, the territorial structure of the Arkhangelsk region repeatedly changed.  The region was called the Northern Territory and was part of the <span>Vologda Oblast;</span> it owned the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug and the Republic of Komi.  As a result, after all the transformations, on September 23, 1937 the history of the Arkhangelsk region with the capital Arkhangelsk began. </p><h2>  Arkhangelsk </h2><p>  Arkhangelsk is the largest city in the north of Russia, located at the mouth of the Northern Dvina River.

At the same time, the city was also a major forestry center. </p><p>  In Soviet times, he did not lose his significance, continuing to carry out important economic functions.  The city, along with Molotovsky and Murmansk, during the war years was one of the main ports that received cargo of allied countries.  For which he subsequently received the honorary title "City of Military Glory." </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.blablacar.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Arkhangelsk" class="if uuid-2511774" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2511774.jpg"></div><p>  Now the city is actively developing and has more than 350 thousand people.
