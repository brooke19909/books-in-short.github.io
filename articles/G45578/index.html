  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitting bags</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A bag is the most important accessory for a woman‚Äôs costume.  <span>A ladies handbag</span> contains so many very important and necessary things that to do without it is simply unthinkable.  It is no coincidence that there are psychological tests that determine the individual character traits and personal characteristics of its owner by the contents of the women's handbag.  But the handbag is also part of the woman‚Äôs appearance, a vivid example of her individual style.  Faceless, uninteresting and shapeless bags are unlikely to be able to decorate the female image and give it charm and originality.  Once the famous fashion designer Vyacheslav Zaitsev called on women to make handbags with their own hands, bringing a certain ‚Äúzest‚Äù, originality to their wardrobe, to challenge standard grayness and facelessness of consumer goods. </p><p>  It‚Äôs not difficult to create an original handbag, knowing how to sew or knit, and a bright, designer accessory made by yourself will certainly adorn the summer outfit, it will be very appropriate on the beach, during a country outing, and in the city too.  Knitting bags with knitting needles and crochet is an exciting and interesting process, like any other creative activity.  To begin with, you can limit yourself to making a simple clutch or tie a handbag-bag for walking. </p><p>  <strong><span>Knitting bags with</span> needles.</strong>  <strong>Smart clutch</strong> </p><p>  To knit, you need a dense yarn with nylon or silk thread of medium thickness.  It is better to choose yarn that is well twisted and stiff so that the finished product keeps its shape.  It will take about 200 grams of thread.  Knitting needles corresponding to the thickness of the yarn, about 3-4 mm.  The clutch is knitted with a dense embossed pattern.  The ‚Äúrice‚Äù pattern will look good (1 row - 1 front loop, 1 wrong side, and in the second row, the front <span>loop is</span> knitted over the wrong side, and the <span>wrong side loop</span> over the front <span>).</span>  You can choose any dense relief pattern. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Clutch bag consists of a back, front walls, valve cover and two side parts.  The dimensions of the front and rear walls are 18 √ó 10 cm, the valve is 18 √ó 12 cm, and the side parts are 10 √ó 3 cm. The rear, front walls and valve are knitted with a single piece of fabric.  The number of loops equal to 18 cm is drawn onto the knitting needles and a patterned canvas 32 cm high is knitted. Then two side parts are made according to the given sizes. </p><p>  The finished canvas is folded according to the pattern.  To keep the handbag in shape, it is recommended to make the inner part of the same dimensions of thin artificial leather.  The lining is put inside the clutch and the two parts are joined together, tied around the edge with a "crustacean step" (single crochet, made from left to right) from the front of the product.  Hook holes are made in the leather lining.  The finished clutch can be decorated with <span>knitted flowers,</span> embroidered with beads or beads. </p><p>  <strong>Knitting bags with needles.</strong>  <strong>Tri-color bag</strong> </p><p>  From a yarn of three colors you can knit a very simple and beautiful bag for spring walks.  The design of the product is based on a combination of colored stripes and embossed textured knitting.  The bag is made of twisted cotton yarn in two additions.  To work, you need 250 grams of thread: 150 of one dark color and 50 grams of two other, lighter colors.  The work uses a combination of the ‚Äúrice‚Äù pattern with embossed stripes tied with a ‚Äúrope‚Äù and smooth facial knitting.  Knitting needles 4-5 mm.  The dimensions of the handbag are 26x28 cm. The front and back walls are knitted with separate parts. </p><p>  They start knitting with dark yarn with a ‚Äúrice‚Äù pattern.  After knitting 5 cm, they switch to a lighter yarn and knit a fabric, combining smooth knitting from front loops with stripes tied with a rope (all the front loops).  The colors of yarn combine to your liking.  Having tied up 18 cm of the central part of the handbag from a combination of different colored stripes, they again switch to the ‚Äúrice‚Äù pattern and knit 5 cm of the upper border.  When tying the upper border, make handles.  To do this, by tying 2.5 cm of the hem, close the loops in the center, as for creating a large loop, and in the next row, the closed loops are re-assembled.  Having knitted another 2.5 cm borders, all the loops are closed.  Both parts of the handbag fit equally.  Finished parts are sewn together, a lining is inserted into the resulting bag, and between the knitting and the lining - a rigid base of dense duplicate material, and neatly fixed on the inside of the knitting.  The upper edge of the bag and the loop of handles are tied with single crochet or ‚Äúcrib step‚Äù, laying a thin nylon cord under the harness, so the edge will be much denser and stronger. </p><p>  Knitting bags with needles or sewing <span>bags with your own hands</span> from various decorative fabrics will allow you to create unique things that will attract the attention of others and cause genuine interest in their creator.  Knitting a handbag is also a very interesting creative process that allows you to show imagination and artistic abilities. </p>
