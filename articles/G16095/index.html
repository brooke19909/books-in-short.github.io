But this should not scare away visitors, because in 2010 the hotel underwent a complete reconstruction and overhaul.  It is worth noting that the decoration of the hotel and the equipment of its rooms are quite modest.  At the same time, in the apartments you will find everything you need for a complete and comfortable stay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  On the very shore of the warm Red Sea is the Royal Paradise Resort 4 * hotel.  The location of the hotel is quite favorable, because it is located only 10 kilometers from the center of Sharm El Sheikh in the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãRas Om Elsid.
