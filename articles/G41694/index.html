It has more than seven centuries of history, traces of which remained in <span>architectural structures</span> and monuments.  This is a pretty beautiful village, occupying the fourth place in terms of population in the country.  To date, there is no clear version of the origin of the name of the city.  However, as well as the exact date of its occurrence.  Many historians adhere to the version that its name comes from the phrase "mighty lion."  There are those who believe that the key word is ‚Äúgrave‚Äù.  But such details of tourists are less interested than the sights of Mogilev. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of mogilev" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/271411.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Familiarity with the city is recommended to start from the historical center and Leninsky Street.  It is here that a large number of interesting structures and monuments are concentrated.  It is not for nothing that Leninsky Street is called the <span>"open-air museum."</span>  The sights of Mogilev can be combined into one large list, which is headed by the city hall.  It was originally built of wood, but it burned down in a big fire.  In 1679, the construction of the stone town hall began, which lasted almost two decades.  The building towered 46 meters above the ground and was significantly different from the previous one.  Now the roof was covered with tiles, and decorated the building, among other things, two porches with gilded weathercocks.  Currently, the building houses a museum of the history of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Mogilev and the Mogilev region" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/271409.jpg" width="600"></div>

Interesting is the building and the Bank of the Underground Peasant.  One cannot fail to notice such a magnificent building as the <span>Mogilev Drama Theater,</span> for the construction of which the place was chosen very carefully.  As a result, it was decided to build it in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe oldest public garden of the city - Muravyevsky, which locals now call Teatralny.  In 1888, the building was illuminated. </p><p>  But the sights of Mogilev do not end there.  Leninskaya Street rests on the Square of Stars, in the center of which the world's only monument to the Starsman is installed.  It is a sundial indicating the signs of the zodiac.  In addition to this place, it is interesting to walk along Sovetskaya Square.  Here are the administrative institutions of the city, the medical board and the district court.  In addition, there is a museum of local lore. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mogilev sights photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/271410.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  What else to see when arriving in the city of Mogilev?  Attractions, photos of which are already presented, can be supplemented with religious buildings.  One of these is the Catholic church - the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary.  The building was built in baroque style in 1738.  The interior and interior of the temple include several biblical frescoes located on arches in their list. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of mogilev" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/271408.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Those who do not have enough interesting places in the city can visit the sights of Mogilev and the Mogilev region.  So, near the village of Buinichi is located the famous memorial complex <span>Buinichnoe field.</span>  It is an arch connecting the alley with a chapel, the height of which is 27 meters.  Its construction is made in the style of East Slavic architecture.  The walls are made of light marble, on which hundreds of names of soldiers and militias are written.  And in the village of Polykovichi there is the famous Polykovichskaya krynitsa in Belarus, which is also called the "miraculous source."  Near her is always quite crowded. </p>
