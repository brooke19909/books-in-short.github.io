    <h2>  Centara Karon Resort: Russian traveler reviews </h2><p>  Modern tourists do not need to explain how important it is with all responsibility and attention to approach the issue of planning a trip abroad.  This is especially true for the choice of the hotel in which you plan to stay during the holidays.  After all, everyone wants to settle in a comfortable room with comfortable furniture and properly working appliances, have a pleasant view from the window and count on good service and a friendly attitude of the staff.  An invaluable source of information about hotels, according to many travelers, are the reviews of those who have recently stayed in a particular place.  Indeed, in their comments, former guests try to share not only positive impressions, but also talk about negative aspects.  In order not to waste time and effort searching and analyzing the opinions of tourists, we bring to your attention the generalized reviews of our compatriots who have recently visited the Centara Karon Resort (Karon Beach, Phuket).

    <h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  There were no complaints from the Centara <span>Karon Resort (Karon Beach)</span> guests on this item.  So, according to the guests, the hotel maids do their job perfectly, conducting regular cleaning, changing towels and updating bed linen.  In addition, as you use it, you will replenish the supplies of personal hygiene products in the bathroom and drinking water in the minibar.  Also keep in mind that if you need something extra, then you can always contact the maid in your building. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  There are internal rules at the Centara Karon Resort (Phuket).  5 *, by the way, is the level to which the hotel is rapidly moving forward.  Accommodation of newly arrived guests in the apartments intended for them begins after two in the afternoon.  However, as tourists note, in practice, often everything happens differently.  Thus, reception administrators always try their best to accommodate travelers who have just arrived in their rooms as soon as possible.  Therefore, even if you arrive at Centara Resort early in the morning, most likely you will be given the keys to the apartments long before checkout time.  Such an approach, many tourists considered a great advantage of this hotel.  Also, guests arriving from Russia and other CIS countries are usually met by a Russian-speaking administrator.  He will talk about the features and rules of the hotel and answer all questions. </p><p>  As for the day of departure, the occupied room should be vacated before noon.  If you plan to leave the hotel only in the evening, then you can either extend your stay for an additional fee, or leave things in the luggage room and continue rest until the time comes to go to the airport. </p>

After all, this beach is considered one of the most beautiful and cleanest in these places.  Moreover, both young people and family people with children like to relax here.
