  <section class="page js-page"><h1>An unforgettable vacation in Thailand</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most sought after destinations in tourism is Thailand.  Here you can enjoy the sun, white beaches, spa treatments and the best nightly shows of the world all year round.  The most popular holiday in Thailand is considered to be on the islands of Phuket and Samui, as well as in Bangkok.  This country is often called the "country of a thousand smiles."  Thai culture involves a very careful and respectful attitude towards the guest.  Such sincere friendliness and courtesy can no longer be found in any corner of the world.  One gets the feeling that the most important people for Thais are their guests. </p><p>  Last minute tours to Thailand are very popular, which allow you to relax in a tropical paradise for modest money.  The optimal time for a vacation is considered from December to the end of February.  Conventionally, a year is divided into three seasons: hot, rainy season and cool.  For residents of northern countries, even a relatively low temperature of + 27s during the cold season will be an excellent addition to the vacation.  If a beach <span>holiday in Thailand</span> was chosen <span>,</span> then most tourists choose Phuket or Samai and prefer to check in to small hotels located near the coast.  The country is washed by the Indian Ocean and the <span>Gulf of Thailand.</span>  Thai beaches are rightfully considered one of the best in the world.  There are also SPA centers that can restore strength and beauty to any traveler. </p><p>  You can spend your holidays in Thailand by exploring numerous attractions.  This is a country with a huge centuries-old history and interesting traditions.  In its capital, Bangkok, a large number of memorable places that can not be ignored.  If the rest in Thailand came at the beginning of December, then there is a good chance to get on the king‚Äôs birthday, which in this country is considered a public holiday.  It takes place annually on December 3.  On this day, the Royal Guard in Royal Plaza solemnly confirms his oath to the king, and on December 5 the country is buried in a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãlights and decorations.  Thais are very fond of their king and consider him godlike.  Since 1782, Thailand has been ruled by a single Chakri dynasty.  In the days of this holiday, people sincerely rejoice and celebrate the event.  In Bangkok, there is the Royal Palace, consisting of 95 pagodas.  There is a huge gallery, 148 frescoes depicting episodes from the life of Rama I. On the territory of the Royal Palace there are libraries, <span>Buddhist temples, a</span> residence with several throne rooms and rooms for business negotiations, the Mausoleum, where the cremated remains of members of the royal family are located.  Interestingly, women should never touch the monks.  It is forbidden to enter the temple in shorts, shoes with open backs and T-shirts that open your shoulders.  If the tourist does not have the opportunity to change into more suitable clothes, then he can rent it here. </p><p>  You can not imagine a vacation in Thailand without its amazing and incomparable cuisine.  It can be tasted both in large restaurants and in small family cafes, where the traditions of its preparation are carefully kept.  She is very spicy and bright.  <span>Thai cuisine</span> primarily uses seafood, as well as duck and chicken.  The side dish is most often served rice or vegetables.  At first, the body may not perceive this food, but by the end of the vacation, tourists take some recipes for themselves.  In the midst of the tourist season, it is very difficult to buy last-minute trips to Thailand, because the demand for them is very high.  This is due to the excellent service, interesting show programs, a huge number of attractions - and all this for a completely nominal price. </p>
