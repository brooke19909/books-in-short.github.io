  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What requirements should a 3 star hotel meet?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each "star" assigned to the hotel, by European standards, is a measure of the level of service provided by the hotel to its customers.  And although there are some general criteria, each country in Europe assigns some additional conditions so that its hotels differ from hotels in other countries.  In this article we will talk about the general criteria that a 3 star hotel should meet, and also pay a little attention to the distinctive features of hotels of this level in some individual countries. </p><p>  Each 3-star hotel receives its rating due to the number of rooms and places in them and their size, as well as the comfort of the proposed conditions.  Nothing in the room should prevent the client from freely placing himself and arranging things in the order he needs.  Such a hotel must have a shower in every room, equipped with hot and cold water, a hairdryer and other amenities.  Telephone communication works both internal and external.  The guest should not have problems with telephone conversations without leaving the room. </p><p>  The classification of a 3-star hotel places great demands on the equipment of the hotel.  The elevator in this hotel runs smoothly.  And in some of them there is a special freight elevator.  The hotel infrastructure is required to have, in addition to the dining room, where all guests eat, a restaurant and cafe, where there should be an internal passage for customers and a separate entrance for staff.  In hotels of this class they usually offer a service for using a minibar, or, for example, can bring ‚Äúbreakfast to bed,‚Äù of course, for a fee. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The 3 star hotel pays particular attention to the safety of its customers.  He is obliged to have <span>emergency lighting</span> and emergency methods of power supply, fire alarm.  And in some countries in hotels of this class a static generator is installed to reproduce energy in the event of an unexpected outage. </p><p>  The 3 star hotel puts forward great requirements to the level of staff.  Not to mention benevolence, patience and restraint, those who contact people living in the hotel are required to know at least two <span>international languages</span> spoken by customers.  In addition, if those people who live in the region where the hotel does not speak these languages ‚Äã‚Äãoften stay at the hotel, then the ability to explain in the local dialect is also a mandatory requirement for staff.  <span>Medical books,</span> wearing a uniform with a personal badge are requirements that the classification of a 3 star hotel necessarily includes. </p><p>  Now a little about those features that have the characteristics of a 3 star hotel in some countries popular for visiting by tourists. </p><p>  In France, 3 star hotels are located in old mansions and have a wide range of services with a swimming pool, two-time housekeeping.  In hotels 3 stars in the Netherlands in the rooms required a personal shower.  You can choose between smoking and non-smoking rooms with an extra bed for children.  Wireless internet is available as an additional service.  In Turkey, the 3 star hotel has a TV and air conditioning, besides the toilet and the bathroom.  You must admit that in such a hot country this is very important. </p><p>  It should be noted that the division of hotels into types according to the number of stars is still very conditional.  In different countries, the level of service in hotels of the same type is very different.  Therefore, if you are going on a trip, ask the manager of a travel agency about the living conditions in a particular hotel.  Just relying on ‚Äústardom‚Äù means risking the amenities that you will miss during your stay in a foreign country.  Experienced managers know this and agree in advance on where the tourists will live. </p>
