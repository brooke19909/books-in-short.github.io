  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to sew clothes for the dog yourself</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A good dog owner should not only take care of the nutrition of his pet, but also of his walk.  Quite often, the weather conditions in our climate leave much to be desired, but the dog still needs to be walked, and at the time, ‚Äúwhen the owner does not throw the dog out into the street‚Äù both the owner and the dog have to go out on their own.  How to protect your pet from cold, wind, wet snow, rain, and even from heat and hot asphalt?  Mankind has invented a lot of different cuddles, jumpsuits, vests and boots for dogs.  But <span>specialized stores that</span> sell clothing for animals are found only in big cities, there are a lot of such things, and buying a new thing by eye is risky.  Some breeds, for example, dachshunds, due to their anatomical structure, need special, atypical patterns.  Therefore, often the dog owners face a difficult question - how to sew clothes for the dog yourself? </p><p>  On the Internet you can find a lot of detailed information on this topic, there are good patterns and step-by-step instructions that clearly and clearly tell and show in photographs how to sew clothes for dogs.  Therefore, for those who have at least some sewing skills, it will be easy to build a simple coddle for your pet, which will protect it from rain and wind or from overheating.  Those who are familiar with the needle and thread, and even better with the sewing machine, will be able to present their favorite real full wardrobe, where, among the necessary and simple clothes, there will be quite stylish gizmos and accessories. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before sewing clothes for dogs, you need to clearly know its purpose.  <span>Small breeds of dogs</span> and short-haired dogs freeze during walks.  In long-haired dogs, the fur coat gets wet and dirty during rain.  Based on what the clothing will serve for - to save you from the cold, heat or rain - we choose the material for tailoring.  Summer clothes should be light, preferably made of white or light cotton.  It should not tightly fit the dog‚Äôs body so that the skin ‚Äúbreathes‚Äù.  This summer vest is very easy to alter from an old children's T-shirt or t-shirt.  The dog raincoat must be made of waterproof fabric, for example, raincoat fabric.  <span>Winter overalls</span> can be two-layer: the top layer is a raincoat fabric from snow sticking, the bottom is a warm bike, wool, flannel.  Strips of reflective reflector fabric can be sewn onto the top layer (to reduce the risk of the dog getting under the car). </p><p>  How to sew clothes for a dog when the fabric for sewing is already selected?  Need to take a measurement from the dog.  Even for making simple blankets, you must know exactly the following parameters: the length of the body from the withers to the base of the tail, the coverage of the chest and the coverage of the body (for a boy - above the penis, for a girl - below the abdomen).  For the manufacture of more complex things, for example, overalls, you need to know the length of the front and hind legs, the width of the back.  Take responsibility for taking measurements very responsibly - after all, the dog‚Äôs clothing should be comfortable, not hampering the animal in movements. </p><p>  The next step is the pattern.  There are many books and articles that describe how to sew clothes for a dog, and attached patterns of a variety of clothes - from a hat to shoes.  But if you don‚Äôt feel skilled in sewing, start with a simple cuddle.  To do this, you will need a wide elastic band, fabric, lock or Velcro for fastening.  Using a pattern sample and guided by the measurements taken, cut the fabric into 2 pieces: for the back (large piece) and the tummy (small).  Sew the elastic in the shape of a tight collar.  Attach two pieces of fabric to the elastic.  Sew a clasp (Velcro) to a piece of cloth that serves as a cover for the abdomen.  Before sewing clothes for a dog on a typewriter, sew manually with wide stitches and try on a new thing for the dog.  If all is well - the ass is not cramped, does not hang out, you can sew stitches on a sewing machine.  The asshole is ready! </p>
