And one of the best (in terms of combination of price and quality) is Bulgaria.  This is a fairly popular country for tourism, and there are many hotels.  I would like to talk more about one of them, which is known as Dolphin Marina 4 *. </p><h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  This hotel complex is located in the resort of Saints Constantine and Helena.  It is not far from Varna - a major port city in Bulgaria.  The nearest airport is also located there. </p><p>  The resort got its interesting name thanks to the eponymous monastery, erected here back in the 18th century.  This is a very popular place among tourists, since there is a huge number of mineral springs concentrated here.  And here is the purest mountain air and sea in the immediate vicinity with excellent beaches.  Everything here is conducive to relaxation and recovery. </p>

    <p>  For two people, living in such a room during the week will cost about 50 thousand rubles.  It turns out only 25,000 each.  And this is with the all-inclusive service!  It is also worth noting that prices can change - sometimes potential guests have a real chance to save, and a good amount (25, 30, 40%).  However, since the hotel is popular, it is better to use early booking if you want to relax here. </p><h2>  Other apartments </h2><p>  Dolphin Marina 4 * (Saint Konstantin und Elena) has more family rooms.  In fact, they do not fundamentally differ from the previously mentioned 2-seater.  The area is the same, the number of sleeping places is the same, but it is only designed for 2 adults and 2 children.  And for them, the price of a weekly stay will be 70-75 thousand rubles.  By the way, it is worth remembering that those who are under six years old are considered children.  All who are older are registered as adult guests occupying a separate place. </p><p>  But the most expensive will be 3-bed rooms.  They are designed for three adults.  And their price is 85-95 thousand rubles a week.  By the way, it is worth remembering that all prices are inclusive of 9 percent VAT and city tax, which is 0.5 ‚Ç¨ per day per person. </p><h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  Before you start buying tours to Dolphin Marina <span>Hotel 4 * (Bulgaria),</span> it is worth familiarizing yourself with some important nuances. </p>
