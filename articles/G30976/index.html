  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Additional earnings in Minsk: interesting ideas, side job options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The opportunity to increase your own income is attractive to many residents of the capital of Belarus.  To this end, they try the various options available.  Someone starts their own business, while someone is simply looking for additional income in Minsk.  About the last of the above ways to improve their own well-being - later in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.saba-adhesives.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="additional income in Minsk at home" class="if uuid-3042564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3042564.jpg"></div><h2>  Search Features </h2><p>  According to experts, the competition in the labor market in Minsk has recently intensified.  Only one vacancy has several applicants, which allows the employer to make a choice.  And this is provided that the majority of vacancies in the country are in the capital of Belarus. </p><p>  Most in demand are specialists in the field of sales, information technology, or simply IT.  Demand is observed in the hotel and restaurant business.  At the same time, the number of vacancies in the field of logistics is reduced. </p><p>  Due to high competition, many potential employees have to reduce wage requirements and working conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="additional earnings in Minsk in the evening" class="if uuid-3042566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3042566.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting ideas </h2><p>  Even if before you were not interested in extra income in your free time in Minsk, the options below will make you change your mind.  So, what options does the labor market offer for those who are looking for not only a profitable, but also an interesting way to replenish their own wallet? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Dating Consultant. </li><li>  Bee breeding. </li><li>  Selling online courses. </li><li>  Partnership with Etsy. </li><li>  Participation in online surveys. </li></ul><p>  Let us dwell separately on each of the above options. </p><h2>  Dating consultant </h2><p>  Curiously, such work does exist.  At the moment, a large number of dating sites offer their own services.  Each of them has registered thousands of users whose profiles are lost in the mass of identical profiles. </p><p>  The consultant‚Äôs job is precisely to draw attention to the profile of his own client.  For example, choose successful photos, compose an interesting story about the applicant on his behalf, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dorstener-arbeit.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="additional earnings in free time in Minsk" class="if uuid-3042568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3042568.jpg"></div><h2>  Bee breeding </h2><p>  If you believe the reviews, farmers engaged in the production and sale of honey can receive a very substantial additional income in Minsk in the season. </p><p>  Of course, such an activity, like any other, requires a certain amount of time and skills.  In addition, this is seasonal profit.  Therefore, the rest of the year, you can do basic work or consider other ways that will bring additional income in Minsk. </p><h2>  Selling online courses </h2><p>  Most people have certain knowledge and skills that they can share with others.  And it‚Äôs not at all necessary to do this for free.  You can create an information product and sell it for money.  This is an option for those who are looking for extra income in Minsk at home. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can engage in such activities absolutely in any free time, even if you have a permanent job.  Selling info courses is also attractive because it becomes a passive source of income.  It is enough to release a digital product once, and then earn an unlimited number of times on its sales. </p><h2>  Partnership with Etsy </h2><p>  This is the name of an international portal that allows people from all over the world to sell various products of their own manufacture.  For example, it can be accessories, clothes and other items. </p><p>  This additional income in Minsk is more attractive for a woman than for a man.  In addition, for many, this allows you to turn your favorite hobby into a source of income. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="additional earnings in Minsk for a woman" class="if uuid-3042571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3042571.jpg"></div><h2>  Participate in online surveys </h2><p>  Enormous competition is observed in the market of goods and services.  This is why large companies are willing to pay respondents to participate in surveys.  To obtain income in this way does not require absolutely any knowledge and skills.  It is enough to meet the requirements that marketers put forward for survey participants. </p><p>  The respondent has to answer simple questions.  Such extra income in Minsk, as a rule, does not bring serious income.  However, it does not require a large investment of time and effort or the presence of certain skills. </p><h2>  Side job options </h2><p>  Even with a permanent job, many are interested in the possibility of generating additional income.  In this way, for example, you can save up for a vacation or a large purchase. </p><p>  One of the options for additional income in Minsk in the evening is available to those who have their own car.  Simply install an application that allows you to provide private pick-up services.  For each trip payment is charged.  Therefore, this method is convenient for several reasons.  Firstly, it allows you to work part-time exclusively in your free time.  Secondly, you do not need to wait long for the payment of income. </p><p>  If you are interested in a remote part-time job, pay attention to the vacancy of a content manager.  It usually does not require highly specialized skills and is suitable for those who can use a computer.  The essence of the work is to publish various materials on the site on the instructions of customers.  Payment is piecework and depends entirely on the amount of work performed. </p><p>  There are many options for a side job.  However, there are no universal recipes.  Experts recommend earning on your own talent.  For example, some can draw.  This allows you to paint portraits to order.  Potential customers can be found among your own acquaintances, in social networks, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lag-arbeit-hessen.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="additional earnings in the city of Minsk" class="if uuid-3042569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3042569.jpg"></div><h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  And finally, some useful tips: </p><ul><li>  You need to think realistically.  If a simple fee is offered a colossal fee, it is likely that you are faced with scammers.  And soon you will be asked to deposit a certain amount to get the desired job.  It is better to refuse such an offer. </li><li>  Money does not pay for nothing.  The more skills you have, the more likely you are to receive decent pay.  And do not interrupt from a penny to a penny.  That is why experts recommend gaining new knowledge rather than spending their own lives in anticipation of high pay. </li><li>  Better to opt out of an unpaid trial period.  It is highly likely that in this way employers simply use free labor.  Find a better deal for yourself. </li></ul>
