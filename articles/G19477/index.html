Griffith Park is no exception.  346 days a year, he is the set of Hollywood projects.  But this does not stop tourists from exploring and getting acquainted with all the attractions of the park. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  The largest city park in the United States was created as if according to the classic Hollywood script.  In the mid-nineteenth century, the territory, 5 times the size of the Central Park of New York, was owned by Antonio Felise.  The ranch located on the eastern slope of Santa Monica was called Los Felice.  A neighbor-villain and a corrupt lawyer tricked them into signing a will in their favor with a terminally ill landowner.  The young blind girl, the niece of the first rancher, was left without a livelihood.  The unfortunate damns scammers and prophesies troubles and misfortunes to future land owners.  Family troubles, tragic deaths and financial troubles tormented ranchers until Jay Griffith bought it. </p><p>  A native of Wales immigrated to California during the Gold Rush.  Ability and perseverance allowed him to succeed.  He bought a ranch for the income from entrepreneurial activity, later converting it into a profitable ostrich farm.  Wanting to thank the country and the city, which gave him the opportunity to succeed, Jay Griffith gives compatriots 1,200 hectares of land.  He also sponsors the design and landscaping of the park.  In mid-December 1896, on the eve of Christmas, the grand opening of Griffith Park took place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Over the past time, the park has increased 1.5 times.  It turned out an amazing symbiosis of preserved wildlife and territory organized for modern recreation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitcalifornia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="griffith observatory" class="if uuid-3212681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117828/3212681.jpg"></div><h2>  What to see </h2><p>  In Los Angeles, you will first be advised to go to the observatory.  Opened in 1935, it became the park's most visited site.  Exhibition halls, a planetarium and, in fact, an observatory can be seen for free.  That was the desire of the founder of the park.  The only thing you have to pay for is watching the show "In the Center of the Universe".  Tickets are sold at the box office of the observatory in a live queue.  Neither reserve nor order them in advance. </p><p>  The building, designed by John Austin, was renovated in 2006.  The planetarium dome has been restored, the number of exhibition halls has been increased.  At the same time, it was possible to maintain the interior of the rooms in the Art Deco style. </p><p>  The Foucault pendulum, the Tesla coil, interactive stands and expositions allow you to visually get acquainted with the physical laws and phenomena of our world, modern telescopes - to see the secrets of space, and the observatory museum - to learn how it all was created and worked. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rootsrated.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wild vacation" class="if uuid-3212682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117828/3212682.jpg"></div><h2>  Wild holiday </h2><p>  More than 60 km of hiking and biking trails have been laid.  Or take a horse ride.  The routes are equipped with drinking water, there are places for relaxation and a picnic.  Wild animals are found in remote corners of the park.  Most often, tourists see coyotes, but some claim that a cougar lives in the park.  You need to carefully follow the signs and read the information stands, warnings.  Poison oaks grow on the territory and snakes are found.  It takes about 3 hours to walk from the entrance to the park to the Sunset Ranch observation deck. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Each of the 10 million visitors to the park for a year chooses entertainment to their taste. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailyventure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="travel town museum" class="if uuid-3212685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117828/3212685.jpg"></div><h2>  Park museums </h2><p>  On the territory of Griffith Park are located: Greek Theater, Museum of the Wild West (Autry National Center), Travel Town Museum. </p><p>  Greek Theater - an open-air concert venue.  It was built in 1929 with funds allocated by Jay Griffith.  Architect Frederick Heath created it in the form of a classical Greek amphitheater, successfully fitting into the natural landscape of the park.  Stunning acoustics and modern stage equipment allow for large-scale shows.  Opera singers and ballet troupes performed here.  Musicals and variety shows were shown.  Tina Turner, Deep Purple, Maroon 5, Elton John, Gipsy Kings and Paul McCartney performed on this stage.  Greek Theater is considered one of the best concert halls in America. </p><p>  The Autry National Center is named after Gene Autry, the "singing cowboy."  More than 500 thousand exhibits are constantly presented.  Among them are genuine artifacts of Native American culture, as well as the scenery and props of numerous films about the Wild West.  The structure of the museum includes the libraries of Autry and Brian, which conduct a lot of research and educational work.  Constantly changing exhibitions and educational programs familiarize visitors with the traditions and history of the western territories of the United States. </p><p>  The city of Los Angeles is the transportation center of California from its inception to the present day.  This can explain the existence of the Travel Town Museum.  Locomotives and locomotives, freight and passenger cars are the basis of the collection.  The originals and restored copies show the history of railways from 1880 to 1930.  Also represented are trolleybuses and cars of the beginning of the last century.  All exhibits are allowed to be touched, you can climb into the cabin or sit in the cabin.  A trip by miniature railway near the museum will delight adults and children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onshegoes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-3212686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117828/3212686.jpg"></div><h2>  Zoo and Botanical Garden </h2><p>  Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens are located on the Griffith Park common area.  You can see more than a thousand species of animals: Asian elephants, Komodo dragons, reindeers.  Reptiles and birds, mammals and amphibians - the zoo collection includes 29 species listed in the Red Book.  Animals are kept in conditions as close to natural as possible.  The minimum of cells is the maximum of freedom. </p><p>  The collection of the botanical garden is one with the inhabitants of the zoo.  It is she who creates the natural environment necessary for animals.  Regional representatives coexist with aliens from the rainforests.  Of particular interest are unique specimens such as bald cypress and Chilean wine palm.  7,500 species of plants give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe diversity of the kingdom of the flora of the planet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="losfelizliving.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="entrance to the park" class="if uuid-3211648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117828/3211648.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Griffith Park Address: United States, California, Los Angeles, North Trail. </p><p>  It is better to get by a rented car (there are ample parking spaces) or by taxi.  Walking from a bus stop or metro station is long and difficult, not everyone can handle a pedestrian climb.  The park is open for visits from 5.00 to 22.00. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="34.1365544" data-lng="-118.29419999999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/2/7/1/17271.png"></div><p>  Griffith Park in Los Angeles is closed for the night, perhaps so as not to disturb the ghosts of the first owners of the Los Felice ranch. </p>
