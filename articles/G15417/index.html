For most, these are two identical concepts, because there is not much difference.  Thanks to cable television, this border has been blurred.  To understand this issue, it is necessary to study in detail each representative individually. </p><h2>  What is a monitor? </h2><p>  If you do not know how the monitor differs from the LCD TV, then it is worth describing it a little. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alalam.ir" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Differs from Samsung TV" class="if uuid-2536460" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2536460.jpg"></div><p>  A monitor is a tool that is designed to receive and display graphic and textual information on a display.  The difference will be that there is no built-in tuner. </p><h2>  What is a television? </h2><p>  In the event that you do not know how the TV differs from the monitor for the computer, please note that this device is a component that receives and reproduces all video signals and sounds from various television stations. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of TVs and monitors </h2><p>  When you do not know what the difference is, it is worth noting the differences between the monitor and the TV: </p><p>  1. The TV has a larger number of possible <span>screen sizes.</span> </p><p>  2. Work behind monitors is usually carried out at arm's length. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  3. The TV does not imply proximity to the screen, because it is designed to view video information. </p><p>  4. On TVs, you can notice more picture elements. </p><p>  5. The number of pixels on monitors is higher than on a TV.  However, it can support more formats. </p><p>  6. The monitors do not have a remote control. </p><p>  7. The cost of monitors is lower than that of televisions with the same technical parameters. </p><p>  8. TVs do not have a built-in system for interacting with other components using various methods. </p><div class="photo" data-original="adhesivekey4220.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The monitor differs from the Samsung TV" class="if uuid-2536461" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2536461.jpg"></div><h2>  Which option is more suitable for a computer? </h2><p>  If you do not know how the monitor differs from the Samsung TV, then you should consider this topic in more detail.  Many people have a question, what can I use - a monitor or a TV for a personal computer.  There is no definite answer here.  To date, LCD TVs have gained quite a lot of popularity.  They are ideal for devices in a personal computer.  And if we talk about other models of TVs, then kinescope options have long receded into the background and are practically not used.  Plasma TVs are not suitable for such purposes.  LED TVs are also inferior to LCDs.  In addition, the television receiver cannot be used to work as a regular monitor if you are sitting at arm's length.  It is not suitable for flipping through documents on a large scale.  It can be used to view pictures, movies.  If you want to choose a TV for yourself and integrate it into a personal computer, then you should do it wisely. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tested.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How the monitor differs from" class="if uuid-2536476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2536476.jpg"></div><h2>  Which option is suitable for games? </h2><p>  Many users who often play various computer games are wondering how the monitor differs from the TV in games.  In this case, the personnel scan will be an important indicator.  If the game produces more than 50 frames per second, then you can use the TV.  In this case, the picture here will be smoother than when using a monitor.  But these indicators are not the most important.  One of the most significant is the Input Leg.  It shows how quickly the electronic parameters in the TV can display the received signal and display it on the screen.  Such a process can very often complicate the work, especially in games.  But when the game is console, then delays are possible.  It is worth remembering that the more expensive the TV will cost, the less delays there will be.  But many experts still prefer monitors, especially if they are the same diagonals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.quora.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The monitor is different from the TV" class="if uuid-2536479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2536479.jpg"></div><h2>  Monitor with tuner: what is it? </h2><p>  When you study the question of how the monitor differs from the TV, you may notice that in the first there is no tuner.  Some time ago, a computer model of the monitor was developed, in which the tuner was built.  But this is not a TV, so this innovation is not widespread.  The main difference here was the resolution.  In monitors, it is computer, which means that it does not allow you to record programs and configure yourself to the host‚Äôs preferences.  That is why models have not become popular.  But when people choose a small TV in the kitchen, they are ready for some simplifications.  Therefore, in stores they can offer a monitor with a tuner.  Why should you choose a TV and spend a little more money than stop on a monitor with a tuner?  Let's consider further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tested.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The monitor is different" class="if uuid-2536478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2536478.jpg"></div><h2>  Some reasons for choosing TVs </h2><p>  Among the main points of how the monitor differs from the TV, the following can be noted: </p><p>  1. The matrix.  It is an element that is used in televisions and monitors in order to transmit a picture.  In TVs, the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãusually designed to provide a wide viewing angle and good color reproduction.  If we talk about the monitor, then only a primitive option is built in.  If you deviate a little to the side, then the picture will change and inversion will be observed.  For monitors, this is not a critical moment, because the user is constantly in approximately the same position and can choose the best location option for himself. </p><p>  2. The inside.  If it comes to the monitor, then usually here the quality will be below average.  This is due to the fact that the signal in the computer will never deteriorate, but when connected in the form of a regular TV, the monitor will not cope even with noise reduction.  In this case, the TV can withstand various negative factors, such as imperfect broadcasting, low signal resolution and much more. </p><p>  3. Brightness.  For televisions, recently many manufacturers have been developing a system so that you can adjust the brightness to specific desires.  There is no such thing in monitors.  Primitive options are usually used there, which will be the standard.  Of course, there are special series here, but they will be expensive and difficult to find. </p><div class="photo" data-original="askopinion.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What is the difference between a monitor and a Samsung TV" class="if uuid-2536462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2536462.jpg"></div><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of using a TV as a monitor </h2><p>  When you do not know the answer to the question of how the monitor differs from the TV, then it is worth considering the merits of buying the second.  If we talk about the advantages of using a TV as a monitor, then we can distinguish the following: </p><p>  1. They have technology that allows you to highlight dark scenes.  This is acceptable for watching movies and games. </p><p>  2. The cost of the TV is quite advantageous, given the increase in the <span>diagonal of the screen.</span>  The purchase of such a device will save money. </p><p>  3. On the big screen, it‚Äôs quite comfortable to work with small details.  This is very often necessary for video editing. </p><p>  4. There is an in-depth diving effect. </p><div class="photo" data-original="askopinion.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The monitor is different from" class="if uuid-2536474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2536474.jpg"></div><p>  If we talk about the shortcomings, then it is worth noting the following: </p><p>  1. TVs have an increased level of contrast, which leads to a loss of detail in some dark colors. </p><p>  2. Saturation here is at a high level, which may make the work incorrect when processing photos. </p><p>  3. You cannot install models at close range, because even individual pixels can be seen on the screen. </p><p>  4. Eyes get very tired during prolonged use. </p><p>  5. There is an image delay function. </p><p>  6. Inconvenient work with text documents. </p>
