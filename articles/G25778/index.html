One such interesting technique is decoupage.  With it, you can transform even the most boring detail of the interior.  Also, craftswomen often resort to decoupling in preparation for the wedding: glasses, a bottle of champagne and other details made in the same style look very impressive.  Perhaps the most difficult kind of decoupage is considered to be work on glass.  In this article, you will not only learn about what is decoupling, but you can also get acquainted with its main techniques, learn about the features of work, and also find many ideas with photo decoupage of glass for inspiration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.allwidewallpapers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decoupled lamp" class="if uuid-2389197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2389197.jpg"></div><h2>  What is decoupage </h2><p>  Decoupage on glass has two varieties: direct - when the image is applied directly to the front of the product, and reverse - when the image is glued inside it.  Choose how you will decorate the product, depending on how you use this item.  If you plan to decorate the plate from which you will eat food, then it is better to make a decor on the back so that the food does not come into contact with the varnish, but if you are decoupling the jar in which you will pour the liquid, then the pattern must be placed on the outside so that it does not soaked from water. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="rljcpvrcodawkon.chroniclesofafoodoholic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="plate with ornament" class="if uuid-2389184" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2389184.jpg"></div><h2>  What difficulties can you face? </h2><p>  Decoupage on glass is one of the most complex varieties of this technique.  Since the surface of the glass is very smooth, there is practically no clash between glue and paper.  Also, all the shortcomings of the work are immediately evident due to the transparency of this material, and not all pictures are suitable for direct decoupage, since the borders of the picture can be visible under a thin layer of varnish. </p><h2>  What can be decorated in this way? </h2><p>  Glass items made in this technique will look very beautiful in the interior.  You can decorate using a decoupage technique a vase of glass, beautiful bottles of an unusual shape, plates, which can later be used to decorate kitchen shelves, Christmas balls that will be a wonderful gift for a holiday, candlesticks and more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="madeheart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wedding glasses" class="if uuid-2389183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2389183.jpg"></div><h2>  Materials </h2><p>  In order to decode any glass item, you will need: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  special paper for decoupage or ordinary kitchen napkins with a beautiful pattern; </li><li>  background paint; </li><li>  decoupage glue; </li><li>  spray varnish for decoupage on glass; </li><li>  brushes of different sizes (at least wide and very small); </li><li>  rubber roller. </li></ul><p>  You can also optionally use: </p><ul><li>  craquelure varnish - this varnish, applied to the product, covers it with small cracks, which makes the thing look like an old one and adds a twist to it; </li><li>  sparkles; </li><li>  beads; </li><li>  stained glass paints; </li><li>  tapes; </li><li>  half pearls and more. </li></ul><h2>  How to choose materials </h2><p>  It is not necessary to purchase expensive materials specifically designed for decoupage.  Their role may well be performed by analog products that will cope with their task no worse.  So, instead of special napkins for decoupage, you can buy kitchen napkins, the print on which will suit your product.  Instead of background paint, which is sold in decoupage departments on glass, you can buy acrylic paint and dilute it with gel medium for maximum transparency, rice paper can also play the role of background. </p><p>  It is not necessary to splurge on decoupage glue, especially if this is your first experience in decoupling.  Instead, you can buy the usual PVA glue known to everyone since childhood, or even use egg white.  Acrylic varnish can play the role of decoupage varnish on glass. </p><p>  Brushes need to be acquired in the following sizes and shapes: thick and fluffy - for working with paint, flat, small in size with hard bristles - for gluing the cut out picture, a thin brush will help out when it is necessary to finish the missing elements. </p><p>  Interesting work in related equipment using stained glass paints and decoupage.  If you purchase all the items for decoupling separately it seems to you too long and energy-consuming event, then in the shops for creativity you can find ready-made sets in which there will be everything you need for this lesson.  They will cost an order of magnitude more expensive, but they will significantly save time and eliminate the need to make a difficult choice between unfamiliar bubbles and jars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftbnb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Craquelure lacquered beverage jug" class="if uuid-2389180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2389180.jpg"></div><h2>  Glass Decoupage for Beginners </h2><p>  If you just decided to try, then get unprofessional means for decoupage.  You should not invest in materials until you understand that this technique is to your liking.  You should also not immediately take on complex objects such as furniture and articles of interesting shapes.  The easiest item to decorate will be a glass transparent plate. </p><h2>  Rules for working with glass </h2><ol><li>  The first thing to do before starting work is the degreasing of the surface for better adhesion of the glue. </li><li>  It is better to work with rubber gloves so as not to leave fingerprints, which can ruin the work, remaining under a layer of varnish. </li><li>  To work with dishes, which you then intend to use when eating food, there are special varnishes and paints. </li><li>  It is necessary to perform decoupage on the glass step by step.  The sequence of work is very important.  So, for example, after gluing the decor in a tissue technique, you can no longer apply the background. </li><li>  Any new coat should be applied only after the previous one has completely dried. </li><li>  Dishes decorated with decoupage must not be washed in a dishwasher. </li></ol><h2>  Decoupage on glass step by step with a photo: direct technique </h2><p>  Working with glass is quite complicated, but incredibly interesting.  Following these simple tips, even an inexperienced needlewoman can make an interesting product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diyforlife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Necessary materials" class="if uuid-2392297" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2392297.jpg"></div><ol><li>  First degrease the surface with alcohol or any alcohol-containing solution. </li><li>  Mark on the product how the drawing will be located.  This can be done using a conventional felt-tip pen. </li><li>  Now you need to apply tinting to the glass: a special paint or rice paper.  Paint the product.  If you want to create a transparent composition, apply glue instead of paint. <div class="photo" data-original="diyforlife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="creating a background for decoupage" class="if uuid-2392294" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2392294.jpg"></div></li><li>  Cut the necessary parts out of decoupage paper.  Instead of such paper, you can use a special film. <div class="photo" data-original="diyforlife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cutting parts" class="if uuid-2392296" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2392296.jpg"></div></li><li>  Now stick them on a bottle or vase, abundantly wetting with glue on top.  It is most convenient to do this using a hard brush. <div class="photo" data-original="diyforlife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decor placement" class="if uuid-2392293" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2392293.jpg"></div></li><li>  Immediately after drawing the pattern, remove excess glue with a sponge or soft cloth. </li><li>  Wait for the glue to dry and apply on top of the lacquer for decoupling in two or more layers. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="diyforlife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="finished candlestick" class="if uuid-2392292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2392292.jpg"></div><p>  When working in direct technology, it is necessary to cut out drawings from multilayer napkins or decoupage cards, but thicker materials will become noticeable: their borders will be visible through the varnish layer. </p><h2>  Reverse Decoupling Technique </h2><p>  The reverse glass decoupage technique for beginners step by step with the photo is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Mark on the product from the outside. </li><li>  Degrease the surface with liquid soap or alcohol-containing liquid. </li><li>  Stick on the reverse side of the decorated object ornaments cut from a napkin according to the marking.  Fix everything with glue and a hard brush. <div class="photo" data-original="www.craftbnb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="carving ornament" class="if uuid-2392444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2392444.jpg"></div></li><li>  Apply the background paint on top of the picture, the paint needs to be applied layer by layer, allowing it to dry out a little.  In total there can be up to 15 layers.  It is necessary to apply the background until the product ceases to shine through. </li><li>  Hide the work under a layer of varnish: one or two layers.  Apply a new layer only after the previous one has dried. </li><li>  Leave to dry completely for at least a day. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftbnb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decoupage window" class="if uuid-2392457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2392457.jpg"></div><p>  On the front side of the product you will see a beautiful pattern, and all the flaws of the work will be hidden inside.  This work has several advantages over direct technology and is more suitable for beginner needlewomen.  For her, you can use both photographs and any drawings that are printed on ordinary office paper that fit your idea. </p><p>  To prepare an ornament printed on plain paper for decoupling, you must first soak the sheet in a small amount of warm water and carefully remove the excess back layer of paper.  With photographs, such a technique will not work - the paint just peels off the photo paper.  Next, you need to dry the paper well and only then use it for work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mrikhwcfyedenqz.chroniclesofafoodoholic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reverse plate" class="if uuid-2389199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2389199.jpg"></div><p>  You can use special paint and varnish for firing.  If you use such materials, then after painting the decoupled item, you need to burn it in the oven.  Paints after additional heat treatment become more interesting, mixing with each other and forming new shades. </p><h2>  Decoupage mirror decoration </h2><p>  In order to get an unusual and very beautiful piece of furniture, you need to take a medium or large mirror.  Next, you need to use a felt-tip pen to circle the area that you will be decoupling.  Having picked up the decor, stick it in a direct technique and fix it.  Decoupage will act as a frame for the mirror.  It is important to combine the ornament with the rest of the interior.  Mirrors with a floral pattern in the interior in the style of shabby chic will look good.  Such a delicate detail can be the highlight of the whole room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="terrierbags.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decoupage mirror" class="if uuid-2389620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2389620.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, you learned how to perform decoupage on glass for beginners step by step, learned how to choose materials, learned a lot of useful things about the features of working in this technique.
