It is located at the southeastern part of the famous Lake Balaton.  The city is famous for its thermal and mineral healing springs.  Tourists come here not only from all over Europe, but also from all over the world: to relax, recharge with positive impressions and, of course, try the ‚Äúlife-giving‚Äù mineral water that gives youth.  For many diseases, bathing in thermal springs and drinking water rich in mineral and natural components are indicated. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="46.76547159999999" data-lng="17.247955400000023" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/3/2/5/11325.png"></div><p>  In addition to beach and spa holidays, you can take walks in the city to explore local attractions.  And there are a lot of them in Keszthely.  Both children and adults will find what to see and where to go for a walk.  For example, you should definitely go to the city center, at least take a look at the Town Hall.  Also required to visit the lake - Balaton and Heviz. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.skyscrapercity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Keszthely - Hungary" class="if uuid-2949472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45251/2949472.jpg"></div><p>  Keszthely is a tourist city, despite the fact that it is small, it is very comfortable.  Guests who come here for sightseeing and treatment in the thermal waters of Balaton note not only local beauty, but also the goodwill of the Hungarians - local residents - in their enthusiastic reviews.  Keszthely (Hungary) is a unique fusion of cultural heritage and modern thought.  Surprisingly, the inhabitants of the city and the authorities managed to preserve what they inherited from their ancestors.  And what's more, show it to others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Festetics Palace </h2><p>  In the 18th century, the city was bought by the Festetics family, who built a magnificent palace complex on the lake and built a beautiful park.  The castle consists of 40 separate rooms, in one of which is a library with more than 100 thousand copies of rare works of art. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ourvoyage.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="keszthely palace" class="if uuid-2949462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45251/2949462.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of the palace was designed so that it was possible to constantly expand and reconstruct it.  Recent changes in its facade took place in the 19th century.  Today the building is open to tourists. </p><h2>  City center.  Area </h2><p>  An equally interesting attraction of Keszthely (Hungary), photo below, is the central square.  On it are located the Town Hall and the column, which depicts the Holy Trinity and personifies the trinity.  The buildings were built in the 18th century, and they are made in the late Baroque style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.columbista.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Town Hall and city center" class="if uuid-2949450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45251/2949450.jpg"></div><p>  Immediately from the square begins the pedestrian street Kossut.  There are cafes, gift shops and other places that attract tourists.  You should definitely take a walk along this street to enjoy gorgeous views of the majestic buildings and structures made in the style of classicism.  Almost at the end of the street is the city hall. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Shumeg Fortress </h2><p>  One of the oldest structures that performed a defensive function during the siege of the city is the S√ºmeg fortress.  However, it is located far from the city of Keszthely (Hungary) - 25 kilometers.  A tourist can easily visit her by car. </p><p>  In the middle of the 16th century, S√ºmeg was occupied by the bishop, and until that time it had an exclusively defensive function and was considered a rather strong and impregnable structure.  Today, various events and costume shows are held here for tourists with a recreation of medieval reality. </p><h2>  Heviz Lake </h2><p>  Keszthely (Hungary) stands on thermal and mineral springs, because all the reservoirs that are in the city have healing power.  Lake Balaton is not the only one here.  Heviz is smaller, but no less valuable in its natural qualities. </p><p>  Thousands of tourists come here every year to take a dip in the healing waters. </p><h2>  Museums in Keszthely </h2><p>  The sights of the Hungarian city are not limited to palaces, town halls, lakes and beautiful squares.  There are interesting museums that are worth visiting for any tourist. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum City" class="if uuid-2949484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45251/2949484.jpg"></div><p>  And it will be interesting for children here!  The city has the following museums: </p><p>  1. Railway trains.  Located on the second floor of the Festetics Palace.  Here are models of both modern trains traveling throughout Europe and historical ones.  Tourists in miniature can contemplate the territory of almost the whole of Europe, where railway lines are laid. </p><p>  2. The hunt.  It is also located in the Festetics Palace.  Here are stuffed animals living in the territory of modern Hungary. </p><p>  3. Keszthely Georgikon.  A small city museum, which contains exhibits depicting the agricultural life of the country.  Here you can see a large number of agricultural machinery. </p><p>  4. Marzipan.  This museum will appeal to the smallest visitors.  Here are collected incredible marzipan crafts.  However, in the museum itself you can‚Äôt try and buy anything.  At the exit there is a shop where all kinds of souvenirs and crafts made from sweet material are sold. </p><p>  5. Puppet.  Lovers and collectors will love the Keszthely Puppet Museum.  Hungarians are very proud of this collection.  All exhibits are dressed up in folk costumes and are located on the windows in chronological order.  Thus, one can observe how the decoration of local residents changed depending on the change of eras. </p><h2>  Battyani Castle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourprom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Balaton" class="if uuid-2949482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45251/2949482.jpg"></div><p>  Not far from Lake Heviz, which is located about six kilometers from the city, there is an ancient castle of Battyani.  It is perfectly preserved, despite the fact that it was built in the 18th century.  It used to be a noble nest of a single pious Hungarian family.  Now the palace is open for tourists.  It houses a museum that stores family heirlooms and displays the realities of the time. </p><p>  Around the castle lies a gorgeous garden with centuries-old trees.  You can walk along it after examining the decoration of the palace. </p>
