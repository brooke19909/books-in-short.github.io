    <h2>  Construction </h2><p>  Initially, it was planned to make the Rozhdestveno station on the Arbat-Pokrovskaya line.  In this case, the exit would be carried out to the residential complex under construction in 2012.  However, subsequently exclusively cottages were erected in this place.  The need for the subway has disappeared.  It was decided to build a station, the exit from which would be at the intersection of Mitinskaya street and Pyatnitsky highway.  After all, this is a very densely populated area. </p><p>  Metro Pyatnitskoe shosse was built over two years.  In 2009, the residents of the city were aware of the upcoming opening of the station in the north-west of Moscow.  However, the name in the project was different.  On the metro map, the station under construction is designated as Pyatnitskaya.  But in the center of the capital there is a street that bears the same name.  In order to avoid misunderstandings, the westernmost station of the Arbat-Pokrovskaya branch received its modern name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 2014, the issue of renaming it again became relevant.  Russia was preparing to celebrate the anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War.  <span>The Council of Veterans</span> proposed to name the station "Defense".  The proposal was approved by the city authorities.  However, as they pass Mitino, the passengers hear the phrase in a pleasant female voice: "The next station is Pyatnitskoye Shosse." </p><p>  The metro station is usually built according to the project of engineers who won the corresponding competition.  It is not known what principles the jury members are guided by when choosing the best project.  Probably, both practicality and the aesthetic side play a role.  One way or another, the competition for the design of Pyatnitskoye Shosse was won by Mosinzhproekt employees. </p>

    <h2>  Architectural design </h2><p>  The metro station Pyatnitskoye Shosse has a magnificent appearance.  The walls are in black and white marble.  The design itself has an arched shape.  Among more than two hundred Moscow metro stations, only five have this feature. </p>

    <h2>  Arbat-Pokrovskaya line </h2><p>  Until 1984, the Mitino district was not part of Moscow.  But the Russian capital is expanding rapidly.  Perhaps, in about ten years, residents of Istra and Solnechnogorsk districts will also be able to proudly call themselves Muscovites.  Even at the beginning of the two thousandth residents of Baryshikha - another street located near the metro station Pyatnitskoe Shosse - and did not dream of getting to Red Square in twenty minutes.  The nearest station until 2003 was Kievskaya.  The wasteland could be seen where now stands a spectacular black and white building with the inscription "Pyatnitskoe highway". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The metro station, which ends in the west of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line, opened three years after the completion of the Mitino construction. </p><p>  Molodezhnaya, Slavyansky Boulevard, Kuntsevskaya, Krylatskoye, Strogino, Volokolamskaya and Myakinino were opened for six years.  That is, the construction of stations of the Arbat-Pokrovskaya branch was carried out at a fairly rapid pace. </p><h2>  Mitino Village </h2><p>  Not so long ago, there was not a single large shopping center in the Mitino area.  And before the beginning of the nineties there was a village at all.  In historical sources of the early seventeenth century, Mitino is referred to as a wasteland.  Later documents speak of it as a relatively large settlement.  However, by the end of the seventeenth century, the inhabitants of the village became much less.  The reason for this is the plague epidemic that gripped Moscow. </p><p>  Pyatnitskoe Shosse Metro is located where the new village was built.  And it happened in the XIX century.  That is, for more than a hundred years this zone has been practically deserted.  Since the revival of the village, the population has been continuously growing.  By the middle of the last century, it was about eight hundred people. </p>

    <h2>  Shops in Mitino </h2><p>  In the nineties, the area was actively built up with typical high-rise buildings.  Today it is one of the most prestigious in the capital.  There are many shops and shopping centers.  The closest to Pyatnitskoe Shosse metro is the Mandarin shopping center.  On the second floor of the center is McDonald's.  On the first - a round-the-clock Victoria supermarket.  In this shopping center there are shops offering perfumes, pet products, clothes, shoes.  In "Mandarin" is also located the restaurant "Chaykhona No. 1". </p><p>  Not far from the Pyatnitskoye Shosse metro station is Novy Knizhny, a pharmacy, two Sberbank branches and several other large shopping centers.  Namely: "Mitino", "Rook", <span>"Ark".</span>  <span>These</span> complexes are a ten-minute walk from Pyatnitskoye Shosse Station.  And each of them is located twenty to thirty meters from the exits from the Mitino metro station. </p><p>  Many residents of the area prefer to make purchases at the Otrada shopping center.  You can get to it from the Pyatnitskoye Shosse metro station by any of the buses or fixed-route taxis heading to Zelenograd or one of the villages of the Solnechnogorsk district of the Moscow region. </p>
