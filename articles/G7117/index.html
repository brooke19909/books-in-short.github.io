Tips, Features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Almost every Russian citizen over 18 uses cards of Sberbank.  The most popular operation is cash withdrawal at the bank's terminals.  Owners of credit cards can receive the required amount only within the limits of the card limit.  But sometimes customers need more money than the cash conditions suggest.  In order not to pay a commission to the bank, you should use one of the tricks on how to withdraw a large amount from Sberbank's card. </p><h2>  Cash withdrawal conditions at Sberbank ATMs </h2><p>  Withdrawing money involves cashing out a credit card account.  The amount the client can receive is limited by the daily and monthly limits.  Minimum client can get 50 thousand rubles in one day.  Amounts for which the bank does not charge a commission are taken into account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russia-ic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much can I withdraw from a sberbank card" class="if uuid-3212999" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3212999.jpg"></div><p>  If the client wants to get over the limit per day, he must pay the bank.  The size of the commission is 0.5% of the amount over the limit.  For example, if the limit on the owner‚Äôs card is 150 thousand rubles, and the owner wants to receive 200 thousand rubles, he will have to pay a commission of 250 rubles.  So much is a commission of 50 thousand rubles, which the cardholder withdraws in excess of the daily limit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to find out your limit? </h2><p>  Before calculating the estimated commission on the card, the conditions for its use should be clarified.  The client can find out information: </p><ul><li>  In the contract.  It is issued with the application for a card.  All tariffs on a debit or credit card of Sberbank will be registered there. </li><li>  In any branch.  It is enough to take a card and a passport with you.  The manager will help you figure out what the excess commission will be. </li><li>  By phone support.  By calling, a client of Sberbank will receive all the necessary information at any time of the day.  The call is free. </li><li>  On the website of Sberbank.  In the section devoted to bank cards, there is information on payment methods fees.  It can be downloaded as a separate file.  Or find the type of card used by the client and read information about it. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much money can be withdrawn from a sberbank card" class="if uuid-3212993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3212993.jpg"></div><p>  Information on tariffs will let you know how much money can be withdrawn from a Sberbank card without a commission.

If the client has no other account than a bank card, an employee of Sberbank will help create a new deposit. </p><p>  To transfer, you should open a savings or universal account.
