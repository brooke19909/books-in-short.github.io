However, there are a number of other ways.  We will consider them in more detail in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fa.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank logo" class="if uuid-2418724" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2418724.jpg"></div><h2>  What is it for? </h2><p>  In modern society, the use of plastic cards to pay for a service has become so commonplace that it is difficult to imagine a person using cash.  Because more and more services are switching to cashless payments, simplifying the method of payment for goods. </p><p>  In order to constantly use a bank card, it must have a positive balance, and for this it is necessary to put cash on the card.  Both in Sberbank and in any other similar institution, the client will be told about several ways to conduct this operation.  Conventionally, they can be divided into two categories: using cash and bank transfer.  These methods will be discussed below. </p><h2>  How to put money on a Sberbank card through the terminal </h2><p>  Everything is simple.  It is enough to find the appropriate device.  The plus is that no commission is charged from the client for this service.  But you need to understand that not every ATM designed for cashing out funds works at the reception. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="fincards.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="through terminal" class="if uuid-2419713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2419713.jpg"></div><p>  To perform the operation, you need exactly the device for payments (can be found in any branch of the bank).  All you need to have with you: a card and a PIN code.  Next, to put money on the card through the terminal of Sberbank, you must do the following: </p><ul><li>  Insert the card into a special port and make sure that the terminal has recognized it (on the screen should not be displayed messages about the error that has occurred and the impossibility of the operation). </li><li>  Enter the pin code.  Many terminals are equipped with special ‚Äúcurtains‚Äù that block the keyboard from prying eyes.  If there are none, it is better to obscure the buttons with your palm, so as not to become the target of attackers who want to illegally seize a bank card of a particular person. </li><li>  A series of keys will appear on the screen according to the names of operations that can be performed.  If the ATM is universal, then the withdrawal and deposit buttons will be available.  In this case, you need to select the option "Deposit cash." </li><li>  Banknotes are entered in a drive designated for this purpose.  The device can return too old or crumpled money.  You just need to align the banknote and insert it back.  If the funds are accepted, the required amount will be displayed on the screen.  When the required quantity has already been entered, press the "Next" key. </li><li>  Now you need to make sure that the amount of funds contributed is correct.  The screen will show which bills the ATM received and the total amount.  If everything is correct, select the "Perform operation" key. </li><li>  In the end, you only need to confirm the actions and complete the process. </li></ul><p>  Funds are credited instantly, the client receives an SMS notification to the phone number associated with the card.  Delay is possible in case of technical malfunctions in the terminal.  Usually this happens on holidays, when there is a lot of hype and, as a result, the servers can‚Äôt cope with a high number of requests.  This is a minus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.sberbank.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="enter pin code in terminal" class="if uuid-2418733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2418733.jpg"></div><h2>  Transfer to third parties </h2><p>  And what to do when you need not to yourself, but to someone else to put money on a Sberbank card?  As in the case described above, everything will be simple.  Only the algorithm of actions will change a little: </p><ul><li>  The card is inserted into the terminal.  The pin code is entered. </li><li>  Now you need to find the money transfer function to the plastic card number, and then enter this sequence of characters. </li><li>  Insert funds into the ATM and confirm the transaction. </li><li>  Pick up your card. </li></ul><p>  The advantages are the same: money comes immediately.  Cons may be that if the cards are issued by different branches, then a commission of 1% will be charged (but not less than 50 rubles). </p><h2>  How to put money on a Sberbank card through a cashier </h2><p>  It is even simpler here.  You just need to have your passport and the card number of the addressee (or your).  Actions will be as follows: </p><ul><li>  Wait in line. </li><li>  Give the employee F.I.O. the recipient, the card or account number, and also transfer the amount necessary for the transfer. </li><li>  Sign the documents provided by the cashier. </li></ul><p>  The positive point is the lack of commission.  But the negative one is that funds can be transferred within a few days.  Again, if the holidays, then the iteration occurs with a delay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, this method is more reliable than transferring to a Sberbank card through an ATM.  Putting money through the device, you may not understand that an error occurred somewhere.  Then you have to suffer: bother the support service, find out information, find out where the finances went. </p><p>  In the case of the cash desk, it is enough to ask the operator a question about how soon the transfer will be made.  Or contact him in case of any difficulties with the transaction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zagraninfo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cash deposit" class="if uuid-2419695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2419695.jpg"></div><h2>  Top-up via a payment terminal </h2><p>  Often these can be found in round-the-clock establishments: shops, night clubs, parking lots and gas stations.  The devices come in from different companies: Qiwi, Eleksnet, Comepay, etc. Can I deposit money to a Sberbank card using these terminals?  You can, you just need to find the appropriate function of transferring funds. </p><p>  The scheme is simple: </p><ul><li>  A card is inserted, a PIN code is entered. </li><li>  On the touch panel, select the button "Crediting funds to the account." </li><li>  Make the necessary funds through the drive.  It is important to make bills one at a time, making sure that the amount is displayed on the screen. </li><li>  Choose a team to confirm the payment and complete the action. </li><li>  Be sure to keep the check. </li></ul><p>  The advantages are that there are a lot of such devices, they are almost at every step, but the disadvantages are very significant.  Firstly, funds are transferred within five days.  Secondly, there may be a commission (depending on the company that supports the ATM).  Thirdly, if the funds were mistakenly credited to the wrong card (for example, a mistake is made in one digit), it will be impossible to return them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn----7sbabhdtyopighgk0aishk.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payment acceptance" class="if uuid-2419732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2419732.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, often such devices do not issue checks, which is an obstacle when interacting with the support service. </p><h2>  Through another bank </h2><p>  Not the most suitable option, which is largely similar to the above.  It requires all the same as when applying to the cash desk of Sberbank.  Crediting occurs usually within 3-5 days (it is better to check with the employee directly for details), but the commission is different everywhere. </p><p>  For this reason, a transfer through a branch of another bank is not very profitable.  If we are talking about large amounts, then it can even be costly. </p><h2>  By "Russian Post" </h2><p>  The most time-consuming option, but they sometimes resort to it if there is no other way.  A commission is taken for the transaction, and the period is from one week to ten days.  It is not very convenient for those who need to put money on a Sberbank card as quickly as possible. </p><p>  To complete a transaction in this way, you must: </p><ul><li>  Find the nearest Russian Post office. </li><li>  Fill out the form that the employee will provide. </li><li>  Present passport and amount for transfer. </li><li>  Get a document confirming the operation. </li></ul><p>  The positive aspects in this situation are indirect: you can always put money on a card in the Sberbank terminal, which are often located in the Russian Post building. </p><h2>  Via SMS Team </h2><p>  There are also ways to conduct transactions through a mobile phone.  To put money on a Sberbank card via SMS, you need to know the card number or account of the recipient, as well as have the ‚ÄúMobile Bank‚Äù function activated. </p><p>  If the specified information is available, then the actions may be as follows: </p><ul><li>  When transferring by card number, send an SMS with the words: TRANSFER [X] [Y] [Z], where X is the last four digits of the sender‚Äôs card, Y is the last four digits of the recipient‚Äôs card, and Z is the amount to be sent. </li><li>  In the event that the sender has only the addressee number, the command will look like this: TRANSFER [recipient number] [amount]. </li></ul><p>  After sending such a message to the short number 900, a response request will come with a confirmation code, which should be addressed again to the number 900. </p><p>  The amount will be debited from the sender's card and transferred to the recipient.  Instructions on how to deposit money to Sberbank's card via SMS may change, therefore (in case of unsuccessful attempt) it is recommended to contact the bank support service for detailed information. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lipstickdigitalmarketing.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer funds using your personal account" class="if uuid-2418742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2418742.jpg"></div><h2>  Recharge from a phone bill </h2><p>  There are times when you need to withdraw money from a phone number.  For example, the balance was (accidentally or on purpose) replenished by a large amount, and such should be transferred to the card. </p><p>  The service is provided only by the largest operators in Russia: MTS, Beeline and MegaFon. </p><p>  Transfer is possible only through the mobile service website, respectively, and the commission (with other requirements) is everywhere different.  On average, this is from 4 to 8% plus a fixed amount to be debited to 260 rubles. </p><p>  Figures may vary, as companies have the right to set the cost of services provided. </p><h2>  E-wallets </h2><p>  Another way to transfer funds is to use payment systems.  The most popular are: Yandex, QIWI and WebMoney.  Transferring from these wallets imposes its limitations, but it is convenient, since you should not resort to the use of cash. </p><p>  Everywhere there is a percentage, and money does not come immediately, but after a few days.  More details should be specified already in the "Personal Account" of the used payment system. </p><p>  This is not to say that this method is 100% convenient.  Many sites that provide a withdrawal of funds to these systems usually do not work with the more common withdrawal options - bank cards. </p><p>  The downside is that first you have to wait a long time for the transaction to the wallet, lose money due to the commission, and then transfer it to the card (again with the commission).  As a result, far from the whole ‚Äúpiece of cake‚Äù comes to ‚Äúplastic‚Äù.  And the negative is accumulating. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kapitalbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="through an electronic wallet" class="if uuid-2419724" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2419724.jpg"></div><p>  The option of using a plastic card issued by the same electronic wallet is also not very convenient: there are either very few or no ATMs that can cash funds.  A narrowly targeted application for the purpose of paying for purchases in a store makes it impossible to receive bonuses that an already "boring" card can give.  For example, "Thank you from Sberbank" bonuses when paying with a card. </p><p>  All of the above suggests that gradually people are moving away from using electronic wallets when it comes to large amounts.  Typically, these are used for small operations such as replenishing the balance of a mobile phone, paying for utilities or donation in online games. </p><p>  But if there is a need to put money both on the card of Sberbank, and any other, ATMs or cash desks are used.  Still, a large commission scares people away from such a convenient service as electronic wallets. </p><h2>  Through Sberbank Online </h2><p>  The service greatly simplifies the life of those who want to transfer funds from one Sberbank card to another.  To do this, you just need to log in to your personal account (it does not matter, through the official website or through the mobile application), select the "Money Transfer" item and enter the card number.  Then indicate the required amount and confirm the transaction. </p><p>  If the recipient has a bank card tied to a phone number, the process is greatly simplified: just enter the phone number.  And if the sender uses the mobile application, then you can completely find the contact list and forward the money with one or two clicks.  Again, provided that the recipient's card is tied to the phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.ugtu.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank online account" class="if uuid-2418727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2418727.jpg"></div><h2>  Balance replenishment </h2><p>  Using the Sberbank Online service, you can not only transfer funds to a card, but also replenish your mobile phone account.  Before you put money on your phone with a Sberbank card, you need to make sure that the account has the right amount.  You need to find a mobile payment point, select the desired mobile operator and enter the number.  Funds will arrive instantly, and the owner will receive a message about replenishment of the balance. </p><p>  Another way to deposit money to your phone through a Sberbank card is to deposit money through an ATM.  The terminal should have a mobile payment function.  The steps are extremely simple: </p><ul><li>  Insert the card and enter the pin code. </li><li>  Choose the appropriate team. </li><li>  Enter the amount to be transferred to the balance. </li><li>  Confirm transaction, pick up your card. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="freenews-en.tk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payment of bills using Sberbank" class="if uuid-2418738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2418738.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summarizing, it should be noted that putting money on a Sberbank card through an ATM or in any other way is quite simple.  It is enough to choose the most convenient option and act. </p><p>  In general, Sberbank Online is a very convenient application, because most people use it to carry out such operations.  The service is multifunctional, through it you can pay taxes, fines, utilities, as well as an overhaul bill. </p><p>  The relatively recently introduced function of reading a QR code has simplified life even more.  Now to pay the bill (for example, for utilities) you need to scan the code by selecting the appropriate command in the application, and then check the correctness of filling in the details that appear on the screen.  And then confirm the action.  Everything is as simple as depositing money to your phone from a Sberbank card. </p><p>  This eliminates the need to stand in line for a long time (and indeed leave the house) to pay the bill. </p>
