  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Canon cameras: only the best!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The latest model in the line of professional SLR cameras from Canon - EOS 70D.  Compare the novelty with the previous SLR cameras and, in order not to overshadow the impression of a really high-quality technique, we will only talk about the good. </p><p>  So, <strong>Canon EOS 70D</strong> .  The main advantage of this model among cameras of this class can primarily be called a decent resolution of the matrix.  Although, looking at the technical specifications of the 70D, it is difficult to say which of the items is the main one. </p><p>  Here, for example, this one: 70D is the only camera in the world with two-pixel CMOS focusing.  Or this one: the model has DIGIC 5+, the latest version of the image processor. </p><p>  Among all the cameras in question, it boasts the highest ISO value - 100 ... 12 800 with the possibility of expanding to 25,600, a 19-point cross-type AF system (the same characteristics are in the Canon 7D), 63-zone exposure metering (this is better than in previous models of cameras 60D, 650D and Canon EOS 700D). </p><p>  <strong>The Canon EOS 70D</strong> has the best, and also a multi-touch display.  This is one of the few cameras, along with the models 7D and D7100, with the presence of weather seals.  In continuous shooting mode, she shows the second best result with 7 kW  The same Canon EOS 7D 8 f.v.s. </p><p>  Of the important additions are the Wi-Fi module, the ability to switch from IPB compression to ALL-I, and also the increased flash sync speed of 1/250. </p><p>  It is impossible not to note the presence of an intelligent pentaprism viewfinder, fine-tuning autofocus and maximum shutter speed of 1/8000 sec., Built-in stereo microphone. </p><p>  What distinguished her predecessors? </p><p>  <strong>Canon EOS 60D</strong> , for example, a 63-zone two-layer exposure metering system, a double anti-reflective coating that protects the camera from ‚Äúhousehold‚Äù damage, spot automatic focusing, and a maximum shutter speed of 1/8000 sec. </p><p>  <strong>Canon EOS 700D and EOS 600D</strong> - high maximum ISO sensitivity, multi-touch touch screen, built-in stereo microphone (while the cameras 60D and 7D it is monaural).  In addition, in the entire series, this model is the most compact, lightest, and cheapest (if the word "cheap" is generally correctly used in relation to SLR cameras of this class). </p><p>  The list of advantages of the Canon EOS 7D camera opens with the presence of the DIGIC 4 image processing processor. This is not the newest model - after it the DIGIC 5 and DIGIC 5+ have already been released (this is the latest in the Canon EOS 70D), which should not be written down as disadvantages. </p><p>  But the pros unconditionally write down the cross type of 19-point autofocus, the presence of a weather seal, the maximum shutter speed of 1/8000 seconds (the shutter speed is better than in the EOS 700D and the 600D), high flash sync speed, in this models making 1/250 seconds. </p><p>  Note that these models have the best viewfinder in the entire group with 100 percent frame coverage and 1.0 zoom, as well as the highest shooting speed in the series and the most capacious buffer (the difference between the 700D, 600D and other models is more than noticeable).  These are not the only advantages of the models in the EOS line of cameras: one cannot fail to mention the excellent built-in stereo microphone, precise AF settings and the largest size in the group. </p></div></article>
