    <p>  At the end of the 19th century, tall giant buildings began to appear on the streets of the United States, which later became the hallmark of the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Until the end of the last century, no country could compete with the United States in the number of skyscrapers and their height, until they were tried to resist the “Asian tigers”. </p><p>  Today they occupy leading positions.  The first places in the top ten of the world were occupied by buildings in China, Malaysia and Taiwan.  Dubai's skyscrapers are also a little smaller.  Although in the latter case, it is not at all the height of the structures.  Here, experts primarily appreciate the originality of shape and size. </p><h2>  Section 2.

    <p>  <span>The most unusual building in</span> Dubai is Burj Dubai, which is also known as the “Khalifa Tower”. </p><p>  The opening of the building was solemnly held in January 2010, after which he was awarded the title of the highest structure on Earth. </p><p>  Burj Dubai harmoniously combines residential, shopping, entertainment, hotel areas, which are located among the picturesque green landscapes of the Persian Gulf and local lakes. </p><p>  The main tower is located on the banks of the largest artificial lake, along the shores of which, as if by magic, the Old Town, hotels, restaurants, residential and corporate complexes, as well as other infrastructure, are located. </p><p>  From the point of view of architects, the main concept of the building is to recreate the axis, which narrows, starting from the foundation and ending with the top.  Each floor is a kind of separate coil. </p><p>  This project is considered one of the most ambitious in the world: in accordance with the decision of the creators, the design both inside and outside is really a kind of technological miracle. </p><p>  By the way, the amount of investments in the project is astronomical: 73 billion dirhams (in translation to the American national currency, this amounts to about $ 20 billion). </p><h2>  Section 4.

    <p>  The 74-story skyscraper called the Diamond Tower is also famous for its popularity in Dubai. </p><p>  The start of construction of the building was scheduled for 2005, the opening took place in 2010.  Today, a 360-meter skyscraper rises above the city and simply fascinates with its view tourists visiting Dubai.  A photo on its background is simply impossible not to take. </p><p>  Basically, all floors are used for commercial purposes with the exception of number "4", which is considered technical. </p><p>  Currently, the building houses several well-known companies in the United Arab Emirates that cut and sell diamonds. </p><h2>  Section 5.
