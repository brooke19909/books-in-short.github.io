    <p>  Orvieto is a blessed town in the central Italian region - Umbria - literally drowning in greenery.  If the tours you bought to Italy include this city, be prepared for chic vineyards, magnificent nature, silence and harmony.  These are the first impressions that this place causes for most tourists.  Despite the fact that the town is relatively small, there are many secrets and mysteries.  It may even seem that Orvieto never left the Middle Ages. <br><br>  A bit about the history of the city <br><br>  In the period from VIII to III century BC, the Etruscan settlement was located on the site of the modern town.  In the 6th century AD, the Bishopric was transferred to Orvieto.  Until the XII century, the city was part of the Lombard Spoletal Duchy and the Papacy.  In 1290, the construction of the cathedral began.  After completion of the construction and until the XIV century, the city was the Papal residence.  In 1860, another significant event for Orvieto occurred - the city became part of the united Italian kingdom.  You can study the history of Orvieto in detail in the city itself by buying <noindex>  <span>tours to Italy</span> </noindex>  . <br><br>  sights <br><br>  There are a lot of architectural and cultural monuments that have passed through the centuries.  One of them is St. Patrick's Well.  Its construction began in 1527 and was dedicated to the settlement of Clement VII in Orvieto after the capture of Rome.  The well was needed to supply water to the fortress of Albornoz.  The well is 62 meters deep and 13 meters wide.  At the same time, different ways are used for descent and ascent.  By tradition, at the bottom of the well is a huge amount of coins. <br><br>  Another structure that was built specifically for clergymen is the Albornoz fortress.  It was built by order of the Spanish cardinal Albornoz.  But by the 19th century, the fortress was in a deplorable state, it was abandoned and it began to collapse.  To our time, only a stone wall and a round tower remained from it.  Near the fortress is a city park in which local residents relax. <br><br>  The main attraction of Orvieto is the already mentioned Cathedral.  No wonder most tourists get <noindex>  <span>flights</span> </noindex>  to Italy with the expectation of getting to this religious building.  Striking is not so much the cathedral itself as the size of the square on which it is located - it is minimal.  If you sit next to the building, it may seem that the cathedral is approaching you.  It is such absurdity that creates the unique appeal of the Cathedral.  The central facade of the building is a unique ensemble of many types of art.  The frescoes of the facade create a rich and sophisticated image, and the sides are made in black and white. <br><br>  Most European cathedrals are characterized by the close proximity of their museums, where paintings and sculptures are collected.  And the Cathedral is no exception.  In Orvieto is a museum of works of the Duomo, consisting of several departments and located on Cathedral Square.  On the ground floor of the building are the works of Italian sculpture of the last century by Emilia Greco, and on the second there is a huge collection of objects of medieval art: utensils, frescoes and the work of jewelers. <br><br>  Before heading to the cathedral, you should sign up for a tour of the underground Orvieto.  During the tour, tourists will learn about the underground city caves, hiding a lot of secrets.  Of particular interest on such an excursion is Adrian's Grotto.  It is noteworthy that most of the available caves were used to collect rainwater or produce wine. <br><br></p></div></article>
