Additional content, which is connected without the knowledge of the owners of the rooms, leads to unforeseen expenses.  What to do in such situations?  There is a solution to this problem.  It consists in disabling all paid options and connecting to MegaFon a ban on paid subscriptions. </p><h2>  Where do paid subscriptions come from? </h2><p>  Many people think that a paid operator is connecting a mobile operator.  This is actually not the case.  Subscriptions are activated by subscriber actions.  There is a high likelihood of unwanted options appearing on the number when visiting music and video sites, resources with a ‚Äústrawberry‚Äù.  A random click on an advertisement - and now the subscription is already activated.  The first 20-50 rubles disappeared from the account (and in some cases more). </p><p>  Some advertisements belong to decent companies that do not immediately connect a subscription, but offer the subscriber to make a choice - either activate or refuse.  But there are unscrupulous services.  They connect additional options unilaterally, so even advanced Internet users often encounter paid subscriptions.  Mobile applications are sometimes to blame for connecting additional options.  Developers embed a virus in them that sends commands to pay for some content.  An effective way to protect your balance is to activate the ban on paid subscriptions on the MegaFon number. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="kadincanameler.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inappropriate content" class="if uuid-3208917" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3208917.jpg"></div><h2>  Disabling Subscriptions </h2><p>  If money in an incomprehensible direction leaves the account, then first of all you need to check whether there are paid subscriptions on the phone number.  You can find out this information in several ways: </p><ol><li>  Visit the nearby MegaFon Communications Salon.  Specialists will do the detailing, explain what the money is spent on, and, if necessary, turn off unwanted options. </li><li>  Go to your personal account.  It is located on the official online resource of the mobile operator.  You can also use the mobile application "My MegaFon".  The Services section contains information about paid subscriptions and you can turn them off in it. </li><li>  On the phone, dial a short command * 105 # and press the call key.  A menu for managing accounts and services will appear.  Next you need to follow the commands on the screen. </li></ol><p>  The next step after deactivating additional options is to activate the ban on paid subscriptions on the MegaFon number.  The specific name of the service is ‚ÄúProhibition of paid content short codes.‚Äù  It is desirable to activate it even if no subscriptions were found.  The service will protect against a one-time charge.  There are such services that do not connect a subscription, but withdraw funds from the account for the purchase of allegedly some content. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.mindaclient.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Personal account of MegaFon" class="if uuid-3208919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3208919.jpg"></div><h2>  Service "Prohibition of paid content short codes" </h2><p>  How to make a ban on paid subscriptions to MegaFon?  Before giving an answer to this question, we note that the essence of the service "Prohibition of paid content short codes" is to block access to paid subscriptions, inappropriate content.  After activating this useful option, you will no longer be able to use paid entertaining SMS messages, commands, voice services created by content providers.  Also, access to numbers of the Mood service is blocked. </p><p>  This option, which prohibits MegaFon from paid subscriptions, has several features.  Firstly, this service does not disable the subscriptions available on the number.  For this reason, before activating it, you must first check for the presence of unnecessary options and disable when it is detected.  Secondly, the service does not apply: </p><ul><li>  to service teams, voice numbers and SMS messages of the MegaFon mobile operator (the exception is the Mood service, which was already mentioned above); </li><li>  calls to numbers of such a format as 8-800- ...; </li><li>  to pay for parking lots via SMS 7757, 7377, by a short command * 377 #. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="mobile-on.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ways to turn off subscriptions" class="if uuid-3208921" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3208921.jpg"></div><h2>  Service activation and deactivation </h2><p>  The service "Prohibition of paid content short codes" is activated absolutely free of charge.  There is no subscription fee.  To activate the service provides a single command.  The ban on paid subscriptions to MegaFon is included in such a combination as * 526 #.  The service may not connect immediately.  Sometimes this process drags on for 10-15 minutes. </p><p>  If desired, the service can be turned off.  The command to disconnect is the same as to connect. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smallbizclub.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The team to set a ban on subscriptions to MegaFon" class="if uuid-3208918" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3208918.jpg"></div><h2>  Create a separate account for subscriptions </h2><p>  For those who sometimes use paid services of content providers, the service of completely banning paid subscriptions at MegaFon is not very convenient.  Such subscribers are recommended to visit any communication salon.  Why go there?  In the communication salon, you can create a separate account to pay for subscriptions.  It cannot be connected on its own, because there are no methods available to the subscriber - there are no single commands, special buttons for activation in your personal account and mobile application. </p><p>  When you connect an additional account, 2 balances appear on the phone number - one standard and the second additional.  The standard balance is a balance familiar to everyone from which money is charged for communication services.  The second balance is only for paid services.  Before connecting an additional account, content providers charged money from the main balance, and after connecting they can no longer do this, because requests from short numbers to write off money the mobile operator redirects to the additional balance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="megafon24.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Content account processing" class="if uuid-3208920" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3208920.jpg"></div><h2>  Can an operator refuse to open an additional account? </h2><p>  MegaFon mobile operator cannot refuse to create a special content account for its subscribers.  The fact is that there is a Federal Law (Federal Law) of July 23, 2013.  Its name is ‚ÄúOn Amendments to the Federal Law‚Äú On Communication ‚Äù.‚Äù  This document obliges absolutely all operators to create content accounts at the request of subscribers. </p><p>  Based on the foregoing, we can conclude: the ban on paid subscriptions to MegaFon is connected in 2 ways.  The first method is self-activation, in which the ability to use paid services is completely blocked.  The second way is to draw up an additional account in the communication salon.  Content balance allows you to use the services of content providers, but only if you have money on it. </p>
