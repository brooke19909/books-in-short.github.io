    <h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Hotel Serenity <span>Fun City Makadi Bay</span> 5 * is located thirty-six kilometers from Hurghada Airport.  A taxi and a car will take about forty-five minutes.  Transfer by bus, which takes tourists to other hotels, of course, takes much longer.  Around the hotel there is a desert, but along the shore you can walk to the territory of another hotel, Harmony, and even swim on their beach.  You can go to Hurghada by hotel bus or go in the evening with animators.  They will take it quickly - the Egyptians love speed.  But it is quite safe, because on the freeways <span>one-way traffic.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hurghada, Makadi </h2><p>  This bay is built up exclusively by hotels.  The resort belongs to Hurghada, but it is about forty kilometers away.  The beaches here are sandy, but the coast is coral, with reefs breaking off in depth.  Therefore, special shoes will be required.  Hotels in the bay are mainly fives.  These include Serenity Fun City Makadi Bay 5 *.  Makadi Bay is a rather windy place, so almost all hotels have special windshields.  The area is deserted, all the bars, restaurants and shops can be found only on the territory of the hotel, or you need to go to Hurghada by bus.  Some hotels also allow strangers to their nightclubs and bars;  Especially popular are institutions such as El Khan or Docker.  Locals do not live here - the resort is populated exclusively by vacationers.  But he is quite promising.  Rumor has it that soon Makadi will separate from Hurghada.  Together with the neighboring resort of Soma Bay, he will represent another administrative unit.  They plan to call her Abu Makadi.  The rest here is very decent, the hotels are stylish, new, the parks are planted with lush greenery and very beautiful.  Each hotel has its own beach, but they are located so that it seems as if the coast goes to infinity.  Aesthetes love to meet the dawn here.  On the beaches of various hotels you can walk almost unhindered, which you are unlikely to meet at other <span>resorts in Egypt.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Serenity Fun city makadi bay 5 makadi bay" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/773181.jpg" width="600"></div>

It takes thirty-three square kilometers.  And if we take into account the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe sister hotel, we get even more.  In general, the complex spreads over a territory of one hundred and fifty kilometers.  Near the beach is the Serenity Makadi Heights.  But this is the official name.  Tourists simply call it Serenity Beach.  Therefore, to get to the sea, you need to go through its territory or go by minibus.  On foot you need to get about seven to ten minutes.  The hotel bus runs on schedule.  But guests write that the territory is very green, well-groomed and clean.  Walking along it is a pleasure, so not everyone is waiting for the bus.  Moreover, if there is an all inclusive system, moving around is even more beneficial.  The hotel has its own lunapark and a water entertainment center.  In addition, there are many shops here - with souvenirs, and with products, and with beach accessories. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Serenity fun city 5 egypt makadi bay" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/773435.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea and water vacations </h2><p>  How good is it to swim and dive on the beach of the Serenity Fun City 5 * hotel?  Reviews claim that this is a typical coral-bottom coast for Makadi.  Such beaches are designed for divers and good swimmers.  You wander for a while in shallow water (in order not to hurt your legs, be sure to bring or get ‚Äúcoral‚Äù slippers), which then breaks off to a depth, and the reef abruptly goes down.  It is there that you can snorkel and watch the underwater life.  For the convenience of vacationers, a pier was built for safe entry into the water.  There are four stairs to go down to the sea.  Vacationers who are keen on watching fish and marine animals like the beach at Serenity Fun City Makadi Bay 5 *.  Makadi Bay is a paradise for divers.  But what if you don‚Äôt know how to swim?  On the shore there is a small lagoon cleared of corals, where it is very convenient for children.  In addition, the hotel has many pools.  They are big, clean and deep.  Among them there is a children's pond, a pool with an artificial wave and an attraction "crazy river" that simulates an alloy.  In addition, the hotel has its own water park with twenty-six slides (of which eight are for children).  Serenity Beach has seawater pools. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Serenity Fun city makadi bay 5 rooms" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/773275.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions and trips </h2><p>  As in any Egyptian hotel, excursions are practiced here.  Where can I go to guests of Serenity Fun City Makadi Bay 5 *?  Reviews say that they offer the same trips as in Hurghada.  And, of course, they are cheaper for beach guides than for hotel tour operators.  Excursions in jeeps or ATVs in the desert, to <span>Paradise Island,</span> to Luxor and Cairo are popular.  In addition, from here you can go to the south of the country, to more unusual places - Aswan, Abu Simbel, and Lake Nasser. </p><h2>  Serenity Fun City 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Hurghada is famous for this type of hotel, as the "budget five".
