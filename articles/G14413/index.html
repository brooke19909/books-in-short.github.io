But for the use of awnings and sunbeds have to pay. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Ayia Napa is considered one of the most popular and lively resorts of the island of Cyprus.  Translated, the name of the city means "Sacred Forests".  This is due to the fact that once shrines were found here.  Historians suggest that in the 7th or 8th century AD, in one of the caves, the Byzantines hid the face of the Holy Virgin.  And only after a hundred years the icon was found by a random traveler.  This message spread throughout the land, and believers began to come to the cave. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="panas holiday village 4 cyprus" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1963280.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The icon was called Panagia Napa, which means the Blessed Virgin Mary from the forest.  After a lot of time, a chapel was built over the cave, and then a temple.  Currently, this monastery has been preserved almost in its original form. </p><p>  The city became a tourist resort only in the eighties.  During this period, the city began to actively develop in terms of tourism.  The resort is known for beaches, vibrant nightlife.  He is even called the second Ibiza. </p><p>  Ayia Napa can be reached from <span>Larnaca Airport,</span> which is just 35 kilometers away.  Many airlines fly from Russia to Larnaca.  The cost of a ticket from Moscow will cost about two hundred euros on both sides.  The flight takes about four hours.  From the airport to Ayia Napa, buses and minibuses run. </p><h2>  Nissi Beach </h2><p>  The beaches of the resort are awarded the Blue Flag.  The coast of the resort is not only very beautiful, but also attracts tourists with numerous entertainments: catamarans, fishing, diving, surfing, yachts, jet skis and more. </p><p>  The most famous beach is Nissi Beach.  During the high season, it is literally crowded with people.  Numerous bars and restaurants are located along the coast. </p><h2>  Reviews for Panas Holiday Village 4 * (Ayia Napa) </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, we turn to the reviews of tourists who recently rested in it.  I want to immediately emphasize that the reviews about Panas Holiday Village 4 * are quite contradictory.  The hotel has its pros and cons, but let's talk about everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="panas holiday village 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1963281.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to tourists, the location of the hotel is quite good.  On the one hand, it is located on a quiet street, and on the other, there is a promenade next to it with all the infrastructure and entertainment.  Near the hotel there is a large store where you can buy food and fruits.  The prices for them in the city are on average the same, so it makes no sense to look for something. </p><p>  Hotel Panas Holiday Village 4 * (Cyprus) is far from new.  Therefore, do not expect something supernatural.  The room fund is distinguished by its spacious size and the presence in each room of a kitchenette equipped with appliances and utensils.  It is very comfortable.  In principle, you can buy products and cook yourself if this does not bother you.  Well, or, for example, cook porridge for a capricious kid.  The rooms themselves, of course, have long been in need of repair, since furniture and interiors require updating, and plumbing does not always cope with the work.  All apartments have terraces (on the ground floor) or balconies with furniture and clothes dryers.  It is very convenient, you can not only sit in the evening and enjoy the view, but also dry beach items. </p><p>  Linen and towels are changed according to the schedule, and cleaned every day.  Not all vacationers are satisfied with the quality of cleaning.  In principle, the rooms are quite normal, and most importantly - very spacious.  And the presence of such a full-fledged kitchen in all apartments in general is an undeniable advantage of the establishment. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Nutrition is one of the most important moments on vacation.  High-quality and tasty food is the key to a good rest.  Modern tourists, burdened with domestic problems and everyday life, prefer to choose hotels with good food in order to fully immerse themselves in the atmosphere of rest and relaxation.  Hotel Panas Holiday Village 4 * offers guests an all-inclusive concept.  Of course, this option is far from Turkish and Egyptian counterparts, but still not bad.  The food is buffet style.  For breakfast, visitors are offered omelettes, cheeses, sausages, vegetables, salads, fruits.  For dinner, several varieties of meat and fish are suppressed to the usual dishes, there is always a dessert.  In general, the food, according to guests, is good, but of course it does not differ in variety.  During the holidays, a monotonous set of dishes bothers, but no one leaves the restaurant even hungry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="panas holiday village 4 cyprus reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1963282.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Some vacationers prefer to take half board (dinner and breakfast), and dine in one of the nearest establishments or cook in the room.  The presence of a well-equipped kitchen allows you to cook yourself. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel area is quite spacious, but very built up.  The villas are close to each other, so there is simply nowhere to go for a walk.  Tourists prefer to walk along the promenade.  Nevertheless, the hotel territory makes a very good impression, as it is surrounded by greenery, decorated with flower arches and flower beds.  The hotel has a tennis court and sports fields, as well as a playground for younger guests. </p><p>  On the territory there are children's and adult pools, but vacationers tend to the beach.  Indeed, it‚Äôs foolish to sit at an artificial reservoir with chlorinated water when there is such a wonderful sea nearby.  Although the pools are very beautiful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="panas holiday village 4 cyprus ayia" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1963301.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The hotel has very few Russian-speaking staff.  But if you know a little English, you can always explain.  There are no problems with the language barrier. </p><p>  The two-story villas of the hotel are very comfortable for living.  On which floor to choose accommodation is a matter of taste.  Some people like to live on the ground floor and have separate access to the terrace and pool, while others prefer apartments on the second floor, because, firstly, they have less dampness, and secondly, much quieter. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  The beach closest to the hotel is very rocky, and its surface is not small pebbles, but sharp stones of volcanic rocks.  Swimming here is not very convenient.  For this reason, all vacationers along the promenade rush to the sandy Nissi Beach.  It is worth noting that Cyprus can not boast of sandy beaches of natural origin, all good beaches were strewn with human hands.  On Nissi Beach, stones are found only in certain places.  In general, entering the sea is gentle and comfortable.  It‚Äôs not bad to relax with children.  Although this part of the coast is considered a place of hangouts of youth, which is always a lot here.  On the beach you can rent an umbrella and sunbed, the cost is about the same everywhere, but you can bargain, sometimes employees make concessions.  But on average, a sunbed will have to pay 2.5 euros per day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel panas holiday village 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1963302.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  There are a lot of various entertainments on the coast.  And along the beach there are a considerable number of cafes in which you can always eat. </p><h2>  Attractions and entertainment </h2><p>  Resting in Cyprus, of course, it is worth breaking away from the beach and paying attention to local attractions, which in Cyprus are very numerous.  And Ayia Napa has many interesting places to visit.  If you come to relax with your children, then you should definitely go with your whole family to the city‚Äôs amusement park and water park, which are located within walking distance from the hotel.  The sculpture park is no less interesting.  But the main place to see is Cape Greco, located next to the resort.  It is incredibly beautiful at any time of the day. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Reviews about Panas Holiday Village 4 * (Cyprus) give reason to recommend it as a good place to stay in Cyprus.  The hotel is popular because of its close proximity to the famous Nissi Beach, which every holidaymaker dreams of visiting. </p>
