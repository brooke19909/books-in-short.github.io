It is located outside the tourist area, so that tourists can fully experience the eastern flavor of the country.  There are mosques, markets and even a historical museum. </p><p>  Midoun has a rich history.  In the old days, the city had a large slave market.  Some of them after the liberation remained to live on the island.  Therefore, there are a lot of black Africans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="seabel rym beach reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1526749.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Midoun was once a small fishing village, and over the past two decades has become a tourist center.  The city is especially interesting in market days, as if it comes to life at such a time.  Tourists are very fond of wandering around the retail space in search of unusual goods.  The market is surrounded by cafes and restaurants where you can relax after a walk.  Tourists, as a rule, are more interesting outlets with souvenirs.  Walking around the market, it should be remembered that you can only buy a good bargain on it.  All prices here are initially overpriced, so you always need to bargain. </p><h2>  Interesting places in the city </h2><p>  Midoun is poor in terms of attractions, but there are also some places that may be interesting for tourists.  Once a week on Tuesdays in the main square you can watch a Barbary wedding; this rite clearly demonstrates local customs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia seabel rym beach" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1526750.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The main attraction of the city is the Fadhlum Mosque, located on the road to the capital of Houmt Souk.  It is interesting in that it can be visited by representatives of any religion. </p><h2>  Seabel Rym Beach Reviews </h2><p>  Concluding the conversation about the hotel, I want to discuss reviews about it.  Can it be recommended as a vacation spot for those tourists who plan to visit Tunisia?  Seabel Rym Beach, according to tourists, is an excellent four-star hotel designed for families.  It is comfortable to stay away from the bustle of the city, being on the coast itself.  The hotel is located far from the city center, so it is not suitable for lovers of night parties.  Near the complex there is no entertainment.  But you can walk along the coast.  Some privacy of the hotel is fully compensated by the beautiful and warm sea, wonderful nature and fine sand.  The hotel has its own beach, located right next to the building.  The coastal area is fenced and is under constant guard.  But traders still walk on it, too annoying guards drive away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jerba seabel rym beach" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1526751.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The beach of the hotel is quite clean and well maintained, it is cleaned daily.  The entry into the water is shallow and long, to get to the depth, you need to walk well.  Perhaps not all adults like it, but for children this beach is very good.  Sometimes algae appear on the shore, but they are quickly cleaned by hotel workers. </p><p>  The complex offers standard rooms with panoramic views of the coast or the pool.  The apartment has double beds and plastic furniture on the terraces.  In general, the rooms have standard equipment for a four-star complex. </p><p>  The maids clean the apartments every day, and even make swans out of towels, and sprinkle the beds with rose petals.  Towels in the rooms are changed every day, and beach towels are issued only with a deposit, and their replacement costs money.  Therefore, it makes sense to go on vacation with their accessories for the beach. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  I want to say a few words about nutrition, which is worthy of all praise.  The guests remain incredibly satisfied, noting the variety and excellent taste of the dishes.  A local chef organizes theme nights a couple of times a week.  Every day for dinner, seafood appears on the tables (crabs, snails, mussels, shrimps).  Twice a day, guests can enjoy ice cream in unlimited quantities.  Enough on the tables and fruits.  Every day at the buffet there is a bird, fish, meat.  Food is served in sufficient quantities.  The cost of drinks is included in All Inclusive, so they can be taken in any quantity.  The waiters in the restaurant do not always cope with the work, but they try very hard and at the same time they are always glad to visitors. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel offers its guests a large clean pool for adults, as well as a children's pool.  In the mornings, the hotel staff clean the ponds, however, there are not so many vacationers around them, since there is such a beautiful sea nearby.  The hotel has its own spa complex, but its services must be paid separately, they are not included in the price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel seabel rym beach" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1526752.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The complex always has a local guide offering numerous trips around the island.  The same sightseeing tours are offered by representatives of travel agencies on the beach.  You can use their services, however, it is easier to travel independently to Midoun or Houmt Souk by public transport.  Such a trip will be much cheaper.  For example, visiting a crocodile farm on your own is two times cheaper than with an excursion group. </p><p>  Knowledgeable tourists are advised to go to Houmt Souk, Midoun, to a crocodile farm, to arrange a ride on a pirate ship for children.  The hotel has animators throughout the day organizing sporting events and theme nights.  The team works fine, but all the programs are created only by the efforts of the guys.  The hotel does not practice performances by visiting artists and dancers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="seabel rym beach 4 djerba" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1526754.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The complex has a very green and beautiful area with different colors and palm trees.  In the evenings, it is pleasant to walk along it, enjoying the beauty of the alleys. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up, we can safely recommend the hotel as a place of excellent budget vacation for those guests who want to relax on the beach and are not looking for active parties and nightly entertainment. </p>
