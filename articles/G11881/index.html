Review of budget smartphones, prices</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Ten years ago, a mobile phone with a 1.3 megapixel camera was considered highly advanced.  Although the photos were fuzzy and grainy.  But there was nothing to compare.  Current smartphones have cameras with solid resolution, which can even compete with conventional digital ‚Äúsoap dishes‚Äù.  The whole difference is that the former do not have optical zoom.  According to other indicators, they are worthy rivals.  Let's try to choose a budget smartphone with a good camera. </p><h2>  Haier W852 smartphone - the first, not bad option </h2><p>  In fact, inexpensive devices rarely provide a decent camera, so before you pick up something worthwhile, you have to look good.  Or buy a camera phone of a famous brand.  We offer you a budget smartphone with a good camera, <span>Haier W852,</span> available for sale in Russia at an affordable price - 5500 rubles.  The device supports full-fledged work with two SIM cards, has a decent design, it has a camera with a resolution of eight megapixels.  There is also a frontal - VGA.  The screen of the device has a standard diagonal of 4.5 inches, built on an IPS-matrix. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="budget smartphone with a good camera" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/598333.jpg" width="600"></div>  Its resolution is 960x540.  The processor with a frequency of 1.3 GHz has four cores.  Its internal memory is not enough - only 4 GB, but it helps that the device supports microSD cards up to 32 GB.  1 GB is its RAM.  Haier W852 is powered by a battery with a capacity of 1700 mAh, works in networks of two generations - the second and third.  The talk time is approximately 6 hours.  The main camera can shoot in HDR mode.  Case dimensions - 132x68x10 mm, weight - 156 grams, it comes with a black and white case and an operating system called Android 4.2 Jelly Bean.  This, of course, is not the best budget smartphone, but you should pay attention to it.

Nevertheless, it is not necessary to immediately discard it.  Of course, if we consider the rating of budget smartphones, the K800i will occupy one of the last places in it.  But in vain, because, thanks to the installed Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãShot optics, our device will give odds to many, more recent phones.  The quality of the pictures is very high, sometimes you can‚Äôt say that the camera on it has a matrix with a relatively small resolution of 3.2 megapixels.  An optical lens has the following characteristics: focal length - 5.2 mm, brightness - f2.8, viewing angle - 50 degrees, xenon illumination and autofocus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best budget smartphone" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/598334.jpg" width="600"></div>  The camera provides features such as scene selection, flash modes, including reducing the so-called ‚Äúred eye‚Äù effect, image stabilization, timer, zoom, several effects, such as sepia, and other properties.  With all this, Sony Ericsson K800i costs only in the region of three thousand rubles.

    <h2>  Chinese smartphone Beidu Little Pepper 6 with a powerful camera </h2><p>  Budget Chinese smartphones confidently continue to discourage buyers from manufacturers of well-known companies and brands.  And what's the reason?  At a time when, for example, Samsung makes the announcement of a budget phone for 12-16 thousand rubles, the Chinese Xiaomi launches devices with decent filling, but much cheaper.  The same applies to the Beidu company, which produced the Beidu Little Pepper 6 with a 20 MP camera and a cost of 8,000 rubles or more.  The brand, of course, is not particularly well-known, but the products are in more and more demand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="budget chinese smartphones" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/598340.jpg" width="495"></div>  This model is equipped with a five-inch display, RAM - 1 GB, 16 GB - flash drive, MediaTek processor, 4-core, 64-bit, with a frequency of one and a half GHz.

OS - Android 4.4, called KitKat, a metal frame, both panels are glass, the thickness is 7.1 mm.

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Most of us want a mobile phone in one person to replace several, including the usual large ‚Äúsoap box‚Äù.  But at the same time, so that the pictures were no worse, and the price is small.  For this reason, we are starting to look for the best budget smartphone that would have at least a 5-megapixel camera.  We have already done a short review, we want to add another device - Fly Luminor FHD.  Its cost is only 12,000 rubles.  And competitors with more well-known names and similar characteristics are at least twice as expensive.  Why is some people afraid to buy low-end phones? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="budget smartphones" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/598337.jpg" width="600"></div>  The main reason is that there is a biased opinion - good and quality must be expensive.  This is partly true: the products of well-known brands, most often, are such.  But this does not deny the fact that smartphones from little-known companies can be no worse.  Indeed, otherwise, they will cease to be acquired.  It is possible that after the promotion of their name, they will also raise the value of their products.  So the choice is yours!
