  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Strengthening the muscles of the chest</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, many bodybuilders as a result of the <span>bench press</span> have luxurious chests - pumped pectoral muscles.  However, not only the bench press is able to provide a load on the frontal deltoid.  There are other exercises to strengthen chest muscles.  Nevertheless, the use of the correct technique for performing the bench press forms the muscles of the chest. </p><p>  If a person has a flat <span>chest shape,</span> then the effect of the bench press will be much greater, since the amplitude of the neck movement increases, and the main load goes to the pectoral muscles.  If a <span>person has a chest</span> in the form of a ‚Äúwheel‚Äù, the future bodybuilder will not receive such an effective pumping of the sternum muscle.  To get out of this situation, experts recommend moving the bar closer to the cervical region of the body. </p><p>  <strong>How to build chest muscles</strong> </p><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that this exercise should not be abused.  If you <span>swing your chest muscles</span> every day, there is a risk of becoming disproportionate.  Also, excessive performance of the bench press will lead to insufficiently pumped deltoids, narrow shoulders.  In this form, you will not look like a mythological titan, so do not forget about the fact that shoulders also require training. </p><p>  The main advantage of the bench press is that it is performed from a stable lying position.  Regular (but not excessive) performance of this exercise will significantly increase strength and give a good load on the upper muscles of the chest. </p><p>  The bench press does not allow jerky movements.  If you tear off the pelvis from the bench, the risk of injury is increased.  It is imperative to know your working weight.  Isolated muscle strength should help you squeeze heavy barbell weight. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To influence the spectrum of action of this exercise, it is recommended to change the grip distance (the distance between the hands).  The grip width is responsible for the part of the chest that will undergo stress during the exercise.  A wide grip pumps the outside of the chest.  Medium grip provides the main load on the middle muscles of the chest.  Internal shares are worked out by a narrow grip.  It is worth noting that during the bench press triceps heads are pumped. </p><p>  Inclined bench presses with a bar are performed in case of pumping the upper chest.  The exercise is performed with a bar or dumbbells on an inclined board.  The external zone of the pectoral muscles is worked out by breeding hands with dumbbells. </p><p>  <strong>Dips</strong> </p><p>  When performing this exercise, the main load goes to the lower zone of the pectoral muscles.  If the bars are 70‚Äì85 cm wide, the upper and lower chest muscles are pumped.  If the athlete is taller, then the bars should have a greater width. </p><p>  The muscles of the chest expand when the <span>pullover exercise is</span> performed <span>.</span>  It is worth noting that this exercise does not give much effect to increase the volume.  The most common mistake in breast training is that the athlete does not concentrate the chest muscles enough.  Muscles must be in tension throughout the entire approach during exercise.  It is worth taking into account the fact that each organism requires an individual program for training chest muscles, so you do not need to blindly follow other people's programs without studying the specifics of your body.  Pectoral muscles should stretch from time to time.  During training between sets, you need to spread your arms in different directions, thereby stretching the pectoral muscles.  To achieve a full tensile effect, dumbbells are the most promising here. </p><p>  It is imperative to maintain proper nutrition between workouts.  If the body takes junk food, then it is very difficult to achieve a great effect from training. </p>
