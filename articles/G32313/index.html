Phenological observations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Regular observations of seasonal changes are carried out on the basis of significant phenomena in nature.  All received data is structured into a single system.  It is called general phenology.  Next, we will become more familiar with this discipline.  Let's find out what science is studying phenology. </p><h2>  Terminology </h2><p>  The official history of phenology began in the mid-19th century.  The term was first proposed by Charles Morran (a botanist from Belgium).  Phenology as a science is a system of knowledge and a body of information about seasonal phenomena in nature, their causes and timing of occurrence.  Observations are made on the basis of the so-called fenoindicators (what it is - we will discuss a little later).  Speaking about what phenology is studying, it should be mentioned that the spatial and temporal patterns of cyclic changes in natural objects and their groups associated with the movement of the Earth around the Sun during the year are determined during the research. </p>

    <h2>  Indicators </h2><p>  As mentioned above, phenological observations are made on the basis of notable natural phenomena.  These, for example, include <span>cherry blossoms, the</span> appearance of "earrings" on a birch or yellowing of leaves.  All these signs are called "phenoindicators".  They characterize the transition of wildlife from one seasonal phase to another. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Average temperatures </h2><p>  Based on these parameters, a more specific definition of natural phenomena is carried out.  So, for example, a steady transition to an average temperature per day above 0 degrees is considered the climatic arrival of spring, and over 15 - summer.  Speaking of what phenology is, it is impossible not to say that the entire research system is based on the analysis of periods of different durations.  So, for example, more narrow changes in temperature indicators are considered - after five degrees.  As a result, each season is divided into short periods - phenological phases.  Each period has its own complex of <span>natural phenomena</span> (phenomena).  Thanks to them, researchers distinguish one phase from another.  Periods according to the most characteristic phenomena have their own names, which are fixed in folk calendars. </p>

    <h2>  Research Method </h2><p>  Seasons and seasons correspond to each other.  Visual phenological observations, which are a traditional method or method of research, allow you to record the timing of the onset of certain phenomena.  To achieve comparability of information obtained by different researchers, special programs, atlases and explanations are compiled.  Such methodological publications describe the phenophases of plants and seasonal phenomena of the animal world.  For scientific purposes, phenological observations are a way to study geographical and biological objects and establish patterns. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Spring: general information </h2><p>  Above, when considering the question of what phenology is, we mentioned that this system has a special structure.  Besides the fact that seasons are distinguished in the discipline (relatively long periods corresponding to the seasons), there are also shorter periods of time - phases.  So, spring includes 4 sub-seasons.  Each of them has its own indicators. </p><h2>  Snow melting </h2><p>  This is the first spring season.  It begins with the formation of the first thawed patches in the field.  The end of the period is determined by the first flowering of hazel-hazel and <span>gray alder.</span>  During this stage, larks, starlings, gulls and rooks fly.  In birches and maples, swelling of the kidneys and the movement of juice are noted.  In the fields, snow begins to descend and snow gradually disappears, water bodies are freed from ice.  In this season, ice fishing ends and fishing in open water begins.  Some inhabitants of reservoirs (ruff, asp, podust, dace, ide, pike) begin to prepare, and in some places begin to spawn.  In some territories, bream and roach are well caught during this period. </p><h2>  Spring revitalization </h2><p>  The beginning of the second subseason coincides with the flowering of gray alder.  The most accurate indicator of this period for urban residents is considered to be coltsfoot, yellowing in wastelands.  The onset of the phenomena characteristic of this period in the Central zone is usually observed on April 15-20.  At this time, the final disappearance of ice in the water bodies is observed.  The soil begins to dry out from above.  At the same time, country roads become passable for people and accessible for transport.  This, in turn, opens the way for anglers to remote places.  In the second season, woodcocks and cranes arrive, bumblebees appear, and frogs begin to ‚Äúvote‚Äù.  Then there is a revival of earthworms.  As for the river inhabitants, the spawning of ide and pike is completed, it continues at the asp and ruff, but at the perch and bream it is just beginning.  In this season, buds have already blossomed on birch trees, and the elm is "dusting". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  High spring </h2><p>  At the beginning of the third subseason, birch trees have already dressed in green foliage.  For approximately two decades, warming has been observed at this time.  The air temperature rises not only during the day, but also at night.  The greenery of shrubs and trees becomes denser, the flowering of orchards begins.  There are more insects, as well as songbirds eating them.  In fields, in meadows and in forests, rapid greening and flowering are noted.  In the coastal thickets, nightingale trills are heard, and in the meadows and fields - quail.  The corgostelle dergach begins to sing.  Other signs include the completion of spawning in ide and the continuation of podust and roach.  The pike zhor begins, fishing for the bream, which has managed to partially spawn, chub and crucian, begins.  The end of the subseason is evidenced by the flowering of lilac lilac and mountain ash. </p><h2>  Prelude </h2><p>  The fourth season is characterized by the completion of flowering <span>orchards,</span> mowing meadow cereals and winter rye.  The phenomena occurring during this period coincide with the flight of dragonflies.  On dry lands bloom of a popovnik, and on damp areas - forget-me-nots. </p><h2>  Summer: 1 season </h2><p>  First of all, it must be said <span>that this period</span> is divided into three phases.  The first is the beginning of summer.  This stage is indicated by the blooming of rose hips.  It, in turn, is accompanied by other phenomena.  So, for example, in the gardens moss and viburnum are blooming, in the field are rye, flax and cornflower, and on the water is a white water lily.  The temperature rises, the air warms more and more.  At this time, the longest days of the year.  An increase in temperature in water bodies is noted. </p>

    <h2>  "Full" summer </h2><p>  The beginning of the second, main, subseason coincides with the <span>flowering of</span> small-leaved <span>linden</span> .  This phenomenon in the Central zone is usually observed between July 5 and 15.  In large cities, however, this happens a little earlier.  Ripening of black and red currants, garden strawberries, and blueberries in the forest should be used as an accompanying indicator of the onset of full summer.  Nightingales begin to subside and cuckoos fall silent.  Yellow tansy and blue chicory bloom on city lawns.  Grasshoppers appear in large numbers. </p><h2>  Summer decline </h2><p>  This is the last, third season.  The period is characterized by the onset of lingonberry ripening.  The nights get noticeably longer.  At dawn, cold dew begins to fall.  Water temperature in rivers and ponds is gradually decreasing.  Grass that was cut during haymaking has time to grow by this time. </p><h2>  Autumn: the beginning </h2><p>  This season, like the summer, includes three phases.  In the European part of the Russian Federation, the entire period lasts a little over 3 months.  The beginning of autumn is characterized by the appearance of yellow strands in the crown of elm, linden and birch.  The end of the subseason is observed when the number of green and flowered leaves becomes approximately the same.  This is most often observed in the last decade of September, and in the wet and warm autumn - in early October.  Honey agarics begin to appear in the forest.  In the air there is a tenet, a flying web.  The water continues to cool, but in large bodies of water the temperature decreases unevenly, starting from the upper layer. </p>

    <h2>  "Golden autumn" </h2><p>  The second season is characterized by widespread yellowing and falling of leaves.  Forests gradually begin to become bare, birds gather in flocks and fly away to warmer climes.  Starlings and rooks are also preparing for migration, wandering along the roadsides and outskirts of the fields.  The end of the fall of the elm, aspen and birch indicates the beginning of late autumn.  This period lasts until the very first snow.  The temperature is getting lower, the last flocks of ducks, swans and geese are flying south.  Water and surface air are cooling faster. </p><h2>  Pre-winter </h2><p>  The autumn ends with the transition to winter.  Actually, for this given season and got its name.  At the beginning of this period, the first snow falls.  The phase ends with ice formation and the formation of a toboggan run. </p>

    <h2>  Winter </h2><p>  This season, researchers are also divided into three phases.  During the entire period, the plants are in deep rest, and only those that are well adapted to winter cold remain from the whole variety of birds.  It becomes almost empty in the forest - almost all animals hibernate, and who does not sleep hides in holes.  As a rule, winter begins from the end of November and lasts until about the second half of March. </p><p>  <em>Primordial</em> </p><p>  At the beginning of this first season, ponds are covered with strong ice.  From this moment, ice fishing opens.  The phase ends on the 20th of December, during the winter solstice.  At first, intense biting becomes somewhat ‚Äúcapricious‚Äù, as the ice cover becomes thicker, the days are shorter, and the volume of dissolved oxygen decreases in water. </p><p>  <em>Root winter</em> </p><p>  This is the second season.  It usually begins in February.  At this time, a great tit begins to ‚Äúsing‚Äù. </p><p>  <em>Winter break</em> </p><p>  The final phase begins with the addition of daylight.  From this moment comes the "spring of light."  Icicles begin to grow, droplets ring.  During the day, the sun warms noticeably. </p><h2>  The relationship of phenomena </h2><p>  Returning to the question of what phenology is, we note that not only natural phenomena are studied within the discipline.  It should be noted here that the duration of the seasons and phases depends on the landscape and the geographical position of the territory.  All periods are interconnected.  Each phase occurs in a certain period of time.  For example, the spring movement of the juice comes first at the holly maple.  2 weeks after its start, swelling of the buds near the birch will be noted, which, in turn, is a signal for anglers: it means that the ide becomes active.  As already mentioned, the <span>average temperature</span> during the day is of great importance.  Until it rises above 5 degrees (with a plus sign), the plants remain in forced rest. </p>

    <h2>  Why do we need research? </h2><p>  The methods and tasks of phenology are of practical importance, and primarily for the national economy.  Patterns are at the heart of calendars for seasonal events.  They, in turn, are used in the organization of work to protect nature, fight against diseases of useful plants, and timely eliminate pests.  Information about the periods of mass flight of birds is important for aviation.  Remote investigation of the earth's surface needs data on the optimal time for carrying out studies of the timing of bird migration.  The results of visual phenological observations are used in the design of sanatoriums, the planning of tourist routes.  Research allows you to identify local natural indicators, which, in turn, make it possible to determine the seasonal state of nature and predict the nature of the growing season. </p>

    <p>  Phenological maps, especially large-scale ones, are needed for planning various seasonal productions.  Natural signals are important when developing territories and developing new species of animals and plants.  Thus, speaking about what phenology is, we can make an obvious conclusion: this discipline is complex.  It includes various techniques and research methods.  Everything that phenology studies allows the most rational use of the natural environment. </p>
