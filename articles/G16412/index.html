Reviews about this place contain the following negative comments: </p><ul><li>  the rooms have very poor sound insulation, and therefore you will hear everything that happens in the corridors and neighboring rooms; </li><li>  the cleaning of the room is very mediocre (sometimes you have to additionally ask the maids to clean the floors and take out the trash); </li><li>  the food is quite monotonous (but tasty); </li><li>  the buffet menu is very rarely fruit; </li><li>  music plays late by the pool, and therefore, if your windows open onto this part of the territory, you will not be able to sleep peacefully; </li><li>  for standard rooms a hairdryer is available only at the reception; </li><li>  due to the poor functioning of the sewage system in rooms that are located on the first floor, there is a very unpleasant smell; </li><li>  very old and creaky furniture in the rooms; </li><li>  the TV screen is small; </li><li>  the real state of the number of rooms does not match the photos on the official website and other resources; </li><li>  in addition to a small playground, for the children in the hotel there is practically nothing; </li><li>  the salads in the restaurant are just disgusting, with a huge amount of mayonnaise (the only tasty one is "Greek"); </li><li>  when lamb is served at the buffet, in fact, it‚Äôs just bones with a small amount of meat (the only thing that more or less meets the standards is chicken); </li><li>  the refrigerator heats up during operation, creating additional heat, and it‚Äôs better not to turn it on at all, otherwise it will break, and you will be forced to pay; </li><li>  the hotel is very noisy due to the huge amount of drinking youth; </li><li>  the beach is strewn with sharp stones; </li><li>  excursions on the hotel territory are very expensive (it is better to take from local guides); </li><li>  even if you reserve a room in advance, a situation may arise that there are no free rooms and you will be relocated to another hotel (but you will have to eat in Dimitrion); </li><li>  linen and towels are changed very rarely, and then after a personal request; </li><li>  almost the entire territory of the beach is crammed with paid sunbeds, and therefore there is no option to even lie on the towel in the sand; </li><li>  if the windows of your room overlook the courtyard, they will be directly opposite the other room, and therefore there is always a feeling that someone is spying on you (it is more comfortable with a curtain drawn up); </li><li>  Wireless Internet is very slow and more or less catches only at the reception; </li><li>  it‚Äôs very inconvenient that the gym and sauna only work until two in the afternoon; </li><li>  very low-quality local alcohol in the restaurant and bar; </li><li>  a very small pool, which tall people will be, as they say, knee-deep; </li><li>  animation is practically absent, and therefore you have to look for entertainment outside the hotel or to invent them yourself; </li><li>  very poor-quality pillows, after sleep on which the neck hurts; </li><li>  very poor-quality cosmetics in the bathroom, it is better to bring everything with you or buy in a supermarket; </li><li>  very poor layout of the building, because of which your windows will either go out on a noisy street, or be located right next to the windows of another room. </li></ul>

    <h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Many guests visit the Central Dimitrion Hotel 3 * <span>(Crete)</span> annually <span>.</span>  <span>Guest reviews</span> suggest that this institution is fully consistent with its three stars.  This applies to both prices and accommodation, food, service and other aspects.  Counting on a budget holiday, you should not expect a stunning interior, luxurious food and high-quality service.  Of course, you may be outraged by poor-quality cleaning (or rather, its almost complete absence), but you will certainly receive the necessary amount of attention and care from the employees. </p><p> Particular attention should be paid to nutrition.  If you are counting on a five-star menu, then you are unlikely to get it.  Get ready for the fact that you will be fed the same dishes every day.  Nevertheless, you will not stay hungry.  You will always find a delicious meat or fish dish, as well as a vegetable salad.  In addition, the ice cream served at the hotel is one of the best at the resort.  Tourists who have already been to this hotel do not recommend full board.  It is better to order breakfast only, and the necessary variety of dishes can be found in neighboring cafes and restaurants. </p><p>  It is worth noting that this hotel is absolutely not suitable for families.  Arriving with children, you will be surprised to find that in addition to the slide and sandbox for the little ones, practically nothing is provided for here.  Another disappointment for you may be that loungers on the beach are provided only at an additional cost.  If you decide to take a seat on the sand, the guards will hint to you that you are interfering with the rest of the guests.  But there is a way out of the situation.  Having walked for about 20 minutes, you will find yourself on a beautiful wild beach where you can enjoy the clear sea and relax under the shadow of picturesque cliffs.  Thus, the hotel fully justifies belonging to the budget category. </p>
