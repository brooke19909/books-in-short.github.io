They believe that it was "stagnation" - a period characterized by the conservation of the old communist regime.  However, some historians disagree with this term. </p><p>  Consider the polar points of view on this issue in more detail. </p><h2>  Period time frame </h2><p>  It is believed that this stage in the <span>development of the Soviet state</span> began with the advent of the new Secretary General.  His name was Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev.  He appeared in this position unexpectedly, due to the voluntary-compulsory retirement of the "reformer" N.S.  Khrushchev in the early 60s.  last century. </p><p>  <span>The board of Brezhnev</span> lasted 18 years.  In general, it was an attempt to preserve the achievements of the USSR, which the country achieved under Stalin. </p>

    <h2>  Characteristic of the era </h2><p>  Unlike the formidable Stalin, Leonid Ilyich was distinguished by his soft nature and lack of desire for unusual social transformations.  During his reign, the purges of the party apparatus stopped, which allowed officials to work in their posts without fear of being fired.  Ordinary <span>Soviet citizens were</span> much less afraid of the authorities, often discussed the problems of <span>socialist society</span> in family conversations in their kitchens, and waited for changes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Underground market trade began to develop due to a shortage of food and <span>consumer goods,</span> which contributed to the emergence of black schemes for the resale of goods. </p><p>  In general, stagnation is a special period in the history of the USSR.  On the one hand, <span>this era</span> was characterized by stability and calm in social terms.  On the other hand, Soviet people, covered by an iron curtain, increasingly thought that the capitalist world also had its advantages, and dreamed of going abroad.  A special myth was created that the Western man as a whole lives much better and more comfortable than a citizen of the USSR. </p>

    <h2>  Positive features of this period </h2><p>  The period of stagnation in the USSR was characterized by many features that were inherent exclusively to this time: </p><p>  1. Stable development of the spheres of culture, art, education, science, mass construction. </p><p>  It was in the Brezhnev era that many people were able to get the long-awaited separate apartments.  Active construction of new microdistricts was carried out, at the same time kindergartens, clinics, schools, palaces of children's creativity were commissioned. </p><p>  The education system was developing, universities were opening.  Every young man who came from the hinterland and had the minimum amount of money could go to a prestigious university, if he had the ability and knowledge.  Also, medical care was available to the general public. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Both education and medicine were truly free. </p><p>  2. Social guarantees </p><p>  The state provided social guarantees to its citizens.  So, everyone could get a job to provide for themselves and their family.  Strict media censorship made it possible to control the flow of information, so it was generally positive.  The military power of the USSR made it possible to keep the opponents of our state in check and not wait for an attack from outside. </p><p>  By and large, the Brezhnev stagnation became the calmest period in the history of the USSR. </p>

    <h2>  Negative features of this period </h2><p>  Among the negative features are the following: </p><ol><li>  Life during the period of stagnation was complicated by the fact that ordinary citizens lacked consumer goods - clothing and household items, as well as some foods were in short supply.  This happened in the field of food due to the fact that many rural residents left for cities, not wanting to work on collective farms.  Since the repressive system of the USSR significantly reduced its pressure, the authorities could not prevent such a relocation. </li><li>  The military industry and military technologies were actively developing, but the areas that led to the appearance of technical innovations in the west: video recorders, players, and other goods did not progress.  This circumstance aroused increased interest in the products of the capitalist world on the part of the Soviet people. </li><li>  The party elite, not updated by new people, has grown old.  In fact, it began to represent a closed clan, which ordinary capable managers could not get into, everything was decided by communications: they gave both high social status and the receipt of special benefits and rights in Soviet society. </li><li>  The ideas of socialism and communism gradually fell into decay, most citizens lost faith in these ideals and waited for the renewal of the ideological component of life. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Who first called this period "stagnant"? </h2><p>  For the first time, the Brezhnev period called stagnation a young and promising general secretary, M. Gorbachev, speaking to listeners in 1986.  Many then were in agreement with the opinion of the Secretary General.  The country was waiting for changes, people hoped that after the era of the "dying elders" (Brezhnev, Andropov and Chernenko) a new life would come. </p><p>  Unfortunately, these hopes did not materialize: the country was awaited by the period of perestroika (which the insightful philosopher Zinoviev called ‚Äúcatastrophe‚Äù), the collapse of the USSR, social upheavals and the difficult era of general collapse in the 90s. </p>

    <h2>  Brezhnev stagnation - the period of the beginning of the destruction of the USSR? </h2><p>  Today, historians very differently assess this stage of development of our country.  Scientists of the liberal camp say that the USSR began to collapse precisely at this time, and Gorbachev only completed the process of the country's irreversible collapse. </p><p>  On the whole, these historians themselves do not particularly favor the former Soviet Union, believing that its destruction only benefited all of humanity. </p><p>  Other scientists hold the opposite position.  In particular, they believe that stagnation is a difficult period in the country's development, but still positive.  In fact, it was a failed attempt to create "socialism with a human face," without the repressive system of Stalin. </p><p>  Therefore, today some of our fellow citizens of the older generation evaluate the period of stagnation in the USSR positively.  They say that at that time they felt support from the state, they knew that they couldn‚Äôt just be fired from work, they could count on receiving high-quality and free medical care and good and also free education. </p>
