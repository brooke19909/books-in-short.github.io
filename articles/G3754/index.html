    <p>  To date, the most popular are deposits in national currency.  There are a huge number of banks that offer customers similar services.  Therefore, it is easy to get confused in such a variety.  To understand this issue, it is worth comparing interest on deposits in St. Petersburg banks. </p><h2>  What to look for when <span>opening a deposit</span> in rubles? </h2><p>  The largest <span>banks in St. Petersburg</span> offer a variety of options for deposit lines that can be opened in Russian rubles, US dollars and euros.  Many believe that the higher the interest rate, the greater the contribution will be made.  However, this factor, although true, is still far from the only one worth paying attention to. </p><p>  When choosing profitable deposits with St. Petersburg banks, it is recommended to pay attention to the conditions that the bank offers on paying interest rates.  Accordingly, it is necessary to clarify the frequency, as well as the place where payments will be deducted.  The fact is that in some banks, income is transferred to the client‚Äôs current account, and in others they are added to the main deposit amount.  It is also worth considering the most interesting offers from financial organizations of the cultural capital of Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Russian Capital </h2><p>  This bank recently opened a new deposit called ‚ÄúStrategic‚Äù.  To open it, it is necessary to conclude an <span>investment life insurance contract, the</span> term of which can be 3, 5 or 7 years.  In this case, the bank's client must cooperate with the insurance company ‚ÄúRGS Life‚Äù.  In this case, the minimum deposit amount is 500 thousand rubles.  This is a fairly large amount, if we talk about other deposits with banks in St. Petersburg. </p>

    <p>  The term of placement of this deposit may vary from 181 to 367 days.  The client receives income in the amount of 7.8% to 8.5% per annum.  In this case, the interest received will be paid to the depositor at the end of the contract.  For this <span>type of deposits,</span> there is no provision for replenishment of the deposit, as well as any type of expenditure transaction.  The same goes for prolongation.  If the client terminates the contract, then in this case all interest charges will be transferred on demand. </p><h2>  Bank "ActiveCapital" </h2><p>  If we compare the deposit rates in banks of St. Petersburg, it‚Äôs worth saying a few words about this institution, which offers its customers the package ‚ÄúSnowy‚Äù.  According to the terms of a financial institution, the minimum deposit amount should be 10 thousand rubles.  Also allowed to use currencies in US dollars or euros.  The term of the deposit is 91, 181 or 370 days. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When opening a ruble deposit, the benefit will be from 6.75% to 7%.  If the account is opened in dollars, then in this case the interest rate can reach the maximum possible 1.6%.  As in the previous case, all received income is transferred to the client at the end of the contract.  However, he cannot make additional contributions or withdraw funds from his contribution.  If an early termination of the contract has been completed, then in this case the interest rate is significantly reduced. </p>

    <p>  To compare deposits in St. Petersburg banks, it is worth considering programs from other financial organizations. </p><h2>  Sauber </h2><p>  This bank has long opened a seasonal deposit called ‚ÄúWinter‚Äù.  If we talk about the minimum amount of investment, then in this case it is only 1 thousand rubles.  The shortest period for which a deposit is allowed is 1 year.  This bank offers customers quite favorable conditions.  When using such a <span>deposit, the</span> income <span>rate</span> will be from 8% to 8.5%.  Moreover, cash payments are made monthly. </p><p>  As with the opening of other deposits in banks of St. Petersburg, the program "Winter" withdrawal of funds or replenishment of the balance is not provided. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  MTS Bank </h2><p>  This financial institution has expanded its offer line with a new deposit called ‚ÄúMTS # Contribution 2018‚Äù.  This deposit involves a minimum amount of 50 thousand rubles.  The term of the deposit is 91, 181 or 367 days. </p>

    <p>  Depending on the length of time the money is stored in the bank, the interest rate may be 7.5% or 8.15%.  It is not allowed to <span>replenish the deposit</span> or withdraw funds from it.  If the client wishes to terminate the contract with the bank, then in this case interest on income will be paid at the current demand rate.  However, in this case it is worth hurrying, since this offer is valid only until February 28 of next year. </p><p>  After the end of this deposit, it can be prolonged.  To do this, you can visit the branch of a financial institution or use the mobile application. </p><p>  Favorable interest on deposits in St. Petersburg banks can be found in larger organizations. </p><h2>  Bank "Russia" </h2><p>  This financial institution currently has a deposit program called ‚ÄúUniversal‚Äù.  According to this proposal, the minimum deposit amount may be 3 thousand rubles.  The term of the deposit is 181 or 367 days.  Provided that interest is paid monthly, the rate will be a maximum of 6.4%.  If the client orders payments at the end of the contract, then in this case the profit may increase to 6.8%. </p><p>  It is worth noting that each new investor receives a MIR bank card as a gift.  At the same time, its face value can range from 3 thousand rubles to 1.5 million, depending on the conditions of the deposit.  <span>Interest rates on deposits</span> are transferred monthly to this card or to another demand account. </p>

    <p>  Speaking of deposits in banks of St. Petersburg, it is worth noting another advantage of this proposal.  It lies in the fact that in this case, the client can partially withdraw funds or replenish his deposit. </p><h2>  Agrosoyuz </h2><p>  In this financial institution, you can issue a seasonal deposit called "Harvest Year".  The minimum contribution amount in this case is 10 thousand rubles.  The term of the deposit is 1 year.  At the same time, customers can expect a profit of 8% per annum.  Money is transferred monthly to a current bank account or to an existing bank card.  The deposit holder does not have the right to make any expenditure transactions on this deposit.  If necessary, you can issue an automatic extension of the contract. </p><h2>  Gazprombank </h2><p>  Speaking of deposits in St. Petersburg banks, it is difficult not to mention this financial institution, which has a special product called ‚ÄúRetirement Income‚Äù.  According to this proposal, people who have gone on legal holidays are invited to deposit at least 500 rubles for a period of 1 year.  The interest rate will be 6.3%. </p>

    <p>  Making additional contributions is allowed, however, in this case, the operation can only be made by wire transfer from the account of the organization that provides pension benefits.  If a pensioner wants to make a cash replenishment, then this is impossible. </p><p>  Interest is capitalized and paid at the end of the contract.  At the same time, investors can make certain expenditure transactions within the amount that is considered an irreducible balance. </p><h2>  Sovcombank </h2><p>  In this financial institution, the minimum contribution is 30 thousand rubles.  The term of the deposit can vary from 1 month to a year.  Moreover, the interest rate is up to 6.9%.  Income is paid to customers monthly.  Money can be transferred both to a valid account, and to an existing card.  If necessary, the client can classify the received money to the amount of the deposit. </p><p>  If we are talking about profitable deposits in St. Petersburg banks, Sberbank in this rating is far from the first place.  This is explained by relatively low rates, which make up a maximum of 5%, provided that the client has contributed at least 700 thousand rubles for 1 year.  If you use the minimum limit of 1 thousand rubles, then the benefit will be no more than 4.5%.  On the other hand, this financial institution is very popular and has the highest level of stability.  When deciding where to invest, it is worth paying attention to these indicators as well. </p>

    <p>  In some situations, it is more profitable to get a lower percentage, but to be sure that the financial institution will not lose the license in the near future.  Moreover, it is necessary to take into account the fact that the longer the deposit is held by the bank, the greater the income will be received by its owner.  Therefore, once again it is worth weighing all the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal.  In addition, you need to determine the type of deposit.  In some situations, replenished deposits will be much more profitable. </p>
