    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  There are a number of shortcomings in the operation of the resort Green Harbor Service Apartment 3 *.  Reviews of tourists contain the following negative comments: </p><ul><li>  there are a lot of ants throughout the hotel (it‚Äôs good that at the reception you can take a special remedy for them for free); </li><li>  the cleanliness of the rooms leaves much to be desired - everywhere there are thick layers of dust and dirt (the staff does not react to comments in any way, and therefore, as far as possible, you have to put the room in order yourself) </li><li>  Green Harbor Hotel &amp; Service Apartment Patong 3 * is located much further from the beach than indicated in the brochures; </li><li>  the balcony is very small and almost without a canopy, and therefore during the rain a lot of water is collected on the floor, which gradually flows into the room; </li><li>  for all time of stay, bed linen is changed no more than once; </li><li>  the bathroom is completely lacking ventilation, and therefore it is very stuffy, constant dampness and just the disgusting smell of sewage; </li><li>  it is very inconvenient that the shower is simply a pipe sticking out of the wall and not separated from the rest of the bathroom (as a result, a flood forms when bathing); </li><li>  the laundry very poorly does its job - there are stains on things, and ironing is disgusting at all (there were even cases when workers spoiled the clothes that were cleaned); </li><li>  all furniture is very old and shabby, requires a complete replacement (repair or restoration will not help here); </li><li>  from the city side a narrow lane leads to the hotel, which is completely littered with garbage (the staff does not care for this territory at all); </li><li>  booking a room in advance, you cannot be absolutely sure that you will be settled in it (quite often, motivating by the lack of available rooms, guests are placed in much worse rooms than planned before); </li><li>  the presence of an elevator is, of course, a plus, but it always has a disgusting smell (something musty, then bleach or other detergent); </li><li>  in a restaurant, food prices are too high - it‚Äôs much cheaper and tastier to eat in neighboring establishments; </li><li>  the pool is practically not warmed up by the sun, as it is in the shade (because of this, the water in it is constantly cold). </li></ul><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  We can say that the Green Harbor Hotel &amp; Service Apartment 3 * (Phuket) makes a rather mixed impression.  The neatness that catches your eye when you first meet it immediately disappears as soon as you begin to look at the situation in more detail.  This is mainly due to the fact that the hotel is quite old, all its funds decently worn out.  In addition, there is some disregard for their work on the part of staff.  Nevertheless, all these shortcomings can be eliminated due to the low cost of living, as well as the courteous attitude of workers who work at the reception. </p><p>  It is also important that the resort Green Harbor Hotel &amp; Service Apartment 3 * (Phuket, Patong) is quite conveniently located.  This, on the one hand, is the very center of the city, and on the other, a quiet and secluded place.  Although, of course, one can not help but pay attention to the mountains of garbage that are piled in the alley that leads to the hotel.  Nevertheless, this hotel has its loyal fans and regular guests, because for the minimum cost you can get everything you need for a lowly tourist.  This is a convenient location, and a polite attitude, as well as a complete set of all necessary amenities that will give a feeling of home comfort. </p>
