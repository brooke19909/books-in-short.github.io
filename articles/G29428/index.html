    <h2>  Terminology </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worthwhile to define the phrase ‚Äúhuman digestive system‚Äù.  The structure and functions will be considered after.  This is a collection of digestive organs.  All of them provide the body with various vitamins, substances (in other words, ‚Äúbuilding material‚Äù) and energy.  All this is vital for the full existence of man.  Due to this, tissues and cells are restored and updated.  This process is ongoing, since all of the above in the process of life is destroyed. </p><p>  Digestion itself is a process during which chemical and mechanical processing of food occurs.  All substances entering the body are split into their components, some of which pass through the walls of the digestive canal, and everything else is processed into waste. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Alimentary canal </h2><p>  This is a very special part of the organs.  The total length of this channel is approximately 8-10 meters!  This part of the organs includes the human digestive system.  The structure and function of the channel also has special features. </p><p>  Its first component is the oral cavity.  Everyone knows what it is.  The cavity consists of <span>salivary glands,</span> tongue and teeth.  This is where the food is ground.  Also, thanks to language receptors, a person feels the taste and temperature of the food or drink consumed.  Thanks to the tongue and saliva, so-called food lumps are formed, which are then sent to the throat.  This, in turn, is a funnel-shaped organ, which is a connecting element between the esophagus and the oral cavity.  The pharynx promotes the pushing of food, but this occurs at a reflex level. </p><p>  The esophagus also includes the digestive system.  Its structure and functions are very specific.  The esophagus is a long 25-cm tube, the upper part of which consists of striated muscle tissue.  The bottom is smooth.  And most importantly, the esophagus is the place through which processed food enters the stomach. </p>

    <h2>  Food splitting </h2><p>  These are the most important components that the human digestive system has.  Their functions are appropriate.  The stomach is an expanded part of the canal.  It contains glands that produce <span>gastric juice.</span>  It contributes to the rapid breakdown of food.  This is the main function of the stomach - to digest food.  But this is not all the organs that the human digestive system includes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The liver also helps to break down food.  And also the pancreas.  It is the liver that produces bile, which helps digest food.  And the pancreas secretes special enzymes that also ‚Äúhelp‚Äù bile.  They contribute to the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. </p><h2>  The last stage of the digestion process </h2><p>  And finally, the intestines.  Without it, the human digestive system cannot exist.  The structure and functions (photos are presented in the article) of the intestine are also special.  Firstly, its length is about 4 meters.  Secondly, it is in the intestine (more precisely, in the duodenum 12) that the ducts of the gallbladder open.  It should be remembered that there is a <span>small and large intestine.</span>  The first of these is the longest component of the digestive system.  The small intestine has villi, and it is through them that nutrients are absorbed.  Fat produces a special mucus.  Thanks to it, fiber is split. </p><p>  The large intestine ends in the rectum.  It ends with an anus.  It is through him that the undigested food remains are removed from the body. </p>

    <h2>  About features </h2><p>  A lot of important processes are performed by the human digestive system.  Over the entire period of its existence, splanchnology has already managed to study the structure and functions in quite some detail.  This science, more precisely, scientists specialized in this field, have already managed not only to give a detailed definition of this system, but also to formulate special terms.  Separately, it is worth noting how it was decided to name the functions of the digestive system. </p><p>  So, there are three of them.  The first is motor-mechanical.  As you might guess, it means chopping, as well as the subsequent movement of food.  The second function is secretory.  All the organs that make up the system produce enzymes, juices and bile - all this improves and speeds up the process of food processing.  And finally, the third is suction.  Food, passing through the digestive system, is broken down, and the beneficial elements present in it <span>(minerals,</span> vitamins, proteins, etc.) penetrate the blood. </p><h2>  Enzymes </h2><p>  Attention should be paid to this topic.  The human digestive system (functions, structure were discussed above) is a very complex and multifaceted part of our body.  Earlier it was casually mentioned that it contains enzymes that affect the breakdown of food.  Now let's talk about these substances in more detail and list them all. </p><p>  Amylase breaks down glycogen and starch, from which maltose is formed.  It, in turn, is processed by maltase.  And in the end, two glucose molecules are obtained.  The listed enzymes are salivary. </p>

    <h2>  The formation of vital substances by enzymes </h2><p>  Pepsin and chymosin are found in the stomach.  Proteins are cleaved, after which peptides are formed.  The pancreas contains trypsin, which processes these same peptides.  As a result, amino acids are obtained.  Amylase and lipase break down fats and starch. </p><p>  Gall bladder and liver contain salts, due to which digestive enzymes are activated, and fats are emulsified.  And finally, a few words should be said about the enzymes of the small intestine.  There are many of them: maltase, lactase, phosphatase, sucrose ... They break down a lot of different substances, as a result of which vital elements for the body are formed.  These are glucose, fructose and free phosphate. </p>

    <h2>  Health issue </h2><p>  This is the last topic that needs to be addressed, talking about what is the human digestive system.  Anatomy is a science that has studied in detail the human body and its specifics.  And scientists who are professionals in this field advise all people to monitor their health.  The digestive system also needs care, as it works constantly. </p><p>  It is advisable to quit smoking.  Thousands of chemical toxins enter the body and cause stomach irritation.  In this regard, gastritis, heartburn and an ulcer can develop. </p><p>  It is also very important not to be nervous.  When a person is stressed, the gastrointestinal tract begins to work more slowly.  As a result, appetite disappears, and vital substances and vitamins cease to get into the body. </p><p>  Alcohol - even comments are not needed here.  The liver, pancreas, kidneys - all this is destroyed.  And the metabolism slows down.  The same thing arises from fast food.  This is a very junk food that inexorably destroys our gastrointestinal tract. </p><p>  A sedentary lifestyle, eating food too quickly, swallowing whole pieces, harmful foods that do not contain vitamins and fiber, too fatty, salty, spicy, hot or too cold food - all this also negatively affects the digestive system.  And if it‚Äôs not possible to follow it as it should, then it‚Äôs worth at least adding healthy products to your diet.  Fruits, dairy products, mineral water, vegetables - all this will help improve the intestinal microflora and the metabolic process.  And of course, it is important that all products and utensils are clean.  Hygiene is above all. </p>
