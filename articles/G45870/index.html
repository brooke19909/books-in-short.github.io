But for the most successful holiday you need to thoroughly plan it.  And the first question before a trip to this wonderful Turkish city is the choice of a suitable hotel.  If your plans do not include big expenses for a hotel room, then you can choose from three-star options.  A good example of such a hotel is My Diva Hotel 3 *, located just 500 meters from the stunning <span>Cleopatra beach,</span> which was specially strewn with white sand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="my diva hotel 3" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/620878.jpg" width="416"></div>

    <h2>  The exterior of the building </h2><p>  The facade of the building looks very interesting.  The hotel itself is a six-story building, which is surrounded on all sides by lights in blue, red and orange.  This idea allows you to see your hotel even a few kilometers from it.  My Diva Hotel 3 * was built at the very beginning of the twenty-first century and has since been practically not restored.  The last redecoration was carried out by the managers and owners of the hotel in 2012.  White was chosen as the main color.  This allows you to reflect the scorching rays of the sun during the day of sultry Alanya and makes it possible to see the stunning color illumination in the evening. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the hotel </h2><p>  Although Alanya is a very attractive resort for many tourists, the distance from the town to the nearest airport is quite large, and is 125 km.  This is the way to go from Antalya to Alanya in order to settle in the hotel My Diva Hotel 3 *.  As for the ticket to Antalya, flights to this Turkish city depart from many Russian cities.  Both permanent and charter planes fly from Moscow.  Upon arrival in Antalya, you can choose one of three possible options to get to Alanya.  The cheapest option is to go to the bus station and catch a bus to the city you need.  At the same time, be prepared to spend from one and a half to two hours on the road.  The second option is to use the services of taxi drivers who are located near the airport.  And the third way is a transfer from the airport to the hotel, which is provided by My Diva Hotel 3 *. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="my diva hotel 3 turkey" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/620890.jpg" width="416"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Facilities </h2><p>  My Diva Hotel 3 * (Turkey) provides a range of services similar to other three-star hotels.  One of the most convenient hotel services can be called the possibility of a transfer from the airport to the hotel, because the distance of 125 km is very large, especially when you consider that it is not very pleasant to travel by bus for an hour and a half or two.  The service is paid, and in order to avoid incidents in Antalya, it is better to find out the possibility of providing this service when booking a room. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The next service that deserves attention is the currency exchange, without leaving the walls of My Diva Hotel 3 * (Alanya).  The rate is not too different from that set by the central bank of the country, so do not be afraid that you will lose a large amount from the exchange in the hotel.  Wi-Fi is free throughout the hotel.  This is not something special, but not every hotel in Turkey can offer a combination of good quality within its walls.  If you do not want to keep your luggage in your room, then you can always put it in the storage room for a fee.  You can also take the opportunity to use the safe to store important documents and precious things. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="my diva hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/620886.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  My Diva Hotel 3 * hotel has very interesting rooms, the cost of which can hardly be called high.  In total, you can choose from three accommodation options.  The cheapest is a standard room with two twin beds for two people worth $ 32.  At the same time, the price of one night also includes a free breakfast.  The second option is a studio number, which will cost a moving pair of 34 dollars.  There is also the opportunity to call in apartments with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã55 square meters.  At the same time, the price of one night is $ 56, but four people can go here at once.  Each room has a balcony with a beautiful view of the sea or the city, depending on which side of the hotel your room is located.  The room also has a large flat-screen TV with cable and satellite channels.  High-speed wireless internet is available in every room for free.  For those people who do not want to go to the city or the sea during the day, but prefer to stay in the room, it will be useful to have an air conditioner that can cool the room to an acceptable temperature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel my diva hotel 3" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/620885.jpg" width="416"></div>

    <h2>  Sports and recreation </h2><p>  The hotel is three-star, so you should not expect from it a variety of sports facilities.  Usually people come here who do not plan to spend all the time in the walls of the hotel, but prefer to go for a walk around the city or along the seashore.  For entertainment, there is only table tennis.  If you do not want to go to the sea, you can go down and relax by the pool, which is located near the hotel.  For those guests who want a good Mediterranean tan, there are special places around it. </p><h2>  Food </h2><p>  Each hotel has its own restaurant, and Alanya My Diva Hotel 3 * is no exception in this regard.  Here you can enjoy breakfast for free, but you will have to pay for lunch and dinner, as these services are no longer included in the room rate.  The food in the restaurant is quite decent, but, based on the opinions of some visitors, it is still inferior to the one that could be bought for the same money in cafes and restaurants near the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="my diva hotel 3 alanya" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/620893.jpg" width="416"></div>  Among the dishes that you should definitely try in Alanya, many tourists call fish dishes.  Moreover, no one says a specific name, claiming that each of them is unique and delicious.  If during the day you decide to run out to dine at a cafe in Alanya, then you should try a local fast food called durum.  It is a pita bread in which finely chopped meat from a skewer is placed together with vegetables.  Very tasty and fairly cheap dish.

    <h2>  Beverages </h2><p>  Drinks at the hotel are different.  There are also soft drinks such as juices, tea, coffee and various carbonated drinks.  Alcohol can be taken at the snack bar, which is located on site.  Here are presented such types of alcohol as vodka, cognac, wine, beer and many others.  If there is no desire to go down to the snack bar, you can always stay in the room and use the minibar located opposite the bed. </p><h2>  My Diva Hotel 3 *: visitor reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who had a chance to relax in Alanya, having previously settled in this hotel, were divided into two categories: those who were happy with everything, and those who were not happy with anything.  The first category of people notes nice and clean rooms, fresh breakfast, as well as relatively inexpensive accommodation.  The second ones claim that the breakfasts were monotonous, and the cleaning of the rooms was of poor quality, although it was carried out every day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alanya my diva hotel 3" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/620894.jpg" width="416"></div>

    <p>  As a wish, before choosing this hotel, I would like to say that the hotel is intended for those people who want to spend almost all their time outside its walls.  If you need an option with a complete pastime on the territory, then it is better to find something else. </p>
