  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Origami envelope in different ways.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To create an origami envelope, you need thick A-4 paper.  It is advisable to choose a beautiful bright color with a printed print.  Origami folds are done with fingers, carefully leveling the lines, then the craft will look neat.  It is recommended to work on a plain white sheet or newspaper before working with quality paper. </p><p>  Schemes of origami envelopes are very different.  In the article, we will consider several interesting options that even beginners of needlework can easily make.  The photos presented show how, step by step, you need to fold a sheet of paper to get the original craft.  There are even ways to make an origami envelope with a surprise.  Opening such an envelope, the recipient will not immediately understand the presence of the second bottom, where a small gift is hidden - a ring, beads or bracelet. </p><h2>  Envelope with a clasp </h2><p>  For work, you need a square sheet of thick paper.  The printed version will look beautiful.  First, the sheet is bent diagonally, forming a triangle, which unfolds the base to the master.  One of the upper corners bends down to an even fold line.  This is necessary in order to mark the junction of the side corners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to assemble an envelope with a pocket" class="if uuid-2552704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2552704.jpg"></div><p>  Connect them in the center with a small overhang.  The left small corner is turned in the opposite direction and is well smoothed with your fingers.  It remains to expand the hole and stretch it into a square in the center of the envelope.  When bending the upper corner of the product, close it by stuffing the edge into a square pocket.  The result is an origami envelope, which is assembled without glue. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Simple heart envelope </h2><p>  An article is being assembled from a heart cut out of bright paper.  Draw it yourself, it is advisable to use a template so that the image is symmetrical.  Folding the envelope occurs on both sides by folding a small strip to the left and right. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heart envelope" class="if uuid-2552723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2552723.jpg"></div><p>  Then the workpiece rotates upward with a triangle and the lower rounded part rises to the level of the notch of the heart, forming an even line.  To prevent the envelope from opening, you can attach two pieces of double-sided tape to the base.  It remains to lower the triangular valve down - and the craft is ready.  You can use such an origami envelope for money.  How convenient for anyone. </p><h2>  Origami envelope heart </h2><p>  A master class on making such a heart is described below.  Read the explanation carefully, immediately bending, then the product will be easy to make. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="envelope origami heart" class="if uuid-2552700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2552700.jpg"></div><p>  Prepare a rectangular sheet of A-4 paper, preferably colored. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to collect envelope </h2><p>  Step-by-step instruction: </p><ul><li>  The sheet is folded in a vertical line in half and deployed back to its original position. </li><li>  The upper left corner is rolled down to the very base, forming a triangle. </li><li>  The blank is turned on the back side and the side rectangle is bent up so that its inner line is connected to the line of the triangle. </li><li>  Then we straighten the sheet completely to its original state. </li><li>  The part of the workpiece where the triangle was previously bent is wrapped inward to the fold line of the rectangle.  This divides sheet A-4 into three unequal parts. </li><li>  Again, the sheet unfolds completely to a flat surface and the strip on the left is bent in the same way, but before the first vertical bend. </li><li>  Turn the workpiece on the back side and the extreme corners of the double fold are turned inward, until it touches the center line. </li><li>  When flipping to the back, it is clear that the resulting triangle on the left has a small pocket. </li><li>  This part is bent to the next vertical bend and turned over to the other side. </li><li>  The protruding corners of a thin strip from the inside are wrapped at right angles in different directions and again open. </li><li>  The bent edge of the strips is opened with a finger, pressing inside the triangles of the corners, the protruding corners of the strip are bent inwards, the same is done with the upper corners, dropping them down by 10 mm. </li><li>  When you turn to the back, you can see the already collected heart, it remains to fold the lateral thin strips inward to the level of the heart and raise the lower half to get the desired object. </li><li>  The sides are lubricated with glue.  The origami envelope is ready! </li></ul><h2>  Original envelope </h2><p>  To work on folding paper for an envelope with beautiful stripes in the middle, you need to prepare a square sheet of double-sided colored paper.  You can put together two sheets of different colors and work with them.  Also make a small cardboard template.  Still need scissors, a ruler and a simple pencil. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami envelope folding scheme" class="if uuid-2552709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2552709.jpg"></div><p>  Actions must be performed according to the above scheme, carefully bending all the lines.  If everything is done correctly, then you should get a spectacular small envelope. </p><p>  Any hand-made crafts will bring joy not only to those who receive a handmade envelope made with a soul as a gift.  The process of creating origami is entertaining in itself, especially when doing the work for the first time.  Try new needlework techniques, get joy from work and give your loved ones beautiful crafts! </p>
