    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Despite the general mass of positive comments, there are some flaws in the hotel "Casadel Sol" (Phuket).  Reviews of tourists indicate the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  there is not enough greenery in the territory, which is very important in a hot tropical climate; </li><li>  breakfasts are rather scarce - on a plate lies a small piece of bread and a little jam.  Therefore, it is better not to overpay for meals in the hotel, but eat in neighboring establishments or purchase fresh products at the local market, since the presence of a fully equipped kitchen in the rooms allows you to cook yourself.  A great help in this matter will be a slow cooker; </li><li>  number of rooms requires a cosmetic upgrade; </li><li>  despite the fact that a large number of channels are announced, it shows only a few local channels (in addition, very poor image quality); </li><li>  there are a lot of mosquitoes on the territory because of the dampness that comes from the pools; </li><li>  the quality of cleaning also raises questions - when checking in, some tourists complain about layers of dust in the rooms, noting that no one wipes it during the stay (the only thing that maids consider it necessary to do is change towels); </li><li>  despite the promise to help bring the suitcases to the room, no one will provide you such a service for free; </li><li>  Despite the fact that the wireless Internet signal covers the entire territory of the hotel, it is almost impossible to get online because of the low speed and poor quality of the connection; </li><li>  the hotel does not have medical personnel (as is usually the case at hotels of a similar high level); </li><li>  it is not recommended to use the services of the tour desk of the hotel "Casadel Sol" (Phuket) "Pegasus", which is too high prices for services (it is much cheaper to buy tours from local guides); </li><li>  if you want to stay in a hotel longer than the period specified in the ticket, then you can be voiced just the sky-high price for accommodation, and therefore it is better to book apartments through special resources on the Internet. </li></ul><p>  Nevertheless, the listed cons are controversial.  Reviews of many tourists refute the negative opinion and testify to the high level of services provided in this hotel. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Thailand is a priority destination for those tourists who love a non-standard and exotic vacation.  Also extremely important is the comfortable accommodation that the Hotel Casadel Sol can provide.  Its main feature is that the architecture is made in the traditional Thai style, which makes it possible to get even closer to the Thai culture. </p><p>  It is worth noting that this hotel does not save on living space, and therefore all apartments can boast quite an impressive area.  In addition, all rooms have balconies, and some even have two or three with wonderful panoramic views.  Also, a rather pleasant moment can be considered the presence of several pools, so there is no feeling of crowding.  The water in the pools is clean. </p><p>  The hotel is waiting for its guests - adults and small ones, trying to make their stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. </p>
