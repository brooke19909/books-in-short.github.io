We will make a herringbone of a large apple, carrot, <span>cheese,</span> two-color <span>grapes</span> , kiwi, marmalade or gelatin figurines.  So, the first step is to prepare the ingredients: first you need to wash them, then peel them.  The apple needs to be removed the upper part, you also need to cut out all the seeds.  Remember that the more carefully you prepare the apple, the more reliable the base of your Christmas tree will be. </p><p>  At the next stage, we begin work on carrots.  It will act as the trunk of our Christmas tree, so you need to try to give it the appropriate look.  By the way, if you want your fruit tree to be tall, choose a plump and big carrot.  Using large toothpicks or wooden skewers, we fix carrots on an apple base.  For structural reliability, it is better to use several fastening elements. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Getting to the twigs </h2><p>  To create a frame for our desktop Christmas tree beauty, you need to stick the barrel well and tightly with toothpicks.  To achieve maximum similarity, you need to leave the lower branches long and the upper ones short. </p>

    <p>  To perform twigs, you need to prepare fruits, namely kiwi and grapes.  Kiwi should be cut into circles, while working with ripe fruits, you need to cut them off thicker - this will allow you to maintain their shape.  But first, grapes need to be threaded abundantly on each toothpick, and you can combine green and red berries - thanks to this, our Christmas tree will look very voluminous <strong> </strong>  of <strong> </strong>  fruit.  How to make it become voluminous?  For this, we will use kiwi circles.  Need to randomly string kiwi on toothpicks.  This is a very thorough process, as the fruit can sprawl.  Therefore, you should act extremely carefully.  What a Christmas tree <strong> </strong>  of <strong> </strong>  fruit do without a star on the top?  In our recipe, it will be edible and healthy, because we will make it from cheese.  It is best to take hard varieties, preferably without holes.  We cut a star from the top of the cheese, as well as various toys that will complement our delicious and healthy beauty.  At the last stage, you need to decorate the Christmas tree with the remaining fruits and berries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2></h2><h2>  Simpler recipes </h2><p>  Of course, not everyone wants to string fruit and spend their time on it.  There are simpler recipes that allow you to create no less beautiful edible compositions on the table.  For example, you can lay out a beautiful Christmas tree in a suitable triangular shape.  Grapes are suitable as the bottom layer, you can even red.  Twigs will imitate long apple slices, and as a garland you can put strawberries, currants or other round berries.  You can use pineapple to create a star. </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Fruits from fruits and vegetables </h2><p>  Today it is very popular to decorate a festive table with the help of carving - the art of cutting out various shapes and forms with the help of special knives.  For lovers of not only fruits, but also vegetables, you can offer to create the appropriate Christmas tree.  For this we need the following products: cauliflower and broccoli, carrots, bell peppers of different colors and grapes.  Using broccoli and cauliflower inflorescences, we will create an incredibly voluminous Christmas tree that will look very magnificent.  Again, we use carrots as a trunk, to which we attach pieces of different cabbage.  The remaining tips of skewers are decorated with grapes and berries, for example, strawberries or currants.  The crown of our Christmas tree will be a star cut from the same cheese.  By the way, it should correspond to the size of the tree: that is, not to be too small or too large, and therefore heavy. </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Symmetry and Conciseness </h2><p>  How to make a fruit tree that will look neat and harmonious?  To do this, you can simply alternate the layers of decoration in a certain order.  For example, we create a Christmas tree traditionally from apples, carrots, slices of pumpkin and zucchini, and also decorate it with berries - grapes, strawberries, currants.  We cut out the core in the apple, where we then firmly insert the peeled carrots (this will be the trunk of our design).  We symmetrically place toothpicks on it, due to which we get a neat composition.  The point is small - to decorate it.  To do this, you can alternate layers: red currant, yellow pumpkin, green grapes and so on several times.  We will get a very beautiful and harmonious Christmas tree. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Maximum fantasy </h2><p>  Not a single festive table is complete without fruit.  But it‚Äôs one thing to just put them on a plate, and another to make a beautiful composition.  An example of this is the Fir-tree pineapple fruit salad.  By the way, it looks simply amazing: it seems that the branches are decorated with peculiar candelabra made of fruits.  To prepare this fabulous dish we will need the following products: large pineapple, watermelon, kiwi, cranberries, bananas, raspberries, melon, grapes, blueberries.  As you can see, all the ingredients are not only bright, but also very exotic, especially for the winter holiday.  Such a salad will definitely not go unnoticed! </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Tasty and beautiful! </h2><p>  So, you need to peel and wash all the fruits and berries.  The basis of the Christmas tree will be peeled pineapple - wooden skewers will be attached to it.  Diced fruits begin to attach to skewers.  By the way, the banana must first be lowered into lemon so that it does not turn black.  When stringing, you should first use even cubes of bananas and apples, and decorate the edges of the skewers with berries.  To create the effect of snow, you can use an aerosol with whipped cream, which you need to decorate the base of the pineapple.  Such a salad will turn out to be very beautiful and effective, it will be an excellent decoration for your New Year's table. </p><p>  As you can see, there are many opportunities for creating a fruit tree.  Someone uses traditional fruits, which are always in the refrigerator, someone will prefer a more original and expensive solution.  But it is worth remembering that the main thing is fantasy, and therefore, if desired, any dish can be presented in a completely new light.  After all, as you know, food should be not only tasty and healthy, but also beautiful.  Create, discover your creative possibilities, and you will see how easy it is to surprise your guests. </p>
