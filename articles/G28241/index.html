    <h2>  Rostov, Assumption Cathedral.  General information </h2><p>  First, it’s worth getting to know this architectural object in more detail.  This is a wonderful cultural monument, which has a rich history.  The date of its construction is unknown, but there is evidence that in the XII century it already existed.  During this time, many changes took place in his appearance, several times he was completely destroyed and re-restored. </p><p>  The cathedral is located near the <span>Rostov Kremlin.</span>  It is interesting that these two objects make up a single architectural complex, which offers wonderful views.  It is best to look at these objects from the side where <span>Lake Nero</span> is located <span>.</span>  In general, this is the central architectural ensemble in the city, which always attracts a large number of tourists and visitors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, the Assumption Cathedral in Rostov-Veliky includes another object, which is a belfry located separately from the cathedral.  This is a very unusual building, which has a lot of features.  About it will be told a little later. </p>

    <h2>  Cathedral History </h2><p>  Now it’s worth talking about the history of this wonderful architectural monument.  He, as we have already said, is located in the very center of the city.  Unfortunately, there is no exact data on the time of its construction. </p><p>  It was originally made of wood.  In 1160, the temple was destroyed by fire.  However, a year later, its restoration began.  This decision was made by Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky.  Then began to build a temple building of stone.  Nevertheless, in this form, he did not last long.  In 1204, a fire broke out again at this place, which destroyed the building. </p><p>  But the temple began to be restored again.  This process took more than 15 years.  After that, at the beginning of the 15th century, another fire occurred.  It was so strong that the temple completely collapsed, because even the vaults of the cathedral and its head were burnt down.  Despite this, he was again restored in white stone, and he again began to adorn the city of Rostov with his appearance.  The Assumption Cathedral, in the version in which you can see it now, was built in 1512.  The construction process took 4 years. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the XVII century, there were also some changes in the appearance of the temple.  A porch was attached to it and the chapters were slightly changed.  Some <span>restoration work</span> was carried out in the XIX century. </p>

    <h2>  Cathedral in Soviet times and its restoration </h2><p>  It is worth talking about the fate of the temple.  As a result of the revolution, significant changes affected the city of Rostov itself, the Assumption Cathedral and many other objects.  First, the temple was transferred for use by the community.  After some time, it was decided to close it.  Despite this, the cathedral was preserved and was not destroyed. </p><p>  In 1953, a powerful hurricane occurred in the city, it tore off the roofs of many buildings of the city.  Then the Assumption Cathedral also suffered.  Rostov was recovering for some time after such a rampant disaster.  The reconstruction process also affected the temple.  His roof was completely replaced with a new one, and received a completely different coating.  They decided to leave the form of the heads of the church the same.  At first they wanted to make them helmet-shaped, but it was decided not to change the onion shape so that the temple looked in the same style with the Kremlin. </p><p>  In addition to repair work, excavations in these places were also carried out at that time.  As a result, the original masonry of the church was found, relating, according to scientists, to the XII century.  In the early 90s of the XX century, the temple was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Features of the architecture of the cathedral </h2><p>  Be sure to note the appearance of the temple.  As mentioned above, the buildings of the cathedral and its belfries are located on the territory adjacent to the main building of the city - the Kremlin.  The temple has 5 chapters, a brick building is built.  However, some of its parts are made of stone - this is a socle and several other elements.  The cathedral is decorated with various decorative details.  Its height is really amazing - it is 60 meters. </p><p>  The architecture of this object, for the most part, resembles the traditional Vladimir-Suzdal architecture.  The temple building has narrow window openings that look like loopholes.  The heads of the cathedral are located on light drums of great height. </p><p>  Thus, we got acquainted with the external appearance of the cathedral, and also examined in detail how it looks and what architectural style it refers to. </p>

    <h2>  What is inside the temple? </h2><p>  Of course, it is worth telling in more detail about what is located in the premises of the cathedral, as well as about its interior decoration.  It is believed that until the end of the XVI century this object was decorated with various murals.  Such data are contained in some annals.  However, already at the end of the XVII century, large-scale work began on the creation of new murals, which subsequently adorned the walls of the temple. </p><p>  This process took quite a while, it was attended by famous masters - I. Vladimirov and <span>S. Dmitriev.</span>  After some time, other specialists were invited.  Unfortunately, these works did not reach our time.  They were destroyed by a fire that occurred in 1671.  After this, the murals were periodically updated. </p><p>  However, much later, in the 50s of the 20th century, ancient frescoes dating back to the 16th – 17th centuries were discovered here.  In addition to the murals, another remarkable item has been preserved - the iconostasis.  It is made in the Baroque style and belongs to the middle of the XVIII century. </p><p>  To see these objects, you must visit Rostov Veliky, the Assumption Cathedral.  Photos of the temple can be seen in many guidebooks, as well as in other tourist materials. </p><h2>  Cathedral belfry </h2><p>  Another interesting object, which is worth talking about separately, is the belfry.  It belongs to the complex of the Kremlin and the cathedral.  This is one of the important elements of the whole ensemble.  It is in close proximity to the temple building.  These two buildings are remarkably combined in style, despite the fact that they relate to completely different times.  Their age is more than 100 years old. </p><p>  The belfry itself consists of two floors.  On the first of them are premises used for household purposes.  The second floor is a large platform with 4 flights.  Above each of them is a chapter.  To get here, you need to climb the narrow stairs passing inside the wall.  Of particular interest is the fact that there are many voids in the structure that enhance the sound. </p>

    <h2>  History of the belfry </h2><p>  Now it’s worth talking about how this wonderful object appeared.  It is an important part, which includes the Assumption Cathedral.  Rostov the Great boasts many attractions, but the belfry is a special building that deserves special attention. </p><p>  Build a belfry began in 1682.  Then it consisted of 3 spans.  After 7 years, all construction work was completed.  There were 13 different bells.  In the 19th century, it was decided to hang 2 more bells. </p><p>  In the XX century, this object was in danger of destruction.  However, in 1919, the director of the Rostov Museum defended the belfry.  People's Commissar A.V. Lunacharsky and several scientists arrived in the city.  After that, it was decided to preserve this unique cultural monument. </p>

    <h2>  Bells </h2><p>  It is also necessary to note the features of the belfry.  As already mentioned, it has many different bells.  All of them differ in both weight and sound.  Some of them have unusual names.  The heaviest of them is Sysoy, it weighs about 32 tons.  Significantly lighter bells "Polyelein" (about 16 tons) and "Swan" (8 tons).  The smallest of them weighs 24 kilograms and is called "Yasak." </p><p>  Probably, the story of how the restoration of the Assumption Cathedral in Rostov went, its description, as well as the interesting history of the belfry, will encourage you to see this unique architectural monument. </p>
