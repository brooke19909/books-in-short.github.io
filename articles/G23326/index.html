In the literal sense, there are 3 steps from the boarding house gate.  To the gate you need 3 minutes to walk through the territory by flower beds, rosary, palm trees and junipers.  The beach at the boarding house seems to be your own, but in reality everyone can relax on it.  The coating is sand.  The entrance to the water is good, the depth near the shore is small, which is invaluable for parents with small children.  The cleaning on the beach is not very high quality, but it is present.  Sun loungers and umbrellas are free for hotel guests.  Nearby there is a beach of the Crystal base.  There sun beds are paid, but the coastline is cleaner. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  <span>Rest in Anapa</span> in the boarding house "Sofia" always goes bright and fun.  A group of talented animators works here who do not let children or adults get bored.

Beyond the walls of a boarding house it is also impossible to get bored.  Literally nearby are the dolphinarium, penguinarium, water park, many cafes, bars, restaurants, discos.  There are also plenty of opportunities to go on dozens of excursions around Anapa and the Krasnodar Territory, visit the Gorgippia archaeological reserve, and visit the healing mineral springs. </p><h2>  Pension Sofia (Anapa): reviews </h2><p>  Regarding the rest in this boarding house, people's opinions differ.
