The secret of harmoniously fitting tunics into any ensemble is in its color and in individual shaped lines.  It would seem that there can be something special in the sleeve of a ‚Äúbat‚Äù and hem, which is several centimeters lower than that of a usual T-shirt?  But if you beat the thing correctly, then it will be an excellent basis for a stylish image. </p><p>  In this article, we will talk about how to build a tunic with a one-piece sleeve and which model lines will give this piece of clothing more chic and femininity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="one-piece tunic pattern" class="if" height="205" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1108468.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  Much depends on the fabric.  Therefore, it is important to choose the right material for the product.  For a tunic, you need to choose a knitted fabric that will not collect any fluff and debris, as well as wrinkle heavily.  Therefore, cotton and velor are eliminated immediately.  For the winter version, you can choose diving or jersey, but for a hotter period, micronoil and French knitwear are suitable. </p><h2>  Building a template </h2><p>  <span>The pattern of a tunic</span> with a one-piece sleeve is good in that for its creation you do not need to make complex calculations and create some kind of grandiose drawings.  Everything is built quite simply, and to develop a workpiece, measurements are needed such as the length from the wrist to the wrist over the shoulders, the circumference of the neck, the circumference of the hips and chest, and the length of the product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="simple tunic with one-piece sleeve" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/1108975.jpg" width="515"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Building can be done directly on the fabric.  The detail of the front and back are almost identical, except for the depth of the neckline. </p><p>  So, to build the fabric is folded in half so that the edges are formed on both sides.  If the web is no longer stretched across, but along or the pattern requires a direction of cut, then they fold the material according to the requirements advanced by the quality and type of web.  The pattern of the tunic with a one-piece sleeve suggests that the cut should be used in the work, which will fit the width "from wrist to wrist" in width, and in height two lengths of the finished tunic from the shoulder to the bottom.  The stages of construction are as follows: </p><ul><li>  on the bend mark the measure "from wrist to wrist" and find the middle of the segment; </li><li>  at the designated center point, draw a neck according to the ‚Äúneck circumference‚Äù measurement taking into account model lines; </li><li>  along the edge of the delayed segment they fall by 7-8 cm and the upper sections of the sleeves are laid to the extreme boundaries of the neck; </li><li>  further, focusing on the central point, indicate the line of the chest (approximately 30‚Äì35 cm down); </li><li>  on the line in accordance with the center, a half-girth of the chest + an increase of about 5 cm is noted; </li><li>  then draw a side seam of the shelf and, rounding it in the armpit, designate the lower seam of the sleeve, taking into account the circumference of the wrist; </li><li>  if the measure of the circumference of the hips is greater than the chest, then the tunic is extended to the bottom. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tunic dress pattern with one-piece sleeve" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1108464.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ul><h2>  Modeling </h2><p>  The pattern of the tunic with a one-piece sleeve can be slightly changed.  This will change her style and give the product a new look.  For example, if a sleeve is made without an upper seam three quarters long and wide enough along the edge, it can be assembled on cuffs.  This will hide the fullness of the hands of girls of magnificent forms.  The thin ones will go with the option of a cuff on the bottom of the hem, which will visually adjust the ratio of the hips and waist. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The pattern of the tunic dress with a one-piece sleeve can have a deep neckline on the back, decorated with tatting lace or guipure.  The same inserts can be made on the shoulders.  Thanks to the combination of a smooth canvas with textured lace, you will get a spectacular outfit, the simple cut of which will be filled up with the chic of the used fabrics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tunic with a short one-piece sleeve" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/1108980.jpg" width="564"></div>

    <h2>  Assembly parts </h2><p>  The best option for processing knitwear is an overlock.  However, if there is no such unit, you can limit yourself to machine lines.  Lace is best sewn with a small zigzag evenly, as well as laying the main seams.  But the processing of sections can be completely omitted, especially when it comes to delicate knitwear.  Usually such material does not crumble and it is quite possible to leave the seams without such processing. </p><p>  A simple pattern of a tunic with a one-piece sleeve requires only 4 main seams, processing the neck and bending of the sleeves and bottom.  If it is planned to make planks on the bottom, then the most difficult is the <span>processing of the neck.</span>  There are several options for its design: </p><ul><li>  make picks about 5 cm wide; </li><li>  turn inside out and scribble; </li><li>  to process with a slanting inlay from the same fabric. </li></ul><p>  Each of them is good in its own way, the easiest option is with a <span>slanting trim.</span>  This treatment is carried out with one closed upper sleeve seam, the second is closed, taking the edges of the inlay into the slice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tunic with one-piece long sleeve" class="if" height="483" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1108466.jpg" width="370"></div>

    <p>  Inside-out and stitched neck cuts are suitable for well-stretched canvases.  It is important to correctly distribute the tension so that the bend is even and does not wrinkle from the line.  It is best to shape the neck in this way when the upper sleeve seams are closed.  Previously, the bend should be ironed and swept by hand, and then stitched with a machine. </p><p>  In the case of selection, the neck is very neat.  To make such a treatment, you need to cut out a part from the main fabric that repeats the neck sections to a depth of 5-7 cm. Sew this element to the base face-to-face along the neck section, make incisions, turn them, and turn them inside out.  In this case, the upper sleeve seams should be closed. </p><p>  In the case of overlock, especially four-thread, the participation of the sewing machine may be necessary only for sewing decorative elements.  And all the main seams will be ready in one sitting. </p><h2>  The sleeve plays a decisive role </h2><p>  A tunic with a one-piece long sleeve is a winter option.  For the summer, a model with a slightly lowered shoulder seam is more suitable.  Of course, this option will require less tissue, which means that the costs will be completely minimal. </p><p>  But what if you need a tunic with a long sleeve, and the width of the canvas does not fit the measure "from wrist to wrist"?  Here you can use the tapping technique.  In order for a thing to look beautiful, the seams should be symmetrical, and the finished parts resembled narrow long cuffs. </p><p>  A simple tunic pattern with a one-piece sleeve is an excellent base for creating many outfits for any season.  The main thing is to choose the right fabric.  By the way, a combination of different paintings will also look original.  For example, a winter tunic model can be sewn from a jersey fabric.  In this case, a third of the sleeve can be made out of a knitted mesh to match the main fabric. </p><p>  The sleeve can be beaten and somewhat differently.  For example, make it flare to the bottom and then assemble it into the cuff assembly.  And to make the folds look more impressive, make a sleeve of chiffon or silk.  In this case, the pattern after building on paper will need to be cut into elements, cut out each of the corresponding material and sew together. </p><h2>  Decorative moments </h2><p>  Almost all girls love lace, ruffles, sequins, beads and other trifles that make clothes more fun.  And why not decorate the tunic?  A heart lined with stones or lace sewn into the assembly, flounces from the neck and down from the net, appliques made from beads, sequins and beads are an excellent decoration option. </p><p>  No less interesting are fabric applications or thermal transfer translations.  There are a ton of design options for a tunic, the main thing is to trust your own taste and imagination. </p><p>  A tunic pattern with a short one-piece sleeve can easily turn into a basic summer dress.  Add a belt to it, and this option is perfect for going to the beach, and with friends in a cafe, and with children in the park. </p>
