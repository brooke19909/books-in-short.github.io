The lineup of speakers is very large and includes both budget solutions and more expensive ones.  In today's article I would like to talk about several Microlab speakers that are definitely worth the money and give the user a lot of positive emotions when using. </p><h2>  Microlab Solo 7C </h2><p>  The first model to be discussed is the Microlab Solo 7C speaker system.  Speakers are the most popular in the middle price segment.  The model has good characteristics, high-quality assembly and excellent sound. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.topzone.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="speakers microlab solo 7c" class="if uuid-2357439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2357439.jpg"></div><p>  Columns are sold in a large cardboard box.  The total weight of the acoustics is 25 kg, so bringing the packaging from the store to the house will not be so simple.  Inside the box, in addition to the speakers themselves, there is a warranty card, a remote control with a battery, a cable for connecting speakers, an RCA cable with an output of 3.5 mm, an instruction manual and self-adhesive legs. </p><h2>  Detailed description </h2><p>  <span>The type of speaker system</span> Microlab is 2.0.  The frequency range is 55 Hz-20 kHz.  The total system power is 110 watts.  The number of speakers on each speaker is 3. Two have a size of 165 mm and one has 25 mm.  Of the interesting features, it is definitely worth noting the presence of high and low frequency controls. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another important plus is the presence of a remote control that duplicates the functions of manual controls.  In fact, it is very convenient, because you will not need to get up and go to the speakers every time to adjust the frequencies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.topzone.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="speaker system microlab solo 7c" class="if uuid-2357436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2357436.jpg"></div><p>  As for sound quality, the acoustics play pretty well.  Low frequencies worked out perfectly, the bass turns out juicy and rich.  In most cases, average players act out well, although when listening to rock music, the frequency and more detailed study are still not enough.  There are no special complaints about high frequencies - they sound great, do not choke and do not swim.  The volume reserve is also pleasing - it is quite enough to have a real loud party. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The reviews on the Microlab Solo 7C speaker system are mostly positive, although, as users note, there are several drawbacks.  The first is a cheap and low-quality remote control, which often fails.  In later games, this problem was eliminated by replacing it with another remote control, of better quality.  The second minus is the built-in amplifier, which does not reveal to the maximum the full potential of the system.  The third minus is that when the power is turned off, all the speaker settings that were made are reset.  Well, the last drawback is the thin audio cable that comes with the kit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Microlab M-200 </h2><p>  The second speaker on the list today is the Microlab M-200.  Despite the fact that this model is in the budget price segment, it has quite good characteristics and is able to give its owner high quality sound. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mkracunari.rs" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="speakers microlab m-200" class="if uuid-2357435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2357435.jpg"></div><p>  The <span>Microlab M-200</span> speaker system is delivered in a medium-sized cardboard box.  On the package there are photos of the acoustics themselves, as well as the main technical specifications.  Inside the box, the user can find the following kit: warranty card, instructions, subwoofer, two speakers, audio cable, wired control panel. </p><h2>  Characteristics and Sound </h2><p>  As for the technical characteristics, then everything is quite simple.  The type of the speaker system Microlab is 2.1.  The total power is 40 watts.  The frequency range here is slightly wider than the previous model - 35 Hz-20 kHz.  The speakers have 1 speaker each with a size of 63.5 mm.  The subwoofer also has one 127 mm speaker. </p><p>  The control panel is wired here.  It has a large volume control, as well as 2 connectors: one input, the other - 3.5 mm, for headphones.  Another <span>volume control</span> is on the subwoofer.  Unfortunately, there are no ‚Äútwists‚Äù for setting high and low frequencies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="masscomputers.com.bd" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="speaker system microlab m-200" class="if uuid-2357437" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2357437.jpg"></div><p>  There are no special complaints about the sound quality.  The bottom is played out very well, the sound is saturated and dense.  The middle is also heard quite well, although when listening to rock it is a little lacking.  There are no complaints about high frequencies, they sound confidently, without jumps and hesitations.  As for the volume margin, it is large, and it will be enough with his head. </p><h2>  What users say </h2><p>  User reviews about this model show that the speakers turned out to be very good, but there are still some minor minuses.  The first is glossy plastic, which is quite easily soiled and attracts dust.  The second - when you connect the headphones to the remote, they play at maximum volume, and adjustment is possible only on the subwoofer.  Well, the third drawback: when you connect the headphones to the speakers from the speakers, the sound continues to be heard anyway, only very quiet.  The rest is no complaints. </p><h2>  Microlab H-510 </h2><p>  Well, the last speaker system for today is the Microlab H-510.  This is a model from the expensive price segment, which not only has a beautiful design, but also pleasantly surprises with high sound quality, as well as its characteristics. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.nix.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="microlab h-510 speaker system" class="if uuid-2357438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2357438.jpg"></div><p>  <span>The</span> Microlab H-510 <span>speaker system is</span> sold in a large cardboard box.  If you look at the packaging, you can immediately get acquainted with the appearance of the acoustics, as well as with its technical characteristics.  The delivery package is as follows: subwoofer, 5 satellites (speakers), external control unit, remote control, 2 RCA cables with 3.5mm outputs, 1 cable with 6 RCA connectors for speakers, warranty card, instructions and a large bay copper speaker cable. </p><h2>  Technical description and sound model </h2><p>  Some technical specifications of the model.  <span>The type of speaker system</span> Microlab is 5.1.  The frequency range is 45 Hz-24 kHz.  The total power is 242 watts.  The subwoofer has 1 speaker with a size of 203 mm.  The front, center and rear speakers have 2 speakers each with a size of 25.4 mm and 88.9 mm, respectively. </p><p>  The external control unit through which various parameters are configured is interesting.  Also on it there is a display on which information is displayed.  The functions of the control unit are additionally duplicated on the remote control, which is made quite high quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="price-altai.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="speakers microlab h-510" class="if uuid-2357440" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2357440.jpg"></div><p>  Now directly about the sound.  The speakers sound very high quality.  Low frequencies, largely due to the subwoofer, still slightly prevail over the others, but this is not critical at all, especially since everything can be easily aligned through the control unit in the equalizer.  The middle is not littered, it is heard distinctly, especially when listening to classical music.  There are also no complaints about high frequencies. </p><h2>  Consumer Assessment </h2><p>  In most cases, reviews about this model are positive, but, as in previous times, it cannot do without minor flaws.  The first minus is the lack of an optical input.  Its presence would be a plus, but overall not critical.  The second minus is defective lots of speakers that have a chip defect.  The third minus - over time, the film begins to peel off the speaker casing.  The rest is an excellent speaker system for the money. </p>
