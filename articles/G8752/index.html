Today the program includes plasticine mosaic</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Perhaps not only today, but tomorrow.  Oh, look, and the day after tomorrow.  The thing is so painstaking that one day can not do.  Although, of course, there are gentle technologies and simple drawings designed for a very young age.  But, you must admit, before educating a child, an adult himself must study the issue from all sides, master the practical side of the matter.  And for this you have to roll up more than one hundred plasticine peas! </p><h2>  Mosaic.  History and Modernity </h2><p>  People fit fragments of various materials from ancient times.  Walls and floors were first mosaic to level. </p><p>  Subsequently, the mosaic became an adornment of temples, home interiors, furniture and utensils. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.privateguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mosaic in art" class="if uuid-3127562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12424/3127562.jpg"></div><p>  From small stones and pieces of ceramics in the distant past, this art form has survived to a modern variety of materials.  Among them are traditional: </p><ul><li>  glass; </li><li>  tile; </li><li>  smalt; </li><li>  stones </li><li>  beads; </li><li>  ceramics; </li><li>  mirror fragments; </li><li>  shells. </li></ul><p>  The combination of colors and textures, the ability to decorate unusual surfaces make the potential of mosaics as a decorative art form unlimited. </p><p>  There are even mosaics like this: </p><ul><li>  Floral </li><li>  grocery; </li><li>  buttons; </li><li>  stationery; </li><li>  screw and nail; </li><li>  Egg </li><li>  sand; </li><li>  cork; </li><li>  candy; </li><li>  trash; </li><li>  cash; </li><li>  toothpicks; </li><li>  pill; </li><li>  textile. </li></ul><p>  And the list goes on and on.  A more traditional look will be described here - plasticine mosaic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mosaic needs plasticine" class="if uuid-3126499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111526/3126499.jpg"></div><h2>  About the benefits of sculpting </h2><p>  Plasticine is a very suitable material for this decoration method.  Its brightness and plasticity, a large selection of colors allow you to create still lifes, landscapes, portraits. </p><p>  For large and complex plasticine mosaics, craftsmen make thousands of balls, the size of which is close to a millet seed. </p><p>  As for children, they always sculpt with pleasure.  The benefit of this lesson is that it develops: </p><ul><li>  fantasy </li><li>  fine motor skills; </li><li>  perseverance; </li><li>  accuracy; </li><li>  purposefulness; </li><li>  eye; </li><li>  color perception; </li><li>  observation. </li></ul><h2>  Where to get the template? </h2><p>  First of all, you should think about what will be depicted on a plasticine mosaic.  Patterns of drawings can be drawn by hand, bought in a store for creativity, or printed on a printer.  They can be any suitable image, even from children's coloring.  To begin with, the child should offer something simple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mosaic pattern" class="if uuid-3127595" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12424/3127595.jpg"></div><h2>  What will we sculpt?  Cloudberries! </h2><p>  It is proposed to make a small panel on the theme "Cloudberries". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Cloudberry is the name of the whole plant and its berries.  The northerners called them royal.  Cloudberries have other names: </p><ul><li>  swamp guardian; </li><li>  amber of the swamp; </li><li>  swamp eyes; </li><li>  arctic orange; </li><li>  northern raspberries. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="We will sculpt cloudberries!" class="if uuid-3126504" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111526/3126504.jpg"></div><p>  Cloudberries have only 2-3 leaves and 1 white flower with five petals.  Its fruit looks like raspberries.  <span>Such a fruit, bones, is very convenient to depict using separate small particles.</span> </p><p>  Before starting work, we will prepare a sheet of cardboard or paper and draw a diagram of the future composition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern for plasticine mosaic." class="if uuid-3126508" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111526/3126508.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparation for work </h2><p>  To create a plasticine mosaic, we need: </p><ol><li>  A lid from the packaging (cans) of some dairy product: mayonnaise, ice cream, cottage cheese (if only it were clean and without stickers). <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="Drawing is applied to the base" class="if uuid-3126506" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111526/3126506.jpg"></div></li><li>  Plasticine.  Here, the choice of the creator can not be limited by anything, since the trading network today shines with a variety of goods for crafts. </li><li>  There are 2 options for this item: </li></ol><ul><li>  We create a plasticine mosaic using a stencil made in advance of cardboard or paper.  If the lid is clear enough, you can attach the template paper with tape on the back. </li><li>  On an opaque basis with a marker, we draw a sketch of a self-developed drawing. </li></ul><p>  In this case, such an image of cloudberries will be transferred to the base cap. </p><h2>  Plasticine mosaic.  Modeling </h2><p>  A rather complex plot has been chosen, so it is better to have a picture in front of you, on the basis of which it is developed.  If this is ‚Äúcreativity from the head‚Äù, it is still worth pre-portraying it in color and putting it in front of you.  This will help in the work. </p><ol><li>  To begin with, we‚Äôll stick a lot of small green balls.  The smallest lay out the contour of the plant. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="We spread the contour of cloudberries" class="if uuid-3126510" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111526/3126510.jpg"></div></li><li>  Fill the background with larger balls.  We leave the rim untouched, it will be a different color. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fill the green mosaic background." class="if uuid-3126512" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111526/3126512.jpg"></div></li><li>  With light green lumps we spread the entire edge of the leaf and veins on it.  To keep the plasticine mosaic on the basis, the details, of course, need to be pressed, but only very slightly, so as not to wrinkle. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="Light green for leaves" class="if uuid-3126514" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111526/3126514.jpg"></div></li><li>  From the darkest shade of green, we roll up plasticine blanks.  We fill in the remaining space of the sheet. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="Feet and sepals on the mosaic" class="if uuid-3126518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111526/3126518.jpg"></div></li><li>  Take ocher, terracotta and brown plasticine.  With their help, create the legs of a flower and a berry: lay them with small balls. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="The main element of the mosaic" class="if uuid-3126521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111526/3126521.jpg"></div></li><li>  Orange and red peas make cloudberries.  A little trick: for greater naturalness, plasticine can be interfered with one another. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="The mosaic center is ready" class="if uuid-3126525" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111526/3126525.jpg"></div></li><li>  Spreads of white plasticine with the flower petals.  When portraying particularly shaded areas, you can add gray, but only very tiny grains and very few. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spread the bezel of the mosaic" class="if uuid-3126542" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111526/3126542.jpg"></div></li><li>  Yellow, white and orange balls fill the ring of the rim. </li></ol><p>  The panel is ready! </p><h2>  Plasticine precautions </h2><p>  Here is such a beautiful cloudberry turned out: directly pulls to pick it and eat it.  But such a fate does not threaten this work, since it is nevertheless intended for more adult authors.  Kids can not afford such painstaking and delicate work. </p><p>  But patterns and techniques can be developed even for very small ones.  And they do plasticine mosaic with no less pleasure and zeal than the elders.  Before starting work with a child, it is advisable to have a conversation about the rules of working with plasticine: this material can not be eaten, it is difficult to wipe off surfaces and is washed off clothes.  It is important to teach your child to be careful while working. </p>
