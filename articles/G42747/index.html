    <p>  When considering the structure of Sberbank, you can see a developed network of partner banks.  These are organizations that provide services on favorable terms.  If the company does not have a partnership agreement, then the cost will be higher.  Therefore, such cooperation will be unprofitable for customers. </p><p>  Now various Sberbank partner banks are working.  Without a commission, you can withdraw funds with their help.  Thanks to cooperation, the institution has more various financial products, which allows you to attract customers.  And people perform operations without commissions or for a very small fee. </p><p>  Collaboration is beneficial for both parties.

If you pay a debt in an institution that is not a partner, you will have to pay a high commission. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of partner banks </h2><p>  Now various Sberbank partner banks are working.
