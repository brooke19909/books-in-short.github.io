    <h2>  Agia Pelagia </h2><p>  This resort village, where Alexander House is located, is located not too far from Heraklion, has a well-developed tourist infrastructure.  There are bars and authentic taverns, shops and souvenir shops.  However, clubs and discos in this village you will not find.  It is located on the north coast of Crete.  This village is famous for its picturesque bay and sandy beach.  The terrain is located so that the coast is protected from the north winds.  Therefore, there are almost never big waves here.  In the Middle Ages there was a monastery of St. Pelagia (hence the name), but to this day its building has not been preserved.  Only the ruins and the foundation remained.  And in ancient times, in these places was the ancient city of Apollonia.  Therefore, archaeological excavations are often conducted here.  In just a few years, the village itself has transformed from a provincial fishing village into a fashionable resort with good infrastructure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander House Hotel 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1936323.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  In the evenings, many guests of the Alexander House Hotel 4 * (Crete) go for a walk around the village.  To visit Heraklion, Hersonnisos or Rethymnon, you can use regular buses, the benefit of the local transport connection is branched.  Thus, you are quite for little money - if you count only a round trip and a ticket to the museum - you can walk around the world-famous ruins of the Knossos Palace.  Well, if you want to travel around the whole island, rent a car.  After all, Crete is an incredible place, there are many interesting things here, so you don‚Äôt have enough vacation to look at all with at least one eye.  And these excursions can be organized on your own.  If you still want to visit tours with a guide, then it is better to buy them on the street.  It will cost much cheaper, and in terms of quality and safety it will be exactly the same as in a hotel.  Quite often, people take long trips - to the island of Santorini, in the Lassithi Valley.  But the first trip is very difficult and tiring, especially in the summer.  It lasts from six in the morning until ten in the evening. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  If, while relaxing in the Alexander House Hotel 4 * (Greece, Crete), you want to bring something home, then it is better to buy it in stores.  First of all, these places are famous for natural and high-quality olive oil.  The best price is 6 euros per liter, and it really is what cannot be found in Russia.  Olives of different tastes and pickling methods are also worth taking with you.  But first of all, you should choose what is right for you.  Cretan olives are not at all like the ones that Russians are used to.  They are best taken by weight in large supermarkets.  And since we‚Äôve already started talking about olive products, women always like the local soap and cosmetics.  The latter is advised to buy in pharmacies.  They also bring wonderful thyme honey from here.  It is mountainous, never sugared and has excellent healing properties.  Men will more like local strong drinks - ouzo, crayfish and, of course, Metax cognac. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander House Hotel 4 Crete Heraklion Greece" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1936338.jpg" width="600"></div>
