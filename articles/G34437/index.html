Salt is poured into cold water and mixed until completely dissolved.  It is advisable to strain the liquid at the end so that grains do not fall into the batch.  Then the flour is sieved through a fine sieve and introduced into small bowl in small portions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When everything is well kneaded, the container is covered with a cotton towel and sent to the cold for a couple of hours.

The following ingredients are needed: potato starch - 1 tablespoon, a glass of cold water, a glass of wheat flour and the same amount of salt. </p><p>  Pour a tablespoon of starch into cold water and mix thoroughly so that there are no lumps.  This mixture is poured into an enameled bowl.  Then pour half a glass of boiling water, also stirring constantly.  It should be a thick substance. </p><p>  Separately, in a bowl mix the flour and salt in a dry form.  Then, with a spoon, gradually add cooled jelly.  To perform work from salt dough, you do not need to make it too soft, it is better if it is tight. </p><h2>  Plastic butter dough </h2><p>  Essential Ingredients: </p><ol><li>  A third cup of salt. </li><li>  Two teaspoons of soda. </li><li>  A glass of cold water. </li><li>  A glass of wheat flour. </li><li>  A spoonful of vegetable oil. </li></ol><p>  Pour all dry ingredients into a bowl and mix.

You can paint it, or you can leave it in a natural beige color. </p><h2>  People figures </h2><p>  Girls like to make salt dough dolls.  You can put on such a figure made by a baby in clothes made of fabric, sew a hat on her or knit a scarf.  Children love dynamic toys with which you can perform some kind of action.

You need to carefully follow the step-by-step instructions and consider a photo of the sequence of making the owl figurine: </p><ol><li>  First, a large ball of dough is molded. </li><li>  A rocking chair needs to be rolled out into a circle with a diameter of 10-12 cm. </li><li>  With a cap from a pen or marker you need to push feathers indentation.  They cover the bottom of the circle.  From above they will not be visible, so there is no point in doing it. </li><li>  The next step is to fold the circle in the middle.  To do this, visually the part is divided into three equal parts.  We perform bends on the left and on the right. </li><li>  Then the upper edge of the circle drops by one third and the ears are pulled out. </li><li>  Two eyes are squeezed out with a cap and a beak is drawn with a knife. </li><li>  The finished owl figurine is put on a slow fire in the oven for half an hour.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to store salt dough" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2088069.jpg"></div>  When the figure cools down, you can begin to stain.  If you want to make not an interior item or a simple craft, but use such a beautiful figure, for example, as a keychain, you will need to make a hole for a ringlet in the middle of your forehead before drying.
