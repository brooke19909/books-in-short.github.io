It is located near the Sovetsky district, or rather, on its outskirts, affecting the territory of the Kirov part as well.  Here the memorial is open to the winds;  you can not find vegetation and around the grave there is soil sprinkled with a thick layer of sand. </p><p>  Bald Mountain is the highest point of Volgograd.  Its height reaches 145 meters.  Climbing to its top, you can see the beautiful city as if in the palm of your hand.  In wartime, it happened that more than 50 thousand soldiers and several hundred officers took part in the battle from all sides.  Tanks, mortars, artillery - everything stood on this earth.  And now the memorial complex ‚ÄúBald Mountain‚Äù (Volgograd) reminds the inhabitants of the war. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bald mountain volgograd" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1158350.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  Memory of the dead </h2><p>  Quite often you can hear how Bald Mountain is compared with the hill of Mamaev Kurgan.  This is due to the fact that once there were fights for the city, which was then called Stalingrad.  Already at that time, the future memorial symbol was considered an important object. </p><h2>  Battle of Stalingrad </h2><p>  The defense in 1942 was held by the 64th Army, led by General <span>M. Shumilov.</span> When hostilities began, the Nazis began to cross the Volga River.  After several successful battles for the enemy on February 14, the Germans nevertheless seized the heights.  However, I did not have to rejoice for long.  Soviet troops, having made an attempt to push back the German army, make a counterattack and force the Germans to withdraw.  After some time, reinforcements come to the aid of the Nazis.  Opponents again capture the height of "Bald Mountain" (Volgograd), and with it the western slope.  After a while, this territory becomes a fairly strong defensive point. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Soviet Union accepted two unsuccessful attempts to launch an attack.  The assault was constantly "fought off" by German troops.  And in the fall of 1942 (October), the Red Army begins a counterattack against the Nazis, thereby not giving the enemy even a chance to strike the last - a decisive blow to Stalingrad.  For seven days, the Germans could not repel the attack, and they have to change course from an attack on the defense. </p><p>  That is how the battle for Volgograd took place.  Sovetsky district, Lysaya Gora (including) were liberated on January 17, 1943.  This joyful event was preceded by strong attacks and counterattacks of the Red Army.  But after the defeat of the strongholds, the Germans had no choice but to retreat.  Only 147 days, the young men and officers had to defend their heights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bald mountain volgograd how to get there" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1158353.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Creation of a memorial complex </h2><p>  In 1968, the government decided to erect a <span>memorial complex.</span>  From that moment on, Lysa Gora (Volgograd) was an important symbolic site for both the city and the Russian Federation.  The memorial is located at an altitude of more than 140 m. Here you can pray and cry for the soldiers of the 64th army of Shumilov.  On November 4 of the same year, a special obelisk was opened, which is made of brick and concrete.  The words of support, grief and regret are written on it, as well as the praise of deeds that will forever remain immortal.  A special unit is installed near the stove, on which the scheme of the army‚Äôs work from January 10 to February 2 is carved.  If you look closely, then Lysa Gora (Volgograd) has small tiles where symbolic objects are painted (five-pointed star).  They are made in order to highlight for the people the most cruel fights in which more than one thousand people died. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="memorial complex bald mountain volgograd" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1158355.jpg" width="412"></div>

In 1973, the government erected a monument here, 4 meters high.  It is made of marble.  A sign is carved on it, which describes whose bodies are resting here.  The Orthodox cross has been standing near the memorial since 2001.  It was established by the Russian people, who himself expressed a desire to establish a cross. </p><h2>  Monument Features </h2><p>  Words are specially carved on the monument so that generations can see and honor the memory of those who saved their lives, did not give Russian territory to the Germans and defended it to the last ... Every year, thousands come to the monument, located near the obelisk, where soldiers who died in battles are buried people.  Bald Mountain (Volgograd) saw everything: blood, and tears, and joy, and sadness.  Flowers constantly cover these areas.  No one spares money on lush bouquets of carnations.  After all, everyone understands who they owe to such a beautiful city - Volgograd. </p>

    <h2>  Reconstruction of events </h2><p>  A few years ago, the city leadership decided to reconstruct all the events that took place in the <span>battle of Stalingrad.</span>  More than half of the city has come to look at the ‚Äúperformance‚Äù.  A particularly large number were pensioners and the elderly, direct descendants of the victims.  The leaders were able to create an atmosphere of one of the terrible days of the war.  Everything was so realistically shown that even in some moments chunks of land were flying at the viewers from the rupture of fake mines (although everything looked quite realistic).  For all viewers, these shots, seen live, made a rather strong impression, which for a long time clogged into a corner of the soul and has been disturbing to this day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bald mountain volgograd mass grave" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1158359.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Movie shooting </h2><p>  Most likely, due to the reconstruction of those events, after a while a film crew came here to make a documentary.  After its publication, the Bald Mountain (Volgograd) became known throughout Eurasia.  How to get there, you can see on the map, because this place is marked on local atlases.  In extreme cases, you can ask the local residents.  No one will refuse a request to find a memorial structure. </p><p>  Vasily Zaitsev - a documentary was shot about him.  He became famous throughout the Soviet Union due to the fact that he was one of the best snipers of the Red Army.  It was not difficult to fully reflect the reality of events, since the trenches of those times are still preserved here. </p>
