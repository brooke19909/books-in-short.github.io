No exception is the story of Sergiev Posad.  Briefly conveying it is not easy, because this settlement has existed for almost 7 centuries, during which many interesting events took place on its lands.  The past of Sergiev Posad is inextricably linked with the Trinity-Sergius Lavra located on its lands - the largest Russian Orthodox monastery, which tourists and believers from many countries come to see.  Located within the Golden Ring, the city attracts visitors with its picturesque nature, unique monuments of ancient architecture, interesting museums and hospitality of residents. </p>

    <h2>  The foundation of the monastery </h2><p>  The history of Sergiev Posad began back in 1347. It was then that in the Radonezhsky forest on the Makovets forest hill near the Konchury River, the brothers Bartholomew and Stefan built a monastic cell and a small church in the name of the Trinity.  Ascetics considered serving God as the only goal of their life, and the uninhabited area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Moscow Region was the best suited for this.  But soon Stefan was tired of dense forests and constant monastic privations.  Leaving his brother, he moved to the Epiphany monastery in Moscow.  Bartholomew was tonsured a monk under the name of Sergius and began to live in a cell as a hermit.  So he existed alone for several years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Over time, monks from nearby lands began to come to Sergius to the settlement.  They founded the Trinity Monastery around the church, which in its appearance resembled a small town fenced with a wooden fence.  Sergius of Radonezh forbade novices to accept alms from strangers and ordered them to earn a living by their own labor.  So the monastery gradually turned into a rich center of handicraft production.  Around him, peasants and artisans began to build their homes.  From these settlements settlements were gradually formed.  Also, the clergy were patronized by the Russian nobility, giving it various benefits and feudal privileges. </p>

    <h2>  The role of the monastery in the victory on the Kulikovo field </h2><p>  The history of the city of Sergiev Posad is closely connected with the name of the Grand Duke Dmitry Donskoy, who delivered the Russian lands from the Mongol-Tatar yoke.  If you believe the annals, in 1380, on the eve of the <span>battle on the Kulikovo field, the</span> ruler of the Russian lands, together with the squad, arrived at the monastery for the blessing of Sergius. </p><p>  The reverend father not only spiritually supported the soldiers, but also gave them two of his monks <span>(Alexander Peresvet</span> and Rodion Oslyabyu), who knew how to handle weapons, to help them.  Having received support from Sergius, Dmitry Donskoy and his team went to <span>Kulikovo Field</span> to fight with the troops of the Golden Horde.  According to ancient legends, the brave monks Oslyabya and Peresvet frantically fought with the enemy and died in battle.  But in the end, the Dmitry Donskoy squad managed to defeat the Mongol-Tatars, and this victory laid the foundation for the liberation of Russia from a long-term yoke. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The death of the founder of the city </h2><p>  The reverend father died in 1392 and was buried in the territory of the monastery he founded.  The story of Sergiev Posad is saturated.  For children, the story of the city‚Äôs life will look magical if you tell them why the name of the great monk, its founder, was known far beyond his place of residence.  Among people, he became famous as a great miracle worker and righteous man, whom not only ordinary peasants, but also <span>noble people,</span> turned to in the most difficult moment <span>.</span>  30 years after the death of Sergius, they were counted among the saints.  In honor of this event, a stone Trinity Cathedral was erected over the place of his burial, erected at the expense of the son of Dmitry Donskoy Prince Yuri. </p>

    <h2>  The destruction of the monastery </h2><p>  The history of the city of Sergiev Posad has its own tragic pages.  Despite the fact that as a result of the Battle of Kulikovo, the troops of the Golden Horde suffered a crushing defeat, they still attacked the Russian lands from time to time.  In 1408, the Tatars launched an attack on Moscow.  When the majestic Trinity-Sergius Monastery appeared on their way, Khan Edigey ordered his army to burn it.  Wooden religious buildings flared up and burned to the ground. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Rebirth and prosperity </h2><p>  Despite the devastating raid of the Tatars, the monastery did not cease to exist, on the site of which later Sergiev Posad was formed.  The history of the city for children can be told without mentioning these facts, but they also need to know about these, albeit unpleasant, events. </p><p>  3 years after the tragedy, new religious buildings appeared on these lands, for the construction of which stone was used.  The restored monastery stood firmly on its feet and, thanks to the support of the princes, began to develop even faster and better.  He owned farms far beyond its borders, meadows, peasant households with farms, places for fishing, etc. </p><p>  Tsar Ivan the Terrible always listened to the opinion of the high Trinity clergy.  In 1561 he received from the monastery clergy the approval of his policy, which went down in history under the name "oprichnina".  The support of the sovereign brought the monks new land holdings and replenishment of the treasury at the expense of state people. </p>

    <p>  In the middle of the 16th century, Ivan the Terrible ordered the construction of stone walls with 11 towers around the lands belonging to the monastery, after which it turned into an impregnable fortress.  The brief history of Sergiev Posad for children contains colorful examples of how the citadel withstood the dignity of almost a year and a half siege of the Polish-Lithuanian conquerors in 1608-1610.  When the Streletsky revolt broke out in Russia in 1682, the stone walls of the monastery sheltered from the anger of the discontented military <span>princess Sofya</span> Nikolaevna and princes Ivan and Peter.  After 7 years, the latter already hid here on his own during his battle for the royal throne.  Having ascended the throne, <span>Peter I</span> supported the monastery lands in every possible way.  Such a policy of the sovereign contributed to their further prosperity. </p><h2>  Renaming the monastery into a laurel </h2><p>  With the support of rulers and nobles, the story of Sergiev Posad continued.  It will be interesting for children to learn that in 1744 the monastery was renamed the Lavra.  Such an honorary title gave him new opportunities and strengthened his status among other Orthodox religious institutions in Russia.  In 1782, numerous settlements surrounding the monastery were united into a settlement called "Sergiev Posad". </p><p>  The educated city received a coat of arms, almshouses, trading shops, monastery hotels began to be erected on its territory, factories, factories, a printing house were opened.  Gradually, he turned into a large center for the production of toys; his Russian doll became his symbol.  In 1865, railroads were laid between Sergiev Posad and Moscow.  This attracted a large number of pilgrims and pilgrims to the monastery. </p>

    <h2>  Bolshevik politics </h2><p>  The prosperity of the Trinity-Sergius Lavra and its lands ended with the coming to power in Russia of the Bolsheviks.  All religious institutions in the city were closed.  A museum was founded on the territory of the laurel in 1919.  The monks were persecuted and repressed.  The name "Sergiev Posad" disappeared from the cards.  The history of the city for children testifies that in 1919 it was named Sergiev, and in 1930 - Zagorsky.  This name he received in honor of the revolutionary Vladimir Zagorsky. </p><h2>  Sergiev Posad during the Soviet era </h2><p>  During the existence of the USSR, the appearance of the city has changed significantly.  New factories and plants were built on its territory.  In 1932, a unique Toy Research Institute was opened here.  The war with the Germans made adjustments to the measured life of the city.  Many of its residents went to war to the front, 14 of them after the end of hostilities were awarded the title of Hero of the USSR.  Since 1946, religious life in Sergiev Posad began to gradually revive.  From this time the monks began to return to the monastery. </p>

    <p>  In 1976, a monument to Zagorsky was opened in the city.  Since 1980, a toy museum began to function here.  In honor of the 1000th anniversary of the baptism of Kievan Rus in 1988, in the vicinity of the village, near the Transfiguration Church, a monument to its founder Sergius of Radonezh was inaugurated.  The former name was returned to Sergiev Posad after a local referendum held in 1991. </p>
