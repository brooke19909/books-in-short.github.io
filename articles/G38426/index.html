Its description is the topic of this article.  Resort services for tourists in the village of Mahmutlar (located in the Alanya region) are traditionally considered the most economical for the province of Antalya.  Obviously, such a pricing policy takes place due to its remoteness from the airport.  Hotels that are different in their classification in the resort business are famous for Alanya.  <span>4 star hotels</span> occupy an important place in it.  They provide a quality guesthouse type economy and classic. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel rating of Alanya </h2><p>  Why do tourists often choose a deliberately less comfortable four-star?  After all, there are more advanced hotels that provide with their more powerful infrastructure a five- and six-star level of service?  Why is a 4 * hotel still chosen by people whose prosperity allows the use of 5 * services?  Reasoning, it is worth paying attention to the most successful institutions.  Pay attention to the <span>rating of hotels</span> shown in table 1 <span>.</span>  Alanya introduced the top ten hotels that have earned recognition in 2014. </p><p>  <em>Table 1.

    <p>  When does it make sense for a holidaymaker to choose a five-star for relaxation?  The answer is simple: if a vacationer plans to spend his entire vacation without going anywhere from the territory of his chosen hotel.  After all, such hotel complexes have such a developed internal infrastructure that it is self-sufficient for a quality passive rest. </p><h2>  Alanya Resort </h2><p>  One of the busiest resort areas of the Country of Stars and the Crescent in general and its region of Antalya in particular, is considered the resort of Alanya.  The map of hotels in this region looks like a pearl necklace scattered along the coast.  The westernmost hotel is the five-star Holiday Park, and the easternmost is the Beach Club Doganay 5 * hotel. </p>

    <p>  Families with children are happy to buy oriental sweets from the local entrepreneur Mustafa.  He really offers quality products at affordable prices.  For example, Turkish delight in a hotel costs only $ 4, which is several times cheaper than in other retail outlets. </p><p>  A good exercise for visitors to the Klas Dom Anex Hotel 4 * hotel is a walk through the village of Mahmutlar.  The nature here is picturesque and pleases the eye with spectacular sea and mountain landscapes </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Like any other hotel, Klas Dom Anex Hotel 4 * has a staff of guides who organize excursions for its guests.  However, an analysis of guest reviews indicates that the price / quality ratio of the review program from the hotel is not higher than, say, a tour agency from Alanya.  We have studied on this score the reviews of many tourists.  The most experienced of them have reserved for themselves informative trips via the Internet before flying to Turkey and, by the way, were very pleased with this. </p><p>  Of course, all the all-inclusive hotels in Turkey have their own excursion program.  Prices, however, are twice as high as those of professional agencies.  The fact is that even at the stage of their planning, hotel guides come from overpriced profitability.  Trying to offer their own program, they use the techniques of <span>unfair competition: they</span> tell vacationers about the risk of being robbed or even worse on "outside" excursions.  They also say that insurance "works" only during their excursions (the latter does not correspond to the truth).  However, in practice, such ‚Äúheavy‚Äù arguments turn out to be a bluff, and the facts show only one thing: the price ratio is twice as good with the tour agency from Alanya. </p><h2>  Pamukkale </h2><p>  One of the most anticipated tours by tourists is to the Pamukkale Natural History Museum.  This place, called the "cotton castle", is hard to miss.  It stands out from afar with its white color.  His beauty was appreciated before our era.  An antique pool was built here.  Numerous picturesque travertine baths in ancient times were surrounded by a portico with columns (time turned out to be stronger, the ancient structure was destroyed). </p>

The main thermal spring of Pamukkale is romantically called the Cleopatra Basin.  It is quite spacious, has a shallow and deep part.  Outside there are natural baths - travertines.  They are covered with picturesque snow-white deposits of salt.  However, the legendary queen never visited this place.  And her name brings a raid of mystery to this object.  Water in the pool is heated by a geyser.  Above it, the ancients built Roman baths, which, unfortunately, could not stand the test of time.  Their ruined columns still lie here, creating a special flavor of antiquity to this miracle of nature.

    <h2>  Cappadocia </h2><p>  Tours to Cappadocia, a unique area of ‚Äã‚Äãvolcanic origin, are traditionally in demand by tourists.  Rocks 40 meters high conical outlines are truly original.  A peculiar rocky relief created by nature is complemented here by ancient underground cities and large underground early Christian churches.  This bewitching sight as if plunges tourists into the lost world.  After all, even the houses of modern residents of this ancient land are cut down in the rocks.  This is a tribute to tradition. </p><h2>  Discovery Park </h2><p>  One of the favorite places for tourists to visit in Antalya is Discovery Park.  Traditionally, adults and children are attracted by giant dinosaur figures.  They are quite complex mechanized devices with automatic control elements.  In particular, the breath of ancient dinosaurs is imitated.  The motion sensors installed in their bodies capture the movement of oncoming spectators and make these giant mannequins move and make a sound.  It looks impressive and the kids really like it. </p><p>  In addition to demonstrating the models of giant dinosaurs who lived on Earth millions of years ago, an exhibition of sand figures is regularly shown at Discovery Park. </p>

After all, this resort is rich not only in clean mountain air, palm groves, warm sea and golden beaches, but also in historical sights, as well as modern entertainment and cultural centers. </p><h2>  Shopping in Alanya </h2><p>  Many tourists staying at the hotel limit their purchases in Turkey to visiting nearby shops.  This gives them an incomplete picture of Turkish trade and limits their contacts and purchases.  They should pay attention to the advantages of the price range of products of the local light industry (in particular, the quality and price of leather products).  First of all, it is worth visiting the eastern bazaar of Alanya with its endless shopping arcades. </p><p>  There are many jewelry shops and boutiques in Alanya.  Many tourists find interesting and sophisticated pendants, brooches, earrings, pendants, necklaces for themselves at the Baran Jewelery store, located in the center of Alanya. </p><p>  Good shopping is famous for the Alanium supermarket known in Turkey.

It is located below sea level.  It is distinguished by a constant year-round temperature of + 22 <sup>0</sup> C. In the grotto, the stunning spectacle of <span>stalactites and stalagmites is</span> enhanced by special lighting.  This place has a story connected with piracy: here once corsairs hid from prying eyes. </p><h2>  Lovers cave </h2><p>  Of course, it is worth not only seeing, but also relaxing on the <span>beach of Cleopatra,</span> one of the best in Turkey.  But a visit to the Cave of Lovers (which is not at all easy to do), according to existing belief, guarantees the couple who committed this brave deed, a long joint family life. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  For many Russians, the words Turkey, Alanya have become a synonym for good, quality rest.  5 * hotels or 4 * hotels ... What does it matter?  The main thing is that the vacationer should be charged for a quality rest.  Even in the Land of Stars and Crescent, where the spa industry initially guarantees the turquoise of the Mediterranean Sea and a quality guesthouse, the charm of relaxation will depend on the chosen excursions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="klas dom anex hotel" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/477553.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  We also note that an important factor in the quality leisure of a tourist is his culture and a tolerant, friendly attitude towards the hotel staff.  After all, the philosophy of well-being is extremely simple: smile at the world - and it will smile at you in return. </p>
