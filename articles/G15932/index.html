Unfortunately, the modern inhabitants of our country have forgotten how to relax, they are so mired with everyday problems, work and the routine of familiar gray everyday life that they can not even fully enjoy the chosen resort.  If you want to be alone with yourself, enjoy the beauty of the landscapes that open, the sound of the surf, the grandeur of the mountains and true Asian exotic, we invite you to Thailand.  Of the variety of resorts we offer to stay on the island of Phuket.  It is remote from the center of resort life in the country, immersed in the greenery of tropical plants and resembles a real paradise in the middle of the ocean. </p><p>  Thousands of tourists come here every year who want to be alone with nature, meet the sunrises and spend sunsets on the coast.  The atmosphere here is really amazing, even magical.  Of course, in many respects the quality of rest depends on the correctness of the chosen hotel.  Thailand is not a country where there are many first-class and fashionable hotels.  On the contrary, most local hotels and hotels are far from ideal, do not correspond to the description indicated on the official website.  Hotel Mirage Patong 3 * is a fairly popular option, it is offered as part of the tour to many Russian tourists.  Let's try based on the reviews of real vacationers to evaluate it from all sides.  Perhaps this is a great option for accommodation. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  So, Mirage Patong Phuket 3 * hotel is located on the second coastline, just 500 meters from the coast.  The distance from the nearest airport is only 40 km, so tourists do not have to travel a considerable distance after a tiring and long flight. </p><p>  On the one hand, the location of the hotel can be called excellent, because the beach and all the necessary entertainment are here within walking distance.  On the other hand, it is quite noisy in the evenings here, but the high-quality soundproofing of the rooms allows you to perfectly combat this problem. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  If you choose Mirage Express Patong Phuket Hotel 3 * for your stay, you can stay in one of the rather comfortable rooms.  Each has a spacious bathroom with towels, bath amenities, beauty products and a hairdryer. </p><p>  It may seem that on vacation you do not need a TV at all.  But the administration of the Mirage Patong 3 * hotel is of a different opinion and equipped all rooms with flat-screen satellite TVs.  You can put things in order with the help of an ironing board and an iron of a modern model.  A powerful air conditioner is responsible for maintaining a comfortable microclimate in the room.  In just a few minutes, it cools the air to the required temperature. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  When checking into the hotel, all tourists will receive a password from the wireless Internet for free, and they will also be able to use the safe in the room to store valuables, documents and money.  Reviews of tourists emphasize that the Internet, or rather the signal in the room is excellent, there is enough speed not only to exchange a couple of phrases and photos with loved ones, but also to watch your favorite movie before going to bed.  You do not have to constantly leave things at the reception - the hotel administration took care of safety and comfort for every vacationer. </p><p>  The rooms in the Mirage Patong 3 * hotel are spacious and bright, the furniture is new, modern, will satisfy the requirements of even the most demanding tourists and vacationers.  Somewhat embarrassing is the wall made of transparent glass between the main room and the bathroom.  And this despite the fact that there are no curtains in the bathroom.  You should be extremely careful when taking water procedures, do not forget to close the curtains, so as not to become public. </p>
