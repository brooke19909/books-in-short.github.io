Azerbaijan is an amazing and harmonious combination of modernity and ancient Eastern culture and architecture.  Locals cherish the national culture and values, as well as centuries-old history.  Tourism in Azerbaijan is a unique opportunity to plunge into the culture of the East. </p><h2>  What to see in Azerbaijan? </h2><p>  In the country there are a huge number of attractions.  Here tourists can visit old cities and visit Islamic mosques.  Go on an excursion to the magnificent palace and see the monumental fortresses that defended the city many centuries ago.  Azerbaijan is a country where in the morning you can go to a noisy bazaar and plunge into the oriental flavor, and in the evening enjoy the views of modern skyscrapers. </p><p>  For those who are tired of the excursion program, the best vacation in Azerbaijan is offered on the coast of the Caspian Sea, where a huge number of beautiful beaches are located.  In addition, you can relax in a health resort with thermal waters, which have a beneficial effect on the human body. </p><p>  The article presents the best places of rest in Azerbaijan and the sights selected in accordance with the reviews of people who have already visited this beautiful country. </p><h2>  Historic Sightseeing Tours </h2><p>  The priority destination of each tourist is the Old City of Icheri Sheher, which is an old part of Baku.  It was in this place on a hill located near the sea that the development of the capital of Azerbaijan began.  The old city is the very center of Baku, it is surrounded by well-preserved ramparts.  People on the territory of Icheri Sheher lived back in the Bronze Age.  This quarter saw the shooting of several episodes of Leonid Gaidai‚Äôs film ‚ÄúThe Diamond Arm‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.hoteliermiddleeast.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baku. Old city" class="if uuid-2728177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2728177.jpg"></div><p>  Today, Icheri Sheher is the oldest residential quarter in Baku.  It is an object of historical and cultural heritage.  Outside the walls of the old city, many unique monuments of antiquity have been preserved, which are must-see. </p><p>  Once in Azerbaijan, one cannot help visiting <span>the Shirvanshahs palace.</span>  It was built in the 15th century and is a masterpiece of Azerbaijani architecture.  The well-preserved complex includes a two-story palace, a tomb, a mosque, ancient baths and the gates of Murad.  The delightful work of medieval artisans will not leave indifferent even the most demanding tourist. </p><h2>  Sightseeing Tours </h2><p>  Baku is a city of contrasts.  Not far from Icheri Sheher is a modern architectural complex - Flame Towers.  Three huge skyscrapers in shape resembling flames.  Every evening, with the advent of darkness, the facade of the skyscrapers is illuminated by a unique illumination that simulates a blazing fire.  This is truly a bewitching sight. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holidayme.com.sa" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flaming towers" class="if uuid-2728158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2728158.jpg"></div><p>  For those who want to explore the capital of Azerbaijan from a height, it is recommended to ride on the Baku Ferris Wheel 60 meters high.  One circle on the Ferris wheel lasts from 20 to 30 minutes.  During this time, you can admire the panoramas of the city.  Incredibly beautiful views open at night in Baku - the city is illuminated by millions of lights.  From such a sight, the heart beats. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.freespirittours.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baku Ferris Wheel" class="if uuid-2728189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2728189.jpg"></div><h2>  Natural beauties of Azerbaijan </h2><p>  Tourism in Azerbaijan is not limited to exploring the capital.  Tourists are invited to go on a fascinating journey around the country in order to visit the best places created by nature itself. </p><p>  <span>Gobustan Nature Reserve</span> is located about 60 km from the capital of Azerbaijan.  Here you can visit the caves and admire the cave paintings made by the ancestors many centuries before our birth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gobustan Nature Reserve" class="if uuid-2728203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2728203.jpg"></div><p>  Azerbaijan is famous for its mud volcanoes.  In this country there are more than 350. The most famous is the volcano Garasu, which erupts to a height of more than 1000 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="azerbaijan24.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mud Volcanoes" class="if uuid-2728217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2728217.jpg"></div><p>  25 km from Baku in the village of Mehemmed is a unique natural phenomenon - Yanardag or Burning Mountain.  It is a natural gas that constantly burns on a hillside.  Gas seeps from the very depths of the earth and maintains constant burning of the flame. </p><h2>  The best resorts </h2><p>  For those who are tired of sightseeing, it is proposed to choose one of the places to stay in Azerbaijan. </p><p>  You can visit the world's only mineral resort Naftalan.  Here, treatment is carried out using crude oil.  Tourists come here to undergo a set of procedures that reduce joint pain, they also have anti-inflammatory properties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mineral resort Naftalan" class="if uuid-2728224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2728224.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The best vacation in Azerbaijan is undoubtedly on the coast of the Caspian Sea.  It has a fairly warm and mild climate, well-developed infrastructure, a large selection of hotels.  Tourists are attracted by rather low prices for accommodation and entertainment - everyone can relax in accordance with their desires.  You can rent a house right on the beach and enjoy the sound of the sea and sunsets of incredible beauty.  For lovers of comfort, you can choose a tour for a vacation in Azerbaijan with the included transfer, meals and accommodation at a world-class hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theculturetrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Azerbaijan Beach" class="if uuid-2728226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2728226.jpg"></div><p>  There are many beautiful beaches where vacationers can rent sun loungers and umbrellas.  Extreme lovers are invited to go to one of the wild beaches and relax in private with nature away from a large concentration of tourists. </p><p>  The beach closest to the capital is Shikhovo.  There are fairly low prices for services, however, the water in the sea is not very clean.  In addition, after swimming in the sea on Shikhov Beach, cases of poisoning are not uncommon, so tourists are advised to spend a little more time on the road, but to relax in a better place. </p><p>  Novkhany is a beach 5 km long.  Restaurants and cafes are located along the entire coastline.  You can also book a table on the beach for a fee.  Entrance to the beach is paid and is 5 manat - about 200 Russian rubles.  The water here is of medium purity, there are always a lot of vacationers.  The beach is well suited for families with children. </p><p>  Favorite, both among tourists and among local residents, is a resort and entertainment center in the village of Bilgia.  The crystal clear sea of ‚Äã‚Äãazure color, clean well-groomed beaches and developed infrastructure make this beach the best in Azerbaijan. </p><p>  Mardakan beaches are ideal for families with children.  The water here is clean, the entrance to the sea is gentle.  The only drawback is the large number of vacationers. </p><p>  The beaches near the village of Zagulba are very popular among vacationers.  The sea is rocky, the entrance to the water is rocky.  The water here is very clear and clean and ideal for snorkeling. </p><p>  Those who are in search of a secluded bathing beach should definitely visit Turkan Beach.  During swimming, one should be very careful, since officially this place is considered unsuitable for beach holidays and is not guarded by the Ministry of Emergencies and rescuers.  The great advantage of this place is the lack of people and the possibility of unity with nature. </p><h2>  Azerbaijani cuisine </h2><p>  Who did not dream to try real pilaf, dolma, hash, bozbash, kebab?  Rest in Azerbaijan, according to tourists, is impossible without excellent food.  The national cuisine of Azerbaijan is one of the richest, most colorful and interesting.  Dishes prepared with local products on special traditional open and closed hearths will be appreciated even by gourmets. </p><h2>  Reviews of tourists about Azerbaijan and the subtleties of tourism </h2><p>  Before traveling to another country, you must definitely know the opinion of those who have already been there.  After examining the reviews of tourism in Azerbaijan, we can conclude that the beaches here are beautiful and clean.  Resting with children is very comfortable and safe.  Rescue teams work on the beaches, buoys are installed in the sea, the entrance to the sea is gentle, the depth of the sea is gradually increasing.  Tourism in Azerbaijan is very interesting and informative.  During the excursions you can learn a lot of interesting things about the culture of the Ancient East. </p><p>  Traveling to Azerbaijan will open for you a new, unknown world.  Many tourists admit that they did not expect the rest to be held at such a high level.  In addition, the lack of a language barrier makes tourism in Azerbaijan very comfortable for Russians. </p>
