But the tourist is not the only beach alive.  I also want to see something.  The sea, no matter how beautiful, does not provide food for the mind.  And on the fifth day of vacation for many curious tourists, the thought begins to spin in my head: should I go somewhere on an excursion?  What sights of the Caucasus (except Kazbek and Elbrus) are in the region? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of the Caucasus" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1221240.jpg" width="600"></div>  The travel agency of Sochi and other seaside resorts offer a wide range of excursions.  There are trips for several hours and even for a couple of days.  In this article we will show you where you can go on your own.  Or sign up for the appropriate tour.  And what do the reviews of tourists say about the sights of the Caucasus that everyone is hearing about?  Is their popularity justified or is all this PR?  Let's get it right.

    <h2>  Vorontsov caves </h2><p>  This attraction is located very close to Sochi, and therefore has long been mastered by local guides.  Each travel agency in the resort is gaining a group to hike through the <span>Vorontsov caves.</span>  A sightseeing bus is the fastest and surest way to get to the Prometheus grotto - the main entrance to the intricate labyrinth, stretching underground for more than eleven kilometers.  But then you have to pay 350 rubles for an adult and 150 for a child.  This Caucasian attraction can be reached independently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vorontsov caves" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1221251.jpg" width="600"></div>  Vorontsov caves are located in the Khostinsky district, and a regular bus goes to the village.  But then you will need to walk 7 km to the grotto.  All tourists are impressed by the beauty and grandeur of the mysterious underworld.  True, the tourist route covers only a small, four hundred meters, piece of these long caves.  Tourists visit the Music Hall.  Caves reflect the history of the Earth.  Their walls are composed of sedimentary deposits of the ancient Tethys Ocean.  At the dawn of mankind, in the grottoes were the sites of primitive tribes.  Tourists advise to take sweaters on an excursion, since under the ground all year round there is one temperature - only +12 <sup>o</sup> C.

But the Caucasus region is large, and each of its parts has its own sights.  If you chose the health resorts of Pyatigorsk as a vacation spot, you can go to <span>Lake Tambukan.</span>  This, according to reviews, is a mystical place.  Its name in translation from Kabardian means "the shelter of Tambia" (the ancient ancestor was buried near the lake).  This pond is closed and salty.  Scientists are still arguing about the origin of the lake.  They say that it is the remnant of the ancient ocean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tambucan lake" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1221379.jpg" width="600"></div>  Like it or not, but <span>Lake Tambukan</span> makes an indelible impression on tourists.  Even in sunny, clear and calm weather, it looks gloomy and dark.  At the bottom of a perfectly oval water body, tons of healing mud lie.  It is from Tambukan that all the health resorts of Pyatigorsk draw a healing brine.

    <h2>  Ancient temples of Karachay-Cherkessia </h2><p>  In addition to the amazing <span>nature, the Caucasus</span> is famous for its man-made sights.  After all, this region has long been inhabited by people.  Many reviews suggest visiting the region‚Äôs ancient churches.  Sentinsky Temple is located in the village of Lower Tiberda, which is 18 km from the city of Karachayevsk.  The church was built at the beginning of the X century on a spur of a mountain range near the river.  The frescoes of the eleventh century are still visible on the walls of the temple.  Nearby is a stone mausoleum of the same era, intended for the burial of the clergy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sentin Temple" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1221265.jpg" width="600"></div>  In the immediate vicinity is the Orthodox Transfiguration of the Savior Monastery, which has neither historical nor cultural value.  But what else to visit in Karachay-Cherkessia is the <span>Shoanin temple.</span>  It was built in the same era and in a similar architectural style as the Church of Sentin.  The temple is located seven kilometers from Karachayevsk.

They can be both foot and bus.  The most popular tourist route is from Kislovodsk to Dombay.  In one trip you can see both historical and natural sights of the Caucasus.  The route passes through the Sentin Church described above.  This temple is one of the five oldest in the territory of the Russian Federation.  Not far from the Teberda - Dombay highway, the river Shumka crosses the road.  Its name is very apt.  A small influx of Teberda boils like boiling water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shumka waterfall" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1221371.jpg" width="600"></div>  The route of the hike approaches the place from where the river, foaming like champagne, falls from a height of twelve meters.  Shumka waterfall is especially beautiful in spring and early summer, at the time of melting snowfields.

    <h2>  Dargav necropolis </h2><p>  Some sights of the Caucasus can be visited only by people with strong nerves.  Not far from the village of Dargavs (North Ossetia) is located the real "City of the Dead."  It has about a hundred semi-underground and towering crypts, which date back to the 9th-18th centuries.  These family tombs are very interesting.  They reflect the life of the ancient Ossetians - after all, the dead were buried in full vestment and, moreover, they placed many household items in the grave. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of the Caucasus" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1221373.jpg" width="600"></div>  Despite the fact that there is no sea near, the coffin was made in the shape of a boat.  Legends tell that during the Great Plague (1347), infected families came here to die in order not to infect their neighbors.  Due to the special microclimate, the bodies did not rot, but mummified.  This can be seen firsthand by paying an entrance ticket of one hundred rubles.  The necropolis is under the protection of UNESCO.  You can get to it yourself by regular bus "Vladikavkaz - Dzhimar".

    <h2>  Dzheirakhsky gorge </h2><p>  It is located in Ingushetia.  This gorge combines the natural and cultural attractions of the Caucasus.  Here are the ancient settlements of Targim, Hamhi, Egikal, an ancient seventh-century Christian church of Thaba-Erdy, castles of Vovnushki and Erzi.  All these interesting places and natural beauties are found in the Jeyrai-Assinsky Museum-Reserve.  It is almost the largest in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="natural attractions of the Caucasus" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1221374.jpg" width="600"></div>  In order not to get lost, reviews are advised to hire a guide.

    <h2>  Barkhan Sarykum </h2><p>  The sights of the Caucasus sometimes not only delight, but also surprise.  Isn't it interesting to meet such a desert formation near snow-capped mountains?  Sarykum is an isolated dune.  In addition, it is the largest in Europe.  Its area is three times the state of Monaco, and its height reaches 260 meters (approximately like a fifty-story skyscraper).  Dune consists of very fine golden sand.  On a summer day, it heats up to +60 ¬∞ C.  Scientists are at a loss where the mountain of sand came from in the Caucasus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="natural attractions of the Caucasus" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1221375.jpg" width="600"></div>  This natural wonder is located in Dagestan, not far from the Kumtorkalinsky ridge and in the immediate vicinity of the village of Korkmaskaly.  Regular buses go from Makhachkala to this aul.
