  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Flexible neon cord: description and application</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern lighting technology does not stand still and is constantly evolving.  The view improves, dimensions are reduced and energy costs for the supply of these devices are reduced.  Gradually, old incandescent bulbs go aside, making way for new energy-saving ones, and inert gases have also become widely used in illuminating signs and advertisements.  One of such modern devices is a neon cord used for lighting.  Below we consider the features of its use. </p><h2>  <span>What is a neon</span> cord? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.myxlshop.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="neon cord" class="if uuid-2922445" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99756/2922445.jpg"></div><p>  It is a wire filled with an inert gas - neon.  <span>Cold neon</span> has physical properties similar to a conventional electric cable.  Such a flexible neon cord consumes less electricity and is powered by a 12 V network or by batteries compiled into a battery whose total voltage is 12 V. The neon wire is waterproof and electrically safe during operation.  Light is emitted from the cord through 360 ¬∞ along the entire length.  For example, LED strips illuminate only 120 ¬∞ and point from each LED. </p><h2>  Device and principle of operation </h2><p>  The flexible neon cord at 12 volts has a simple design and a principle of action that is not complicated for an ordinary person to understand.  The wire construction consists of a copper core coated with a phosphor with a neon compound.  A thin copper spiral is wound over the phosphor.  When electric current passes through a copper core and a spiral wound around a phosphor, a magnetic field is created.  It emits a glow.  This phenomenon is called electroluminescence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A transparent sheath is applied over the copper wire and phosphor to impart a color gamut.  Depending on personal wishes, it is painted in various colors.  Moreover, the highest brightness is released with a white cold glow. </p><p>  The first generations of neon lights were not widely used due to the low brightness.  But thanks to modern developments, it was possible to achieve the greatest light emission when using less energy. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.shine-decor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="neon cord at work" class="if uuid-2922447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99756/2922447.jpg"></div><p>  A neon cord has several advantages over other light sources: </p><ul><li>  Low power consumption.  It consumes 10-15 watts per meter of length.  The amount of electricity consumed depends on the thickness of the copper core. </li><li>  Increased resistance to moisture and water due to polyvinyl chloride insulation.  This property allows you to use the cord both inside the equipment and outside, with street lighting. </li><li>  A large assortment of various lengths, and it is also possible to cut and connect the cord, depending on the design decisions. </li><li>  During operation, the wire does not heat up, which makes it safe for use.  It is also characterized by increased flexibility, which allows you to install the wire according to the conditions of use.  A glow of 360 ¬∞ around the wire, unlike other light sources. </li><li>  Different color palette.  Up to 10 shades are noted on the market. </li><li>  The possibility of manufacturing a rigid structure, depending on operating conditions. </li></ul><h2>  Application </h2><div class="photo" data-original="automolighting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="neon lighting application" class="if uuid-2922449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99756/2922449.jpg"></div><p>  Flexible neon cord is used in car tuning.  Used for decoration inside the car and outside.  The cord is also used for dyeing clothes.  Such things are used in spectacular dance numbers.  Ideal for decorating bicycle and motor vehicles, where it does not require special complexity and additional power sources.  Also, the cord has found application in illuminating the direction, illuminating road signs at night. </p><p>  Worth mentioning is the design application.  With the help of a neon cord, it became possible to realize the most daring and creative solutions.  For example, it is possible to display windows and advertising signs without large energy and financial costs. </p>
