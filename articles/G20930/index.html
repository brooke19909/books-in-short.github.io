Some believe that this will negatively affect the battery of the device, and it will fail more quickly.  Is this true or myth? </p><div class="photo" data-original="pocketnow.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://pocketnow.com/charge-ipad-mini-faster"><img itemprop="image" alt="adapter &amp; quot; iPad &amp; quot;" class="if uuid-3133705" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3133705.jpg"></div><h2>  How to use the battery </h2><p>  There are some simple battery rules that you should follow. </p><ol><li>  The tablet‚Äôs battery doesn‚Äôt like temperatures that are too high or too low.  The most comfortable temperature is not lower than zero and not higher than thirty degrees. </li><li>  When the tablet is fully charged, use it; do not let it stand idle for too long. </li><li>  At least sometimes let the tablet completely discharge before turning it off, then charge it in the off mode. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="zen.yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="charge indicator" class="if uuid-3133708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3133708.jpg"></div><h2>  How to charge a tablet </h2><p>  The device can be charged both through the network and through a computer by connecting a USB cable.  The charge process through the adapter takes several hours, the device connects to a 220 W outlet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It takes at least half a day to charge the tablet via USB from a PC, and the computer cannot be turned off.  The power at the USB port is insufficient.  But if you have nowhere to rush, then you can safely use this method. </p><p>  Experts advise charging the battery after it is completely discharged, especially with a newly-purchased device.  The brand new ‚ÄúiPad‚Äù must be charged from a complete shutdown at least three times. </p><p>  But can I use the tablet while charging the battery?  If the gadget has a lithium-ion battery, then it is not recommended to overload it, but it is advisable to charge it in the off mode.  A device with a built-in lead-acid battery can safely be used during charging. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sofloirepair.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what does the tablet battery look like" class="if uuid-3133710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3133710.jpg"></div><p>  Regardless of whether the use of the device while charging is detrimental to the battery or not, the tablet will heat up more, because it is subjected to excessive load.  Therefore, the question of whether it is possible to use the tablet while charging from the network, the answer is rather positive than negative, but still do not get involved in games and watching a movie, it is better to wait until the device is fully ready for use. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Using charging is not from the original kit </h2><p>  It happens that the adapter that came with the tablet broke.  Then there is a need to buy a new one.  If you use a third-party adapter, you must remember that its power must be the same as that of the complete one, otherwise there is a risk of damage to the battery.  It‚Äôs better for users of expensive Apple tablets to purchase genuine accessories. </p><p>  Chinese charges are much cheaper, but if you value your equipment, it is better not to save.  Can I use the tablet while charging the Samsung battery?  The tablets from the South Korean manufacturer, like all flagship devices, have a power controller.  It lowers the current strength at those moments when the required temperature was too high.  In addition, the power supply is automatically turned off when the tablet is fully charged. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mobilefun.co.uk" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.mobilefun.co.uk/olixar-high-power-samsung-galaxy-tab-s2-charger-mains-62253"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet &amp; quot; Samsung &amp; quot;" class="if uuid-3133709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3133709.jpg"></div><h2>  How to avoid excessive heating of the battery, if you need to use the tablet when it is charging </h2><p>  Those who just recently became the owner of the tablet often doubt whether it is possible to use the tablet while charging, because the battery can overheat, and then the gadget will fail.  Fortunately, if you follow simple rules, then using the tablet while it is connected to a power source will be absolutely safe for the device.  Do not open several programs at once.  Launched applications slow down the gadget, especially during the charging process.  Experts recommend abstaining from games for a while until the tablet is fully charged.  Bulky graphic toys require maximum power, which leads to overheating of the battery.  When the gadget is charging, do not load it by downloading various information from the network.  These actions will also slow down the processor, and the tablet will not only heat up, but will also freeze at the time of recharging.  In other cases, use the gadget without restrictions.  And to make the tablet charge faster, you can reduce the screen brightness in the settings. </p><h2>  Powerbank tablet charge </h2><p>  Many are interested in the question of whether it is possible to use the tablet while charging from an external battery.  This accessory is used to replenish the battery capacity when it is not possible to charge the gadget from the outlet.  The capacity of the external battery varies between 7000-10000 mAh.  Today, almost everyone has a Power Bank.  The external battery is easy to use, all that is needed is a connecting cord.  The charge of this unit is enough to fully replenish the energy of the tablet. </p><p>  Using the gadget while charging from Power Bank is allowed without restrictions.  Less current is supplied from the external battery than when charging from the mains, therefore, the gadget will not heat up and hang, but the charge time will increase slightly.  To make the tablet charge faster, decrease the brightness of the display and turn off programs that are not in use. </p><p>  If you completely turn off the gadget, it will make up energy even faster.  Now you should have no doubt about whether you can use the tablet when charging the battery from Power Bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rombica.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="external battery" class="if uuid-3133704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3133704.jpg"></div><h2>  The most popular charging myths </h2><p>  Gadgets are constantly being improved, this applies not only to their appearance, but also to the filling.  However, the batteries practically do not change. </p><p>  But much depends on the battery and how the device owner handles it. </p><p>  This has given rise to many myths about whether the tablet can be used while charging.  Here are the most popular ones. </p><ol><li>  Power Bank harms the battery and reduces its useful life.  When choosing an external battery, you should give preference to quality brands and beware of cheap ones.  One of the well-known news portals tested an expensive powerbank and its budget counterpart.  The results of the experiment did not surprise: the flagship battery copes with the task ‚Äúperfectly‚Äù, but the state employee can fail at any time. </li><li>  Neither the tablet nor the phone can be used while charging.  This is the most common misconception.  If you use the original adapter from the kit, you can use the device whenever you want.  It just takes longer to charge.  Earlier, the owners of the iPad have already noticed that when using a gadget connected to electricity, charging stops.  But in the latest models, this problem has been fixed.  There were also emergency situations when the device exploded in the hands of the owner during charging.  Such cases occur only when the adapter is defective or does not fit the gadget in terms of power. </li><li>  The tablet can not be turned off at all.  Even the most expensive and high-quality gadgets need a short break.  Experts recommend at least occasionally turning off the tablet for several hours, at least while the user is sleeping.  This will help extend battery life. </li></ol><h2>  Do I have to wait until the battery runs out? </h2><p>  Some believe that you should not charge the tablet until it is cut down.  The ideal option is to periodically recharge the tablet, rather than allowing it to turn off.  Full discharge is recommended only for a new device.  Lithium-ion batteries, which are used in the Samsung and Apple tablets, feel much better in the ‚Äúrecharge‚Äù state than in the state of complete emptying. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.wikihow.com/Charge-an-iPad-Without-a-Charging-Block"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet charge from USB" class="if uuid-3133714" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3133714.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know if you can use the tablet while charging.  Trust only high-quality adapters and branded powerbanks. </p>
