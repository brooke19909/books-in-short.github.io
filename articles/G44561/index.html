    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  As mentioned above, Annabelle Beach Resort 5 * is located in Hersonissos.  This city, in turn, occupies an extremely successful place on the island, which largely explains its popularity.  Firstly, only 25 kilometers separates it from the island's capital - Heraklion.  Secondly, it is washed by the waters of two seas - the Aegean and the Mediterranean. </p><p>  The Nikos Kazantzakis Airport (in Heraklion) is a 15-20 minute drive from the hotel.  Sitia Public Airport (in Lasithi) is approximately an hour away. </p><p>  It is also important that the hotel complex is located just 300 meters from the beach.  And on foot you can walk to such interesting sights as the Lychnostatis Folk Museum and the Aquaworld Aquarium. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Annabelle Beach Resort 5 * (Greece) is a hotel with excellent infrastructure.  On the territory of this complex there is everything that guests can need - from free private parking to high-speed Wi-Fi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A 24-hour reception welcomes guests in the lobby, where you can also find a left-luggage office for things and luggage, as well as a currency exchange office.  You can contact the administrator for any questions or to order a specific service - to call a taxi or a personal nanny for the child in your room, for example, which is possible here. </p><p>  The hotel has everything that every good hotel has at its disposal - dry cleaning and laundry, a business center, a conference room, several shops and a mini market, car rental, a souvenir shop.  Needless to say, even a small church is available on the territory of Annabelle Beach Resort 5 * (Greece, Crete). </p><p>  What about the staff?  Real hotel professionals work at this hotel, and first of all this fact is confirmed by their knowledge of foreign languages.  The staff here speaks Italian, English, German and Greek.  Even though this language is not in our list, people who have been here assure us that many hotel staff are also able to communicate in Russian.  It is not surprising, since a considerable part of the guests staying at this hotel are guests from Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Restaurants </h2><p>  In Annabelle Beach Resort 5 * (Crete), the service is conducted on an all-inclusive basis.  The main restaurant is called Ambrosia, and its windows offer magnificent panoramic views of the surroundings. </p><p>  An American breakfast is served from 7:15 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. - a variety of dishes is presented at the buffet for guests, among which everyone will find something that suits his taste.

There are also gala dinners and days of Cretan cuisine.  And in the midst of the bathing season, evenings are held with the Danish buffet. </p><p>  It is worth mentioning that in the evening non-alcoholic cocktails, fruit juices, local draft beer, mineral water and tea are free of charge. </p><p>  In addition to this institution, on the territory of the Annabelle Beach Resort 5 * hotel there is also an Athena tavern.

    <h2>  Bars </h2><p>  Of course, institutions of this type are also available in Annabelle Beach Resort 5 * (Crete).  The main bar is called Bacchus, and it is open from 18:00 to 01:00.  If you are interested in a wide selection of drinks and a variety of cocktails - you should go there.  There is also the Pelagos <span>beach bar</span> , open from 10:00 to 01:00 and Poseidon, located in the pool. </p><p>  The range in all establishments is decent.  There are soft drinks and strong drinks (both local and imported), smoothies, premium alcohol, ouzo, brandy, brandy, gin, whiskey, tequila, vodka, liquors, rum and a special wine list. </p><p>  I would like to note that in all interior rooms there is a dress code.  And this concerns, by the way, not only bars and restaurants, but also the rest of the hotel space (corridors, foyer, halls, etc.). </p><h2>  Standard Bungalow </h2><p>  In Annabelle Beach Resort 5 * (Greece, Crete, Heraklion) only 262 rooms.  All of them belong to certain categories.  And I would like to start with the apartments, which are the most economical - and this is a standard bungalow with an area of ​​24 square meters.  m., designed for two adult guests. </p><p>  Guests who decide to stay in such a room are greeted by a cozy, bright room with a stylish interior and modern furnishings.  There are two beds inside - one king-size and the other standard.  In addition, there is a widescreen TV with satellite channels, a telephone, air conditioning, a dressing room, a refrigerator, a bathroom.  There are also such pleasant things as trash baskets, a hairdryer and free hygiene items (shampoos, gels, lotions, soap, etc.). </p><p>  How much does a weekly stay in such a bungalow cost?  In general, it depends on the season.  At the height of the season (in August) it will cost about 200,000 rubles.  This amount includes 13 percent VAT, city tax and all inclusive payment.  But a week in the same room can cost half as much (or even less) if you choose a different period for your vacation (October, for example) or book an apartment in advance.  Then it will save a considerable amount. </p>

    <h2>  VIP Suite </h2><p>  This, as you might guess from the name, is the most expensive option at Annabelle <span>Beach Resort Hotel</span> 5 *.  VIP suites are luxury apartments with an area of ​​50 square meters.  m </p><p>  Guests are offered a private terrace that goes directly to the pool with sun loungers and parasols.  The apartments themselves are distinguished by the presence of a jacuzzi and the presence of more space. </p><p>  The suite is designed for three adults.  The room area is conveniently divided into a bedroom with a king-size bed and a living room with a large folding sofa, so that no one will lack personal space.  In the fall, a week in these apartments will cost three guests about 150 tons.  At the height of the season - 1.5 times more expensive. </p><p>  I would also like to note that there are apartments of other categories in the Annabelle <span>Beach Resort Hotel 5 *</span> - Deluxe (open-plan bungalow), a villa for five people and family apartments for 2 adults and 2 children.  In terms of conditions, they are not much different from the previously mentioned option.  The difference is only in area, number of beds and cost of living. </p>

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Despite the rather high prices, Annabelle Beach Resort 5 * (Crete, Heraklion, Greece) is very popular among tourists.  Many of them leave reviews about the hotel, which allows you to find out if he is really as good as described in the description.  Apparently, yes, since there are no negative comments. </p><p>  Guests say this is a great hotel with well-kept green areas, delicious varied food, friendly staff and spacious rooms.  Fans of active pastime also note great animation.  The staff does not just carry out some kind of “fresh” program - they organize real colorful shows that will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><p>  Importantly, the complex has a huge number of awards as the best hotel in the opinion of European tourists.  Yes, the decor here is not made of gold, but the luxury of this hotel is manifested in a completely different way - in impeccable service. </p><h2>  Tourists on vacation </h2><p>  Continuing to study the 5 * reviews left about Annabelle Beach Resort, it is worth paying attention to what guests generally tell about their vacation spent here. </p><p>  In fact, many comments concern the beach.  It’s good, sandy and pebble, but entering the sea seems uncomfortable to some.  However, this is a small problem, since you can go a little further towards other hotels to find a more suitable place for yourself. </p><p>  Even in the reviews, many talk about the rooms.  Tourists who have been here recommend checking apartments near the chapel upon check-in.  It’s quietest there.  The most important thing is not to ask for apartments under the pool and near the sea.  And certainly not the facade of the summer theater, otherwise you have to listen to the animation program from start to finish. </p>

    <h2>  Who is the hotel suitable for? </h2><p>  Well, this hotel is an ideal option for people who dream of relaxing in a hotel with top-level service.  But families with small children are definitely not worth going here.  And also people with sore feet, since this hotel goes down the cascade to the sea - on the way you have to overcome many stairs with pretty high steps.  This is the only nuance worth knowing about.  Otherwise, this hotel fully lives up to expectations, and numerous positive reviews are the best confirmation of this. </p>
