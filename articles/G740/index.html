  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hotels located in Helsinki give peace.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Finland is a small state that attracts many tourists from all over the world.  The only million-plus city in Finland, considering satellite cities, is Helsinki.  This city is the capital of the state, but it is worth noting that Helsinki has little resemblance to the European capital, in the usual sense - everything is quite modest and differs in small size, as well as lack of bombast.  <strong>Hotels</strong> located in <strong>Helsinki</strong> also do not stand out with too high a level of chic; five-star hotels can be counted on the fingers.  <strong>Reviews of Helsinki hotels,</strong> as well as the city as a whole confirm that it is not luxury that attracts tourists to this place.  The small territory of the city contains many amazing architectural monuments, cultural and historical sights, the examination of which involves almost all <strong>tours to Helsinki</strong> . </p><p>  The history of Helsinki dates back to 1550, when the city was laid down by order of King Gustav Vas.  Almost half of the millennium that Helsinki exists has brought the city many trials.  The city passed from the hands of the Swedes, who captured Finland in the 12-13 centuries, to the Russians, who, in 1809, having won the Russian-Swedish war, included Finland in Russia.  Only since 1812 Finland became independent and gained its own capital - the city of Helsinki. </p><p>  <strong>Hotels</strong> built in <strong>Helsinki</strong> offer their guests to look from the windows of the rooms at the amazing city, which includes many attractions.  In the city center, especially in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSenate Square, the tourist offers an unforgettable view of the buildings in the neoclassical style, which is difficult to find elsewhere.  a trip to Helsinki must be accompanied by an inspection of buildings, at least 3, presented by the State Council, the Cathedral and the central building of the University.  These buildings are the real architectural pearls of Helsinki.  Many <strong>hotels</strong> located in <strong>Helsinki are</strong> focused on guests who appreciate the true beauty of the historical place.  Such guests will definitely like <span>Senate Square,</span> which is considered one of the most beautiful in the whole world.  The plan of this square was created by the legendary German architect Karl Ludwig Eingel.  Here you can see a monument to Emperor Alexander II, who made a significant contribution to the development and preservation of the culture of Finland.  It is highly recommended to visit the ancient buildings represented by the Cederholm House, the House of Estates, the State Art Museum Athenaeum, the Church in Kallio, as well as the Central Railway Station. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The capital of Finland</span> is a very green city, on its territory there are many parks, forests grow.  The main attraction for tourists from all over the world is the Barents Sea. </p><p>  Tours in Helsinki involve not only hotel accommodation and sightseeing.  The city is striking in its unique atmosphere, but it does not have the absence of modern infrastructure represented by excellent restaurants, cafes and bars, as well as nightclubs and discos - all this, of course, is in Helsinki and visits to such places will allow you to diversify your vacation. </p><p>  A visit to Helsinki - this calm and measured city, allows you to have a good rest from everyday hustle and bustle, plunge into history, enjoy architecture and beautiful sea views, forget about everything in the world and feel previously unattainable peace.  Such a vacation is perfect for the whole family, makes it possible to restore strength after hard months of work, to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beautiful.  Calling hotels in Helsinki and the reviews of guests visiting them fully confirm the above. </p><p>  Some hotels in Helsinki should be described in more detail. </p><p>  Hotel Hotel K√§mp, which recently entered the 400 best hotels, according to the authoritative publication Forbes Traveler, is the most famous hotel in Helsinki, Finland, and Scandinavia as a whole.  The recognition of Forbes Traveler suggests that every aspect of the work is perfectly organized in this hotel.  The hotel has a unique style of room decoration, and in general it is a wonderful decoration of the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãlandscape, which</span> has been pleasing residents and guests of Helsinki for 120 years. </p><p>  Hotel "Anna", located in the heart of Helsinki, is a 7-storey building, which provides everything for a comfortable stay.  This hotel has a rather long history, which suggests the presence of certain traditions.  The main feature of the hotel, attracting guests from all over the world, is an individual approach to each guest.  For example, the floors are divided according to the preferences of customers and their habits (for example, there is a non-smoking floor).  The 60 rooms of the hotel have everything for a good rest and comfortable stay. </p><p>  Especially cozy, but at the same time the Arthur Hotel is characterized by the most modern equipment.  In the design of interior design brought its own unique style.  A positive feature of this hotel is also its location in the immediate vicinity of the train station and all the main attractions.  Each room is comfortable and equipped with every necessary lodging item. </p>
