    <h2>  Forms and sizes of vacations </h2><p>  The current labor law provides each employee with the right to a guaranteed right to leave once a year.  In this case, the worker receives a certain amount of money (vacation pay).  Also in the indicated period of a person‚Äôs absence from work, his place of work and specialty remain unchanged.  Before answering the question of how vacation money is calculated, it is necessary to dwell on types of recreation.  The information is presented below. </p><p>  In total, there are five fundamental varieties of vacations: </p><ul><li>  relying once a year to each employee; </li><li>  vacation granted during study; </li><li>  "for family reasons"; </li><li>  maternity (provided to a woman in connection with her pregnancy and upcoming birth; for caring for a young child until he is three years old). </li></ul><h2>  Features of Standard Vacation </h2><p>  Each employee who is supposed to be granted annual leave is granted for the time actually worked, at least 11 months.  Its size is twenty eight calendar days.  The employee may be given the specified type of vacation, by agreement with the administration of the enterprise, and after 6 months of actual working out.  However, in this case, the principle of advance payment applies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Upon receipt of the initial higher education (in the correspondence form of study), an educational leave is granted in an institution that has the appropriate state accreditation.  It is given for the duration of the session, the period of which is reflected in the certificate of the university sent to the employer.  This type of vacation is also provided at the time of passing the final exams and protecting the student with a diploma. </p><p>  The third form of time, exempting from the performance of labor duties, is provided without accrual of vacation funds, at the expense of the employee, due to the presence of certain personal circumstances.  Its term can reach up to two weeks per year (subject to agreement with the employer). </p><h2>  Maternity leave </h2><p>  A woman who is preparing to become a mother is given a so-called ‚Äúmaternity‚Äù leave before the actual birth for a period of one hundred and forty days, provided that she provides the employer with a medical form of the established form.  In the event of the adoption of a baby who has not reached the age of three months, a similar vacation of seventy days is supposed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how are vacation money" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/1905910.jpg" width="600"></div>

The deadline for this form falls on the birthday of a child who has reached the age of 3 years. </p><p>  How vacation pay is calculated in all of the above cases will be described below. </p><h2>  General calculation procedure </h2><p>  As a general rule, when calculating vacation payable to an employee who is going on vacation, the principle of multiplying the total number of vacation days by the earnings of one working day is initially used.  To calculate the average cost of the latter, the following formula is used, in which the average earnings per working day is equal to income (wages + bonus payments + various types of surcharges, usually accrued to public sector employees) divided by: figure 12 (number of months in a year), by the figure 29.3 (statutory average coefficient). </p><p>  For example, the total employee income for the past year, equal to 800,000 rubles, is divided by 12 and 29.3.  As a result, we get the amount of 2275 rubles 31 kopecks.  This is the average cost of one working day.  After that, we multiply the indicated amount by the number of vacation days, let's say 24. As a result, we get 54607 rubles 50 kopecks.  This is the total amount of vacation funds. </p>

    <p>  It should be noted that the employee‚Äôs income does not include the so-called hospital money, as well as various types of compensation (travel, payment for cellular communications, medical procedures, material assistance).  The above example reveals the answer to the question of how vacation pay is calculated correctly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Schedules and terms of vacation pay </h2><p>  In general, all enterprises adhere to the established rules for sending their employees to rest, according to previously prepared vacation schedules.  At the same time, new employees can be temporarily relieved of labor duties, without their preparation, time is determined by agreement with the management.  Vacation is also possible in the initial working year, if this is expressly indicated in the contract for the hiring of an employee. </p><p>  Since vacation finance is subject to taxation, along with other payments, the accountant of the company needs some time to check all the documents, as well as calculate vacation pay, from which taxes should be withheld.  According to the law in force in our country, vacation pay must be paid to the employee 3 days before the start of the vacation.  Violation of this rule is fraught with high fines for the organization. </p>

    <h2>  Length of rest time </h2><p>  The term of the vacation period depends on the established full or part-time working regimes stipulated by the conditions reflected in the agreements between the employer and his employee, which directly depends on how the vacation days are calculated.  Based on the general current rule, mandatory annual leave is twenty-eight calendar days in a year, in which Saturday and Sunday are also taken into account. </p><p>  During the calculation of the time for rest, the time must be included in the period during which the employee performed his duties, as well as was absent from work while maintaining his place.  Also, in the indicated period, attendance at sessions, on business trips, on sick leave, on state duty, as well as in cases of suspension of the work cycle by decision of a special body, is taken into account due to violation by the administration of established rules protecting labor. </p>

    <p>  If the employee is dismissed illegally, and his subsequent restoration through the court at work, this period of absence also gives the right to be included in the vacation period.  Individual categories of workers are provided with individual minimum periods of time for rest.  So, for minors and employees of the state, as well as people on disabilities, they are thirty days, for workers in hazardous industries forty-nine, for teachers from forty-two to fifty-six days.  The above information exhaustively answers the question for what period vacation pay is calculated. </p><h2>  Cash payments upon dismissal </h2><p>  The specificity is distinguished by the payment of due finance to an employee leaving the company, in order to understand how the vacation pay is calculated, you should carefully read the information below. </p><p>  In the event of the dismissal of an employee who has not worked for one year, but who has already advanced on a full vacation, the number of unnecessarily provided days for rest is taken into account, which are taken into account when preparing the final calculation, and a certain amount is deducted from it.  Upon the dismissal of an employee who has worked for a full year, and who has not ‚Äútaken time off‚Äù at the same time, the laid-off vacation is, on the contrary, due to monetary compensation for unused days for legal rest.  The specified compensation in both cases is calculated identically as holiday pay (the average cost of one day is multiplied by the number of days). </p><h2>  How are vacation pay after maternity leave </h2><p>  It should be borne in mind that a woman who leaves the decree for work has all the rights to basic annual leave, regardless of how much she actually worked.  When calculating vacation pay <span>after maternity leave, the</span> average of her average income for the last year of her work is taken, from which the average cost of the day is calculated using the following formula. </p>

    <p>  Let's say the income is 500,000 rubles.  It is divided by the number of months in a year (12), as well as the average coefficient (29.3).  As a result, we come to the desired indicator: 500/12 / 29.3 = 1422 rubles.  We multiply this amount by the number of vacation days (28), receiving the amount of compensation due to the woman as vacation funds.  We consider this: 1422 x 28 = 39,816 rubles. </p>
