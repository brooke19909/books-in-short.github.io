    <h2>  Montenegro, Budva, Riviera </h2><p>  This country and this city will not leave anyone indifferent.  Everyone will find here something for themselves that sinks right into their hearts and will never forget it.  Budva is a place for those who are tired of the usual beach holiday.  It is very good for lovers of walks and antiquities.  After all, this city was founded back in the days of the Roman Empire and is one of the oldest on the entire local coast.  Romantic evenings can be spent on Quay street.  And if you want to have fun, you will find many clubs and discos between shops, parallel to the sea.  A lot of different attractions and entertainment for kids.  No wonder this place was called the <span>Budva Riviera.</span>  This resort on the Adriatic offers tourists beautiful sandy and pebble beaches, beautiful Mediterranean architecture that fits perfectly into the unique landscape.  Local hotels are both luxurious palaces and budget apartment villas offering good services and excellent accommodation.  Many of them have a category of "Deluxe", or starryness level "4".  Villa Grand Palazzo, which we describe in this article, is a typical budget hotel for tourists who come here to visit the city or a beach holiday, as well as a good starting point for traveling around the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Palazzo Montenegro" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/611610.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You can get to the Grand Palazzo Hotel from two airports at once - Podgorica and Tivat.  The first of them is sixty-five kilometers, the second - twenty-seven.  Through the city runs one of the busiest routes in the country - the Jadran tract, which mainly drives all vehicles.  This road goes straight to Greece.  Tourists who used the services of Russian tour operators mostly get by transfer.  The hotel is located in the New Town, where most of the hotels are located, so if you go by taxi from the airport, you will not be looking for this area for a long time.  There is a railway here too, but it connects Budva with Belgrade, since it was built back in the times of the former Yugoslavia.  From the airports, the Old Town bus station can also be reached by public transport, but from there you still have to take a taxi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro Grand Palazzo" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/611615.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The sea is a few hundred meters from the Grand Palazzo Cat Delux 4. This coast is called the Slovenska Plaza.  The beach is municipal and small.  It is sometimes pebbled, but often sandy.  Go to him for about fifteen minutes.  A little further is the coast called Mogren.  Before it you need to go through the old city.  It is larger, and refers specifically to those beaches that Montenegro is famous for.  Grand Palazzo 4 also has a small rooftop pool.  Near it are free umbrellas and sun loungers.  From there, a beautiful panorama of ancient Budva opens.  Clean it every day.  Those who wish can take a boat to the island of St. Nicholas - there is sparsely populated and amazingly clear water.  Locals call this beach ‚ÄúHawaii‚Äù.  However, you will have to purchase special shoes.  This beach can have large pebbles and a not very convenient entrance to the water.  Many vacationers go and go from here to such famous beaches as Becici, Rafailovici and <span>St. Stephen.</span>  The banks of Milocer are also good, where Serbian kings used to relax.  The sea here is clean, gentle, warm, no algae and jellyfish. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand palazzo cat delux 4" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/611630.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Villa Grand Palazzo 4 is so conveniently located that literally all the <span>sights of Budva</span> can be reached on foot.  It is very pleasant to walk around this city with ancient tiled houses, and if you are not too lazy and climb onto the upper terraces, amazing landscapes open up at every turn.  In the evening, you can stroll along the Embankment Street.  But if you want to see the country, then tourists recommend a sightseeing tour called ‚ÄúFive Canyons‚Äù.  Having acquired it, you can go to the mountains, to the Durmitor National Park, to the <span>Black Lake,</span> visit <span>the Dzhurdzhevich Bridge</span> and <span>the Moraca Monastery.</span>  A special trip is also organized to the capital of Cetinje, as well as to the temples of Ostrog and Podgorica.  You will see ancient and modern churches and monasteries, as well as rise and descend along the famous Montenegrin serpentines at such a height that your heart will freeze.  And lovers of swimming on the sea are recommended a trip to the <span>Bay of Kotor.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Villa grand palazzo" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/611631.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Grand Palazzo (Montenegro) - prices </h2><p>  Tours to this hotel will cost, depending on the category of the room, from four hundred and fifty in five days to five hundred or more euros per room per week.  This includes flights and breakfasts.  In general, your spending in Montenegro and in the Budva Riviera will not be very high.  In some cafes you can eat for four euros (this includes huge portions of salad, soup and a second dish, so you can take this complex for two).  On a paid section of the beach, prices depend on proximity to the sea.  On the first line for two sun loungers and an umbrella they ask ten euros, on the second - eight.  In restaurants, wine and lemonade at the same price.  To take a taxi from Budva to Tivat, you need to pay fifteen euros. </p><h2>  Grand Palazzo (Montenegro) - Reviews </h2><p>  This villa deserves its category.  She is very nice, clean and comfortable.  The service in it is ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù, because the country of Montenegro itself is cordial, interesting and diverse.  There is almost no language barrier here.  Rest at the hotel for most tourists makes an indelible impression, despite the fact that this is not a "five-star" palace.  The hotel is brand new, its owner, according to reviews, a wonderful person.  Deliciously fed, politely talking, all popularly explained.  The hotel, of course, is not on the first line, but tourists find it very pleasant, because it has everything you need for a good vacation.  In their reviews, they thank the friendly hosts and dream of meeting with them again. </p>
