    <h2>  Playa del carmen </h2><p>  Once it was the most common Mexican fishing village 70 kilometers from Cancun.  Now she was chosen by lovers of the sun and the sea.  And all thanks to the white, similar to flour, not only in color, but also in the structure of the sand.  No wonder the ClubHotel Riu Tequila 5 * (Mexico, Playa del Carmen) is visited by tourists eager for a beach holiday, as well as fans of beautiful nature, national parks and clear water.  This resort is located in the middle of the famous coastal strip of the Riviera Maya.  Its main street is the so-called Fifth Avenue, where all kinds of shops and souvenir shops are located, as well as restaurants, clubs and bars.  And near the pier there is another favorite place for tourists - Plaza Mayor.  There you can see the Indian ritual dance, which in ancient times appealed to the fertility gods.  It is performed on a high pillar.  But keep in mind that alcohol cannot be drunk on the street here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  ClubHotel Riu Tequila 5 * hotel is located eight hundred meters from the beach.

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Organized sightseeing trips from ClubHotel Riu Tequila 5 * in Mexico are very expensive, around $ 130 per person.  And the difference between excursions from tour operators or local street bureaus is not too big.  But if you decide to explore the surroundings, it is best to start with boat trips to the local lagoons and bays.  This tour lasts seven to eight hours and includes lunch.  And you can choose an evening cruise to Cancun and to the island of Mujeres, where you will find a night disco.  Not far from Playa are the mysterious Mayan cities - Chichen Itza and Tulum - with their temples, bas-reliefs and step pyramids.  A trip to Shkaret National Park, where you can swim with dolphins, travel along the underground river and explore the amazing caves where butterflies live, will leave you an unforgettable experience. </p><h2>  ClubHotel Riu Tequila 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists claim that of all five Riu hotels that are located almost in the same place, it is Tequila that definitely wins in terms of price-quality ratio, although it is not on the first line.  No wonder many sincerely called him a "Caribbean fairy tale."  Tourists are not annoyed by the fact that you have to go to the sea for 7-10 minutes.  The road is beautiful, almost all in the shade, along the way there are various cute little animals, amazing trees, bright butterflies and flowers.  The staff - from bartenders to janitors - is very positive, friendly, does everything with a smile, tries for hotel guests.  Everything here is done so that tourists feel like they are on a real vacation.  The choice of food is so huge that even in two weeks you will not have time to try everything.  However, you need to be careful with the local sun - often even protective cream + 50 often does not help. And the beach is one of the best in this area - it is not for nothing that newlyweds constantly come here to do photo shoots.  Yes, the Riu Tequila 5 * hotel (Mexico, Playa del Carmen) does not have a very rich nightlife, it's not Cancun, but nature and the sea are simply divine. </p>
