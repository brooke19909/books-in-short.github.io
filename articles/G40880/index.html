Or maybe even against Benoni?  Then you should read this article.  It tells about the main options in defense, strong chess players playing this option, a list of books and resources on Modern Benoni is presented.  We hope the article will reveal in you a desire to comprehend this debut, to understand its structure and mechanism. </p><h2>  Option History </h2><p>  Benoni’s defense or, as it is also called, “Indian defense” was first mentioned in A. Reinganum’s book “Ben-Oni, or Defense against Gambit Chess Movements” in 1825, but only in the late 50s of the XX century this scheme was able interest a wide range of chess players.  At that time, the element of sport sharply increased in chess.  The principle of equation on the agenda was replaced by the question of an aggressive answer for Black against move 1. d4.  Huge efforts in the development of the option were invested by Soviet chess players, especially ex-world champion M. Tal. </p><h2>  Benoni Chess Defense </h2><p>  First moves: </p><p>  1.d4-kf6. </p><p>  2.c4-c5. </p><p>  3.d5-e6. </p><p>  4. kc3-ed. </p><p>  5.cd-d6. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author="" data-source=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Benoni defense" class="if uuid-3092632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123386/3092632.jpg"></div><p>  Benoni's defense is a half-closed debut.  The asymmetry of the pawn structure determines the sharp nature of the struggle, which makes the course of the game exciting and exciting.  Black’s main idea is to make the b7-b5 liberation breakthrough, while for White it is to prove that the advantage in the center is more important than flanking prospects, they attack in the center with e4-e5. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But, of course, there are no rules without exceptions.  There are options in which Black needs to attack the enemy king thanks to moves like f7-f5 and even g6-g5, while White at this moment tries to open line b with an attack on the queenside. </p><p>  When choosing Benoni's defense for Black, it is worth considering that the preference for a specific game scheme is provided by White.  In preparation, they can be limited to one option, while the opponent must be fully armed. </p><h2>  Protection for white </h2><p>  First, note the advantages of white in the position after the first five moves: </p><ol><li>  Possessing an advantage in space, allowing you to create difficulties in the harmonious development of black pieces. </li><li>  Weakness of the enemy pawn d6. </li><li>  The pawn advantage in the center and, therefore, the possibility of the offensive by this center, i.e.  pawn mass </li></ol><p>  There are a huge number of schemes against Benoni’s defense for White: active (aimed at the attack) and passive (positional play). </p><p>  Here are some examples. </p><h2>  Indian Defense Options </h2><p>  For aggressive players who love risk and have the instinct of murderers in the blood, the "Pawn Assault System" is suitable.  The position is obtained after: </p><p>  1.d4-kf6. </p><p>  2.c4-c5. </p><p>  3.d5-e6. </p><p>  4.cc3-ed. </p><p>  5.cd-d6. </p><p>  6.e4-g6. </p><p>  7.f4-cg7. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author="" data-source=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Benoni defense" class="if uuid-3092680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123386/3092680.jpg"></div><p>  In the shown variant, White immediately begins to put forward his main trump card - the center.  But far advanced pawns can turn out to be not only strength, but also weakness.  There are many nuances in theory, but if Black does not know the correct sequence of moves, he can quickly get a rather unpleasant (and, possibly, lost) position.  In many cases, the black king voluntarily remains without castling, but white still has to prove the correctness of the "commandments of the right development", which makes the game more exciting for both sides. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For less active and more cunning players, Pirouette Nimzowicz is suitable, the main goal of which is to bring all the forces into the defenseless d6-pawn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author="" data-source=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Benoni defense" class="if uuid-3092685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123386/3092685.jpg"></div><p>  So, let’s follow the course of history after five memorized moves: </p><p>  6. kf3-g6. </p><p>  7.kd2. </p><p>  The idea of ​​the last move is frank: get the knight on c4, and then go down the bishop on f4.  Black will not stand still, but to be honest: defending a weak pawn is very unpleasant.  There is almost no counterplay, and it’s rather boring to “bathe” on the seventh-eighth rows.  Therefore, we advise Black to consider the option of sacrificing a weak pawn for the initiative when studying.  So what?  No pawn, no problem. </p><p>  Of course, there are still a huge number of very different options: “Semu-Zemish,” whose idea was taken from the Old Indian defense, the system with early cg5, the “Fianchetto” scheme.  In our opinion, the most fundamental versions for white were considered in the article.  When choosing the provided plans, we took into account the relevance of the variation and the nuisance of choosing answers for blacks. </p><h2>  Defense for black </h2><p>  After watching the article, have you already lost the desire to play Benoni’s construction for blacks?  But do not be afraid, many chess players who have reached heights have been able to prove the correctness of the Indian defense.  And even more so, if you know your weaknesses, then it becomes much easier to eliminate them. </p><p>  We saw the minuses of Black’s position, now consider the pros: </p><ol><li>  The fianchette elephant g7, i.e.  elephant located on a large diagonal. </li><li>  Possibility of attack on the queenside. </li><li>  Half-open line pressure e. </li></ol><p>  As we have already noted, if for a well-played game White needs only to know at least one option well, then Black is much more complicated.  Blacks in defense Modern Benoni, as the owners of the house, white - guests who came for a short meeting.  In order to show good results and statistics in this debut, you need to work hard: study the theory that builds over the years, keep track of new products, "collect" the ideas, plans and ideas of the boomer players, both for your color and the color of your opponent, try ourselves to analyze frequently occurring positions and invent new items in old sequels.  Yes, it’s difficult, but chess is an intellectual sport, so to speak, a “survival game” in which the strongest wins. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chess.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Boy playing chess" class="if uuid-3092737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123386/3092737.jpg"></div><h2>  Strong chess players playing Indian Defense </h2><p>  The most sensible study of any debut is to watch the parties of Great Minds.  And if the game is commented on, mistakes are immediately remembered, you better understand the main tasks assigned to the players.  It is very nice to watch the competitions of players with a similar nature of the game.  This is how to find a favorite writer: you know right away - you will like his work and will be useful in studying. </p><ul><li>  Grandmaster Psakhis Lev Borisovich. </li></ul><p>  Israeli and Soviet chess player, grandmaster.  His parts at an early age in the debut we examined are quite instructive and interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="visualrian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grandmaster Psahis" class="if uuid-3092770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123386/3092770.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Vugar Gashimov. </li></ul><p>  The Azerbaijani grandmaster, who became famous among a wide circle of chess players under the nickname "Mr. Modern-Benoni".  His parties are striking in their beauty, abundance and variety of ideas.  His vast experience in positions of this type is worthy of respect. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xsport.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grandmaster Hashimov" class="if uuid-3092795" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123386/3092795.jpg"></div><h2>  Books for the Defense of Benoni </h2><ul><li>  First author - Dreev A.S.  - An experienced grandmaster, his analyzes are accurate and, of course, interesting and useful for study.  In the book “Play against the defense of Benoni” about three hundred pages!  And the main idea of ​​the author is to teach the reader to resist the Indian Defense.  Well, isn't it nice? </li><li>  "Indian Defense" written by A.Z.  Capengut in 1984, but the relevance of the book is still strong.  You should not expect an easy reading from this “work of art”, and it is suitable for more mature chess players.  For beginners, the book is complicated: there is almost no text, some solid options, it’s easy to get confused.  But if you have definitely decided to play Modern Benoni as black, you should at least have this book. </li><li>  "Benoni's Defense" from P.E.  Kondratiev.  The same commentary can be given as for the work of Capengut.  The book is a collection of theory, useful for both black and white. </li></ul>
