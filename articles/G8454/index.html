Focused on beginners who do not want to sacrifice their appearance, the camera costs about $ 130 and is available in black, blue, silver pink and red. </p><h2>  Canon IXUS 155: specifications </h2><p>  Perhaps Canon knew what it was doing when it decided to give IXUS cameras the exact same look.  This causes additional difficulties when searching for the camera, because if the user wants to improve additional functions, it will be difficult to choose from the same series if you do not like the appearance of the device. </p><p>  But if outwardly the camera is indistinguishable from all previous IXUS models, the 155th has a couple of trump cards in its sleeve.  For example, a camera in a thin body has a 10x optical zoom.  This is better than 8x on the IXUS 150. In addition, the zoom starts from a wider angle and improves the parameters of the previous model at the upper end.  Another update is the higher resolution of the CCD.  A 20 megapixel sensor is 4 million points more than the IXUS 150. </p><p>  The line is known for providing the end user a little more than others, and these innovations are present in the model 155, even if for this it should be considered a little closer.  For example, a metal tripod mount will last much longer than a plastic tripod mount, which is used on Powershot cameras sold at the same price.  There is also a very small zoom switch located at the top of the camera.  It could be larger, but using a smaller size indicates a large cost for its development. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Control </h2><p>  On the rear panel of the Canon IXUS 155, four operating keys are standardly located, making up the main navigation panel.  To reduce the size of the buttons were staggered.  We can confidently say that one of them is superfluous, because it provides access to the menu, which is called from the main one.  Despite this, the camera is very easy to use, and this button may not be activated in any case.  Nevertheless, for a beginner or a person who is having difficulty learning new technologies, the help button, indicated by a question mark, will explain the functions of the mode the user is in without using professional jargon. </p><p>  On the back of the camera you can see the lack of macro buttons and exposure compensation.  They were moved to the function menu so that instead of them it was possible to turn on the Eco mode and Auto / Live. </p>

    <h2>  Menu </h2><p>  Canon always made simple menus.  In this camera, it consists of two main sections.  The most commonly used of these may be the function menu.  It is called up by the central button on the navigation bar.  Various options appear on the left side of the screen, which will vary depending on the current operating mode.  For the most extensive, it is better to bring the camera out of automatic mode by pressing the top navigation key before entering the menu, which will lead to the on-screen viewing mode.  Then select the program from the list under the ISO selector.  Other functions that can be accessed in this menu include options for adjusting ISO settings, white balance, resolution, and continuous shooting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To get to even more Canon IXUS 155 features, use the button at the bottom of the camera to access the main menu.  The latter is composed of two tabs.  The left is devoted to camera functions such as focusing, image stabilization, blink detection, i-Contrast and red-eye correction.  The tab on the right is for basic camera settings.  For example, here you can change the volume, set the date and time, format the card, change the video standard or language, etc. </p><p>  The menu has a gray background with black shadows and white letters.  The cursor is orange and contrasts well with gray, providing a great look and ease of use. </p>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Turning on the camera, and then focusing and shooting, takes 1.3 seconds.  This is somewhat faster than the average for cameras of this class, equal to 1.5-1.8 seconds.  The device takes 8 photos in 10 seconds, which is very slow.  There are much faster cameras, however, then this is not continuous, but continuous shooting.  In fact, if there is a need to photograph fast-moving objects, then do not worry, since this device was not created for speed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  View Snapshots </h2><p>  Access to captured photos can be obtained by pressing the button with a blue arrow on the back of the camera.  This can be done both when the camera is on and off.  And if with the device turned off, you usually need to hold the button down for several seconds, then for the Canon IXUS 155 Black, a quick press is enough. </p><p>  The latest photos on the screen are displayed without additional information, but if there is a need, you can press the Disp button located at the bottom of the navigation keyboard.  Pressing it again will produce a complex information screen with a thumbnail image and a histogram. </p>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  There is one thing that plays against Canon compacts compared to similar cameras from other manufacturers.  They use an external charger.  Thanks to their wide range of functions, small cameras are great for traveling on weekends and holidays.  The external charger is equipped with a cord for connecting to the mains.  Accessories for the Canon IXUS 155 also include a battery and a small wrist strap.  The camera does not have internal memory, but you will have to buy a memory card separately. </p><p>  At the top of the box is a sealed package with instructions for getting started, a warranty card and promotional items.  What is missing is a complete user guide, which is usually supplied on a CD with basic photo editing software.  All this is available for download from the company website.  This is an interesting solution designed to save the environment and lower the price of the Canon IXUS 155. </p>

    <h2>  Image Quality: Noise </h2><p>  According to user reviews, photos taken at ISO 100 look promising.  In dark areas, the noise is completely absent, the detail is large, the edges are clear.  If you are too picky, then small interference begins to appear even at ISO 200, and this is disappointing.  But the biggest changes occur at ISO 400. Image quality, in terms of detail and noise, drops dramatically.  Green spots appear in dark areas, and details become fuzzy due to the operation of the noise reduction system. </p><p>  At ISO 800, colors are inexpressive.  This is a consequence of the reduction in color noise that is still present on most of the image.  On midtones, black and white dots begin to appear much more.  This was probably the reason why the manufacturer limited himself to a maximum ISO of 1600. At high values, the pictures would be completely unrecognizable, which could adversely affect the brand‚Äôs reputation. </p><h2>  Sharpness </h2><p>  Image sharpening works if photos are taken at low ISO and there is no obvious noise.  Otherwise, this procedure only strengthens it. </p><h2>  Focal length range </h2><p>  The Canon IXUS 155 is equipped with a 10x zoom lens.  This provides a <span>focal length</span> of 24 to 240 mm for a 35 mm camera. </p><h2>  Chromatic aberration </h2><p>  Traces of chromatic aberration are present in all photographs.  As a rule, they are observed at high contrast edges, but not only - on not very sharp edges they are also visible.  Users note that due to the limited dynamic range of the sensor, the bright sky looks colored. </p>

    <h2>  Macro shot </h2><p>  The Canon IXUS 155 can take pictures with a focal length of 1 cm. The central area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe picture gives incredibly clear images, but to the edges its quality quickly and significantly deteriorates. </p><h2>  Flash </h2><p>  Without additional lighting, the pictures are balanced and have no visible signs of vignetting.  The flash in wide-angle shooting adds a tough vignette, but with full zoom it goes away. </p><p>  When photographing portraits, the effect of red eyes is observed.  Using the correction function really reduces it, although it involves its complete elimination.  True, the system works only at the digital level - the camera is programmed to search for a specific color, and it is possible that some shades are outside the specified coverage. </p><h2>  Night </h2><p>  The camera allows you to shoot at night in program mode.  At the same time, you can control ISO and achieve smoother images.  However, the maximum exposure is 1 second, which in very dark conditions is clearly not enough.  The IXUS 155 night mode is much better than some other compact cameras.  It uses a long exposure, allowing the user to choose its duration, up to 15 seconds, as well as ISO and white balance. </p>

    <h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  The Canon Digital IXUS 155 was created to be outwardly attractive and very easy to use.  Nevertheless, the camera received some other functions designed to lure owners of the IXUS 150 model. </p><p>  This is a very simple camera that will suit most users - both young and older, technophobes and gadget connoisseurs.  The compact design allows you to carry the camera in your pocket or bag.  Long zoom and quick start will not let precious shots be missed.  An external charger spoils the overall impression of the camera a bit.  It provides extra weight, as it is a standard solution, and not specifically designed for a compact camera. </p><p>  The IXUS line set the bar high, and 155 was no exception.  There is, of course, something to work on - for example, on the locking mechanism of the battery cover.  It should not just recline by itself.  Owners love the rubber USB port cover as part of the design of the entire right side of the camera. </p><p>  The image quality is very good.  Users are happy with the result, although noise appears too early.  Keep in mind the low cost of the Canon IXUS 155, which costs $ 130. </p><p>  The cost of the model justifies the available functionality from a company with an excellent reputation.  The complaints are caused only by the number of chromatic aberrations - a consequence of the use of non-standard optics, as well as noise arising at too low ISO values. </p>
