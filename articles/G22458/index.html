    <p>  <span>Crocheting rugs</span> from a cord became popular not so long ago, this idea is literally several years old.  Despite this, many craftswomen have already managed to decorate their homes with such unusual products. </p><h2>  Crocheted polyester mat: what it is and where it can come in handy </h2><p>  Of course, in the manufacture of a large round or square carpet, there is nothing surprising, for sure such attempts were made repeatedly.  However, the use of synthetic material gives any pattern originality and volume, due to which the crocheted rug from the cord stands out qualitatively against the background of those knitted from cotton, acrylic or blended yarn. </p><p>  In addition to the obvious decorative advantages, these products have all the classic qualities of carpets: they are dense and moderately tough.  They are laid in the living rooms, bedrooms and bathrooms.  By the way, a semicircular rug crocheted from a cord becomes an excellent solution for equipping small halls.  This form is obtained if only half of the pattern is used when knitting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Secrets of the material </h2><p>  A polyester cord is a material based on synthetic fibers.  It is woven from one hundred percent polyester, due to which it receives a number of extremely important properties: </p><ul><li>  Elasticity.  That is, the mat can stretch and contract without global deformation. </li><li>  Durability. </li><li>  Moisture resistance (water is not absorbed, the product dries quickly). </li><li>  Strength. </li><li>  Softness (no unpleasant stiffness). </li></ul>

    <p>  At the same time, it is interesting that the crocheted rug from the cord looks like it is knitted from cotton twine, that is, the effect of the ‚Äúplastic bag‚Äù is completely absent. </p><p>  The polyester cord is suitable for the manufacture of <span>carpets, rugs,</span> walkways, bags, baskets and other products.  Those who use such items claim that dust does not accumulate on them and mold does not appear.  You can wash them manually in the bathroom or even in the car at a temperature of 30 degrees. </p><p>  Like many other knitted products, carpets should be dried unfolded, that is, horizontally. </p><h2>  How to calculate the amount of cord </h2><p>  To make a round rug, you will need material and a large hook (at least No. 4 or No. 5).  The cord can be purchased at a large construction supermarket or online store.  To create a product about 1100 mm in diameter, at least 800 m of material will be required.  At the same time, if the craftswoman plans to supply the rug with a large number of voluminous parts, she should take into account that the cord will take more. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As a rule, the weight of a product of this size will be at least three kilograms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheting rugs from a cord" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1370198.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Larger carpets will require significantly more cord.  For example, if you increase the diameter of the product to 2300 mm, you will need to use about 2200 m of material.  Of course, such a rug will be quite heavy - at least nine kilograms. </p><p>  Such a large-scale work will be surely marked by guests, since such a practical decor becomes the main decoration of the room. </p><h2>  How to get started? </h2><p>  To create the center of a round rug, you do not need to knit a chain of air loops (VP), here another way to start the canvas will be more appropriate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheting rugs from a polyester cord" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1370201.jpg" width="494"></div>  Twist the edge of the cord around the index and middle fingers twice, then remove this loop and knit the required number of columns inside.  For the scheme below, the first row is 20 double crochet (CCH).  The further sequence of work is as follows:

    <ol><li>  3VP (rise), * 4 VP, CCH *.  The fragment of the description between the icons * should be repeated until the end of the row. </li><li>  3VP, 50 CCH. </li><li>  3B, * 3 VP, 5 CCH with a common tip, 3 VP, CCH *. </li><li>  3 VP, 90 SSN. </li><li>  * 5VP, single crochet (RLS) *. </li><li>  * 5 VP, PRS *. </li><li>  VP, * 4 SSN, 3 VP, 4 SSN, RLS *. </li></ol><p>  Due to the fact that the last row of the pattern is designed in the form of teeth, the crocheted rug from the cord will have a very clear shape, similar to a flower. </p><p>  If desired, you can use any other scheme of a round motive or napkin.  The main thing is that it should have approximately the same number of rows. </p><p>  When using this pattern, the rug will turn out about one meter in diameter. </p><h2>  How to give the product a semicircular shape </h2><p>  To ‚Äúcrop‚Äù a circuit, you need to: </p><ol><li>  In the first row, perform only half the required amount of CCH. </li><li>  Then turn the canvas, perform 3VP lifting and start work on the second row. </li><li>  In the same way, knit all subsequent rows.  In the last two 3VPs are not required. </li></ol><p>  That is, the work is not in a circle, but in straight and return rows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted oval rug" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1370200.jpg" width="510"></div>

    <h2>  Oval <span>rug crocheted</span> from a cord </h2><p>  Such schemes are extremely rare, but do not get upset, because you can make it yourself. </p><p>  The basis is the same: the scheme of a round napkin.  The beginning of the work will not be a ring, but a chain of VPs, in each of which a CCH should be tied (on both sides). </p><p>  Then you need to follow this principle: </p><ol><li>  Along both long sides you should simply knit CCH. </li><li>  At the ends they knit semicircles. </li><li>  Each circular row will include a flat section, a semicircle, again a flat and again a semicircle. </li></ol><p>  Thus, the output will be an oval rug.  Its length depends on the size of the initial chain of VP. </p><p>  Crocheting rugs from a polyester cord is charming in that after a few hours of work, the result will be visible.  This is extremely important for craftswomen who are not confident in their abilities, since quick progress is the best motivation. </p><p>  Of course, when the rows will increase, the growth rate of the canvas will slow down.  This is due to the fact that the rows will become longer, and it will take much more time to knit each of them. </p><p>  However, all the same, such work moves incredibly fast: in just three to four evenings, you can make a medium-sized carpet.  If the craftswoman prefers to go headlong into her work, she may well manage in two days. </p><p>  Having mastered this task, many knitters are happy to perform similar products for their friends and girlfriends.  It should be noted that a carpet made of cord is a great housewarming gift. </p>
