This model of the radio station has been on the market for the past ten years, and over the entire period of its existence, it has undergone many changes and upgrades, without losing its popularity.  This is due to its simplicity, reliability and PR by those users who leave feedback on the MegaJet MJ-600.  To date, the model of the radio station is morally obsolete, and it has been replaced by an updated version of the MJ-650, but this does not prevent the old model from being very actively sold in domestic markets. </p><p>  The MegaJet MJ-600 radio is shipped in a regular silver color cardboard box.  No color printing is applied to the packaging, which is most likely done for the sake of cost. </p><p>  Both the form and equipment of the MJ-600 are much like the MJ-650. </p>

    <h2>  Radio design </h2><p>  The dimensions of the MegaJet MJ-600 are standard for the entire line of such devices. </p><p>  The chassis dimensions used in this model laid the foundation for creating an entire line of radio stations of this brand, as well as many others. </p><p>  Each of the body covers is screwed separately to the chassis.  This explains the rattling of the case at high volume due to resonances.  The body of the MegaJet MJ-600 Turbo is covered in black powder paint. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For the manufacture of the front panel used black plastic.  The radio station has a concise and thoughtful design, which determines the appearance of the device.  The appearance can hardly be called original, since many of its features are borrowed from stations of other manufacturers.  Despite the obviously borrowed design, the device in the end turned out to be very successful. </p><p>  The buttons of the MegaJet MJ-600 Plus walkie-talkie are rubberized, with small inscriptions located under them.  The keys located under the station display are softly illuminated by LEDs, as are the control knobs. </p><p>  The station is equipped with a Black Matrix display with a wide viewing angle.  A slightly worse image is read from below and above. </p><p>  On the rear panel of the MegaJet MJ-600 there is a connector for connecting an <span>antenna, a connector</span> for connecting a speaker and a power cable, which can be quickly disconnected from the device. </p><p>  The headset is connected using a standard 6-pin connector.  The headset itself is completely identical to the one installed on the MegaJet MJ-600 Plus.  The only differences are pinout and backlight.  The headset cable is elastic and soft, at low temperatures it does not lose its flexibility. </p>

    <h2>  Radio Functionality </h2><p>  The main functions are located on the front panel of the MegaJet MJ-600 Plus Turbo station, however, some of them respond only to key combinations after a complete reboot of the processor: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol data-id="b6a7b771c4658"><li>  Button for working with memory and additional functions.  In the memory of the radio station, the channel is recorded after pressing the FUN key and holding the button of the required memory cell.  Only the grid and channel are recorded.  To recall the required channel from the device‚Äôs memory, hold down the FUN key and then press the button corresponding to the desired memory location. </li><li>  Button for switching channel and frequency modes. </li><li>  A button that presses the last used channel.  On some MegaJet MJ-600 Plus Turbo devices, this key is disabled at the factory. </li><li>  Volume control and turning off / on the station are carried out using a special knob. </li><li>  Threshold squelch knob. </li><li>  Multifunction display. </li><li>  Button for switching AM / FM modulation.  Also, this key puts the MegaJet MJ-600 radio station into the advanced mode of operation.  To transfer a station, you must turn it off and on again with the key held down.  This will launch the multigrid mode of the radio station.  MegaJet MJ-600 Plus supports 6 grids, each of which has 40 channels. </li><li>  Key to open the list of channel scan modes.  Scanning is carried out only upwards, this cannot be changed, unfortunately.  Changing the direction resets the scan function. </li><li>  Enables listening to channels.  The mode starts after selecting one channel, pressing the DW key and selecting the second channel.  After that, the station will automatically switch to listening mode of two channels at once.  The key of this mode has another function - switching between fives and zeros.  The transition is carried out after turning off the MegaJet MJ-600 radio station and re-turning it on when the key is pressed.  The display should show the number 5, which signals the transition of the station to zeros.  To return the top five, you must repeat the whole situation. </li><li>  In advanced mode, the key switches grids; in normal mode, it triggers an emergency channel.  An additional function of the key is to reset all settings of the MegaJet MJ-600 Turbo station to the factory settings.  To do this, the station turns off and on again when the button is pressed.  The station will return to the factory settings, which is indicated on the display by RESET. </li><li>  Turn on the automatic noise suppressor. </li><li>  Headset jack </li><li>  Knob for switching channels. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Radio station setup </h2><p>  The MegaJet radio station can be installed in cars with a voltage of on-board network of 12 V and a grounded negative. </p><p>  The device is mounted in the passenger compartment using the bracket - microphone holder and mounting bracket. </p><h2>  Where to place the radio station? </h2><p>  It is desirable to install the device in the car in such a place so that it does not distract the driver from the road and does not cause inconvenience during operation.  The best option is the dashboard of the vehicle. </p><p>  After installation, the radio should not interfere with the driver and obstruct the view of the track or impair access to the controls of the machine.  Connecting cables are laid in compliance with all safety requirements. </p><h2>  Mechanical installation phase </h2><p>  Mounting holes under the dashboard are marked using the mounting bracket, which is used as a template for marking.  Any sharp tool, such as an awl, is suitable for marking the places of drilling holes. </p><p>  A hole with a diameter of 3 mm is drilled for each mounting plate mounting screw.  The bracket is mounted under the dashboard using self-tapping screws.  The holes must be drilled very carefully and carefully so that wires and other electronic devices hidden under the dashboard are not touched during operation. </p>
