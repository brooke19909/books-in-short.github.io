Overview, features, specifications and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Television is constantly evolving.  At the moment, a variety of standards have been created for the convenience of users.  One of the most popular is the DVB-C format.  What is it on TV? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hardwarezone.com.sg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="led tvs with dvb t2" class="if uuid-3184681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3184681.jpg"></div><p>  The main standards of TV are as follows: </p><ul><li>  DVB - digital television format, which is the main one in Europe; </li><li>  ISDB - distributed in Japan; </li><li>  ATSC - in the countries of America; </li><li>  DVB-C is the main standard for cable television. </li></ul><h2>  DVB-C standard </h2><p>  What is it on TV?  To start working with this standard, you need to insert the card issued by your provider into a special slot on the tuner.  This format is based on the encoding of a changing image, and it also has sound in MPEG-2 format.  The DVB-C receiver only works with a cable connection.  In other words, you must call the wizard so that he runs the cable.  The need for its presence is one of the most important drawbacks of this type of standard, because it is impossible to route a cable to some houses, which means that it is not possible to use the DVB-C television standard.  What is it on the TV, how does it differ from other standards? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wisegeek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tvs lg c dvb t2" class="if uuid-3184682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3184682.jpg"></div><h2>  Modern television technology </h2><p>  Many modern TV broadcast devices have built-in DVB-C support.  What is it on TV?  In this case, devices are meant not only TVs, but also various receivers, consoles and tuners.  There are several reasons for this: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  most devices connect to cable type broadcasts without problems; </li><li>  There are many different options for connecting DVB-C; </li><li>  connection cost is relatively inexpensive; </li><li>  easy to improve the quality of the resulting image; </li><li>  it‚Äôs easy to provide your television with mpeg support. </li></ul><p>  Modern consoles for the most part support DVB-C, because it is much easier and more profitable for the provider to configure this type of broadcast. </p><p>  Due to this, the demand for equipment with DVB-C support is growing.  The manufacturer seeks to get the location of consumers, providing them with the opportunity to purchase equipment that supports DVB-C and mpeg4. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cleanleap.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvb c tuner for tv" class="if uuid-3184685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3184685.jpg"></div><p>  In cities, it is DVB-C that is most popular.  This is due to the fact that connecting a cable television is inexpensive, does not take much time, and in most cases can be connected by the same provider that provides the user with the Internet. </p><h2>  A variation of the DVB-C2 standard </h2><p>  This is the second generation of the standard described above.  It differs from the first one in that when it is connected, cheaper technologies are used, but not inferior in quality to their predecessors.  OFDM technology has come to replace one carrier.  It provides the television with added flexibility and prevents interference. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  DVB-S </h2><p>  The difference of this standard is that communication is via satellite.  That is, for the operation of television is required not a cable, but an antenna and a receiver.  This method of broadcasting is the fastest of all described, and also provides high image and sound quality.  If you install a combined HD-receiver with two tuners for DVB-S2, you will get at home a high quality image, which can usually be found in movie theaters. </p><h2>  How to connect DVB-C </h2><p>  If you have a modern TV, then most likely DVB-C support is already built into it and there is a CAM module.  Then you just have to purchase the module and access card from the provider, and then connect everything to your device. </p><p>  If your model does not support DVB-C, then you need to purchase a tuner with this technology.  At the moment there are a lot of them, so the search will not take you much time. </p><p>  If you have a DVB-C receiver for cable television and a special card reader, you can use this type of broadcasting even from your personal computer.  You only need to pay for a subscription, the cost of which is acceptable, given the number of channels that you receive in return. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.consumerreports.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cable dvb c receivers" class="if uuid-3184687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3184687.jpg"></div><p>  DVB-C technology is primarily of interest to users who already have cable television at their disposal, but only in analog format.  In this case, you do not need to call the wizard for installation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Many providers provide big discounts on connecting this type of broadcasting, because the procedure does not require special expenses, and the technology itself is extremely popular among consumers.  If you already have cable TV, then you should talk to your operator about connecting digital DVB-C tariffs. </p><p>  Many modern LED TVs with DVB-C T2 have special connectors that greatly simplify the format connection process due to the fact that the cable can be connected directly to the device without using additional tuners and consoles. </p><p>  When you connect the cable to the TV, you only need to configure the broadcast, and this is a very simple and quick procedure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gesatech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="We study TVs lg c dvb s2" class="if uuid-3184683" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3184683.jpg"></div><p>  On average, when you connect a broadcast in DVB-C format, you get more than a hundred different channels, among which everyone will find interesting for themselves.  Devices can increase the amount of resources provided when reconfiguring broadcasting to other frequencies, but this is possible only with the permission of the provider, because it controls the content provided to users. </p><h2>  How to connect them? </h2><p>  If you have already activated the DVB-C tuner for the TV and you have completed all the other settings, you can start searching for channels.  To do this, you need to open the menu and find the "Channel Settings" function.  For different TV models, the option name may vary. </p><p>  Next, the menu item "Channel Search", followed by "Automatic Search".  Run the automatic channel search, and the device will find everything available in this region.  So simply, you can connect and set up digital television and enjoy watching your favorite movies and TV shows. </p><h2>  What do the reviews say? </h2><p>  The DVB-C digital cable television format provides high image and sound quality.  It is more stable and less susceptible to interference than analog.  Another great benefit is the availability of connectivity.  The main condition is the presence in your home of a provider that provides cable television and Internet and cable services. </p><p>  Digital signal transmission via cable has a number of advantages over satellite - no ‚Äúsnow‚Äù, noise and cod.  And the standards for encoding and compressing video and audio data MPEG-2, MPEG-4 allow you to broadcast HD and SD broadcasts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="amonet.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv tuner dvb reviews" class="if uuid-3184688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3184688.jpg"></div><p>  In order to get a high-quality television product, you just need to contact your provider and connect to the digital data service.  Next, install and connect a DVB TV tuner.  Reviews say that all channels work well and smoothly. </p><p>  It is also possible to watch digital television on your personal computer.  To do this, you need a DVB-C tuner and a card reader for a conditional access card.  Unfortunately, the option of digital television with the DVB-C tuner is not available to owners of television antennas. </p><p>  For television of normal resolution, the data transfer rate is no more than 15 Mbit, and for digital format it is several times larger - from 60 to 80 Mbit per second.  If you look at the prices and reviews of all DVB-C digital cable receivers in most stores, this technology seems even more attractive.  The cost of such devices starts from a thousand rubles, and the proposed features are very impressive. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of the standard </h2><p>  Of the minuses of this method of signal reception, you can select a paid connection and the need for cable television.  But if there is one in your home, then you have the opportunity to become a member of the digital broadcasting project, just without leaving your home, and watch any television product in high quality image and sound. </p><h2>  Differences between DVB-T and DVB-C </h2><p>  The differences between the different types of DVB standard have already been discussed above.  If you do not have access to the cable, you can use the DVB-S connection.  Moreover, modern LG TVs with DVB-C S2 are available for sale today.  But can it be compared with a digital format? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.johnlewis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="digital cable receivers dvb c price reviews" class="if uuid-3184689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3184689.jpg"></div><p>  The DVB-T standard guarantees high-quality signal reception.  He is able to not perceive the reflected signals.  Channel coding is used to increase immunity to various interference.  This standard carries out exactly the same broadcasting, as is the case with analog television, but the transmission format and technology are used differently.  DVB-T terrestrial broadcasting is completely different from satellite DVB-S or cable DVB-C.  Decoders have completely different frequency channels and modulation methods, so they are not compatible with each other. </p><p>  Digital TV is broadcast in the decimeter spectrum.  Therefore, such indicators as the topography of the territory, the openness of the terrain to the transmitter and the compactness of the building affect the quality of signal reception. </p><p>  What are the benefits of digital TV: </p><ul><li>  High quality video, the ability to view on a large screen. </li><li>  Great sound quality. </li><li>  Huge selection of channels. </li><li>  Connect parental control. </li></ul><h2>  More on every aspect </h2><p>  The main advantage this format offers is high quality video.  You can forget about the problems with the screen.  With digital television, you will never encounter effects such as splitting a picture, a snowy screen, etc. All these effects are only with poor quality analog signals.  Digital is arranged in this way: either the signal is received in high quality, or not received at all. </p><p>  There are many cases where broadcasting is carried out with stereo sound instead of mono sound.  This means that there is even more detail and separation of sound.  The DVB standard does not distort or compress sounds.  Using a high-speed data stream makes it possible to save traffic without compromising quality. </p><p>  This technology allows the transmission of an audio track, which is divided into a certain number of channels.  Owners of home theaters can also use the DVB format. </p><p>  There is another plus to using digital television.  It supports a huge number of channels.  Analog subscribers have no diversity either in focus or in topic.  You will have access to news, educational, scientific, musical, sports and other categories of channels at your own discretion.  It all depends on your personal interests. </p><p>  The DVB standard has a parental control connection function.  It allows you to choose this particular method of broadcasting.  You can block access to certain channels, which, in your opinion, should not be visible to your children by simply putting a special password on them.  Then no one but you can turn them on. </p><p>  This method also has disadvantages.  To use DVB successfully, you need to fulfill the following conditions: </p><ol><li>  Find a secure provider. </li><li>  Make sure that the equipment is in good working order. </li><li>  Carefully and correctly complete all the settings. </li></ol><p>  At first glance, it might seem that it's easy.  But in the case of unreliable equipment, this format will cause you a lot of inconvenience.  It may be damaged during strong winds, and you may be left without a TV.  To identify a quality provider, you need to have a good look at the reviews of all available in your home.  In addition, you will need to purchase the latest LG TV with DVB-C T2. </p><p>  The lack of round-the-clock support for most providers is also one of the drawbacks.  For example, due to a night thunderstorm, equipment on the roof of the house is out of order.  Although it is possible to restore work very quickly, you cannot call a specialist at night or on a day off. </p>
