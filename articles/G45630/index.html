    <p>  Over the two centuries of its existence, the park has repeatedly changed its name.  Initially, it was a country house, then - a country garden.  After the revolution, he became the garden of the Public Assembly, and then the Red Garden.  And only then it turned into the central park of culture and rest - Gorky Children's Park.  Perm is proud of this attraction, because it is one of the oldest parks in the city with a rich history that dates back to 1804 and is closely intertwined with the history of the regional center. </p><p>  It was then that at the initiative of the city governor K.F. Moderakh, a city plan was developed.  But in his project there was no park.  A moat was dug at the border of the village to drain water.  In order to strengthen it, they planted a birch alley, which marked the beginning of the Country Garden.  Here citizens walked, and carriages could ride.  This alley has long been gone.  Despite the fact that the main attraction due to which Gorky Park appeared, Perm is ready to offer the residents and guests of the city a different one, with the romantic name ‚ÄúAlley of Love‚Äù.  According to her exercise their first trip newlyweds when making thus his most <span>cherished desire.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gorky Perm 2013" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/237211.jpg" width="600"></div>

This place is also famous for the fact that Emperor Alexander I triumphantly entered Perm in 1824 through it. In honor of this visit, the construction of the rotunda, which was installed on the territory of the Zagorodny Garden (modern Gorky Park), was carried out in the same year.  Perm is proud of this building, since at present it is a monument of town planning and architecture of federal significance.  During a tour of this attraction, you can see a plate with an inscription that indicates the meeting of the emperor with the inhabitants of the city.  In 1905, another historical monument was erected in the park dedicated to the first united political demonstration of Perm workers. </p>

    <p>  The park has entertainment for both children and adults.  So, in the children's sector, designed for the youngest visitors, sandboxes are installed, playgrounds are equipped on which there are all kinds of swings, slides and carousels.  For older children, slot machines, shooting galleries, various attractions, 4D cinema work.  In addition, there is a mini zoo where you can watch squirrels, rabbits, ostriches or pheasants.  And this is not all that Gorky Park (Perm) is famous for.  2013 was marked by the 209th anniversary of the former Country Garden. </p><p>  This year, a new Ferris wheel was installed, the total weight of which is 162 tons.  This attraction has 24 cabins that rise to a height of 50 meters.  A full turn of the wheel takes 5 minutes.  But this is not all that attracts Gorky Park (Perm).  The rides, of which there were about 60, can be supplemented with another one - the prehistoric aquarium located at the base of the Ferris wheel.  Here, vacationers can admire the inhabitants of the ancient oceans and seas through 3D glasses.  The aquarium itself is a kind of maze, consisting of 8 screens.  At the same time it can be visited by 100 people. </p><p>  A visit to Gorky Park always leaves only positive memories. </p>
