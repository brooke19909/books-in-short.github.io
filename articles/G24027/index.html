    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Hotel Muong Thanh Mui Ne 4 * did not disappoint its guests on this point.  So, tourists in their reviews note that they were very pleased with the beach holiday here.  From residential buildings to the sea, you can literally walk in a couple of minutes at a leisurely pace.  You can sit here on comfortable sun loungers with umbrellas.  The beach here is sandy, clean.  Entering shallow water.  However, some travelers warn of the need to be careful, as there is a risk of stepping on a sea urchin.  Such cases do not occur often, but you should still be aware of this.  As for the shortcomings, a number of guests, especially those who visited here during the New Year holidays, complained about the fact that there are not enough sun loungers on the beach.  However, this does not happen because there are not enough sun loungers, but because tourists occupy them early in the morning (literally at 6 a.m.), and then they come to the sea at best for dinner.  But when the hotel is not completely filled, such difficulties do not arise. </p>
