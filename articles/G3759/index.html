Have you ever wondered what it is, why and how it is measured?  About atmospheric pressure and its effect on humans will be discussed in this article.  For the first time, atmospheric pressure was measured back in 1643.  The long experiments of the Italian scientist Evangelist Torricelli showed that air has a certain weight, which can be measured.  As a result of lengthy trials, the great scientist invented the barometer.  Now atmospheric could be measured with extreme accuracy. </p>

    <p>  Imagine the effect of atmospheric pressure is not difficult.  In fact, this is the force with which atmospheric air presses on everything that surrounds us.  This force is measured in hectopascals (hPa), but the use of old units is also acceptable: the popular mm.  Hg.  Art.  and millibar (mb).  Often the question arises: "What is normal atmospheric pressure?"  This is the force with which a column of air presses on the earth's surface at sea level.  For this value, take 760 mm RT.article.  The maximum atmospheric pressure was recorded in 1968 in the northern region of Siberia and amounted to 113.35 hPa.  During this period, almost all residents felt unwell, since the maximum atmospheric pressure is an unusual phenomenon of nature and there is no adaptation to it. </p>

    <p>  Any deviation from the norm, whether it is high atmospheric pressure or low, leads to a change in weather conditions.  It is known that gases have an excellent resource for compressibility, respectively, the denser the gas, the greater the pressure it can produce.  Indices of atmospheric pressure decrease significantly with height.  The higher the measurement above sea level, the lower will be the indicators.  This is due to the fact that the pressure of one layer on another is reduced.  For example, at an altitude of 5000 meters, its performance is already half that of the earth. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Elevated atmospheric pressure is usually observed at night, and during the day, with an increase in air temperature, the pressure decreases.  How does low or high atmospheric pressure affect a person?  First of all, it depends on the individual characteristics of a person and his state of health.  Usually people with pathology of the heart and blood vessels are more responsive to fluctuations in atmospheric pressure.  It does not matter for them what normal atmospheric pressure is, the main thing is that the pressure characteristic of their locality does not give sharp jumps.  Such people are usually interested in the prognosis for the coming days, so that they can take appropriate measures and prevent the exacerbation of their diseases. </p>

    <p>  From observations and studies, it is clear that not all people have high blood pressure that causes a general deterioration in well-being.  With a strong excess of the norm in individuals, breathing becomes deeper, the pulse quickens, the hearing weakens a little and the voice becomes quieter.  The main part of the population these diseases are transmitted almost imperceptibly.  Elevated air pressure more often becomes a problem for people suffering from migraines and cardiovascular diseases.  Of course, this takes into account not only the magnitude, but also the frequency of pressure fluctuations.  When the differences occur smoothly, and the difference is only a few units, they are felt much weaker. </p>

    <p>  Most often, we feel unwell precisely with a decrease in atmospheric pressure.  Blood pressure decreases, the general condition resembles the process of oxygen starvation, the head is spinning, the legs become "cottony," etc.  Scientists conducted research on the number of traffic accidents and received a disappointing result.  The number of accidents during low atmospheric pressure increases by an average of 15-20%.  Drivers, be careful and careful! </p>

    <p>  Whether we like it or not, the weather affects not only our mood, but also our general physical condition.  When you feel that you‚Äôre feeling ‚Äúuneasy,‚Äù try not to worry and, if possible, reduce all sorts of serious physical activities.  In cases where the malaise becomes simply unbearable, of course, you should consult a doctor. </p>
