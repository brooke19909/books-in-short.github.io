    <h2>  HD Flat Model Reviews </h2><p>  This line was once very popular due to the use of high-resolution screens.  Today, such models form the base fourth series in the general assortment of the manufacturer.  Actually, the greatest interest in this "family" is caused by one of the most modest- <span>sized TVs of the</span> brand - a modification of the H4080 by 24 inches.  This is a niche option that is designed to be used as a secondary practical TV screen.  In general, reviews about Samsung TVs in this series mark their manufacturability.  Usually small-format models adopt technologies that are in the past from older versions.  In this case, the developers maintain a high level of functionality and multimedia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The strengths of the HD Flat line include high-quality acoustics.  Typically, entry-level models are practically not evaluated by sound characteristics, as sophisticated music lovers immediately calculate the addition of the system with separate speakers or soundbars.  But in this case, the creators also succeeded in this characteristic.  Users also note the good color rendering that Samsung TVs are provided with.  Prices for representatives of the 4th series are quite affordable to consumers of budget products - with a 24-inch display, such a model costs from 15 to 20 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  5 Series Model Reviews </h2><p>  This line is also focused on the offer of high-quality images, but <span>Smart</span> TV <span>technology</span> should be attributed to its features.  Users value this ‚Äúfamily‚Äù for the Full HD format, which enhances the feel of the broadcast ‚Äúpicture.‚Äù  The interaction of models with other equipment is carried out through the <span>HDMI connector,</span> which simultaneously transmits both the audio stream and the video signal.  You can enjoy the TV show through screens of different formats, and the maximum size is 58 ". The entry-level level is Samsung TV 32", which successfully combines intellectual filling and small sizes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  While few people can be surprised at the high resolution today, the Smart TV offers significantly expand the multimedia functionality of the technology.  Directly through the TV screen, you can broadcast a signal from the Internet, work with applications and run games.  In addition, the options for display settings are expanding.  The menu allows you to focus on a specific area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe screen, but at the same time maintain high quality.  By and large, in this series of Samsung TVs there is nothing fundamentally new by the standards of the current level of development of the segment.  It comprises the technological minimum that the later generations of the model range already disclose in a more complete format. </p>

    <h2>  Curved Model Reviews </h2><p>  With the 6th series, the introduction into the model line of televisions with an unusual curved screen begins.  Opinions about such a structural solution are still mixed.  As the reviews themselves note, the feeling of a richer picture and a complete immersion in the atmosphere of the display are achieved only when viewing on a large screen.  In addition, high resolution should be supported, at least in UHD 4K format.  This means that, for example, Samsung 32 "TV will no longer provide the desired effect. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For this reason, manufacturers are starting a line of curved models with 40-inch versions.  This approach is also practiced by Samsung, which, in addition to a curved screen, offers a lot of interesting things in the not very developed 6th series.  For example, users of such televisions respond positively to the color rendering settings.  The fact is that models in the UHD resolution format are complemented by PurColour technology, which provides not only an optimal range of colors, but also crystal clear images. </p><h2>  7 Series TV Reviews </h2><p>  In this "family" there was a revision of existing technologies, as a result of which there were good models with optimized "stuffing".  In all senses, a striking example of the series is the 78-inch JU7500 version. If reviews on Samsung TVs with a 40-inch screen are quite restrained with respect to the advantages of a curved panel, this option not only provides a full range of Curved effects, but also saves High definition with the benefits of multimedia. </p>

    <p>  According to users, the JU7500 model successfully embodied the advantages of high resolution UHD 4K and Smart TV technology, reinforcing these add-ons with a huge screen.  The design qualities of the modification, which enhance the effect of the perception of what is happening on the screen, are also noted separately.  Samsung TV 40 "from the 7th series allows you to enjoy similar properties. Of course, the diagonal size again limits the advantages of a curved screen, but otherwise the image quality causes, rather, positive emotions from the audience. </p><h2>  What do the reviews say about the models of the 9th series? </h2><p>  Although the prospects for curved screens to this day raise doubts among experts, the South Korean brand has recently released a whole line of such models, forming the ninth series from them.  Here you can find Samsung TV 40 ", as well as models with a diagonal of more than 80".  The main emphasis in this "family" is made on high-resolution Ultra HD.  According to the developers, this format is 4 times superior to the Full HD scan.  And this is confirmed by the users themselves, noting the excellent detail and increased clarity of the picture. </p><p>  There are also many laudatory comments regarding the capabilities of Auto Depth Enhancer technology, thanks to which you can increase the depth of the image.  As reviews on Samsung TVs with such a feature show, the screen provides a more natural perception due to optimal contrast settings. </p>

    <h2>  Widescreen Model Reviews </h2><p>  This is the most attractive class of modern TVs.  The maximum size of the diagonal available to the model for the mass consumer, slightly exceed 100 inches.  The most popular are 82-inch Samsung TVs, the prices of which range from 300 to 500 thousand rubles.  And it should be noted that this is not the limit, as the 88-inch model UE88JS9500T is estimated at 1.5 million rubles.  Of course, the impressions of the owners are appropriate - there are many reviews that compare such televisions with the capabilities of movie theaters or, at least, projectors. </p><h2>  How to choose the best option? </h2><p>  First of all, <span>the screen size is</span> determined <span>.</span>  As can be seen from the review, the South Korean manufacturer produces models in a wide range of diagonals.  It should be borne in mind that the best reviews about Samsung TVs still belong to the middle group.  For example, if you plan to purchase a curved screen, then preference should be given to 45-inch models.  Next, you need to decide on the resolution - the higher it is, the better the image.  The best option may be UHD, but if funds are limited, then the output will be very decent Full HD. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Manufacturer Samsung in recent years has become a true trendsetter on television.  This is partly due to an active marketing campaign for advertising curved panels.  Two companies dominate in this segment, one of which is the South Korean brand.  Despite this, reviews on Samsung TVs can hardly be called convinced of the advertised merits.  Nevertheless, there is almost no criticism of the usual formats and technologies.  Most owners of flat-screen models that are deprived of high resolution, note the quality of assembly, convenient functionality and good image quality. </p>
