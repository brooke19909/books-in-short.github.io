    <h2>  Cornelius Tacitus: biography </h2><p>  In his youth, he combined service as a judicial speaker and political activity.  Subsequently, <span>Cornelius Tacitus</span> became a senator.  By 97, he became consul of higher magistracy.  Rising to the heights of the political Olympus, <span>Cornelius Tacitus</span> observed the subservience of the Senate and the arbitrariness of imperial power.  After the assassination of Domitian, the Antonin dynasty took over the throne.  It was this period that was the first, the opinion of which <span>Cornelius Tacitus</span> began to express <span>.</span>  <span>The works</span> that he planned to create had to truly reflect what was happening.  To do this, he had to carefully study the sources.  He strove to create a complete and accurate picture of events.  He processed and reproduced all the accumulated material in his own manner.  Spectacular language, an abundance of honed phrases are the basic principles used by <span>Cornelius Tacitus.</span>  <span>The author was</span> guided by the best examples of Latin literature.  Among them were the books of Titus Livius, Cicero, Sallust. </p><h2>  Information from sources </h2><p>  The first name that the <span>historian Cornelius Tacitus</span> carried is not known for certain.  Contemporaries called him by nomen or cognom.  In the 5th century, Sidonius Apollinaris mentioned him under the name Guy.  However, the medieval manuscripts of Tacitus himself are signed by the name Publius.  The latter remained after him later.  The date of birth of Tacitus is also unknown.  Its appearance is attributed to the 50th years on the basis of the sequence in the lesson of magistracy.  Most researchers agree that <span>Kornelius Tacitus</span> was born between 55 and 58 years old.  The place of his birth is also not exactly known.  There is evidence that he was absent several times in Rome.  One of them was associated with the death of his father-in-law Agricola, whose life will subsequently be set forth in one of his essays. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cornelius Tacitus: photo, origin </h2><p>  It is believed that his ancestors came from southern France or Italy.  Cognomen "Tacitus" was used in the formation of Latin names.  It comes from the word, which in translation means "be quiet," "keep quiet."  More often than not, the Tacitus cognitive phenomenon was used in Narbonne and Cisalpine Gaul.  From this, researchers conclude about the Celtic roots of the family. </p>

    <h2>  Training </h2><p>  <span>Cornelius Tacitus,</span> whose <span>works</span> later became widely known throughout ancient Rome, received a very good education.  Presumably, the quintilian was the teacher of rhetoric, and then Julius Secundus and Mark Apr.  Apparently, no one taught him philosophy, since he subsequently was quite restrained about it and to thinkers in general.  Cornelius Tacitus achieved great success in public speaking.  This is evidenced by the words of Pliny the Younger. </p><h2>  "Caesar's candidate" </h2><p>  In 76-77, <span>Cornelius Tacitus</span> married the daughter of Gnei Julius Agricola.  At the same time, his career began to develop actively.  In his notes, Tacitus admitted that three emperors contributed to the quick success: Domitian, Titus and Vespasian.  In political language, this means that it has been included in the lists of praetor, quaestor and senate.  Usually magistrates from a quaestor or tribune fell into the composition of the latter.  Tacitus was listed ahead of schedule.  This testified to the special trust of the emperor.  So Tacitus was on the list of ‚ÄúCaesar‚Äôs candidates‚Äù - people who were recommended for the post and approved by the Senate, regardless of ability and merit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what Cornelius Tacitus wrote" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1552325.jpg" width="385"></div>

Instead, Nerve became emperor.  From the sources it is not entirely clear which of them formed and approved the lists of the consulate.  Presumably, the compiler was Domitian.  The final approval was already carried out by the Nerve.  One way or another, in 97, Cornelius Tacitus received the post of consul-suffice.  For him, this was the peak of his fairly successful career.  During the consulate, Tacitus witnessed and was a direct participant in attempts to suppress the rebellion of the Praetorians.  Around the year 100 with <span>Pliny the Younger,</span> he dealt with the case of African provincials who opposed Maria Prisca, a consul known for abuses. </p><h2>  last years of life </h2><p>  From the sources found in Millas at the end of the 19th century, it is known that Cornelius Tacitus was consulsed in Asia in 112-113.  His position and name were recorded in the inscription.  The province was of particular importance to Rome.  The emperors sent only proven people to it.  At the same time, the appointment of Cornelius Tacitus was especially responsible.  The importance was associated with the planned campaign of Trajan to Parthia.  Throughout his life, Tacitus was friends with Pliny the Younger.  The latter was considered the most famous Roman intellectual of the late 1st century.  Unfortunately, the exact date of Tacitus‚Äôs death is unknown.  Based on his desire to document the rule of Trajan, Nerva, and Octavian Augustus, but not implemented, the researchers conclude that he died some time after the publication of "Annals".  But there is no mention of Tacitus in Suetonius.  This may indicate death around 120 or even later. </p>

    <h2>  Literature Dr.  Rome </h2><p>  By the end of the 1st century, a lot of writings were written in the empire, in which its development was illustrated.  They included evidence of the founding of Rome, the past of the provinces, a substantial part of which were once independent states.  There were also detailed works on wars.  At that time, history was equated with a kind of oratory.  This was due to the fact that in Greece and Rome of the ancient period, any compositions, as a rule, were read and, accordingly, were perceived by people by ear.  History was considered honorable.  Emperor Claudius had several works.  Contemporaries of Tacitus left their autobiographical works.  Among them were Adrian and Vespasian.  Trajan witnessed the events of the Dacian campaign. </p>

    <h2>  The problems of antiquity </h2><p>  However, speaking generally, historiography during Tacitus was in decline.  First of all, the establishment of the principle was to blame.  Because of him, historians were divided into two categories.  The first supported the empire.  They tried not to record events that have occurred in recent decades.  The authors usually limited themselves to describing individual episodes, very recent phenomena and glorifying the current emperor.  However, they adhered to the official versions of what is happening.  The opposition entered another category.  Accordingly, they carried completely opposite ideas in their writings.  This greatly alarmed the authorities.  Authors who described contemporary events had difficulty finding sources.  The fact is that many of the eyewitnesses kept strict silence, were killed or expelled from the empire.  All documents confirming conspiracies, coups, intrigues, were at the court of the ruler.  Access to it had a very limited circle of people.  Few of them dared to reveal secrets.  And if there were such people, they asked for a high price for information. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Post Cornelius Tacitus Pics" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1552328.jpg" width="319"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <h2>  Censorship </h2><p>  In addition, the ruling elite began to realize that the authors, fixing past events, invariably draw a parallel with modern realities.  Accordingly, they expressed their own opinions about what was happening.  In this regard, the imperial court introduced censorship.  This was perfectly notified and Tacitus, who described the tragic events associated with Cremucius Cord.  The latter committed suicide, and all of his writings were devoted to fire.  Everything that Cornelius Tacitus wrote testifies to the reprisals against oppositional thinkers of our time.  For example, in the writings he mentions Herenius of Senezion and Arulen Rustik, who were executed.  In his ‚ÄúDialogue on the speaker,‚Äù the author voices the widespread opinion at that time that publications that the ruling authorities could interpret as an attack on her are undesirable.  Potential writers began to be actively pressured for their desire to uncover the secrets of the court life and activities of the Senate.  For example, Pliny the Younger testifies that Tacitus, who was reading his work, was interrupted by friends of "one man."  They begged not to continue, because they believed that information could be discovered that could adversely affect the reputation of their acquaintance.  Writing stories began to be accompanied, therefore, by various difficulties.  That is why relatively neutral writings by the end of the 1st century did not appear.  For the writing of such works just took Tacitus. </p><h2>  Essay Review </h2><p>  <span>What did Cornelius Tacitus write</span> ?  Presumably, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating an essay on the recent past came to him some time after the death of Domitian.  Nevertheless, Tacitus began with small works.  First, he created a biography of Agricola (his father-in-law).  In it, among other things, Tacitus collected many ethnographic and geographical details about the life of British nationalities.  In the introduction to the composition, he characterizes the period of Domitian's reign.  In particular, Tacitus speaks of him as a time that was taken by the emperor from the Romans.  The same preface indicates the intention to present a comprehensive essay.  Subsequently, in a separate work, Germany, Tacitus describes the northern neighbors of the empire.  It is worth noting that these first two works have something in common with the general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhis later works.  After graduating from Agricola and Germany, Tacitus began large-scale work on the events of 68-96.  In the process of its creation, he published the Dialogue on Speakers.  At the end of his life, Tacitus began the creation of the Annals.  In them he wanted to expound the events of 14-68. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="historian cornelius tacitus" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1552329.jpg" width="352"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Cornelius Tacitus had the brightest writing talent.  In his writings, he did not use beaten cliches.  Hone his mastery with every new work, Tacitus became the greatest chronicler of his time.  This is largely due to the fact that he conducted a deep analysis of the sources he used.  Moreover, in his writings, he sought to reveal the psychology of the characters.  The works of Tacitus in modern times have gained immense popularity in European countries.  Despite the censorship and pressure imposed, he was able to create the greatest works.  The works of Tacitus had a huge impact on the development of political thought in European countries. </p>
