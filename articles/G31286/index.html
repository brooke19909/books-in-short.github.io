How nice to get rid of shoes and give your legs a rest after a hard day's work.  To feel good at home, you need to know how to sew slippers that sit comfortably on your foot and fit your home suit. </p><p>  Many do not consider it necessary to do such trifles on their own, preferring to buy them in a store.  But we all know how pleasant it is to sew <span>slippers with our own hands</span> for ourselves and for those close to us.  They will warm them on long winter evenings, and remind us of our care and attention. </p><p>  How to sew home slippers and what material to use for this?  Any <span>unnecessary things</span> and rags of jeans, knitwear, fur, suede and leather, as well as drap in bright colors, will do.  Before stitching slippers, you should choose a suitable model and make a pattern of the right size. </p><p>  You can make comfortable homemade flip flops from felt.  The manufacturing process takes only 20 minutes.  It became interesting how?  We will tell you.  Take a sheet of paper and outline your foot on it.  Add 1-1.5 centimeters on all sides for a loose fit.  Now, draw two rectangles 5-8 centimeters wide and 10 centimeters long on each side to the foot.  They will play the role of a jumper holding the slippers on the foot. </p><p>  We got a kind of letter "T" with a protruding upper part.  Cut two mirrored details of the slippers from the felt.  Connect the side parts into a ring.  Try and adjust them on the foot.  After this, sew with a few stitches and decorate with a large decorative button or any other part as you wish.  Home spanking ready. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to sew slippers from fabric. </p><p>  The easiest way to make a pattern is to gently rip old slippers and circle every detail.  But if you do not have such an opportunity, then we proceed as follows.  We circle the paper on the foot and add 1.5 centimeters on all sides, and then cut it out.  On the foot detail, note the level at which the top of the slippers will end.  We bend the sole detail according to the marks made and we see a small rounded upper part in front of us.  We circle it on paper and cut it out.  Carefully cut the resulting part in the middle, directing the ends of the scissors to the rounded part, but do not cut to the end of 1.5-2 centimeters.  We put the blank on paper, push the ends of the cut part to the side by 5 centimeters.  Circle the simulated detail of the top. </p><p>  Having finished with the pattern, we set about cutting the details of the fabric.  You will need to make double details of the sole and top for each slipper.  The bottom of the sole is best cut out of faux leather, felt or thick jeans.  For the top, any beautiful fabric is suitable.  If it is dense enough, then one layer is enough.  For thin fabric, you need to cut out the lining.  Cut out the details of the sole.  We put them together and connect the line at a distance of 2 millimeters from the edge.  We also connect the details of the top of the slippers, after which we fringe a straight cut with an <span>oblique trim</span> or <span>decorative braid.</span> </p><p>  Put the top on the sole.  Equalize the details of the notches and stab with needles.  We connect a straight line.  We turn over the soles of the slippers with an oblique trim.  The ends of the braid are superimposed on each other and stitched.  Choosing a plain fabric for slippers, be sure to decorate the top with any decorative trim.  For this, embroidery, appliques, the remains of beads, bright beads or rhinestones are suitable. </p><p>  Knowing how to sew slippers, you can please not only with seven gifts, but also take care of the people who come to visit you.  To do this, make a special guest set of identical slaps of different sizes.  Having made a beautiful pocket for such slippers, and placing it on the wall in the hallway, you will not have problems finding shoes for guests. </p>
