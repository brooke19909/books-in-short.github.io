    <h2>  Crystal Cyrene Hotel 4 *: reviews of tourists from the Russian Federation </h2><p>  Modern travelers today are paying great attention to the process of choosing a hotel.  After all, no one wants to pay for the tour, and upon arrival at the place to be disappointed with the conditions of their stay.  In order to get the most accurate idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat awaits in a particular hotel, it is not enough for a modern tourist to simply familiarize himself with the official description and listen to advice from a tour operator.  So, today most people try to study the impressions of other travelers who happened to visit a place that is considered as an option for a vacation.  Indeed, in their reviews, tourists frankly talk about what they liked in this or that hotel, and which, on the contrary, disappointed and upset. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In this regard, we decided to make your task a little easier and provide generalized comments by our compatriots regarding their stay at Crystal Cyrene Hotel 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh).  First of all, it should be noted that most tourists do not regret their choice at all.  In their opinion, the rest was worth the money spent and left a lot of positive emotions.  But we learn more about everything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crystal cyrene hotel 4 charm el sheikh" class="if" height="246" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/970724.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  On the whole, quite a majority of our compatriots remained accommodation.  According to them, the proposed rooms were quite spacious and with everything necessary.  Furniture and appliances are not new, but everything is in normal working condition.  Guests say that when checking in, a hotel employee checks to see if everything in the room is functioning.  If any malfunction is detected, it will be fixed in the very near future, or you will be offered to move to other apartments. </p><p>  As for cleaning, it was carried out regularly and efficiently.  Travelers also claim that the cleaners here are not too lazy to build funny figures from towels almost every day.  And they do it regardless of whether you leave them a tip or not.  Such funny monkeys, swans and other animals especially appealed to the kids. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As for the shortcomings, some guests complained about this fact: in case of an early arrival at the Crystal Cyrene Hotel 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh) they were forced to wait two hours in the afternoon, while they did not give out bracelets, so the guests could not go for breakfast or dinner.  However, this problem was easily solved if you pay extra for the reception for early check-in.  For our compatriots this cost about $ 30.  In this case, they were immediately placed in the room assigned to them. </p><p>  Another disadvantage of a number of guests considers expensive Internet at the hotel.  Therefore, many guests bought a local SIM card with an Internet package.  It costs about ten dollars.  And the Internet is enough for a few days in order to exchange messages in instant messengers and check mail. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews about the territory and location of the hotel </h2><p>  As for the territory of the Crystal Cyrene Hotel (Ex. Sol Cyrene) 4 *, it seemed to our compatriots quite large and well-groomed.  There is not so much greenery as near the neighboring Crystal Charm Hotel.  However, due to the fact that both hotels are on the same network, you can stroll through the common area.  But at the same time, guests warn that it is impossible to use the infrastructure of another hotel.  So, for example, if you live in Crystal Sirens, then you cannot go for lunch at Crystal Charm restaurant. </p><p>  As for the location of the hotel, then, according to tourists, it can be called remote from the center.  So, you can get to the Old Town and Naami Bay by taxi or bus.  Moreover, a taxi sometimes comes out cheaper, especially if you cooperate with other guests who want to leave the hotel.  Tourists claim that if you catch a taxi near the hotel, you can agree on a price of $ 6 one way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crystal cyrene 4 reviews" class="if" height="246" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/970722.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  The issue of food, as a rule, in the reviews of tourists about hotels causes a lot of disagreement.  The Crystal Cyrene 4 * hotel (Sharm-El-Sheikh, Egypt) was no exception. </p><p>  So, a number of guests claim that the food here is not very well organized.  According to them, almost all dishes are seasoned with a large number of spices, and it is impossible to eat them.  In addition, some guests in their comments complained about the fact that the cooks in the restaurant, when distributing meat to their compatriots, put the best pieces, and tourists from Russia and the CIS allegedly choose worse. </p><p>  However, most travelers claim that there are no problems with food at this hotel.  According to them, the menu does have dishes with seasonings, but they are few.  And there is always the opportunity to choose food to your taste.  Of course, the variety of dishes here cannot be compared with a five-star hotel, but it is definitely impossible to stay hungry.  Tourists also assure: if in a restaurant it seems to you that the cook has put on your plate too small or unsightly a piece of meat, then you can well tell him about it and ask for a replacement. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crystal cyrene hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="246" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/970721.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Most tourists come to Egypt, of course, mainly for a beach holiday on the Red Sea.  Crystal Cyrene 4 * (Egypt, Sharm El Sheikh), although it is located some distance from the sea, has its own sandy beach.  More specifically, the local beach belongs to two hotels - Crystal Sirens and Crystal Charm.  The distance to it is about 500 meters.  You can walk, or you can get to the shore by a small bus provided by the hotel.  Transfer is organized regularly. </p><p>  But still, most vacationers preferred to make a pleasant walk to the sea on foot.  According to them, the beach can be reached in measured steps in just ten minutes.  The transfer was used mainly by elderly people and tourists with young children. </p><p>  The beach at the hotel is spacious, sandy.  There is a sufficient number of sunbeds for everyone.  The reef is off the coast of the inanimate, so there are no masses of underwater inhabitants here.  But when you enter the water there are no corals that you risk seriously injuring your legs.  Therefore, you can swim without special shoes.  If you want to go in for snorkeling and watch the fascinating life of the underwater world, you can walk a few hundred meters to neighboring hotels with live reefs. </p><p>  You can have a good time on the territory of the Crystal Cyrene 4 * hotel.  Guest reviews contain information that there are very good pools.  They are regularly cleaned.  Nearby there are sun terraces and bars where you can enjoy a drink.  You can also have a junk food in the snack bar.  Throughout the day, animators work at the hotel complex.  They offer vacationers to do yoga, water aerobics, gymnastics, play volleyball or darts, as well as take part in fun contests.  In the evening, amphitheater hosts entertaining shows and performances.  The animators here, according to our compatriots, are unobtrusive and pleasant. </p><h2>  Personnel Impression </h2><p>  In general, the reviews of our compatriots practically do not contain negative comments addressed to the employees of the Crystal Siren Hotel.  However, some dissatisfaction, as mentioned above, relates to cooks serving portioned dishes in a restaurant.  But this problem is very easy to fix.  The remaining employees, according to most tourists, are friendly and pleasant people, and also do a good job of their duties. </p>
