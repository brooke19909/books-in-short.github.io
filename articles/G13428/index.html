    <p>  Beach holidays in Phuket - the most popular.  Most hotels are built directly on the beach, so often the choice of hotel primarily depends on which beach it is located on.  Most of the coast is very clean and with convenient access to the water. </p><h2>  Phuket Holidays </h2><p>  The beaches of the island differ mainly in the number of hotels, as well as places where tourists can have fun.  And already depends on the development of infrastructure is expensive or cheap vacation.  Phuket's beaches are plentiful, but the eleven largest are the most popular among tourists.  It was they who liked our compatriots.  Among them are Patong, Kata, Karon, and, of course, Surin Beach.  Phuket, reviews of staying on which almost everything is positive, is snow-white sand, emerald waves rolling on the shore, amazing nature, exotic food and hotels for every taste and affluence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The best season for arriving in Phuket is considered the time from November to April.

Here you can find a cheap accommodation option - for only 300 baht per day (about 440 rubles).  But there are apartments, the cost of which starts with thirty thousand (about 49 thousand rubles). </p>

    <p>  According to experts, the best beaches of this Thai island are located on its west coast.  They have developed infrastructure and convenient access to the water.  And one of them is Surin Beach.  Many people choose Phuket because of its highly developed tourist infrastructure.  Here you can not only relax comfortably, but also see the local attractions that this exotic island is so rich in. </p><h2>  Description of "Surin" </h2><p>  Of course, Patong is considered the most popular, especially among young people.  There are all the possibilities for entertainment.  In Patong you can find a hotel for every taste and wealth. </p><p>  In contrast, Surin Beach (Phuket) is a place where it is difficult to find cheap hotels.  Located on the west coast, it is more suitable for high-income people.  This is a fairly calm resort area, somewhat reminiscent of a small coastal village.  Tourists are waiting for the purest white sand, which looks especially impressive against the background of the turquoise sea water.  Surin Beach <span>(Phuket), the photo of</span> which is presented below, judging by the reviews, is very cozy.  In the season from April to November there is a fairly strong surf, so because of the strong waves, few swim. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Where is </h2><p>  Surin Beach (Phuket), the advantages of which have been appreciated by our compatriots for a long time, is filled in the high season not only by lovers of swimming and sunbathing, but also by those who cannot imagine themselves without surfing, boogie boarding, etc. It is located on west coast of the island, half an hour from Patong towards the north.  To get to it, you need to drive through Kamala, past the turn to Laem Singh Beach, at the fork with three roads, turn left.  A few minutes later, the beach "Surin".  Phuket is a place that many rich people have chosen for themselves.  And one of the places where you can see the most luxurious villas is its west coast. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The beach "Surin" has a length of a little less than a kilometer.  Impressive stones are set in the water along its borders.  It is quite wide, although in high season the beach, densely lined with sunbeds and umbrellas, does not seem spacious.  The ebbs and flows in this part of the coast are not as pronounced as, for example, in the neighboring Bang Tao.  Here the water does not go several tens of meters.  Another advantage of Surin is sand.  Depending on the illumination, its color changes from yellow to snow-white.  Water in the sea is transparent azure.  There is practically no silt.  The combination of white sand, the emerald sea and bright umbrellas with frills fluttering in the wind, judging by the reviews, creates a kind of festive atmosphere. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Many Europeans choose the Surin Beach (Phuket) for their holidays.  The disadvantages of this resort area are few.  Like many other beaches located on the west coast of Phuket, Surin also abounds with quite strong undercurrents, especially in the rainy season.  Therefore, tourists have to be extremely careful when bathing from April to November.  And of course, another disadvantage of Surin is its high cost. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The beach is constantly cleaned, in addition, trash bins are installed everywhere.  Apparently, therefore, it is always clean and tidy here.  In high season, it is crowded.  Unlike the more ‚Äúrelaxed‚Äù spacious neighboring Bang Tao, Surin is considered a party place.  Here you can meet a lot of young people.  Already approaching the beach, you feel its comfort.  It provides everything that is necessary for a comfortable stay: umbrellas, deck chairs, several massage parlors, many outlets.  Water activities are widely represented.  Inexpensive cafes alternate with fashionable restaurants.  Surin is not as noisy as, for example, Patong.  Here you can ride a "banana", rent a catamaran or <span>water skiing,</span> go sailing.  On the south side of the beach there is an expanse for divers: scuba diving enthusiasts can see flocks of colorful fish swimming among the rocks. </p>

    <h2>  Hotels on Surin Beach </h2><p>  Wealthy foreigners have long been chosen by Phuket, many of whom have built luxury villas here.  Most of them are located in the Surin area.  In general, this Thai beach is often called a real "paradise" for millionaires.  After all, it is Surin that has the highest building density in fashionable hotels.  There are a lot of people who want to relax on this expensive Thai beach, even though there are few budget hotels here, and they need to be booked in a few months. </p><p>  Of the five-star ones, the most famous are Baan Phu Prana Boutique Villa, considered the hotel for the ‚Äúchosen ones‚Äù The Surin, which occupies a vast territory of Twinpalms, etc. Most of them are luxury cottages equipped with everything you need.  Among the four-star hotels, the most popular are Ayara Hilltops, Sansuri Phuket and others. </p>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Almost a third of all hotel complexes available here offer accommodation at a price of about a hundred dollars a day.  There are, of course, such hotels in which a night in a room will cost three hundred or even five hundred.  e. I must say that you will not surprise anyone: after all, Surin Beach has always been considered a place where wealthy tourists go to rest.  And therefore, everything is provided here to meet their needs and maximize profits.  For example, the Twinpalms Phuket hotel, typical of Surin, occupying an incredibly large territory and offering developed infrastructure and service, offers customers rooms ranging in price from four hundred to one thousand two hundred dollars. </p><p>  One of the most expensive apartments in Amanpuri are considered to be in the closed area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beach - Pansea.  Accommodation in it is not available for average tourists, since the cost of rooms starts from a thousand dollars. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  I must say that, despite such a high cost, local hotels are always crowded in the high season.  And not only relatively cheap, but also the most fashionable.  Many Europeans choose the hotels on the Surin beach for their holidays.  Phuket, reviews about the rest on which, without exception, are full of enthusiasm, is truly a paradise.  And Surin, with its crystal clear water and picturesque landscapes, stands out among the other beaches of the island. </p><p>  Most Russians who visited the resort liked the hotel they stayed in.  Spacious rooms, all amenities, well-developed infrastructure - all this was appreciated by our compatriots quite high. </p>

    <p>  Most food hotels only offer breakfast.  It must be said that those who come to Phuket with young children prefer to choose an accommodation option in which there is an opportunity to cook for themselves.  As for the beach itself, the vast majority of Russians intend to return here more than once.  No one found any cons, but Surin has so many advantages that it cannot be listed.  And first of all it concerns cleanliness.  The entrance to the water is comfortable, gentle, the depth begins with only ten meters.  Many liked the fact that almost all the cafes from the beach were demolished.  In general, our compatriots are happy with their vacation in Phuket. </p>
