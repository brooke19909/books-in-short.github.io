Possible options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Password is a very unreliable thing.  Users often forget it.  And it turns out an unpleasant situation if it was an access code to a mobile device (smartphone or tablet).  And this situation is really unpleasant.  However, it can be fixed.  How to unlock a Huawei phone if I forget my password?  This will be discussed in the presented material.  But first, we just list all the possible ways to unlock it.  By the way, there are not so many of them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="joyofandroid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock huawei phone if you forgot your password" class="if uuid-3026766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3026766.jpg"></div><h2>  How to unlock your smartphone </h2><p>  There are several ways to unlock your Huawei phone without a password.  Or rather, two.  The first of them is more gentle, and the second is recommended to be used exclusively in the most extreme cases.  These are the ways.  They are radically different from each other. </p><ul><li>  Using Google Accounts.  If the access code to the device is forgotten, then you can try to restore access using the Google account.  But this option does not always work.  Only if the smartphone has been tied to the account in advance and there is Internet access. </li><li>  Force reset.  When using this option, the user will lose all data located on the device‚Äôs internal storage.  This is carried out using system recovery. </li></ul><p>  If, in order to use the first method, it is necessary that certain conditions are met beforehand, then the second will work in one hundred percent of cases.  Unlocking a Huawei phone without a password is only possible using the two options listed above.  It will not work in any other way.  Now we turn to a detailed analysis of each of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ria.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="unlock huawei phone if you forgot your password" class="if uuid-3026799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3026799.jpg"></div><h2>  Method number 1.  Google Account </h2><p>  So how to unlock your Huawei phone if you forget your password using Google Account?  This requires an active Internet connection on the device.  If Wi-Fi or data transfer are disabled, then nothing will work.  However, suppose there is internet.  What is the access recovery guide?  She is extremely simple. </p><ol><li>  Enter the password incorrectly 5 times (exactly five). </li><li>  We are waiting for the text "Forgot Password" to appear and click on it. </li><li>  The main window for logging in to your Google account will appear. </li><li>  Enter your account information. </li><li>  Click "Login." </li><li>  Access restored.  Change the password in the settings. </li><li>  We write it on a separate leaf. </li></ol><p>  This is how the unlock happens.  Huawei phone, if you forget the password, in fact, is pliable for such manipulations.  Yes, in principle, and any other device on Android, too.  Here with the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù would be a problem.  But what if all the data on the Google account is also forgotten?  Or no internet connection?  In this case, you will have to use the most radical way.  There is no getting away from this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock huawei phone without password" class="if uuid-3026803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3026803.jpg"></div><h2>  Method number 2.  Reset to factory settings </h2><p>  Those who are going to apply this particular method must understand that all information on the internal drive will be deleted: photos, pictures, videos, music and applications.  The phone will return to its original state.  As if just been purchased.  Instructions for implementing this process are as follows. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Turn off the phone completely (using the physical button). </li><li>  And now turn on the volume up button while holding down the button. </li><li>  We are waiting for the logo to load and release the volume button. </li><li>  We get into the recovery and click Wipe Data / Factory Reset. </li><li>  We agree to the deletion of data using the Yes item. </li><li>  We return to the previous page using the "Back" button. </li><li>  Select the Reboot System Now item. </li><li>  We are waiting for the operating system to load. </li><li>  Enter your Google account data and generally set up your smartphone. </li><li>  We use it. </li></ol><p>  And this instruction tells in detail about how to unlock a Huawei phone if you forget your password.  Experts recommend using this method as little as possible, since this is stress for the device and the operating system as a whole.  But the loss of almost all user data also plays a role. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dottech.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="unlock huawei phone without password" class="if uuid-3026811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3026811.jpg"></div><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  There are several ways to unlock your smartphone from Huawei.  But it will be better if the user remembers the password, since the loss of all data is unpleasant.  Nevertheless, the operation to restore access is quite possible.  The first method, of course, is more pleasant, but it does not always work.  And the second, although quite radical, always works.  This is because the settings are reset at the hardware level, and the system has no chance to resist it.  By the way, if a custom recovery is installed on the smartphone, it is recommended to backup the system.  This minimizes losses when resetting to factory settings. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we received an answer to the question of how to unlock a Huawei phone if you forgot your password.  It is worth noting immediately that the above instructions apply not only to devices from a company from the Middle Kingdom.  In the same way, you can restore access to devices from Samsung, NTS, Xiaomi, Honor, Nokia and other manufacturers.  In general, all on which Android operating systems are installed.  There is nothing complicated about it.  The main thing is to strictly follow the above algorithm.  And then no problems will arise.  And if even the second method does not help, you will have to carry the smartphone to the service center, as there is clearly something wrong with it. </p>
