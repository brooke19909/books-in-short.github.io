This device had a slight overall height and was set in motion by human power.  The first large-scale sightseeing attraction was designed in 1893 by engineer George Washington Gail Ferris Jr.  The diameter of the wheel was 75 meters, and at the same time 2160 people could ride it.  The attraction made its full revolution in 20 minutes.  In our country, the first such roundabout was commissioned in 1912 in St. Petersburg.  At that time, there was still no debate about where <span>in the world is the largest ferris wheel.</span>  This type of attraction was then considered a symbol of progress in engineering.  Gradually, such carousels became more and more popular.  For a long time, the Moscow attraction was considered the record holder in our country.  It was opened to the 850th anniversary of the founding of the capital in 1995.  The height of the largest ferris wheel in Russia was 73 meters.  This record was broken only in 2012.

The chief engineer of the project was Vladimir Gnezdilov, who had previously specialized in the construction of attractions of this category.  Due to its amazing size, the carousel immediately received the title of the highest in our country.  At the same time, the attraction is made in accordance with modern safety standards.  The height of the largest Ferris wheel in Russia is 83.5 m. Those who wish to ride can choose an open or closed cabin, there are equal numbers of them on the ride, 14 of each type.  The carousel completes a full revolution in 8 minutes.  From the upper tiers opens a picturesque panorama of the sea and mountains.  The largest ferris wheel in Russia in Sochi is incredibly popular among locals and tourists.  What is especially nice, a skiing session costs from 250 rubles.

What is curious, in many parks they also install children's mini-versions of this attraction, designed for riding kids.  The largest ferris wheel in Russia is located in Sochi.  In what other cities can you ride on very high attractions of this type?  The second in the ranking of the largest carousels is in Rostov-on-Don.  This is a modern building 65 meters high, with the romantic name "One Sky".  In Ufa, everyone can ride a sightseeing attraction, the height of which is 60 meters.  The main highlight of the giant carousel is year-round operation.  There is its own high-rise ferris wheel in Kazan, its height is 55 meters.  All these amazing figures seem insignificant in comparison with the sizes of the largest attractions in the world of this category.

    <p>  One of the most famous ferris wheels in the world is located in London (Great Britain).  This is the <span>London Eye,</span> whose height is 135 meters.  What is noteworthy, the London Eye is more of an observation wheel than a ferris wheel.  Its main feature is the mounting of the cabs on the outside of the rim, while in the classic version the cabs are suspended from the movable part.  But this attraction is not the most unusual in its class. </p><p>  In 1999, a ferris wheel was built for the exhibition in the Netherlands.  Instead of the usual cabins, it was equipped with special platforms for securing cars.  The attraction struck the imagination of observers, but for some reason this version of the design did not become as popular as the classic one. </p>
