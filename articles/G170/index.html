    <h2>  General description of the hotel </h2><p>  A light two-story building with balconies more likely gives the impression of a cozy apartment building than a government hotel.  The hotel has two swimming pools, a bar, a restaurant and a garden.  Cozy rooms, a large lounge with a seating area, a number of additional services are provided for guests.  Wi-Fi works stably everywhere. </p><p>  If necessary, the administration of Flisvos Beach Rethymno 3 * can provide a well-equipped conference room.  The hotel provides a buffet in the dining room three times a day.  At the reception there are safes with a rental of 10 euros per day. </p><p>  The main part of the hotel was built in the 90s, and in 1998 a partial reconstruction was made, the complex was completed, a garden and a second pool appeared. </p><p>  According to the reviews of tourists who have been here, you need to consider that the hotel does not smoke at all.  Therefore, when planning a vacation, it is worth keeping this in mind, since it is impossible to agree with the locals regarding cigarettes, and the fire safety system picks up even a faint hint of smoke. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel address </h2><p>  <span>Flisvos Beach Hotel</span> 3 * is located on the waterfront, fifty meters from the water line.  Closer to the azure waves of the <span>Cretan Sea</span> - only beach umbrellas.  The quiet street of Ari Velouhioti, stretching along the coast, at which the hotel stands at number 47, gives a misleading impression of deserts and lack of traffic, mainly due to a serious speed limit for cars. </p><p>  In fact, all public transport routes pass nearby, there are a large number of restaurants, including Turkish kebabs, famous throughout the island.  Flisvos Beach stands in the very center of Rethymnon, and within walking distance is not only wonderful sand and <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãwaves,</span> but also a large number of attractions. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Tourists usually arrive in Crete by plane, at the Nikos Kazantzakis airport in Heraklion.  From there you can get to the Flisvos Hotel in Rethymnon in different ways, it all depends on your own preferences and finances: </p><ul><li>  taxi, perhaps the most simple and familiar means of transportation, will cost a hundred euros, and the trip will take an hour from the door of the airport terminal to the hotel entrance; </li><li>  the bus is more interesting, but not very convenient, because you have to find a bus station in Heraklion, from where the buses leave strictly on schedule, the trip itself will take an hour and a half and will cost only eight euros; </li><li>  car - there are car rental locations throughout Crete, including near the airport in Heraklion, it makes sense to hire a car if you plan a big independent trip around the island, the pricing policy is affordable, you can bargain, and the roads are very simple in terms of navigation for example, from Heraklion to the Flisvos Hotel in Rethymnon, you just need to take the E75 highway along the coast. </li></ul><p>  Most of those who come for the first time use taxi services.  But those who return to Crete for the second or third, fourth time prefer the bus.  The fact is that the whole island is riddled with routes, and the cars themselves are quite comfortable, and their delivery is always on schedule.  Therefore, it is enough to simply plan your own time and, leaving your luggage in the luggage room of the bus station, take a walk around Heraklion. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A long-distance bus finishes the route to Rethymno just two hundred meters from the hotel, however, if you wish, you can call a taxi to a stop.  Voyage will cost seven to five euros and take ten minutes. </p><p>  Or you can walk to the Unknown Soldiers Square and take the local bus route, taking a ride through the entire center to the hotel, which will cost one euro and five to ten minutes of time. </p><p>  According to tourists, the absence of a direct transfer from Flisvos Beach services does not bother at all, the number of regular hotel guests returning to it from year to year also speaks about this. </p>

    <h2>  Where to go next? </h2><p>  If the restaurant at the hotel seems boring, then there are a lot of wonderful places nearby.  For example, the Akropolis tavern, where prices are quite acceptable: meat dishes - from 7 euros, salads and pizza - from 5 euros, real <span>Greek coffee</span> - from 2.5 euros.  To find the tavern, from the hotel you need to turn right, go up to the center of the island. </p><p>  According to tourists who often come to Flisvos Beach, everything that is closer to the center and further from the promenade of the promenade is several times cheaper, whether it be coffee or souvenirs, or just household goods. </p><p>  Also in the direction of the center there are local pastry shops where you can taste amazing coffee from 2 to 20 euros per cup and local pies with different fillings at a price of one and a half euros. </p><p>  If there is a desire to feel the real local flavor, to feel like a resident of Crete, and not a visitor, then, leaving the hotel, you need to turn left, at the first intersection turn towards the center and go up to the second line from the embankment.  Here begins a network of fast foods and coffee houses, where locals prefer to have a bite to eat and drink coffee.  The most interesting thing is that the menu in such places is only in Greek, and the cost of the strongest coffee is only a half euros. </p><p>  If there is no desire to go far, then to the right of Flisvos Beach, just around the corner, the beautiful French tavern La Mare with a wonderful wine cellar and assortment of cheese, a full dinner here will cost 30-50 euros. </p><p>  Not far from the hotel, literally 150 meters along the promenade, there is an excellent water park and playgrounds with trampolines, animators and other entertainments, including multi-colored cotton candy. </p><p>  Three hundred meters from the hotel - rental of catamarans, jet skis and boats. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Crete is a small island.  In the lobby of the hotel there are guides with detailed routes, museum hours and bus schedules.  Also included are maps of the island for renting cars with marked roads leading to places of interest to tourists. </p><p>  In the immediate vicinity is the old city and the Venetian fortress, and 20 km away is the famous Arkadi Monastery, which usually takes a full day to visit. </p><p>  They travel to Crete, not only to see the ruins of Antiquity, but also to spend several days in peace and quiet, enjoying water, sand, delicious food and a huge Mediterranean moon, looking at the terraces at night.  Often a vacation in Greece involves a lot of shopping. </p><p>  All this: at least relaxation on the beach, at least routes rich in impressions, visiting ancient ruins, at least buying a fur coat - you can do it by staying at Flisvos Beach Rethymno 3 *. </p>
