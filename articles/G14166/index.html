    <p>  <span>Provincial property appeared in connection with the expansion and exit of the Roman Empire far beyond the Apennine Peninsula.</span>  <span>Since the rest of the territory, except Italy, Quirit law could not be realized, the authorities of the Empire had to come up with a different way to regulate private ownership of property.</span>  <span>Therefore, the so-called provincial property was created, by which a person received the right to use state property in order to extract certain benefits from it.</span> </p><p>  <span>Peregrinsky property was called property belonging to persons without Roman citizenship (peregrines).</span>  <span>They obeyed rules that did not apply in the empire.</span>  <span>Therefore, foreigners could not have full protection in a Roman court in contentious issues concerning property.</span>  <span>Over time, Peregrinsky property ceased to exist as such and merged with the bonitary property.</span> </p><p>  <span>Quirite, Bonitarnaya, provincial, and Peregrine property are the main types of property that have ever existed on the territory of the Roman Empire.</span> </p><h2>  Features of Roman Law </h2><p>  <span>In Roman property law, Quiritic and Bonitarian property existed side by side with each other.</span>  <span>This was due not only to the conditions that had developed in the state, but also to the mentality of the native Romans.</span> </p><p>  <span>The main feature of the thinking of the Romans, whose state over time became simply of immense proportions at that time, was the positioning of their ethnic group as dominant in the country.</span>  <span>Therefore, the conservative orders laid down by the ancestors were unshakable.</span>  <span>However, the Romans were very pragmatic and understood that the bureaucratic swamp did not allow speculators and ordinary citizens to conduct business efficiently.</span> </p>
