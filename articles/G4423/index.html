Scarf snood</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A scarf collar, and in a modern way - snood, gained its popularity a couple of decades ago.  And he returned again, taking one of the first places among the winter accessories that are relevant this winter. </p><h2>  Which to choose </h2><p>  How to choose a circular <span>scarf?</span>  <span>Knit</span> or crochet?  We will consider knitting.  What is meant by snud?  This is an ordinary scarf connected in a ring.  The easiest and fastest way to make it is to take your favorite scarf and sew the ends.  You got a clamp. </p><p>  Scarf collar has its own varieties.  It can be in one revolution, in two and even in three.  It also has a different width.  It can be small, just to warm the neck in winter, and can be very large.  This width is most often used to combine in one product both a scarf and a hood at once.  These scarves are very practical.  They warm on the street, and in the room they turn into an extravagant and voluminous scarf. </p><p>  Also, a circular scarf with knitting needles can be complemented with such an accessory as a button.  It diversifies the structure of your product, namely, you can not sew the edges, but fasten them on one large or several small buttons.  It all depends on your taste and views. </p><h2>  The easiest way </h2><p>  Probably the easiest and fastest way to create a <span>scarf-snood with knitting needles</span> is to tie it with a front smooth surface.  Let's look at an example. </p><ol><li>  Dial the required number of loops (let it be 15) in order to see how our finished product will look. </li><li>  Knit the first row with facial loops.  Do not forget to remove the first (edge) loop.  This is necessary so that the edges are neat and delicate. </li><li>  Then turn over and knit the second row with purl stitches. </li><li>  We knit the third row again.  Remember the edge loop. </li><li>  We knit the fourth row with the wrong ones. </li><li>  Having knitted twenty rows in this way, you will already see our facial surface. </li></ol><p>  Thus, the knitted circular scarf with knitting needles will have a very elastic shape and stretch well.  Also gives your product a little volume.  This knitting method can be applied to any yarn.  Perfect for needlewomen who are just learning and want to make their own warming beauty for the winter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting scarf" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43946/1506389.jpg" width="417"></div>

It can be knitted both on ordinary knitting needles, and on circular.  And how to knit a circular scarf with knitting needles, we will consider further. </p><h2>  Seamless scarf </h2><p>  How <span>to knit a scarf snood</span> seamlessly?  Circular knitting needles!  On such knitting needles, as well as on ordinary, absolutely any collar can be connected.  Whether it‚Äôs an openwork drawing or an <span>English gum.</span>  But there are a few tricks to create the right and beautiful product. </p><p>  When making loops and knitting the first rows, make sure that the loops do not twist.  Everyone should lie flat and clear. </p><p>  To mark the beginning of a row, mark it with a pin or colored thread. </p><p>  A set of loops is done on a single needle, in a standard way. </p><p>  When knitting on circular knitting needles, the removal of edge loops can not be done.  Since knitting is done in a circle, this need disappears. </p><p>  To prevent our wire from twisting during operation, lower it for several minutes in hot water.  So it will become smooth, and will work much easier. </p><p>  To simplify the task, the loops must be evenly spread along the entire length of the wire and the spokes themselves.  Avoid finding loops in one place.  This way you prevent spaces in the picture. </p><h2>  Knit for children </h2><p>  A children's circular scarf with knitting needles knits much faster and easier than an adult.  The scarf is not particularly wide for children.  To do it to fulfill the duties of a hood is still unnecessary.  It can subside and is blown away by the wind.  Children can knit a beautiful scarf ribbon that will fit snugly and warm their neck.  And you can connect the ends with a beautiful large button. </p><p>  In order for the child not to freeze in the harsh winter, <span>garter stitch is</span> perfect <span>.</span>  This is when each row fits only facial.  Voluminous and plush yarn are perfect for children. </p>

Carefully read the composition of the yarn.  It is worth choosing semi-woolen materials.

You can do as you wish. </p><p>  We knit all the rows with facial loops.  Try not to tighten the yarn and knit more freely.  Otherwise, a very rough product may result. </p><p>  Having knitted the required number of rows, we close our loops. </p><p>  Sew a beautiful button.  For a snug fit, you can add several hidden fasteners. </p><h2>  For the stronger sex </h2><p>  Men, like women, follow fashion and do not mind pampering themselves with the purchase of a winter accessory.  To please your man, tie him a scarf snood.  Circular knitting needles <em> </em>  it will be faster and easier to do.  It is worth choosing yarn of darker shades, gray or even black.  Also, a product from bulk yarn will constantly remind him of the house and the love with which you knitted a scarf. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit a circular scarf with knitting needles" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43946/1506419.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For men, more restrained patterns are suitable.  For example, Polish gum. </p><ul><li>  Dial the desired number of loops. </li><li>  Knit the first row with facial loops. </li><li>  Second row.  Remove the edge loop (if you knit on a circular, then it is not necessary) Then the wrong side and three facial, again the wrong side and three facial.  So to the end of the row. </li><li>  Third row.  Three purl, one obverse, three purl, one obverse.  So to the end of the row. </li><li>  Fourth row.  One wrong side, three facial, one wrong side, three facial.  To the end of the row. </li><li>  Fifth row.  Three wrong side, one front.  To the end of the row. </li><li>  Alternate rows in this way to the height you need. </li></ul><h2>  Pattern for all </h2><p>  In order not to search and not to guess which pattern to choose, use a picture called ‚Äúrice‚Äù.  This pattern is perfect for both the female half and the male.  A children's scarf with such a pattern will be a good warming element.  Technique of execution. </p><p>  Dial the required number of loops. </p><p>  First row.  Knit alternately: facial, wrong side, facial, wrong side. </p><p>  Second row.  In the place of the front knit purl, in place of the purl - facial.  Thus, it turns out something like knots. </p><p>  Alternate the first and second row to the end of your product. </p><p>  This pattern can be customized as you wish.  For example: you have thin yarn, but want the knots to be larger.  Then alternate in two loops.  Two facial, two purl, and vice versa.  If you made a choice in the direction of bulk yarn, then it will be enough to knit one loop each. </p><p>  Do not tighten the knitting too much!  This pattern implies splendor and softness.  Of course, much depends on the yarn itself.  If you knit very tight, the product will be very rough and tough. </p><h2>  How to calculate the required number of loops </h2><p>  Many needlewomen at the beginning of their journey are faced with the problem of constantly dressing started.  This is because the number of loops is initially incorrectly calculated.  Even if you took a ready-made description and diagram, it may not necessarily turn out what is in the picture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork circular scarf with knitting needles" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43946/1506426.jpg" width="372"></div>

    <ul><li>  In order to calculate the number of loops you need, first measure the circumference of the head. </li><li>  Then select the picture you like. </li><li>  Knit a small piece with this pattern, ten centimeters wide and high.  So you can understand how the finished product will look like. </li><li>  In addition, count how many loops are in these 10 centimeters.  Multiply them by the length you need.  For example, the head circumference is 50 cm. In 10 cm there are 20 loops.  So, for your product you need to dial 100 loops. </li><li>  Also do not forget to include rapport in your calculations.  Incorrect counting can bring down your drawing.  Usually, with each scheme, the number of loops required for rapport is given. </li></ul><h2>  We decorate our snud </h2><p>  Knitting a circular scarf with knitting needles does not end with a simple performance.  Each of us wants to complement our image with some zest and a flower.  In order to decorate our product, you need imagination and skill. </p><ul><li>  You can make a beautiful flower crocheted.  To make it the same color as a collar, or, conversely, contrasting, is everyone's business.  The size of the flower also depends on your preference.  You can make one big or many small ones.  Many colorful flowers on the chest will warm you with thoughts about the approaching summer. </li><li>  Complement it with a large button, such as wood or with numerous rhinestones.  Sew one or more different sizes. </li><li>  A brooch in the form of an insect or a flower will look simple and very original.  Bright and shiny lizard, hidden in a pattern of woolen threads, will not leave anyone indifferent. </li><li>  If, for example, you made yourself a scarf-collar in the form of a hood, then you can add a small pompom. </li><li>  You can also tie ordinary buttons with yarn yourself. </li></ul><p>  There are many ideas for decorating, plug in your imagination, and you will get an exclusive winter accessory. </p><h2>  How nice to close the loop </h2><p>  If you knit a scarf-clamp on ordinary knitting needles, then at the end the question will arise about how to make the seam less noticeable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="circular scarf knitting english rubber band" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43946/1506453.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <ul><li>  Option one.  Just close the stitches and carefully sew the edges with a regular thread and needle.  The color of the thread should be chosen to match the yarn. </li><li>  The second option.  The trick of the craftswomen.  In order to make the seam thinner and invisible, do the following.  Once you have finished the product and the last row is knitted, set aside the spoke with the product.  At the beginning of your product, draw the same number of loops using a hook and a spare knitting needle.  Then close all the stitches from the two knitting needles at the same time. </li><li>  The third option.  Use circular knitting needles.  When working with them, no question about the seams will arise. </li></ul><p>  We examined several options for making a snud.
