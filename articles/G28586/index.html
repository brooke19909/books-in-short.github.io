    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The Boutique Hotel Terramarina Beach Club is not immune from shortcomings and shortcomings.  Reviews contain such negative comments: </p><ul><li>  tasteless breakfasts, after which most of the guests remain hungry (these are, as a rule, scrambled eggs, sticky porridge and the cheapest sausages); </li><li>  in the dining room almost never include air conditioning, but because there it is very hot, stuffy and smells like food; </li><li>  paid use of beach towels (2 euros per day); </li><li>  there is only one elevator working for a large seven-story hotel, near which queues are always going (it is faster to reach the upper floors on foot); </li><li>  photos of the rooms presented on the hotel‚Äôs official website do not correspond to reality (in reality, the rooms are much smaller and the repair is not so fresh); </li><li>  poor soundproofing in the rooms (in the room you can hear everything that happens on the street, in the corridor and in the neighboring apartments); </li><li>  air conditioners work very noisy, which is especially felt at night (even to the extent that you have to turn off the device and open the window); </li><li>  it is bad that the hotel does not have parking (you have to use the services of private paid parking); </li><li>  maids do not change bed linen in the rooms (you have to strongly remind them of this); </li><li>  during cleaning do not wash the dishes that are in the room; </li><li>  the rooms lack electric kettles and bottles of drinking water; </li><li>  the outdoor pool is very small and completely groomed; </li><li>  in the gym there are only three simulators that are in poor condition (the room is also very small and stuffy); </li><li>  tasteless pastries in a restaurant (most likely, they don‚Äôt cook it on the spot, but buy it in a supermarket); </li><li>  on mattresses, oilcloth mattress covers are put on, which rustle at the slightest movement; </li><li>  there is practically no entertainment for children, although a lot of them relax in the hotel; </li><li>  lizards and insects often run in rooms; </li><li>  on the tables in the restaurant, paper tablecloths are laid, which is more suitable for an inexpensive hostel than for a four-star hotel; </li><li>  the beach is very small, and therefore, when guests go out to relax by the sea, there is simply nowhere for an apple to fall on the shore; </li><li>  there are not enough tables in the restaurant, and therefore guests often have to wait in line for dinner or breakfast outside the door of the establishment; </li><li>  in all rooms of the hotel there is an obsessive floral smell of an air freshener (in addition, it is eaten into hair and clothes); </li><li>  the hotel beach is located in close proximity to the port, which calls into question the purity of the water; </li><li>  the door to the bathroom is glass, which creates some discomfort (even though the glass is frosted); </li><li>  due to the fact that the wash basin has been taken out into the living area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room, the room is very damp; </li><li>  low-quality hookah; </li><li>  the white walls of the hotel corridors evoke associations with the hospital (I would like to add paintings or some other decor); </li><li>  uncomfortable beds with bulging mattresses (springs painfully stick into the back). </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  After examining the reviews of travelers about holidays in this Spanish hotel, we can say with confidence that it does not correspond to the high four-star status.  Expectations are justified only by professional, well-trained and helpful staff who carefully and promptly respond to requests from guests.  In all the rest, total savings are felt.  This also applies to the equipment of rooms, and external decoration, and food.  Repair in the rooms is already pretty outdated.  For all that is possible, guests are charged extra.  Nearby is a port and several industrial enterprises, which casts doubt on the cleanliness of air and sea water.  But the location regarding the sights is more than successful.  If you want to get to know Spain better and don‚Äôt intend to spend much time in the hotel, you are here. </p>
