  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Personality Structure in Sociology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There is more than one approach to the problem of personality structure in sociology.  <strong>The structure of personality in sociology</strong> is one of the most controversial issues.  Its consideration is distinguished by a rather large difference. </p><p>  There is a concept of Freud, according to which the personality structure in sociology is made up of three main elements - this is It (Id), I (Ego), Super-I (Super-Ego).  It is the subconscious, in which instincts dominate.  Two needs stand out in it: aggression and libido.  I am an element of consciousness that is connected in the unconscious, because ‚Äúit‚Äù periodically breaks out.  The superego is an internal censor that includes a set of <span>moral principles</span> and norms.  Consciousness is in conflict with the unconscious instincts penetrating into it, and on the other hand, with the prohibitions dictated by the Super-Self.  The resolution of these conflicts is mediated by sublimation (repression). </p><p>  For some time, Freud's ideas were considered unscientific.  But it was precisely with them that the personality structure in sociology began to be considered as multifaceted, and in human behavior I saw the struggle of biological and social principles. </p><p>  Modern Russian authors see the personality structure in sociology as a combination of three components: memory, culture, and activity.  Memory includes operational information and knowledge, culture - values ‚Äã‚Äãand <span>social norms,</span> activities - the implementation of human needs, desires, interests. </p><p>  <strong><span>The social structure of</span> personality in sociology is</strong> reflected in culture and vice versa.  The structure of personality correlates traditional and modern strata of culture.  In a crisis, when the upper <span>cultural layer is</span> affected <span>, the</span> lower traditional layer can be activated itself.  This occurs in conditions of breaking down moral and ideological norms and values.  A similar layer-by-layer removal of cultural strata is also characteristic for certain mental illnesses. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the analysis of the personality structure, it is impossible not to consider the relationship between social and individual principles.  Each person is unique and unique.  On the other hand, the personality is a social, collective being, collectivism is inherent in it. </p><p>  Until now, there is no unity between scientists in the question of whether a person is an individualist or collectivist by nature.  Supporters of both positions are many.  The solution to this issue is not only of theoretical importance.  The exit to the practice of education depends on him.  For many years in the USSR, collectivism was brought up as one of the most important <span>personality traits.</span>  In the West at this time, the emphasis was on individualism.  As practice shows, none of the options in its pure form is harmonious. </p><p>  <strong>Theories of personality in sociology are</strong> aimed at studying the relationship between the process of development and formation of personality with the development and functioning of social communities, the relationship of personality and society, of individual groups.  The most famous personality theories in sociology are the theory of the mirror "I", psychoanalytic theory, role theory of personality and <span>Marxist theory.</span> </p><p>  The theory of mirror ‚ÄúI‚Äù was developed by J. Mead and C. Cooley.  According to this doctrine, a person is a reflection of the reactions of other people.  Self-awareness determines the essence of a person. </p><p>  <span>The psychoanalytic theory</span> headed by Z. Freud is aimed at revealing the contradictions of the inner world of man, the psychological aspects of the relationship between man and society. </p><p>  Role theory was derived by T. Parsonson, R. Minton and R. Merton.  According to her, <span>social behavior is</span> described by two basic concepts: ‚Äúsocial role‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial status‚Äù.  Status means a person‚Äôs position in the social system.  A role is an action performed by a person who has a specific status. </p><p>  Marxist theory sees personality as a product of the development of an individual in society. </p>
