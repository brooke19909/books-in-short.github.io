On the site of the modern Brateevsky park then there was an unattractive wasteland, on which sand was actively mined.  As a result of the excavation of a significant amount of soil, a gulf formed here, which existed until the beginning of the 2000s.

The bay was filled up, an original relief was formed with an abundance of terraces and hills.  It was decided to turn this place into Brateevsky cascade park.  The grand opening of the recreation area took place in 2006. </p><p>  The first trees were planted on the territory, stairs with ramps, tiled walkways, lanterns and urns appeared.  Quite quickly, the recreation area began to be popular among residents of the nearest housing estates.  However, the park did not receive enough care.  Quickly, the recreation area began to litter and lost its original picturesque appearance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Improvement of Brateevsky park in 2016 </h2>

    <p>  Is it worth it to come specifically for a walk in Brateevsky Cascade Park?  Moscow is a very large city, and similar natural recreation areas can be found in almost any area.  To date, the park has no unique attractions, monuments and art objects.  And this means that a trip here from another district of Moscow can be justified only on the day of interesting events. </p>
