Multicook function in a multicooker</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Needless to say, today the multicooker has won the hearts of more than one housewife and firmly occupied the niche owed to her in the consumer market.  Which is not surprising, because its small bowl "fits" almost the entire kitchen, because it can replace many of the usual appliances of household appliances.  This is so important for those who suffer from a shortage of space, and we have a lot of such housewives, because most apartments, as you know, very rarely please their owners with large sizes. </p><h2>  Who needs a slow cooker? </h2><p>  By the way, the opinion that the multicooker is simply vital for those who cook a lot and really skillfully is erroneous.  A huge number of housewives - excellent cooks - perfectly do without any newfangled appliances.  A miracle pan is more likely to come in handy for those who are always in a hurry somewhere, constantly busy at work, or simply lazy not only to spend a lot of time at the stove, but also to understand the intricacies of cooking.  But for them, this device is a truly valuable asset.  But deciding to buy a slow cooker, you need to at least approximately understand what this unit is.  For all multicookers are different and have certain functions, some of which, by the way, are sometimes not needed at all.  And most of the questions are caused by the Multi-Cook mode in a multi-cooker.  Is he needed or not?  This almost Hamletian question is being asked by many consumers.  Therefore, now we will try to give an answer to it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, "Multipovar" - what is it and what is it "eaten" with? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="multipovar what is it" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/351036.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Determine the concept </h2><p>  I must say that for some this definition is somewhat strangely associated with the miracle pan itself.  So, many people think, having heard the word "multi-cooker", that this is some completely different household appliance that has nothing to do with a multicooker.  Moreover, sometimes the sellers themselves sin this, not really understanding the meaning of the concept, which is what misleads the consumer.  This is not a separate device. </p><p>  Therefore, it is necessary to clearly know about the "Multipovar" function, that this is a special program in a multi-cooker, created by and large for professionals, but, oddly enough, can significantly facilitate the preparation of food for beginners and those who would not like to spend a lot on this process time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="multi-cook function in a multicooker" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/351038.jpg?1394527230744" width="350"></div>

They can be both automatic - ‚Äúporridge‚Äù, ‚Äúbuckwheat‚Äù, ‚Äúpilaf‚Äù, ‚Äúrice‚Äù, and semi-automatic - ‚Äúfrying‚Äù, ‚Äústewing‚Äù, ‚Äúbaking‚Äù.  What is the difference?  The fact that using the first mode allows us to load all the required products into the bowl, after which it is enough to press the button of the selected program.  After that, the device itself will figure out how much time and what temperature will be needed to prepare a particular dish.  Semi-automatic give us the opportunity to choose this time on our own.  Such standard units differ only in the number of modes embedded in them.  And, accordingly, at a price.  But the program "Multipovar" in the multicooker allows you to cook dishes at your own discretion, setting all the necessary parameters manually. </p><h2>  "Multipovar" - what kind of regime is this? </h2><p>  As mentioned above, this mode gives each hostess a unique opportunity to regulate the temperature, as well as the cooking time.  We can cook whatever we want, since the Multi-Cook function in a multi-cooker is nothing more than a manual mode.  Therefore, if in automatic programs we cannot make our own corrections, then here - please.  How much is needed and how you want. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="multipovar polaris" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/351071.jpg?1394527269833" width="454"></div>

    <p>  Therefore, we have a unique opportunity to cook any dishes according to the most complex and interesting recipes.  True, if we talk about temperature, then it will not be possible to set it up to one degree, but by and large it is not particularly required.  As for the options, the minimum value is used as a guideline, which can then be increased at your own discretion. </p><p>  But in order to make it clearer, it is better to consider any specific example of how to work in the "Multi-cook" mode.  Polaris is a multicooker that enjoys well-deserved popularity among consumers, so let's dwell on it. </p><h2></h2><h2>  How it works? </h2><p>  In principle, everything is very, very simple.  The <span>Multi-Cook</span> function in the <span>Polaris multicooker</span> works on the basis of a combination of manual settings included in the program.  You can improvise in the following temperature conditions: from thirty-five degrees minimum and up to one hundred and sixty - maximum.  Each step allows you to change the temperature by five degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="multicook mode in a multicooker" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/351066.jpg?1394527324983" width="300"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In fact, it is by this principle that we set the time in the microwave.  In total, twenty-six combinations of settings are offered in manual mode, as for the time, with each click of a button you can increase it by five minutes.  Or just for one hour.  Agree, a fairly familiar and completely simple procedure.  By the way, there is a more ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù mode.  This is Multipovar Plus. </p><p>  It differs from the usual one in that we can set the temperature and time for cooking the selected dish more than once, but even create several stages of cooking, each with its own mode.  The most ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù ‚ÄúPolaris‚Äù make it possible to set as many as nine cooking stages, the maximum time of which can be set for 16 hours. </p><p>  And finally - about the most important thing.  Why, in fact, such difficulties? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="multi-cook program in a multicooker" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/351067.jpg?1394527356302" width="595"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  What does this give us? </h2><p>  For those who really love and know how to cook, the Multi-Chef function opens up enormous opportunities for creativity.  You can experiment, and not limit yourself to the scope of recipes available in the application to the multicooker or in numerous forums.  And even if you use some traditional method, then adapt it for yourself.  After all, let‚Äôs say, for example, someone loves meat with a crust, and someone only likes a little fried more. </p><p>  For those who do not like and do not really know how to cook, this is, firstly, a great opportunity to learn.  And secondly, a real way to really save time on cooking. </p><p>  So, now you know about the existence of the Multi-Cook function, what it is and how to use it. </p>
