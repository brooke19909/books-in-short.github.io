Unlike exotic countries, a flight to this state will be short-lived.  And the climate in Turkey does not require crumbs for long-term adaptation.  In this country, a reverent attitude towards children.  And the all-inclusive system - a kind of know-how of the tourism industry in Turkey - makes relaxing with a child completely hassle-free.  However, kids are moody and demanding creatures.  Where an adult feels like in paradise, the child is bored, or even starts to hurt.  Is vacation with children in Turkey so cloudless everywhere?  Where better to go, which resort to choose?  Let's understand the intricacies of a package holiday in Turkey.  And the feedback from parents who have already visited this country together with their children will help us in this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sunshine.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey hotels for families with children" class="if uuid-2293669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2293669.jpg"></div><h2>  Climate resort selection </h2><p>  If you are going on a vacation in Turkey with a child, you can not focus only on the money that you are going to spend.  In travel agencies, especially large cities of Russia, you will be offered a variety of resorts to choose from.  Some of them are considered expensive, others are cheaper.  But you should also consider the specific needs of the child.  Let's start with the main thing: adaptation to climate.  Kids suffer from both cold and excessive heat.  Therefore, if you go to Turkey in the middle of summer, it is better to choose resorts on the coast of the Aegean.  The constant west winds disperse the most sweltering heat, making the air fresh.  And if you intend to spend a week or two in Turkey for the May holidays or in October, "at the close" of the holiday season, choose the cities of the Anatolian Riviera.  In Alanya, Side and Belek, people bathe in November, while in Izmir the south is coming, but still autumn.  And of course, in the summer you need to make sure that your room has air conditioning. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": NATALIA_MAROZ, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey beaches for families with children" class="if uuid-2293662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2293662.jpg"></div><h2>  Resort selection.  Beaches </h2><p>  Travel agencies that advertise holidays in Turkey with a child often portray wonderful sandy coasts on posters.  All this is so, travelers say in reviews, but there are exceptions.  Some resorts in Turkey, such as Kemer, have pebble coasts.  It happens that hotels on the first line delight their guests with bulk sand.  But in most cases, holidaymakers are content with what nature offers them.  There are also places where descent into the sea is possible only by a ladder from the pontoon.  And how is the kids swimming here?  They are even dangerous here.  Children, especially small ones, can tuck their feet on large pebbles.  At the slightest disturbance of the sea, a stone can hurt them.  And you can’t build pebble castles.  Therefore, it is better to choose Turkish resorts with sandy beaches.  Those, judging by the reviews of vacationers, are Alanya, Belek, Marmaris, and on the Aegean coast - Kusadasi, Fethiye, Kas.  Surfers and children are two completely different categories of vacationers.  And if you are the first to give the wind and the excitement of the sea, then kids should be protected from this.  And in this regard, nothing better than Marmaris, you will not find.  Reviews mention islands that block the entrance to the bay of this city, which makes it more like a lake. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  We take into account the specifics of the resort </h2><p>  The large coastal cities of Turkey position themselves as vacation spots for young people.  In Bodrum, Izmir or Marmaris you will not notice at all signs that this is a Muslim country.  Discos, night clubs, “Streets of bars” - this is not exactly what young children need.  But, choosing Turkish resorts for families with children, you should know that they all have their own peculiarity.  And these are small satellite villages.  Do you want to get to the city market, “hang out” in the evening in a cafe or see the main attractions?  Please - take the minibus, which in Turkey is called "dolmush", and in ten minutes you will be at the epicenter of civilization.  The price of the issue is one and a half lira (15-20 rubles).  But in the small village where your hotel is located, life calms down with the sunset.  And your baby can fully enjoy the true Turkish flavor.  Small villages such as Icmeler near Marmaris, Goynuk, Beldibi, Tekirova, Camyuva and Kirish near Kemer, all satellites of Alanya and Antalya, the small town of Side - these are places for recreation that family tourists recommend in their reviews. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelandleisure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey resorts for families with children" class="if uuid-2293696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2293696.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  We have already talked about the resorts and beaches of Turkey for families with children.  Now it's time to consider the hotels of the country.  Their star rating only affects prices, but by no means on amenities or proximity to the sea.  In Turkey, you can meet the “fours” and even “three”, the quality of services is not inferior to the “five”.  Therefore, each time you need to get acquainted with the hotel in advance based on reviews from tourists.  Some hotels are located in very picturesque places: on rocky cliffs or on high banks.  From there, an enchanting view of the sea opens.  But think for yourself: what will it be like for your baby to overcome all these descents and climbs in order to get from a room to a restaurant or the beach?  So it is better to choose a hotel, standing on a flat area.  Some elite five-star hotels have a huge territory where you can walk.  But sometimes these hotels are far from the sea, and a bus carries the guests to the beach.  Decide for yourself whether your child needs daily shaking in stuffy, crowded vehicles as a prelude to sunbathing.  It is better to choose a hotel with fewer stars, but located on the first or second line from the sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelsupermarket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best holiday with children in Turkey" class="if uuid-2293683" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2293683.jpg"></div><h2>  Something about the "specificity" of hotels in Turkey </h2><p>  The concept of “16+”, according to which people under the age of sixteen do not settle, is still rare for the tourism industry in Turkey.  On the contrary, the lion's share of hotels in this country position themselves as a place of family relaxation.  It is customary to travel to Turkey with children, since a short flight and a mild climate are most suitable for kids.  However, there are hotels that position themselves as "youth".  But as a rule, they are located in the center or near major cities - in Antalya, Marmaris, Bodrum, Izmir.  Some hoteliers are trying to attract all categories of vacationers.  Therefore, you need to carefully familiarize yourself with the services.  Perhaps there is a disco in their list until two in the morning or a bar that works until the morning?  But still, those hotels that call themselves “a place to relax with the whole family” organize a transfer to places of noisy entertainment in the city, reserving a place in the hotel for silence and bliss.  However, the amused company, having returned from a party at two in the morning, does not really care about the rest of the other residents' good sleep. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tatildenizkeyfi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best holiday in Turkey with children" class="if uuid-2293867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2293867.jpg"></div><h2>  What should be the hotels of Turkey for families with children </h2><p>  Now let's talk about what specific services a "hotel for the whole family" should provide to its young guests.  Cribs are now available even in cheap city "youth" hotels.  But what about the rest?  In a good hotel, which is not in vain called “family”, according to your order, a pot or nozzle for the toilet seat will be delivered to your room.  At your disposal will be a changing table and a bathtub for bathing the baby.  Some family “fives” even rent strollers for rent.  To make your holiday in Turkey with your child as safe as possible, balconies in the rooms of such hotels have high but transparent railings.  In hotels there is not only a medical office, but also a pediatrician on duty.  In the reviews, tourists recommend carefully familiarizing themselves with the list of services in the rooms before choosing a hotel. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Turkish cuisine is very tasty, but also very peculiar.  For religious reasons, they do not eat pork.  In the dishes there are many spices and spices.  Therefore, the best vacation with children in Turkey can be overshadowed by the fact that the child simply refuses to eat unusual food.  Travelers in reviews recommend knowing in advance whether there are conditions for eating kids in the restaurant of your chosen hotel.  And they should not be limited only by the presence of high chairs for feeding.  Ideally, a hotel restaurant should offer the so-called "children's table".  This is a series of ships located at the height of a five-year-old child.  Children, imitating adults, can choose their own food.  And not some, but useful and loved by them.  These are mashed potatoes, pasta, steam meatballs, chicken breast, soups - all with a minimum of spices.  For breakfast, pancakes, pancakes, cereals with milk and other dishes that children love are desirable in the restaurant's menu.  And for the smallest guests, the Five restaurant should provide a sterilizer and a bottle warmer, infant formula and first foods. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelsupermarket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey vacation with children water park" class="if uuid-2293676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2293676.jpg"></div><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Parents in their reviews assure that swimming in the sea and the construction of sand castles delight the children the first two days.  Then they get bored and they want something new.  And nothing takes kids so much as a swing-carousel.  There are playgrounds in Turkey even in hotels without a single star.  It is much more important to know what they are - these places of entertainment for kids.  Knowing the injustice of their children, many parents would like to see the coverage of such sites as soft as possible, in which case they would not need to contact the emergency room.  Since children will spend a lot of time on swings and slides, it is important that the sun does not bake their heads.  Playgrounds should be well shaded.  In the “fives” a trampoline is added to the standard set of children's fun.  In case of bad weather, there should be a room with toys and a video player, through which cartoons are broadcast.  And of course, hotels in Turkey for families with children are inconceivable without a shallow pool (most often heated). </p><h2>  Animation </h2><p>  Sometimes people so want to throw off the burden of parental care!  And the best vacation in Turkey with children will be when experienced animators take care of the kids.  These are teachers who are successfully disguised as companionable guys and girls.  Even the most uncommunicative and sociopathic child will be delighted with the mini-club led by such animators.  The language barrier with the proper organization of children's leisure does not matter.  In good hotels, mini-clubs have several groups, divided by age: for kids, primary school students and adolescents.  And in hotels in Turkey, which are not suitable for families with a child, perhaps they play children's hits in front of an adult disco.  Mini clubs are also different.  If you want to take a break from your child and want it not to be bored, make sure that the animators will be engaged in wards from morning to evening, and not just at certain hours.  Good hotels in the mini-club have lunch and a quiet daytime. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xanaduhotels.com.tr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best holiday in Turkey with children reviews" class="if uuid-2293700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2293700.jpg"></div><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The best family entertainment while relaxing with children in Turkey is a water park.  Water attraction towns are now available at any seaside resort.  But you will save a lot of money if you choose a hotel with your own water park as your place of residence in Turkey.  Reviews of parents about such hotels are unanimously enthusiastic.  For kids, there are completely harmless slides in the form of elephants and mushrooms, and for schoolchildren and teenagers there are slopes on which the adult is breathtaking.  Hesitate, is it possible to go on vacation to Turkey with a very tiny child?  Parents say that in specialized hotels there are not only bathtubs for bathing, pots and sterilizers for bottles.  For a fee, you can hire a registered nanny or baby sitter.  And in some hotels, along with mini-clubs, there is even a nursery. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  When choosing to relax in Turkey with a child, you need to think about leisure outside the hotel.  Not all excursions are equally interesting for children.  Walking in ancient ruins and medieval temples can be entertaining for schoolchildren, but not for the crumbs of three years of age.  But riding a donkey and a show of trained dolphins will leave the most happy memories of Turkey in children's memory.  At least once during your vacation you need to visit a real water park.  In Turkey, they are stylized as the tales of “A Thousand and One Nights,” and do not leave indifferent kids, schoolchildren, or adults. </p><h2>  The best holiday in Turkey with children: reviews </h2><p>  What resorts and hotels do family tourists recommend?  In Belek, famous for its sandy beaches, Melissa Garden 4 * remains the undisputed leader.  In Alanya there are quite good “triples”, such as “Deha Hotel” and “Club San Haven Family”, as well as “fours”: “Antique Roman Palace”, “Sapphire”, “Asrin Beach” and others.  The resort Side specializes entirely on children's vacations, thanks to its microclimate and its location among the coniferous forest.  On the Aegean coast, reviews recommend Holiday Resort in Didim, Rosso Verde in Bodrum, Tusan Beach Resort in Kusadasi and Pasha Beach in Marmaris. </p>
