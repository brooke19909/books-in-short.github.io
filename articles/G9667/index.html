  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Date of foundation of Russia as a state</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When did humanity first learn about Russia?  Who was its founder?  What is the date of foundation of Russia?  The first mention of the state appeared in the annals in the X century.  The memoirs of the king of the Byzantine <span>Konstantin Bagryanorodny</span> mainly tells about the ceremonies that took place in the state and how they controlled it. </p><p>  Our compatriot chroniclers mentioned the word ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù in Cyrillic four centuries later, and the title of one of the metropolitans, Kipran, indicated that he was ‚ÄúMetropolitan of Kiev and All Russia.‚Äù  The modern spelling with two letters ‚Äúc‚Äù appeared in the middle of the XVII century, and finally became established during the reign of Peter I. Four centuries have passed since then, and Russia has become one of the most powerful states in the world.  When did she declare herself as a power? </p><h2>  Date of foundation of Russia as a state </h2><p>  The country has gone through a <span>thorny path</span> to our days and has been reformed at least five times.  But everyone knows that it was a single state with a vast territory.  The first mention of Russia as a state occurred in the XIII century, when all the Slavs united under the banners of the Rurikovich, and it was called Kievan Rus in 862. </p><h2>  List of the most ancient cities </h2><p>  A list of the founding dates of the cities of Russia is presented to visually show the oldest cities of the state.  The most interesting thing is that neither Moscow nor Tula were included in this list, although they are also considered one of the most ancient cities in Russia.  All data is presented at the time of 2014. </p><ul><li>  <em>Ryazan.</em>  With a population of 533 thousand people, this city is known for its tourist places, because it is one of the most ancient lands in Russia.  Many architectural monuments attract tourists from all over the country and the world, giving the opportunity to penetrate in the meantime and that atmosphere. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="russiatrek.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yaroslavl city" class="if uuid-2675054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2675054.jpg"></div><ul><li>  <em>Yaroslavl</em> with a population of 603 thousand people was founded back in 1010, and it is known for its churches, for which it even received the name "City of a hundred churches."  In our time there are no more than 30 of them, but they have not lost their greatness and beauty. <div class="photo" data-original="www.bautrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vladimir city" class="if uuid-2675064" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2675064.jpg"></div></li><li>  With a population of 362 thousand people, <em>Vladimir</em> is one of the oldest cities in the country.  Included in the so-called Golden Ring of Russia, along which a tourist route passes, showing all the main cities of the country.  Vladimir has a reputation for architectural heritage, because even an ordinary store there has the status of a cultural monument.  And there is no exaggeration: almost every house, every building was built about three hundred years ago. <div class="photo" data-original="mapsights.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Murom" class="if uuid-2675073" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2675073.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  As the chronicler Cyril Murom mentioned? </h2><p>  The city of <em>Murom was</em> first mentioned in the annals of "The Tale of Bygone Years."  Only with the help of it was it possible to find out the origin and name of this city.  A long time ago, on the site of the city lived the tribes of the Finno-Ugric Slavs, who called themselves "Murom".  In 988, this city passed under the control of the son of Prince Vladimir Gleb.  Tourists are interested in the Transfiguration Monastery, which is called one of the oldest in the whole country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="kagouletheband.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Smolensk" class="if uuid-2675076" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2675076.jpg"></div><p>  In the ancient chronicles for 1024, the name of the city of <em>Suzdal</em> is mentioned <em>,</em> as well as the uprising of the Magi, which glorified this city.  There are earlier records telling that this settlement was created from the merger of several villages.  An interesting fact is that on the territory of this city there are a huge number of different monuments, and only 10 thousand people live there, but more and more tourists come there every year. </p><h2>  Smolensk is our hero </h2><p>  The hero city of <em>Smolensk</em> with a population of 330 thousand people is first mentioned, like the city of Murom, in the "Tale of Bygone Years" in 946 as a settlement in which Krivichi lived - a mixture of East Slavic tribes.  According to the annals, Prince Oleg, who captured this city and made it his own, set there to rule his son Igor, who could not cope with his task because of his young age. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kagouletheband.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Novgorod city" class="if uuid-2675080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2675080.jpg"></div><p>  <em>Veliky Novgorod</em> can rightfully be considered one of the most famous cities in Ancient Russia, as well as one of its centers from the beginning of the founding date of Russia.  Until 882, it was its center, until it became the city of Kiev, located on the territory of Ukraine.  St. Sophia Cathedral is the oldest attraction in Veliky Novgorod along with the Novgorod Kremlin.  All tourists traveling along the Golden Ring visit this city, because only there you can feel the very atmosphere of ancient Russia.  At present, 200 thousand people live there. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <em>Old Ladoga</em> used to be on the border with all the states that were at war with ancient Rusichs.  It was destroyed and rebuilt countless times, and in one of the so-called restorations, a city was made of it, not a border fortress.  This restructuring dates back to 753 and is notable for the fact that it was here that the first of the Ruriks lived.  The population of Staraya Ladoga is only two thousand people. </p><h2>  Independent Russia </h2><p>  In 1990, when the first president Boris Yeltsin was elected, and the country itself gained independence and became the Russian Federation, it can rightfully be considered the Day of Russia, and the date of the founding of the state is June 12.  Having passed through the thorny path, the state turned out to be completely free and began to proudly bear the name - Russia.  Since 1991, June 12 has been a non-working day. At present, the president of the country issues state bonuses in the Kremlin.  Across the entire territory of the country, it is customary to consider the date of the foundation of Russia as the City Day, which means that at the end of the day festive fireworks are thundering throughout the country and solemn events are taking place. </p><h2>  Political Party Governing the Country </h2><p>  The most famous political party is United Russia, whose founding date is December 1, 2001.  It is considered in the country as a ‚Äúparty of power", which has been at the head of the country for many years.  The leader of the party is Dmitry Medvedev, who holds the post of <span>Prime Minister of the Russian Federation</span> under the current president, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin.  In addition to this party, the country has more than 15 political blocs </p>
