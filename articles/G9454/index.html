Many of us love to read, learn new worlds with unknown heroes, and re-read what has been stored in the chiffonier for years is a pretty monotonous task.  But the cost of the paper book is now such that its acquisition is more attributed to a one-time promotion, but not to purchases on an ongoing basis.  That is why the e-book is a great way out of the current dilemma.  One of the most famous representatives of this line is PocketBook 515. </p><p>  But even with such products different situations happen, and we have prepared for you instructions on how to take everything into our own hands and solve any problem. </p><h2>  A little bit about the subject of conversation </h2><p>  Here we give a small description of the book itself in order to understand what we are dealing with. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mobile-networks.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pocketbook 515 does not turn on" class="if uuid-3196973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127097/3196973.jpg"></div><p>  PocketBook 515 has a 5-inch display E-ink (electronic ink) with anti-reflective coating.  The manufacturer claims that the device can withstand up to 8,000 coups or about a month of continuous reading.  The memory is 4 GB, so the number of books that can be simultaneously stored on the reader is estimated in the thousands.  Even with the purchase of the device, 500 electronic copies will already be available to you.  The gadget supports a wide range of file extensions, standard for texts and images. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The design of the book is minimalist and discreet.  At the bottom of the case is a joystick button with function keys.  The device fits comfortably in the palm of your hand, the surface is non-slip. </p><p>  There is no surplus like a touch screen, Wi-Fi module or voice support.  This is an easy and affordable e-book that just does its job. </p><h2>  Doesn't work - no panic! </h2><p>  So, your PocketBook 515 does not turn on.  Where to run and what to do, because you never found out if the wedding was and the ship was hijacked? </p><p>  Stay calm.  When this problem occurs, one of the most common causes is a fully discharged battery.  Connect the charger, wait until the mark reaches the minimum, that is 5%.  Then the reader should start. </p><p>  If PocketBook 515 does not turn on after a long non-use, then the above reason is the most probable. </p><p>  But if your device has been connected to the network for more than two or three hours, but the problem remains, then check the power outlet and charger for a malfunction.  If everything is in order, then another reason for the lack of reaction may be a damaged connector for the charger, but in this case you will need the help of service technicians.  Do not try to find the contact between the plug and the connector - this can cause even more harm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cheklab.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pocketbook 515 does not turn on after long non-use" class="if uuid-3196979" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127097/3196979.jpg"></div><p>  We do not exclude the possibility of a malfunction of the start button itself.  Perhaps even because of such an obvious factor, your PocketBook 515 does not turn on.  But here only engineering experts will help you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Lack of nutrition - how to feed? </h2><p>  If you are far from the art of owning a soldering iron, then most likely you did not know and did not think that using a non-original power supply unit and usb cable is fraught with consequences for your gadget.  Of course, outwardly it seems that there are no differences at all, but the <span>devil is in the details.</span>  The fact is that in chargers not intended for a certain type and model of electronics, the output voltage may differ from the standard voltage by a fraction.  But it can violate the integrity of the electrical circuit and lead to malfunction.  This is how you learned about another reason why your PocketBook 515 does not turn on and does not charge. </p><p>  You can try to connect the book to a laptop or PC - so check the reaction of the device and the likelihood of an inoperative power supply. </p><h2>  Mechanical damage </h2><p>  So what should I do if the PocketBook 515 does not turn on after being hit? </p><p>  Try to reboot it - hold the start button for 10 seconds.  But if the button itself is damaged during a fall or other impact, then this will not help. </p><p>  There is a possibility that at the moment of impact inside the device, some loop could disconnect.  So you can try to open the book (only if it is not under warranty!).  Lift the back cover using, for example, a plastic card.  Move along the seam of the case, thereby opening the locks.  Arm yourself with a screwdriver and unscrew the screws.  Check the integrity and all cables and cables are securely fastened.  A fairly common reason if your Pocketbook 515 does not turn on is the lack of a connection with a cable for the power button or screen. </p><p>  But if nothing aroused suspicion, then do not hesitate and bring the book to specialists for inspection for timely repair. </p><h2>  Software Update - Every Book </h2><p>  There is another common problem - the device just hung, for example, on some open page.  Or it just works slowly and takes a long time to load.  There is a way out - try reflashing your gadget, especially since this procedure is available to ordinary users. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobile-review.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pocketbook 515 does not turn on and does not charge" class="if uuid-3197629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127097/3197629.jpg"></div><p>  The information you need is on the website pocketbook-int.com.  Choose your country there.  Next is the ‚ÄúSupport‚Äù button.  Now indicate the model of your book.  Go to the "Firmware" section, where you download the latest version to your computer. </p><p>  You have the SWUPDATE.BIN archive - unpack it to the root folder.  Connect your book to your PC or laptop and turn it on.  Hold the Forward and Back buttons at the same time.  The system message Firmware update should appear.  The download of the update begins, and you click "Forward" and "Ok."  Further prompts will gradually appear.  Follow the steps.  The software has been updated - now the device will live a new life. </p><h2>  Preventive measures to preserve battery life </h2><p>  You already know that it is extremely undesirable to use a non-original power supply unit and a usb cable to avoid questions about why the PocketBook 515 is discharged and does not turn on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mforum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pocketbook 515 is exhausted and does not turn on" class="if uuid-3197763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3197763.jpg"></div><p>  The charging process also has its own rules: the optimum mark for connecting to the memory is 15-20%.  Turn off the book first.  Do not let the battery run out completely, as the generation of Li-on (lithium-ion) batteries is not designed for this. </p><p>  There is also one more advice from the manufacturer: after purchasing the device, discharge the battery, turn off the book and set it to charge for 8-12 hours.  Then follow these recommendations on a regular basis. </p><h2>  Developer Recommendations </h2><p>  It is necessary to take care of your gadget and fulfill simple requirements in order to extend the period of operation and minimize your costs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.the-ebook.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pocketbook 515 doesn't turn on" class="if uuid-3196982" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127097/3196982.jpg"></div><ol><li>  The greatest danger is mechanical damage.  Try to avoid such trouble as much as possible.  To protect the device, stick a protective film on the screen, and place the book itself in a special hard case.  These measures will prevent possible consequences if the moment of impact does take place in the life of the reader. </li><li>  No moisture.  Reading in the bathroom is undoubtedly pleasant, but disastrous for a book.  Vapors can enter the device through the seams of the case and start the oxidation process.  It can take from a week to a year - and now your PocketBook 515 does not turn on and does not respond. </li><li>  Wipe the screen at least once a week with microfiber or other soft cloth.  In extreme cases, you can use wet wipes, but without alcohol. </li><li>  Overheating is an obvious danger.  Increased temperature conditions can violate the integrity of internal elements and you can forget about full performance. </li></ol><h2>  What is the result? </h2><p>  You are convinced that if the PocketBook 515 e-book does not turn on, then there is still an opportunity to bring it back to life and make you serve faithfully.  However, if you are not confident in yourself, it is better not to open the device, but entrust this work to professionals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobile-review.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pocketbook 515 does not turn on after hitting" class="if uuid-3197768" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3197768.jpg"></div><p>  For your part, follow all the recommendations as much as possible, and for a long time the reader will be your faithful companion in the world of new adventures and knowledge. </p>
