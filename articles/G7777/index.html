In historical literature, every major battle, army operation is considered in general, impersonal.  But after all, every victory was achieved by the titanic efforts of specific people who died, became crippled or miraculously survived at the front.  Kolobanov Zinovy ‚Äã‚ÄãGrigorievich, whose feat will forever remain in the history of the Second World War, is one of those heroes that should be specifically discussed. </p><h2>  The childhood and youth of the tankman </h2><p>  Zinovy ‚Äã‚ÄãKolobanov was born in 1910.  Place of birth: village of Arefino, <span>Vladimir province.</span>  The family lived very poorly.  Zinovy ‚Äã‚Äãhad two more brothers.  It became especially hard after the death of his father, who died on the fronts of the Civil War in 1920.  Understanding the advantages of the collective farm system for the family, at the end of the 1920s the family moved to the village of Big Zagarino.  Just at that time, collectivization was taking place in this village. </p><p>  After graduating from the eight-year plan, Zinoviy Kolobanov goes to study at the Gorky Industrial College. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zinovy ‚Äã‚ÄãKolobanov" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29179/954417.jpg" width="200"></div></h2><h2>  The beginning of the military career of a hero </h2><p>  The turning point in the life of the future tanker Kolobanov was 1933.  Then he studied in the third year of technical school.  He received a summons from the draft board.  At that time, repaying a debt to the Motherland was holy for every young man.  Immediately after entering the service, Zinovy ‚Äã‚Äãrealized that he was in his element.  The military registration and enlistment office determined Kolobanov to serve in the Streltsy regiment.  Already in 1936, the future legendary tankman graduated with honors from the Oryol Armored School.  He had the opportunity to independently choose a place of service, so Zinovy ‚Äã‚Äãdecided to fulfill his childhood dream - to visit Leningrad.  There he served for some time as tank commander.  The high command noticed the military talent of the fighter, so he was sent to continuing education courses for the junior command staff.  In 1938, Kolobanov successfully completed these courses, after which his place of work changed.  Now Lieutenant Zinoviy Kolobanov serves first as an assistant regiment commander, then as platoon and company commander. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Soviet-Finnish company in the tanker's biography </h2><p>  Tanks took an active part in the <span>Finnish war.</span>  The fighting on this front became a real baptism of fire for Kolobanov.  People who know history are well aware of how difficult it was for the Red Army in that war.  Kolobanov could die three times on this front, but escaped from burning tanks.  During this war winter he made a military journey from the border to Vyborg itself.  His tank participated in the successful breakthrough of <span>the Mannerheim Line.</span>  By the way, there is unconfirmed information that the tanker was awarded the title of Hero of the USSR for this feat.  The fact is that one of the Soviet journalists in his article tells such a story.  Allegedly, senior lieutenant Zinovy ‚Äã‚ÄãKolobanov received an award for breaking the Mannerheim line, but then was deprived of the next rank and order of the Hero because his subordinates in the tank communicated with Finnish soldiers.  In official sources there is no information about the award. </p><h2>  Zinoviy Kolobanov: biography after the Finnish war </h2><p>  After the Finnish War, Kolobanov continued his service.  It was in the interwar years that fate connected our hero with Ukraine.  The command transferred him to the Kiev Military District.  Kolobanov spent a lot of time in the Ukrainian city of Starokonstantinov.  During the years 1940-1941 he managed to change several command posts in the tank and mechanized corps of the Red Army.  Over the years of command of military units, senior lieutenant Zinovy ‚Äã‚ÄãKolobanov has become a fairly mature military leader. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  That is why, with the <span>beginning of World War II,</span> he was thrown to the difficult sections of the Northern Front in the Leningrad Region.  By the way, simultaneously with sending to the war our hero receives the rank of senior lieutenant.  Given the presence of combat experience (unlike most other Red Army soldiers, including commanders), Kolobanov was immediately appointed company commander.  Despite the leading status, the tanker took part in the battles.  A landmark battle took place on August 14, 1941, when five tanks, including a tank under the command of Kolobanov, stopped the advance of German intelligence and tank columns, while destroying many enemy vehicles.  At that time, this allowed to defend some settlements.  Also, the feat of Kolobanov (and his tank could well have been knocked out during this battle) allowed other military tank formations to destroy a larger group of German armored vehicles.  After one of the battles in September 1941, Zinovy ‚Äã‚Äãwas seriously wounded. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zinovy ‚Äã‚ÄãKolobanov biography" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29179/954434.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  After the war </h2><p>  Zinoviy Kolobanov after long-term treatment returned to duty.  True, this was already after the war, in 1945.  He remained in military service until 1958.  Of course, he worked mainly in senior management positions (battalion commander).  After the transfer to the reserve, the legendary tanker worked for a long time at the Minsk MAZ plant.  He received the honorary title "Drummer of Communist Labor." </p><p>  Zinovy ‚Äã‚ÄãKolobanov died in 1994, having lived a long and meaningful life dedicated to his homeland. </p>
