There is a unique natural complex, including 14 lakes of fabulous beauty, and the water in them has therapeutic properties.  The name of this place is Borovoe.  Hotel "Zhumbaktas" is one of its best complexes.  Tourists speak about him very favorably, and many plan to come here more than once.  Why is this hotel so good?  What conditions are offered here for accommodation and recreation?  How to serve?  We will talk about all this in an article. </p><h2>  Briefly about Borovoy </h2><p>  Note that natural sites and settlements with the same name are available in Russia and Belarus, but our article is devoted only to the resort village of Borovoye in Kazakhstan.  Zhumbaktas is not the only hotel to be found here.  This resort has several dozen hotels, pensions and resorts, annually hosting over a million tourists.  Borovoye gained such popularity thanks to the incredible beauty of these places.  According to tourists, there is an unusually blue sky, some special air filled with life-giving energy and the most gentle sun.  These natural factors help to improve the health of people suffering from diseases of the nervous and pulmonary systems, patients with tuberculosis (in closed form) who have some mental disorders. </p><p>  Borovoe is located on the Kokchetav Upland.  On its territory there are 14 picturesque lakes formed during a meteorite.  In some, the water is fresh, in others, salty, so each lake has a different therapeutic effect.  Pine and deciduous forests adorn the area extraordinarily, and silent rocks give it grandeur and exclusivity.  On the shores of some <span>lakes (Borovoe,</span> Shchuchye) excellent beaches are equipped, there are popular water attractions such as ‚Äúbanana‚Äù, canoe, catamaran.  You can also go fishing here.  Excursions to distant lakes, to the Kenesary cave, to Astana, horse and boat trips are very popular with all vacationers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Since 2005, the village has been called Burabay, but many know it as Borovoye.  There are two Zhumbaktas hotels here.  Both are located on Kenesary street, but the mailing address of one is the number 21a, and the other has the number 70. In addition, there is also the Zhumbaktas boarding house and the Zhumbaktas hotel in Astana.  It is difficult to say why the Kazakhs like this name so much, but many tourists are confused by the number of objects of the same name providing similar services and concentrated in about one place.  When booking, we advise you to definitely check the location of the selected hotel so that there will be no misunderstanding upon arrival. </p><p>  The distance between the two Zhumbaktas hotels in Borovoy does not exceed 1000 meters.  Kenesary street is one of the central ones, but runs along the edge of the village, parallel to Lake Borovoe, so it takes about 10 minutes to go from both hotels to it, although the distance is only 300 meters in advertising brochures, without specifying that it is in a straight line.  There is a difference in the location of each of the Zhumbaktas hotels in relation to the infrastructure of the village.  Object number 21a is located closer to the residential area, there are many cafes and shops around it, and the Culture Center is nearby.  Object number 70 is located closer to the outskirts, almost on the ring itself, where Kenesary Street intersects Shchorsa Street, which passes into the P7 highway.  She leads from Borovoy to Schuchinsk.  There are fewer shops in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village, but there is the <span>Abylay Khan</span> Museum nearby <span>,</span> and most importantly, the intercity bus stop.  There are literally two steps from her to the hotel, which is very convenient for those who have heavy suitcases with them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is no boarding house ‚ÄúZhumbaktas‚Äù in Borovoye (settlement).  It is located 200 meters from the shore of another lake - Schuchye.  The official address of this sanatorium complex is as follows: Priozernaya street, building No. 17.  Administratively, this area also belongs to <span>the Borovoye resort,</span> which is indicated in the packages.  Here, too, out of habit, you can get a little confused, because Priozernaya Street is located in the small village of Schuchinsky, located near the town of Schuchinsk.  Many tourists believe that this is one and the same settlement, but in fact the city stands on one side of the lake, by the way, very elongated in length, and the village on the other.  They are separated by more than 8 km in a straight line (across the lake) and 27 km along the highway. </p><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  Tourists are very convenient to get to any "Zhumbaktas".  Borovoe is located less than 20 km from the town of Shchuchye, where there is a railway station.  Trains from many cities of the country come here, including Moscow, Novosibirsk, Novokuznetsk, Astana, Tashkent, Chelyabinsk.  From Shchuchye to Borovoye can be reached by taxi or by bus. </p><p>  The large city of Kokshetau is 95 km from the resort, and Astana is 260 km away.  You can now get from Borovoye from the capital of Kazakhstan with increased comfort, since in 2009 a six-lane highway was opened leading from Astana to this resort.  According to motorists, the roadbed on it is of European quality, along the highway there are gas stations with cafes, toilets.  Local residents say that such a road was built, because Putin himself often visits Borovoye to relax and recharge his batteries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>
