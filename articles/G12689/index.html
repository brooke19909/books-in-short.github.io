    <p>  And one cannot fail to mention the famous Thai massages.  Massage services are provided upon request to all visitors to the hotel. </p><h2>  Why visit Phu View Talay Resort? </h2><p>  The main criterion for the attractiveness of this place is the low prices for service and hotel accommodation.  The vast majority of staff speaks Russian. </p><p>  The velvet season for visiting is considered to be the winter period, but the air temperature at this time does not fall below thirty degrees of heat.  At this point, the thermometer keeps throughout the year. </p><p>  Pattaya is considered a night city.  It is usually noisy there at night.  If you settle in a secluded, standing on the background of nature Phu View Talay, then the noise at night will not bother you.  Built not so long ago, the Phu View Talay Resort 3 * hotel, however, is indicated on the map, as it is the most visited hotel in Pattaya. </p><p>  The beach, located not far from your location, is quite clean and comfortable, although not quite large.  Here you can rent a sunbed and parasol.  This, of course, for some money, but is relatively inexpensive.  Comfortable temperature in the resort period, short rains that refresh the hot climate of this resort, fell in love with tourists. </p><h2>  Phu View Talay Resort 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  The comments of tourists who have been here are quite diverse. </p>

    <p>  Workers are greeted very friendly and courteous.  The path to the sea takes five minutes.  Uncomfortable when going to sea is the road, the descent and rise are very steep.  But these inconveniences, like the narrowness of the beach, are compensated by a very clean and warm sea.  Breakfasts are delicious and hearty, although not varied.  On the way to the sea you can visit the cafe. </p><p>  Some tourists did not like the rather poor equipment of the rooms, the small and shallow pool.  It was annoying that there were no kettles in the rooms, and the hairdryer had to be rented at the reception for a fee. </p><p>  Many write comments that describe both the good and bad aspects of staying at this three-star hotel. </p><p>  For example, the hotel area is relatively quiet and calm, in contrast to the bustling center of Pattaya.  In this fact, of course, there are advantages and disadvantages.  Advantages - quite calmly at night, disadvantages - far from the center. </p><p>  Walking to the center for about thirty minutes, but it would not be so inconvenient if it were not for the steep winding road. </p><p>  Usually people come to a hotel only to spend the night, because in the evening there is absolutely nothing to do there, it can be boring for young people. </p><p>  Undoubted advantages: rooms with a good area, clean, comfortable.  The furniture is new.  Laundry, which is located not far from the hotel, perfectly launches and ironed linen literally for a penny.  The hotel staff are very friendly.  As soon as you enter the hotel building, bags are immediately taken from you and taken to your room. </p><p>  They clean the hotel every day, towels, shampoos, soap, toilet paper are brought daily.  The only bad thing is that they bring one towel, but this is not very convenient. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Phu View Talay Resort 3" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32994/1121607.jpg" width="600"></div>  Good budget hotel </h2><p>  According to the reviews of tourists who visited this hotel, it may be suitable for different categories of travelers.  The staff tries to provide the most comfortable conditions for all categories of citizens who have come to rest. </p><p>  The proximity of the beach impresses not only people who come for a family vacation, but also young people who like to frolic in the water. </p><p>  The hotel accepts tourists throughout the year! </p><h2>  Hotel details and basic information </h2><p>  Address: 396/102 M.12, Soi Kasetsin 3, Rajchawaroon Road. </p><p>  Email Address: info@phuviewtalayresort.com </p><p>  Phone: + 3 (825) 03-38-9. </p><p>  Fax: + 3 (825) 03-42. </p><p>  Build date: 2010. </p><p>  Number of rooms: 64. </p><h2>  Summarize </h2><p>  In this short article, we discussed the hotel, reviews about it, basic information, so you hopefully found answers to your questions.
