  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Isoamyl alcohol</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The monohydric saturated alcohol, which is one of the eight isomers of pentanol, is isoamyl alcohol (the chemical formula is C5H11OH, the rational is (CH3) 2CHCH2CH2OH, and the empirical is C5H12O).  The systematic name of the substance is 3-methylbutanol-1.  Other common names are isopentanol (Isopentanol) and isobutylcarbinol (Isobutylcarbinol). </p><p>  The molar mass of alcohol is 88.148 g / mol.  In appearance, it is an unpleasantly smelling, transparent, colorless liquid that is lighter than water.  The density of the pure substance at 20 ¬∞ C is 0.8104 g / cm¬≥.  Isopentanol melts at a temperature of minus 117.2 ¬∞ C, boils at plus 131.1 ¬∞ C.  Isoamyl alcohol is one of the three isomers of amyl alcohol, which are slightly better than others dissolve in water.  Its solubility in water reaches 28 g / l.  Miscible with acetone, <span>diethyl ether,</span> ethanol, benzene, chloroform, acetic acid (glacial).  <span>The dynamic viscosity of</span> alcohol is 3.692 mPa ‚Ä¢ s.  Isopentanol is a flammable substance (it is a flammable liquid).  Its explosive limits are 1.2‚Äì9%, flash point is plus 42 ¬∞ , autoignition is plus 350 ¬∞ . </p><p>  Isopentanol is the main component of <span>fusel oil</span> (it is formed in the manufacture of ethanol), from which it is obtained.  The technology for the production of alcohol consists in heating the raw materials in order to remove light fractions (at first the ethanol ‚Äì water azeotropic mixture is distilled off, then the butanol ‚Äì water azeotrope is distilled off at higher temperatures).  Further heating in the evaporator allows the isolation of isoamyl alcohol, and the remaining heavy residue is sent to waste.  By changing the parameters of the technological process (temperature and others), the quality of the finished product is regulated.  The result is isopentanol with a <span>mass fraction of</span> 3-methylbutanol-1 up to 99.0% (according to GOST 5830-79) or up to 80% (according to TU 2421-004-20992222-98). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the presence of a catalyst, which is sulfuric acid, isoamyl alcohol reacts with glacial acetic acid.  The equation can be written as follows: C5H11OH + CH3COOH ‚Üí C7H14O2 + H2O.  This reaction has two names: the Fisher reaction or the esterification reaction.  The result is <span>an ester</span> (isoamyl acetate) and water.  Instead of sulfuric acid, acidic ion-exchange resins can be used as a catalyst.  Isoamyl acetate is an artificial flavor that is used to give banana flavor to foods.  In addition, it serves as a solvent for some nitrocellulose varnishes, is used (pheromone) to attract large groups of bees to a small area.  Due to its intense pleasant odor and low toxicity, isoamyl acetate is used to test the effectiveness of respirators or gas masks. </p><p>  Isoamyl alcohol is a drug, it is toxic.  Its pairs irritate the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, causing suffocation and coughing.  It is harmful if swallowed or inhaled.  May cause depression of the central nervous system.  The central nervous system, lungs, eyes, and skin are more affected by alcohol poisoning.  Prolonged or repeated contact with it leads to dryness and degreasing of the skin.  Ingestion causes gastrointestinal irritation with nausea, <span>vomiting, and diarrhea.</span>  Getting it into the lungs causes chemical pneumonitis with a fatal outcome.  The narcotic effect occurs with symptoms: headache, weakness, dizziness, loss of consciousness.  As a result, the victim may fall into a coma. </p><p>  If isoamyl alcohol gets into the eyes, then they are washed for a long time (at least 15 minutes) with plenty of water and seek medical help.  If it gets on the skin, these areas are also washed with plenty of water.  Remove contaminated clothing and shoes.  If irritation intensifies and does not go away, then consult a doctor.  Clothing must be washed before reuse.  If swallowed, get medical attention immediately.  Do not induce vomiting unless directed by a doctor.  A person who has lost consciousness is never given anything by mouth.  If vomiting occurs naturally, then the victim is tilted forward.  When poisoning with vapors of isoamyl alcohol, the patient is taken out to fresh air.  If he does not breathe, then they do artificial respiration.  With difficulty breathing give oxygen.  Medical assistance is required!  The doctor prescribes symptomatic and supportive treatment. </p>
