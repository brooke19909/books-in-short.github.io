    <p>  Currently, the manufacturer of the HTC smartphones line - a Taiwanese company - continues to successfully work towards expanding its lineup, supplying more and more new models to the smartphone market.  Every year they become better, equipped with modern hardware to meet the previously announced international level.  One of these models was the HTC Desire 820 smartphone, reviews of which, after its release, simply flooded the Internet. </p><p>  This phone was officially introduced in the fall.  Then the IFA 2015 exhibition was held in Germany, in Berlin.  It can immediately be noted that the HTC Desire 820 S Dual Sim, reviews of which will be given in a generalized form in this article, has become a continuation of the line.  The successor to the Desire 816, if you will.  In fact, the new smartphone has become nothing more than an improved version of this device.  However, this is not so important.  It is much more important for us to deal with what possibilities a modified telephone provides to its users. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Not so long ago, the Desire Eye smartphone stood at the head of the entire model range.  And I must say, between this smartphone and the HTC Desire 820 Dual SIM, reviews of which we will consider, there are certain similarities in terms of appearance and design.  The excitement around the model is not entirely clear, since it is positioned as a model of not a high, but an average level. </p><p>  But HTC Desire 820 Dual SIM, reviews of which will be given later, nevertheless was able to gather around itself a huge circle of fans.  Many buyers preferred him, and in the course of this article we will still try to find out what is in the smartphone. </p><p>  Users who purchased the device claim that with their dimensions (and they are not so compact, believe me) the smartphone turned out to be lightweight, and even boasts its small thickness.  This, in turn, makes the model very convenient to handle.  The phone lies in the hand quite comfortably.  As users note, when handling the device in this regard, no negative emotions can arise.  And now, moving a bit away from the reviews, let's consider what features the HTC Desire 820 has. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  The model is delivered to the smartphone market in a box made of white thin cardboard.  I think that fans of this brand have already noticed that the use of such packaging for HTC has become something of a tradition, if I may call it that.  At first glance, this is a flat square box.  It has rounded contours.  The box itself is made from special materials, which can then be used after processing.  To inscribe, soy ink is used as a paint. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can call the box not just neat: it is awarded the title of ‚Äústylish‚Äù.  And this is by no means an exaggeration, but simply a statement of fact.  But as for the opening, then everything is not so rosy.  The top cover of the box completely covers the pan below.  That is why something to hook in that area with your fingers is quite problematic.  Very often, buyers who purchase the HTC Desire 820, the reviews mentioned earlier, complain that immediately when you open the package lid, it simply breaks. </p><p>  The delivery kit is quite modest.  Here there is a charger operating at a voltage of 5 volts and a current of 1 ampere, a connecting cable for synchronizing the device with a laptop or personal computer.  This, of course, is about the MicroUSB wire.  There is also a stereo headset.  But speaking about it, it is worth mentioning that the headset has entangled wires.  But in terms of appearance, it clearly loses to its analogues. </p><h2>  Appearance and design </h2>

    <p>  HTC Desire 820, the reviews of the owners of which we have already partially reviewed, can boast of a case made of plastic.  This was, in principle, the case with the Desire Eye model.  This is logical, since at the beginning of the article it was said that there is an external similarity between the two devices in terms of appearance.  And this, by the way, is the difference between the 820th model and the flagships of the One series.  Recall that the latter are made of metal materials.  The smartphone is running HTC Desire 820, reviews of which we will consider further, in a sports style, as it can be called.  It is very bizarre (but at the same time good) the white color of the performance is combined with stripes.  They are quite wide and bright.  All elements of the smartphone case frame the strip, right from the camera to the screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A very wide strip closes around the perimeter of the screen.  Even though the case is made of plastic rather than metal, it cannot be said that this model looks worse than the One series.  Yes, there is a more youthful style, sporty, but this does not make the smartphone look worse, in any case.  Attractiveness, of course, because of this style is not lost, it is a fact. </p><p>  It is worth saying that the materials were selected by engineers, designers and constructors to fame.  It can be said, even with taste.  Polycarbonate turned out to be smooth, and it looks quite bright.  Assembling the phone should not cause any complaints.  The details are clearly assembled and fitted no worse.  But, comparing the 820th model with the same Desire Eye, it is necessary to note one drawback of the first device: the plastic here is a little slippery. </p><p>  Mixed feelings evoke the dimensions of the phone.  On the one hand, there seems to be nothing to praise the company's developers.  With such a screen (and its diagonal is 5.5 inches), the phone is quite elongated.  Not everyone can comfortably use it at this size.  Stereo speakers also played a role, for which a lot of space was allotted.  But a definite plus is the thickness of the model, which was reduced to the maximum.  This equalizes the scales, no doubt.  Agree that a flat device is much easier to hold in the palm of your hand even with such a large size?  The mass of the smartphone is within acceptable limits. </p><p>  The frames around the screen are quite wide, since holes for stereo speakers were cut out on the front side (above and below) of the screen.  The case is not protected from water, as was the case with the Desire Eye.  That is why the speaker grilles were made in the form of ordinary arrays.  A certain symmetry is observed here.  The LED indicator is located next to the camera window.  It signals the user about an incoming message or that the device‚Äôs battery is running low. </p><h2>  Front </h2>

    <p>  As mentioned earlier, there is a wide black frame around the screen.  If not for her, then the phone case could have been smaller.  The lower part of the frame reaches a width of about one centimeter.  Only the logo is located there, and there are no useful elements.  The control buttons are located on the screen.  They are non-mechanical.  Customize the button set and their location. </p><h2>  Behind </h2>

    <p>  It is logical that on the back of the device we will not find any grilles or speakers.  The back surface of the device is almost smooth.  The exception is a fairly large camera, the round eye of which almost protrudes from the body.  Incidentally, it is also framed by a plastic rim of a color different from the main color of the case.  Next to the camera itself is a peephole flash type LED.  It, by the way, can be used as a flashlight if necessary.  To do this, you only need to use the special program that is installed on the smartphone. </p><h2>  Left </h2><p>  Housing HTC Desire 820 Dual SIM, a review, reviews of which are given in this article, refers to a non-separable type.  It is monolithic, as it is commonly called.  It‚Äôs unusual that SIM cards, as well as a memory card, are installed in slots located on the side of the device.  All three holes are covered with a plug.  As you know, there is a modification of the smartphone that supports only one SIM-card.  In it, the slot for the second card is simply tightly clogged with a stub. </p><h2>  On right </h2>

    <p>  The HTC Desire 820, a review whose reviews are presented in the article, has stubs on the opposite side.  There are the hardware keys of the smartphone.  We are talking about the volume control swing, the lock button and on / off.  But there are no buttons with which you could control the camera.  The keys are made of plastic.  They are quite large, so finding them blindly is quite possible in complete darkness.  The response is a bit soft, I would like it to be tougher. </p><h2>  From below </h2><p>  At the bottom there is a connector for synchronization with a personal computer such as MicroUSB.  Version 2.0, it supports the connection of third-party devices through the use of OTG adapters. </p><h2>  From above </h2>

    <p>  At the top there is a connector for connecting an audio headset, headphones.  This is a standard 3.5 mm. </p><h2>  Do you need stubs? </h2><p>  What is below, what is above - the ends are not covered with plugs.  On the one hand, not everyone likes this, on the other hand, the user is deprived of the need to constantly plug and remove the plugs.  With all the ensuing mechanical consequences, primarily for the phone itself. </p><h2>  Design Conclusion </h2><p>  A lot of different colors came out.  The fact is that the models differ not only in the color of the strips running along the perimeter, but also in the color of the case itself.  Users noted this fact, arguing that everyone can find a color scheme to their liking. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  HTC Desire 820 is equipped with an IPS matrix, which reduces eye strain.  Because of this, the user gets the opportunity to read texts and electronic books for a long time, use the Internet for these needs.  Screen sizes - 68 by 121 mm.  The diagonal of the device, as mentioned earlier, is 5.5 inches.  At the same time, the screen resolution is 1280 by 720 pixels.  With these parameters, the density is not very high - only 267 pixels per inch.  However, this does not negate the good consumer qualities of the device for this parameter. </p><p>  On top, the thickness of the frame next to the screen is 16 millimeters, from the bottom 4 millimeters more.  On the sides, the distance was minimized: only 5 millimeters.  It was already mentioned that such dimensions directly affected the dimensions of the devices.  But what to do, it seems that this could not be avoided. </p><p>  The display, it should be noted, is quite bright.  It is possible to automatically adjust the brightness, because the corresponding sensor is built into the design.  There is support for multitouch technology.  It gives the smartphone the ability to process about 10 touches made simultaneously.  But you must manually use the technology using the phone settings. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The older model - Desire Eye - outperforms the 820th in a number of ways.  But definitely not on camera.  Here our smartphone significantly outperformed its ‚Äúmentor‚Äù.  <span>The front camera</span> is represented by a device that has a resolution of 8 megapixels, but for such a resolution it demonstrates a fairly average quality.  Although, it would seem, it should work unlike better.  There is no auto focus function.  There is no frontal flash either.  But the front camera allows you to shoot video in a fairly high resolution.  This, of course, is about Full HD.  It is 1920 by 1080 pixels.  For photo enthusiasts, there is a smile recognition function, and shooting can be done using the volume button. </p><p>  The rear, main, camera is of better quality, which, in principle, was expected from it.  This is a 13 megapixel device that is equipped with sensors.  Auto focus is available, as is a single-section type LED flash.  The camera does not shoot in 4K mode, but it records at a resolution of 1080 pixels. </p><h2>  Communications kit </h2><p>  The smartphone is expected to work in 3G and 2G modes.  It is possible to work in 4G.  The set of wireless modules is fairly standard: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.  As mentioned earlier, there is a MicroUSB port with the ability to connect a device based on the use of an OTG adapter.  It can be a computer mouse, keyboard, flash drive. </p><h2>  Hardware equipment </h2><p>  The platform on which the 820th model runs is eight-core, 64-bit.  There are four cores of two architectures.  They differ among themselves at the maximum working frequency.  The influence is exerted by the choice of working nuclei on how the charge will be spent.  By the way, a more powerful group has a clock frequency of 1.5 GHz.  Running the younger group, you can save a sufficient amount of charge.  The graphics accelerator operates at a frequency of 550 MHz.  This is Adreno 405. </p><p>  "RAM" built-in 2 GB.  A user of 16 GB of non-volatile memory has only 9.5 available.  You can increase the size of the memory through the use of flash drives through an OTG adapter or through a microSD memory card.  The model is perfect for launching the latest games and applications on it.  Hardware allows you to do this.  The model in this regard will be relevant for quite some time, no one doubts this. </p>
