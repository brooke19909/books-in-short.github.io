The bathroom is combined and has a shower and washbasin.  The cost of living is 2150 rubles per day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.foursquare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="single standard room" class="if uuid-2845775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2845775.jpg"></div><h2>  Double Room </h2><p>  In apartments of this class can be two single beds or one large.  There is also a standard set of furniture, a refrigerator and a TV.  The room is spacious and simple, without frills and frills.  The bathroom has everything you need for personal hygiene.  Cost - 3220 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="takeahotel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="double room" class="if uuid-2845749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2845749.jpg"></div><h2>  Triple room </h2><p>  Apartments for three people have the appropriate number of comfortable beds, as well as a minimum set of furniture.  There is a TV, a fridge, a table and a carafe for water with glasses.  Towels and cosmetics are in the bathroom.  The cost of accommodation is 3840 rubles per day. </p><h2>  Superior Room </h2><p>  Superior apartments are a two-room suite.

Cost - 4530 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ostrovok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Single Room" class="if uuid-2845746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2845746.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  For guests of the hotel on the ground floor, near the reception, a small snack bar is organized.  Nearby there is a vending machine where you can buy drinks (tea, coffee, hot chocolate, as well as sweet soda and plain water).  They work around the clock.  Therefore, even those who are populated at night will be able to eat. </p><p>  There is a cafe in the hotel, which stands out from the general style.  This is perhaps the only place in the hotel that meets modern ideas about the interior.  Glossy ceilings with built-in light bulbs, large windows and light walls - all this is very pleasing after the gloomy gray walls of the hotel.  Simple furniture - tables and chairs, as well as a bar counter do not cause delight.  However, like the menu.  The first impression that at least a cafe will meet the modern parameters of public catering establishments becomes deceptive.  Dishes from a cheap dining room.  There is an assortment of drinks and snacks.  In general, you can have a bite from the road. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lajner72.tumengid24.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="breakfast in a cafe" class="if uuid-2845753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2845753.jpg"></div><p>  Near the hotel (in the next building) there is a small grocery store where you can purchase the necessary products, as well as some household items. </p><p>  In the terminal building there is a small cafe "Maxim", in which you can look at a cup of aromatic coffee.  This is a great alternative for those who do not want to eat in the hotel dining room, but are not ready to go to the city. </p><h2>  Attractions nearby </h2><p>  Many guests and tourists staying at a hotel near the airport want to see the sights of the city.  Seven kilometers from the airport is the beautiful Zatyumensky park.  Here you can relax from the noise of the aircraft and the hustle and bustle.  Walking through the streets and enjoying the fresh air, tourists can feel the sincerity of this city.  On the way, you may meet small shops with souvenirs that can be brought as a souvenir to your hometown. </p><p>  A little further is Tyumen embankment, which all tourists seek.  Ten kilometers from the hotel is the Tyumen Monastery, known throughout the country.  Hotel "Liner" (Tyumen, Oleg Antonov St., 5) is located in close proximity to the city's memorable places.  You can get here by taxi in 10-15 minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="discovery-chel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tyumen embankment" class="if uuid-2845795" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2845795.jpg"></div><p>  Also, many guests rush to Tsvetnoy Boulevard and to Alexander Park, which are located in the city center.  Many people want to visit the local market.  Finding it is very simple - any resident of the city will tell you the way.  You can order a taxi or transfer from the hotel. </p><p>  There are also theaters, museums and thematic exhibitions in the city.  The city center is 21 km from the airport, and the main attractions are somewhat closer.  Hotel Liner (Tyumen) itself is located 300 meters from the airport terminal. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about this vacation spot are enough to draw certain conclusions.  However, everyone should understand that tourists have no choice, because the Liner is the only hotel near the airport.  That is why, based on customer reviews, the hotel administration should do everything necessary to make the guest's stay even better. </p><p>  Of course, in their reviews, customers write that in anticipation of a flight after a long flight, absolutely any hotel will do.  In the "Liner" there are minimum conditions for relaxation, but for a long stay it is not entirely convenient.  There is a water cooler on the floor, but there are no glasses, so you have to take your own.  Hotel "Liner" (Tyumen) needs modernization and repair.  However, the staff here are polite and helpful. </p><p>  Many hotel guests believe that this hotel is a budget option for those who need to wait for the plane.  The appearance, and the atmosphere inside, is very reminiscent of Soviet hotels.  On the ground floor there is a reception desk, like a stall from the 90s.  No elevator, although 5 floors.  It is unpleasant to carry heavy suitcases even to the second floor.  There is a hot drinks machine near the reception, and there is also a cafe and a hairdresser on the ground floor.  The rooms are clean and spacious, but with very shabby furniture.  It seems that everything here has not changed since the founding of the hotel.  You can spend the night one night, but you should not stay longer - this is how guests respond to the hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lajner72.tumengid24.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Superior Room" class="if uuid-2845755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2845755.jpg"></div><p>  Many guests believe that for such a low price the hotel is quite decent.  The rooms have a refrigerator, TV, bedside tables, beds and wardrobes.  The bathroom includes cosmetics and towels.  The furniture is old but comfortable.  Breakfast is not included.  Nearby there is a small grocery store, a cafe. </p><p>  In the reviews, guests write that the Internet in the hotel only works near the router, and even that is bad.  In a cafe, food resembles a dining room or an eatery at the station.  Dishes cannot even warm up normally.  Nearby there is a grocery store - this is the way out.  The hotel is only suitable for a one-day stay. </p><p>  Hotel Liner (Tyumen), reviews of which are mixed, offers a comfortable stay near the airport.  The Soviet interior and an undeveloped food chain in the hotel upset the tired tourists, however, in the reviews they note that this hotel takes care of each guest.  Despite all the shortcomings, the rooms are clean and comfortable, the smiling and friendly staff is ready to meet and help even in the latest hours.  Hotel "Liner" is a chance to relax, take a shower and have a snack for many tourists. </p>
