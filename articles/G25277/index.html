    <p>  In the region, where more than a hundred different enterprises operate, such a service is quite in demand.  In addition, the Lokomotiv recreation center in Chelyabinsk is often visited by members of many sports clubs.  Here they can not only relax and gain strength.  For daily training on the territory there is a large football field, volleyball court, table tennis table and other necessary equipment.  This type of rest in between competitions is very useful. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Where exactly is the Lokomotiv recreation center located, and how do potential visitors get to the place?  In principle, this is not difficult, since a specially paved asphalt road leads from the main highway to the country club itself.  First, moving along Sverdlovsky Avenue, you need to leave the city.  This will take some time given traffic jams.  Then you need to move along the M36 and turn left after the roundabout.  Behind should remain lakes Kosargi and Small Kisegach.  Along the way, you can admire the picturesque landscape of the local plains and forests.  Right after Kara-Kumlyak Lake, on the right there will be a ramp onto the asphalt road, which will lead directly to the country club. </p>

    <p>  Of course, after all, a day in such an institution per person costs from 500 rubles.  This amount includes: </p><ul><li>  residence; </li><li>  parking; </li><li>  beach; </li><li>  sports grounds and equipment; </li><li>  use of equipment of the barbecue area. </li></ul><p>  Moreover, children under 5 years old are provided with free space.  Adults will have to pay 350 rubles per day for this.  The houses are usually clean.  Cleaning is done on schedule.  Polite staff is always ready to provide any service to visitors.  According to most of them, rest in such a place gives not only health and good mood, but also a huge charge of vivacity and positive.  But not everything is as perfect as we would like.  As in any other establishment, guests also have skirmishes with attendants.  And sometimes they go too emotional on both sides.  But this is difficult to avoid in the service sector. </p>
