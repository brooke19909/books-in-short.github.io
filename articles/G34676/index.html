    <h2>  What science studies animal behavior? </h2><p>  The behavior of animals from the point of view of biological principles, the adaptation of an animal to its environment, is studied by ethology.  The term translated from Greek means "study of character."  This is the science of animal behavior in vivo.  People professionally studying the habits of animals, ethologists, pay special attention to genetically fixed behavior.  They also study those forms of animal behavior that are explained by experience gained in the process of historical development.  Since its founding by zoologists <span>K. Lorenz</span> and N. Tinbergen, the science of animal behavior has set itself the following tasks: </p><ul><li>  identify the causes of behavioral acts of animals; </li><li>  find out how the formation of a behavioral act occurs in the individual development of the animal; </li><li>  find out what it means in the life of the beast; </li><li>  understand how the evolution of a behavioral act took place. </li></ul><p>  The questions of ethology are clear, and there are disputes about research methods.  Some scientists believe, and most of them, that observations can only be made in vivo.  The point of view of supporters of anthropogenic ethology comes down to the recognition of the right to observe animals in the midst of human activity.  Others believe that ethology has the right to use the methods of experimental zoopsychology: modeling, experiments, experiments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="science of animal behavior in vivo" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40448/1261148.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Animal behavior </h2><p>  Ethologists study behavior as a versatile interaction of animals with the outside world.  Behavior means any activity that an individual exhibits.  It is defined by two concepts: a unitary reaction and a biological form of behavior.  The combination of reflexes characterizes a unitary reaction.  The biological form of behavior is called complex behavior corresponding to the phases of life, for example, food, defensive, research, parent and others. </p><p>  Thanks to observations of animals in their natural environment, the science of animal behavior has determined that, for example, dogs eat liquid food and water while standing, and eat solid foods while lying down - this is eating behavior.  Caring for their offspring in the midst of polar bears, when a bear lies for several months with cubs in a den, feeds them, depleting its reserves, these are observations of parental behavior. </p><h2>  Where do ethologists observe? </h2><p>  Ethological knowledge is needed mainly to describe the behavior of animals.  The methods used by ethologists in the work provide an opportunity to detail existing knowledge about animals, to expand ideas about their behavior. </p><p>  The science of animal behavior provides the knowledge needed in animal husbandry.  Ethological observations of the offspring of females allow livestock breeders to determine when delivery is expected. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ethology animal science" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40448/1261157.jpg" width="600"></div>  For example, seeing that the cow has become restless, constantly changing location, trying to retire, the breeder understands that it is necessary to prepare for the appearance of a new member of the farm.  Observations of horse behavior indicate the complex disposition of these animals.  The farmer or trainer should consider ethological knowledge, which suggests that horses are very picky in humans.  They respond with credulity and obedience only to those who care for them, respect and praise them. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what science studies animal behavior" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40448/1261165.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Without ethological knowledge, it is hard for trainers.  Data on a passive defensive reaction in animals, which gives ethology (the science of animal behavior), help to avoid accidents.  So, seeing the numbness and stillness of the tiger, the trainer reassures the beast so that he does not attack.  When working with likes, the trainer must take into account the results of ethology, which indicate that these animals do not have such a reaction - they immediately show anger - an active defensive reaction. </p><h2>  Interesting ethological observations </h2><p>  Some animal observations are quite interesting. </p><ul><li>  If the otters lie upside down on the water and hold on to their paws, then they are sleeping. </li><li>  Boy puppies often play specially with girls puppies, giving them the opportunity to enjoy the victory. </li><li>  There are animals, for example, squirrels, which are taken to raise the cubs of another female. </li><li>  Cows are true friends.  They are able to be friends, spend most of their time with a friend, communicate with him, take care of him. </li></ul>
