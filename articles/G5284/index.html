And all because the do-it-yourself things turn out to be unique and somewhat unusual, and it‚Äôs very fun and interesting to do them on your own or with your children. </p><p>  For this reason, in this article we offer the reader several simple-to-use master classes that will provide for themselves, kids, relatives, friends and acquaintances with original handmade knitted slippers. </p><h2>  How to take measurements from the foot </h2><p>  The first thing to find out before heading to the nearest needlework store is the size of the foot.  Indeed, it is thanks to this parameter that we will later find out how much yarn we need.  Perhaps the reader might wonder why he should determine the size of the foot, if he already knows him well.  Let's say the foot size is 38. But what does this give us? </p><p>  That is why we need to identify the parameters of our foot.  For this we need a regular centimeter, a pencil and a piece of thick A4 paper.  When all the necessary tools are ready, you can proceed to the following manipulations: </p><ul><li>  We put a sheet of paper on a flat smooth surface. </li><li>  We put the bare foot directly on the sheet and outline it with a pencil. </li><li>  Now we take a centimeter in our hands and, looking at the picture below, measure our foot and be sure to record the resulting values.  So that in the process of performing knitted slippers do not confuse anything. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.vectorstock.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted slippers" class="if uuid-2489993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2489993.jpg"></div><h2>  Simple slippers </h2><p>  Having figured out our sizes, we proceed to the study of the first, simplest instruction.  To execute it, you will need: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  two store insoles of its size; </li><li>  skeins of knitting threads of different colors (you can take leftovers); </li><li>  two hooks - No. 3 and No. 6. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.kodinkuvalehti.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted slippers" class="if uuid-2490009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2490009.jpg"></div><p>  How to do: </p><ol><li>  To begin with, we need to pick up a thin hook and tie the prepared insoles with it. </li><li>  Then change the hook to the one that is thicker, and already they continue to tie another row.  But new loops need not be pulled out from all the previous ones, but only from every second one. </li><li>  We knit the next three rows simply.  Without adding or removing anything. </li><li>  After the heel and sides, we knit in the same way, and we begin to round the sock.  To do this, in each next row in this part, we decrease one loop every three.  That is, we introduce the hook into the first loop of the lower row, then into the second and knit them together.  We knit the next three as usual. </li><li>  When both knitted slippers are ready, we proceed to make an interesting flower for decoration.  To do this, follow the scheme shown in the picture below. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="slipper pattern" class="if uuid-2490022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2490022.jpg"></div><h2>  <span>Home slippers</span> with a cardboard insole </h2><p>  This workshop is very similar to the previous one.  Indeed, in it we also will not knit out the insole, but we will make it out of cardboard.  To do this, draw both feet, gently with a pencil, draw a rounded toe and cut out the details.  After we tie them with a thin hook and continue with a thicker one.  We complement the finished product with a flower and an elegant strap. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And as a result, we get interesting and very feminine slippers.  Like those presented in the following photo.  And you can make them the same as the previous ones - striped.  Or decorate with a motley flower.  It all depends on the imagination. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.artfire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted slippers model" class="if uuid-2490028" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2490028.jpg"></div><h2>  Slippers or ballet shoes from old flip flops </h2><p>  The most comfortable beach shoes tend to tear after a season.  But usually the straps are torn, and the sole basically remains intact.  For this reason, creative needlewomen have long come up with her original application.  They make very comfortable knitted slippers from old flip flops that can be worn both at home and outdoors. </p><p>  Absolutely any old soles are suitable for their execution, however rubber ones are softer, therefore slippers are much more convenient to ‚Äútie‚Äù to them.  Threads can also be selected at your own discretion.  But still, it is better to opt for those that consist of acrylic or nylon.  Such shoes will be more durable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makeanddocrew.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="slippers from flip flops" class="if uuid-2490031" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2490031.jpg"></div><p>  So, when the old soles and threads are ready, grab the hook number 4 in our hands and carefully tie the first sole.  Then we rise another three or four rows and try on a new new thing.  If the edge covers the thumb, we proceed to the reduction and knitting of the sock.  To do this, we outline on the sides the estimated height of knitted slippers (crochet) and reduce the loops strictly in this part.  Having reached the desired size, we tie the top of the slippers for the last time, remove the threads and try on the finished product. </p><h2>  Slippers "Bunnies" with a knitted insole </h2><p>  Another noteworthy variant of the studied product is most appreciated by beautiful people.  After all, such slippers cannot be characterized otherwise than by the word ‚Äúcute‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bunny slippers" class="if uuid-2490048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2490048.jpg"></div><p>  It is very simple to make them: you need to take your own sheet with measurements and determine the length of the foot.  Then divide the resulting value into two, collect as many air loops so that the resulting chain matches the desired value.  Now we begin to bind it, forming an insole of its size.  After that, we switch to yarn of a different color and carry out the main part of knitted slippers.  A description of the necessary actions is reflected in the previous paragraphs. </p><p>  When the products are ready, decorate them with small ears, pom-poms, ‚Äúdraw‚Äù eyes and nose. </p><h2>  Knitted insole slippers </h2><p>  This thing will appeal to kids most of all.  Because it combines the original idea, convenience, brightness and warmth.  Performing it yourself is not at all difficult.  You just need to buy yarn of suitable colors in the store, hook number 10 and plastic eyes.  Then we knit the insoles as described above, and lay them aside.  And we ourselves make the upper part of slippers.  To do this, we knit a chain of six air loops, go to the next row and every two loops we add one new one.  So we continue until we reach a distance equal to the width of the rise.  We measured it earlier.  Then we knit a few more rows with an even cloth and sew the parts together.  We knit out black dots, a muzzle and glue eyes.  And now, the new model of knitted slippers is ready! </p><div class="photo" data-original="repinned.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="slippers for children" class="if uuid-2490059" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2490059.jpg"></div><h2>  Slippers trace "Minions" </h2><p>  Another interesting idea will surely appeal to fans of the characters of the famous Disney cartoon.  Performing the wonderful thing that is presented in the photo below is very simple.  It is only necessary to prepare hook No. 7 or No. 8 and yarn of the necessary colors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lukybox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="slippers minions" class="if uuid-2490038" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2490038.jpg"></div><p>  We collect a chain of six air loops and close it in a ring.  Next, from each previous loop, we knit two new ones, moving in a circle, making double crochets.  After two or three rows we try on a toe of knitted slippers, footprints.  If their length reaches the little finger, just knit in a circle until we reach the desired height of the slippers.  Then we pass to the blue yarn and knit ‚Äúback and forth‚Äù, thus performing the sole part.  Reaching the middle of the heel, we begin to reduce three loops strictly in the center.  We finish the products and tie them.  We finish the eyes and make out a smile. </p><h2>  Slippers slippers "Charming birds" </h2><p>  By a similar pattern, you can connect the following interesting slippers.  For it you will need yarn of pink, green, blue, white and orange colors, as well as hook number 7 or number 8 and six small buttons in black and white. </p><div class="photo" data-original="creativeideasz.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="slippers for girls" class="if uuid-2490062" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2490062.jpg"></div><p>  We begin the execution of the model, as in the previous version, with a sock.  We tie it to the moment when part of the product completely covers the fingers, and move on to pink threads.  Having reached the cutout on the rise, we knit "here and there", forming the sole of the slippers.  After the familiar technology we perform the heel.  Finally, we prepare two beaks, four eyes and two flowers.  Sew details to new knitted slippers, attach pupils and flower hearts. </p><h2>  Slippers for babies </h2><p>  From the next idea, mothers and their dear babies will be delighted.  After all, with such slippers it‚Äôs simply impossible to go unnoticed! </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="slippers for babies" class="if uuid-2490077" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2490077.jpg"></div><p>  But their performance will have to tinker a bit.  Although for an experienced needlewoman, the task will not take much time.  So, in order to make interesting slippers, socks, you will need: yarn of yellow and brown colors, stocking knitting needles No. 2 and hook No. 3. </p><p>  We collect ten loops on the knitting needles with brown thread and knit forty rows of garter stitch.  After ‚Äúarm‚Äù with a hook and on the sides we collect twenty new loops, another ten on the heel side.  We transfer the loops to the stocking knitting needles, distributing them evenly.  We knit three rows and, switching to light yarn, we perform six more rows.  Next, knitted slippers with knitting needles are performed in a special way: we knit only the bow, and from the side we grab one loop in each subsequent row.  So repeat over ten rows.  When these manipulations are carried out, we knit again in a circle.  But already 1x1 rubber band.  We move up twenty-two rows, and then close the loop.  Do not over tighten.  We crochet the ears: we collect a chain of nine loops and tie it in a circle.  We embroider the eyes and nose, sew the ears. </p><h2>  Baby slippers booties </h2><p>  The stores present a huge amount of goods for children.  But since each mother has her own baby, she wants to somehow highlight it, make it even more perfect.  And to help accomplish such a task, we suggest you review the next master class. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="tUt1qTwAexc" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&amp;v=tUt1qTwAexc" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/3/5/1/8/3518.jpg"></div><p>  It will allow you to understand the technology of performing original, delicate and very cute booties that are suitable for both boys and girls.  You just need to choose a yarn of the right color.  Or use several shades at once.  If desired, you can decorate the finished booties with a flower, ears, tail or beads.  And then a note of freshness and uniqueness will appear in them. </p><h2>  Home-made slippers on two knitting needles </h2><p>  Another interesting idea will appeal to beginner needlewomen.  Indeed, for its execution it will not be necessary to study complex and lengthy descriptions of the necessary actions or to understand incomprehensible schemes.  We offer a video where each step is demonstrated and described in detail.  Therefore, even beginners will not have difficulties with knitted slippers (knitting needles). </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="XKMqHDu9C3M" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKMqHDu9C3M" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/3/5/1/6/3516.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitted sandals </h2><p>  When the phrase ‚Äúknitted slippers‚Äù appears in the conversation, most of us immediately present models of slippers.  In fact, this concept is much more extended.  After all, it includes those products that we managed to consider in the current article, and many others - no less original and interesting.  For example, in this paragraph we invite the reader to study a detailed master class.  And then try to do something similar at home. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="k2oVxH1wdi8" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2oVxH1wdi8" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/3/5/1/7/3517.jpg"></div><p>  So, in this article we presented many models of knitted slippers.  Making them simple enough, the main thing is not to get scared and try. </p>
