This city lives without sleep and rest, reviving the whole Mediterranean coast with its tremendous energy.  The amazing architecture of the city is complemented by <span>high-rise buildings,</span> most of which have concert halls, art galleries, sophisticated restaurants.  Therefore, tourists flock here from all over the globe.  Naturally, Tel Aviv hotels are always crowded and finding a place for a person traveling alone is a very difficult task.  But for someone who, before leaving for Israel, will get acquainted with some information about this country and the conditions provided for visitors, or will draw up documents through reliable travel agencies, there will be no problems with accommodation.  The fact is that there are plenty of hotels in Tel Aviv.  You can choose according to the state of the budget and claims. </p><p>  All hotels in Tel Aviv, as well as around the world, have an assessment of their star rating.  In this article, we will describe the most famous hotels, based not only on statistics and arguments, but also studying impartial reviews of Tel Aviv hotels that were left on the pages of websites and forums by tourists who were fortunate enough to visit this corner blessed by God.  And start with five star hotels. </p><p>  The following 5 * hotels are considered the most famous and chic: Telton Aviv, Carlton Tel Aviv, Crowne Plaza City Center, Dan Panorama Tel Aviv, Dan Tel Aviv Hotel, Hilton Tel Aviv, Herods Tel Aviv, Renaissance Tel Aviv and Sheraton Tel-Aviv.  You can list hotels in this category for a very long time.  The main thing that unites these hotels is their very favorable location.  All of them are practically located along the seashore, at the intersection of transport hubs.  From these hotels it is very easy to get to the historical and cultural <span>sights of the Israeli</span> capital.  If the tourist is lucky and he gets the opportunity to stay at one of the above hotels while traveling, then we can assume that the rest in Tel Aviv was half successful.  These fashionable buildings rise where you can easily reach various museums and monuments that are part of world culture. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Enthusiastic reviews about Tel Aviv hotels were left by tourists who felt at the top of bliss from the level of service provided in them.  The comfort and cosiness of Israeli hotels can only be envied.  Their rooms are provided with all amenities, from air conditioning and television broadcasting, ending with Internet access and international telephone communications.  The hotel infrastructure, in addition to restaurants and bars, necessarily includes spas, Turkish baths and massage rooms.  Business centers and conference rooms, dry cleaning and a beauty salon, souvenir shops and rental services are an incomplete list of services that Tel Aviv hotels have available, and tourists are happy to use. </p><p>  A full-fledged vacation in Tel Aviv would not have been possible without 4 * hotels, which are also incredibly numerous in the <span>capital of Israel</span> .  Among them, the best should be mentioned: Artplus Hotel, Leonardo Basel, Best Western Kfar Maccabiah, Best Western Regency Suites and others.  They are characterized by elegant <span>luxury rooms</span> with free Wi-Fi, a refrigerator and all the amenities required for hotels of this level.  They also include special rooms for non-smoking guests.  Most 4 * hotels are located near the offices of airlines, banks and supermarkets.  Restaurants and indoor cafes are a must for hotels of this level. </p><p>  Of course, it is impossible to do without a fly in the ointment in a barrel of honey, and not to say that there are hotels of a lower level and their service does not always suit those who stay here.  Among the hotels, which are not very flattering guests, Adiv Hotel leads.  Tourists complain about the rudeness of the staff and the lack of modernity of the services.  Ambiguous reviews about the David Intercontinental hotel.  The guests of this hotel believe that the service provided in this institution does not correspond to the prices that are paid for them.  But let's take into account that these are 3 * hotels and their activities, rather an exception to the rule. </p><p>  In fact, everyone who came to stay in Tel Aviv can be sure that they are welcome here and will be received by hospitable hotels.  No need to postpone the journey to this paradise in a long box.  Come and feel what a European level service in modern hotels should be like. </p>
