    <h2>  Fairytale island, dream island </h2><p>  Today we will visit a unique corner of the planet - Barbados.  Where is this country located and what makes it special?  Such a question can cause a storm of emotions among travelers who have been there.  And also a whole avalanche of laudatory words, because she does not leave indifferent any guest. </p><p>  So, this is an island in the <span>Caribbean</span> small in size, part of the Lesser Antilles group.  Its fantastic landscape is created by lush tropical nature, turquoise waves and long beaches, rugged lagoons.  And if you add to all this a mild, even climate throughout the year and an abundance of entertainment, you simply cannot find the best place to relax and improve. </p><p>  Surrounded by coral reefs, Barbados, the capital of which is the country's main resort city, is mostly flat.  Only on the east coast, washed by the Atlantic Ocean, can one see small slopes.  The West Bank is washed by the glorious Caribbean Sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the past, this territory belonged to the British Crown.  And today Barbados, where there are many monuments of the colonial era, carefully preserves the traditions of the <span>Foggy Albion,</span> for which it is often called Little England. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is barbados" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/800258.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Main city </h2><p>  The reader already knows that the island is Barbados, its capital is the next stopping point on our route.  This is a beautiful settlement, the main port of the country and the largest resort.  Its name - Bridgetown - comes from two bridges that are thrown over the bay, deeply crashing into the coast.  This picturesque bay divides the city into two parts.  About one hundred thousand people live here permanently.  It is worth noting that the island capital is one of the main free ports in the Caribbean, and therefore it houses the offices of major companies and the residence of the government. </p><h2>  Sights of the capital </h2><p>  Barbados, whose capital is already known to us, is proud of its attractions.  In the central part of Bridgetown is Trafalgar Square, and on it is a monument to Lord Nelson.  The one who forced the French and Spaniards to abandon the capture of the island and leave it to Britain.  From the square begins Broad Street - the main shopping area, and also offers a fabulous view of the harbor called Careenage.  Both bridges will lead to the main markets of the island. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="island in the caribbean" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/800257.jpg" width="341"></div>

It was the only trip of the <span>American president</span> outside the United States.  The temple building is built in a classic style of coral stone. </p><p>  To the east of the temple, the Royal Park has spread its emerald tent, famous for the fact that it grows baobab over a thousand years old and houses a theater (the former residence of the commander of British troops).  And a mile from the capital is the Barbados Museum. </p><h2>  Things to do? </h2><p>  What else can you do on the island, besides sightseeing, swimming and lazy lying on the beaches?  It is proposed to go on a boat trip, ride a sailboat, go down to the bottom with scuba diving, play golf.  In January, the festival of jazz music is annually held, which attracts people from all over the world.  On the island you can book a short excursion to the places where the filming of ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean‚Äù took place, and to the nearby islands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="barbados reviews" class="if" height="111" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/800256.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Places for rest </h2><p>  An island in the Caribbean seems to be created for relaxation.  Its south coast is ideal for fans of surfing.  The area is full of small hotels of three and four star levels, numerous bars where rum is for sale, there are discos and restaurants.  The capital of nightlife is the town of St. Lawrence Gap. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you are planning a vacation in Barbados and prefer a quiet pastime, then choose the west coast.  The waves of the Caribbean are surprisingly transparent and clean, and the sands have a golden hue.  Here are the best hotels of the island, cozy bars and restaurants. </p><p>  The east coast, washed by the Atlantic Ocean, is very beautiful.  It is suitable for lovers of secluded relaxation, as there are few tourists here.  It offers <span>wild beaches</span> and first-class surfing conditions. </p><p>  The country of Barbados in the north is sparsely populated.  But here is a wildlife sanctuary (only 25 kilometers from the capital Bridgetown), which is home to turtles, otters, green monkeys, roe deer and other exotic inhabitants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Barbados hotels" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/800255.jpg" width="220"></div>

    <h2>  What do people say? </h2><p>  And what do people who visited Barbados say?  Their reviews are the most enthusiastic, as the islanders know exactly what the traveler needs.  And this is the best addition to heavenly living conditions and climate.  People say that there is amazing water, like no other Caribbean resort.  A lot of beaches and water activities, but few locals.  Even the capital may seem like a provincial town with a rich historical past.  Relax on the beach can be combined with sightseeing.  Tourists are also advised to be prepared for high temperatures, as even in May days the afternoon is too hot. </p><h2>  Some more useful tips </h2><p>  Going to Barbados, a traveler should know that sunbathing naked or topless is strictly prohibited here.  Little England sacredly honors traditions and does not depart from moral standards. </p><p>  Most retail establishments are open from half past eight to 16:30 from Monday to Friday, Saturday is a shortened day, and Sunday is a day off.  The island has duty-free shops, supermarkets (open until 20:00), specialized shops selling rum.  Prices here are quite high, and sellers often do not give change (no small money). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation in barbados" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/800524.jpg" width="471"></div>
