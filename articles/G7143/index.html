    <h2>  Holding a wedding </h2><p>  The recreation center "Don forest" of the Lipetsk region is a favorite and beautiful place for exit registration and weddings.  The special romantic atmosphere of the registration and the magical forest around is something that the newlyweds like.  Moreover, at any time of the year the forest is unusually beautiful.  Here you can hold a unique photo shoot.  Exit registration of marriage in the "Don Forest" is also good because there is no need to spend time on the road, moving from the registry office to the banquet hall and for a photo shoot.  Everything is in one place. </p><p>  At any time of the year, the organizers of exit registration create unique and original programs for each couple.  Winter weddings are no worse than summer and autumn.  Sledding, tea from a samovar, hot mulled wine.  The rest of the seasons are interesting in their own way.  Yellow carpet of leaves in autumn, delicate snowdrops in early spring. </p>

    <p>  On the territory of the recreation center "Donskoy Les" there are two banquet rooms and two sites for marriage registration.  For the bride and groom, there are deluxe rooms, as well as rooms for guests who want to stay on the second day of the wedding. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  At the camp site, they relax in the family circle or spend time outdoors with friends.  The reviews are very different: from everything is bad to everything is just wonderful.  Why such a runaway in grades?  Everyone just has their own criteria.  Someone loves silence, and someone likes to spend the whole night in a disco.  Not everyone likes the comfort that the administration of the base provides.  Of course, the houses are much more comfortable, but here, mainly, visitors appreciated the rest. </p><p>  In their reviews, people indicate the excellent location of the recreation center "Don Forest": the river is just around the corner, time passes in the forest zone, where the air is clean, which even makes you dizzy from an excess of oxygen.  Complaints to the service staff no.  There is no garbage on the territory, the grass is trimmed and always looks fresh, paths are laid everywhere, and in the dark the base is well lit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="base otzhhyha Don forest Zadonsky district" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2071410.jpg"></div>

    <p>  One of the wishes was to somehow resolve the issue with the stairs leading to the beach.  Very steep steps for the elderly, and it would not hurt to make a railing.  But this is quite fixable, and the request is justified.  There are claims to the bungalow, in which there are small rooms.  But, as representatives of the base explained, rest here is not positioned as comfortable with deluxe rooms.  The main thing here is nature, river, forest.  And whoever comes to enjoy time in nature, leaves the base very pleased. </p><h2>  How to get to the recreation center </h2><p>  Since the base is located near Lipetsk, and the Zadonsky district has bus stations, you can come to the base by bus or by personal transport. </p><p>  When traveling, a person often changes his perception of the world.  Perhaps after a trip to the recreation center "Don Forest" something will change in your perception of the surrounding reality. </p>
