To answer this question with one sentence will not work, since there are many ways to obtain information.  It is important to know it, since the tariff determines the main opportunities in terms of using mobile communications.  But before disassembling all available methods, we will consider the meaning of the existence of such a service. </p><h2>  Is this an opportunity? </h2><p>  How to find out your tariff for Tele2?  At first, doubt may arise on the appropriateness of using this information.  But you need to know your tariff, since it contains data on available Internet packages, provides rates for calls and messages.  It also contains information regarding additional features.

We will consider all available methods and provide the necessary instructions.  And first of all, we note the most effective and simplest option associated with calling the operator.  To implement it, it is enough to do the following: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Pick up the phone. </li><li>  Dial 611, press the call button. </li><li>  An answering machine will answer you and ask you to perform several actions. </li><li>  After a few minutes, the operator will answer. </li><li>  Explain the situation to him and request the necessary information. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.1010systems.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the tariff is easier than a simple tele2" class="if uuid-3138232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3138232.jpg"></div><p>  This method is the simplest, however, it requires several minutes of free time.

And if you want to use the standard option, then you need to know the USSD command.  For convenience, we have compiled instructions for you: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Pick up the phone. </li><li>  Enter the command * 107 #, press the call button. </li><li>  A window will immediately appear on the screen of the mobile phone, where the name of your tariff will be indicated. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="USSD request information" class="if uuid-3138239" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3138239.jpg"></div><p>  This option is convenient only if you just want to find out the name.  To get additional information about the cost and packages, in any case you have to visit the site or call the operator.  Now you are informed about how to find out your tariff on Tele2, and you can safely check all the methods in practice.  And we will supplement the material with information regarding archive rates and the most interesting offers that are relevant for January 2019. </p><h2>  The best rates </h2><p>  The mobile operator is gradually developing and offers new services.  Now we will try to determine the advantageous tariff "Tele2", which is available today.  In fact, in order to decide on a suitable service, you first need to understand the needs in terms of calls and Internet traffic.  And only after comparison, already make the final decision.  Currently, the following tariffs are available for connection: </p><ol><li>  ‚ÄúMy Online +‚Äù is the most interesting offer, especially if you decide to purchase a new SIM card.  In this case, you will get unlimited access to social networks and instant messengers, 30 GB of Internet traffic and unlimited calls to Tele2 in Russia.  The main feature is the cost, which is only 250 rubles per month when buying a new connection kit. </li><li>  ‚ÄúMy Online‚Äù is already a less saturated tariff with 10 GB of Internet, 400 minutes for calls to other operators of the home region and unlimited communication on ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù.  The cost is 350 rubles per month. </li><li>  ‚ÄúMy talk‚Äù is the best option for subscribers who communicate a little and do not use the Internet so actively.  This includes unlimited calls to Tele2, 3 GB of Internet and 250 minutes to other operators in your home region. </li><li>  ‚ÄúMy Tele2‚Äù is an interesting tariff that involves a daily fee.  It is designed for subscribers who are not ready to pay monthly.  The cost is 10 rubles per day.  The package includes unlimited calls to Tele2 in Russia and 7 GB of Internet. </li><li>  "My unlimited" is a tariff that is not advertised, but is available for connection.  The cost varies from 150 to 450 rubles, the package includes unlimited calls to Tele2 in Russia and unlimited Internet.  It is connected only at a personal request from the operator and in the salons of mobile communication. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="the tariff is so simple tel2" class="if uuid-3138237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3138237.jpg"></div><p>  To determine the most suitable option for you, you need to understand what you want from the service.  More internet?  Lots of calls?  Or a small cost?  It is on these points that you can make a choice. </p><h2>  Archive rates </h2><p>  But how to solve the issue with the tariff ‚ÄúEasy as Easy‚Äù in ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù?  Why is it not in the list for connections, but does the comrade have it?  Indeed, many subscribers faced a similar situation and still could not understand the essence of what was happening.  But the answer is quite simple - improving offers and developing a mobile operator.  Almost every month, the company makes adjustments to existing tariffs and offers new ones.  And so that tariffs do not conflict with each other and there is no overabundance of information, it was decided to write off such proposals as part of the archive.  In simple terms, they were simply removed from the available services.  And subscribers who did not change the tariff could continue to use them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.protarif.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the tariff is so simple tel2" class="if uuid-3138241" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3138241.jpg"></div><p>  Everything sounds complicated, but it is prescribed in the contract of the mobile operator and is carried out within the framework of the law.  And to determine if your tariff is archival, just use our instructions to get information.  If there are numbers indicating the month and year opposite the name of your service, then it is closed for connection.  As an example, you can pay attention to the tariff ‚ÄúIt's so simple‚Äù in ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù, which has the designation ‚Äú10-2012‚Äù. </p><h2>  How to return an outdated offer? </h2><p>  Often, subscribers do not want to switch to new services and use familiar ones.  It will not work out deliberately to return to archive tariffs, as this is prohibited by the terms of the mobile operator.  But there is an exception in the form of a random connection, which sometimes occurs by mistake of the support specialist or the ‚ÄúTele2 Theme‚Äù function.  For example, the subscriber used the tariff ‚ÄúEasier than Easy‚Äù, but an unpleasant incident occurred and now he has ‚ÄúMy Online +‚Äù.  To fix this situation, it is enough for the user to contact support at 611 and explain the whole situation. </p><p>  An application for the return of the archive tariff will be drawn up and in the near future it will be restored to its previous conditions.  Please note that a special check is carried out, as a result of which the reason for the connection is determined.  If the subscriber is not involved, then the recovery procedure is performed.  And if the user tries to cheat, then he will be denied. </p><p>  Now you have all the necessary information that is useful to you.  Use our tips and keep instructions. </p>
