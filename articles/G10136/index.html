    <p>  Nevertheless, banks do not always issue loans under a business plan from scratch.  However, some organizations have special programs for such borrowers. </p><h2>  Primary requirements </h2><p>  Before applying for a loan under a business plan, you need to carefully prepare.  First of all, the representative of the bank will ask about what kind of strategy the future activities of the novice entrepreneur will follow.  The document should be prepared as detailed as possible.  The business plan for obtaining a loan indicates structured information according to which the bank can be sure of the implementation of this project. </p><p>  In addition, to obtain loans of this type, a pledge is required, in which you can use private property or other valuable property.  You will also need to open an account with the selected bank.  If an entrepreneur is employed at the time of filling out the documents, then a statement of income will only help to get a positive answer.  Of course, you can try to get a loan under a business plan without collateral, but in this case the chance of approving the application is significantly reduced. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is also worth considering that such loans are issued exclusively to those who have an impeccable credit history.  In addition, loans are not issued to people who have a criminal record. </p>

    <p>  It is worth considering that the main criterion for issuing a loan under a business plan is the solvency of the borrower.  If he has no income or any valuable property that can be mortgaged, it is more profitable for the bank not to risk it.  Therefore, before leaving the old job, it is worthwhile to think about the fact that it is probably much better to apply with a permanent place of employment. </p><p>  It is also worth considering that lending to small businesses differs in more stringent conditions when compared with consumer loans.  Therefore, if the initial capital does not require too large a sum of funds, then it may be much easier to get a consumer <span>non-targeted loan.</span>  Consider step-by-step recommendations that will help you take a loan under a business plan.  And you should start with the most important thing. </p><h2>  Business plan </h2><p>  The fact is that, first of all, the development strategy of the new organization is needed not only for the bank, so that it makes sure that this company will be profitable, but also for the novice entrepreneur.  Without this document it is impossible to correctly calculate and even more justify the costs that the selected business will require. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This paper must contain at least 10 pages, on which all expenses for opening a particular enterprise will be indicated.  It is necessary to indicate the possible costs, the number of employees who will be involved in the work process, suppliers and much more.  And the main thing is to correctly calculate everything and back it up with real figures of estimated income. </p>

    <p>  Not having studied these basics, it is very risky to get a loan under a business plan. </p><h2>  Availability of collateral and guarantors </h2><p>  This is the second point that a bank employee draws attention to when issuing such a loan.  If a person has collateral, then it will become a reliable guarantor that in case of bankruptcy of a novice businessman, all money will be returned to the bank. </p><p>  It is also worth considering that due to collateral, the loan rate will be significantly reduced.  As collateral, you can use real estate (apartment, house or land), transport, any securities, equipment, etc. </p>

    <p>  To be sure to get a loan under a business plan, it is best to involve a legal entity that will act as a guarantor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Credit history </h2><p>  This is a very important nuance, since absolutely at any bank, when applying for a loan, the borrower's previous activities with regard to financial organizations are always checked.  Therefore, you need to make sure that the previous entrepreneur has successfully closed all previous loans and that no penalties have been filed against them. </p><h2>  Package of documents </h2><p>  In addition to the business plan and basic documents confirming the identity of the borrower, it is necessary to provide absolutely all the papers that may in one way or another relate to the future project.  Also, a very good help in obtaining a loan will be the availability of ready-made licenses and other permits for a certain type of activity that a person plans to engage in. </p><h2>  Additional documents </h2><p>  In addition to the main papers, you will need to provide an internal passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation and any second document that can confirm the identity of the borrower.  As a rule, a TIN is used as it. </p><p>  It is also desirable to provide a certificate of registration of IP or open joint stock company.  An extract from the OGRUL will be useful.  At the same time, it should be quite fresh.  Also, experts recommend registering with the tax service and getting a license or permission. </p>

    <h2>  Choosing a bank and lending program </h2><p>  Today there are a huge number of different offers for obtaining loans of this type.  Of course, each client wants to choose exactly the program that will be most profitable. </p><p>  First of all, for a loan under a business plan it is worth contacting the bank in which the Russian citizen has already opened an account or has a pension or salary card. </p><p>  When choosing a financial institution, you should pay attention to its independent rating.  For this, the easiest way is to go to the official website of Expert RA. </p><h2>  Filing an application </h2><p>  When all the documents have been collected and the business plan has been prepared in detail, it is time to go to the official website of the selected bank and fill out the application online.  Or you can contact the branch of the financial organization directly and draw up all the documents personally. </p><p>  The data should be indicated as accurately as possible, since in the event of any error the bank employee may have doubts that the borrower is trying to deceive him. </p><p>  After this, the application is reviewed, which can take from several days to two weeks, depending on the selected bank.  After that, a financial institution employee contacts the client and invites him to sign the contract. </p><h2>  Conclusion of an agreement </h2><p>  Before signing any documents, regardless of which financial institution the aspiring entrepreneur applied to, he should carefully and thoroughly study the paper provided to him.  Most attention should be paid to the final interest rate on the loan.  If it is not indicated, then in this case there is a big risk of overpaying twice.  It is also worth paying attention to the payment schedule, which should be quite convenient and fully consistent with the capabilities of the client. </p>
