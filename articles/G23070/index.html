First of all, tourists are attracted by the magnificent nature and attractions of this corner, as well as delicious food and always excellent weather. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The town of Raanana in Israel was founded in 1912.  It would be more correct to say that at the beginning it was not a city, but a settlement, since it was formed by several Jewish families who returned from America.  They called their settlement Raanania, but neighboring Palestinian families christened this region of America.  A few years later, when the settlement grew and looked like a city, it was decided to call it Raanana, which means ‚Äúvigor‚Äù. </p><p>  Today, the number of people living in the city of Raanan in Israel reaches 80 thousand people.  These are mainly immigrants from the USA and Europe.  However, in the past few years, the Russian-speaking population has also begun to discover this small, cozy town. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Raanana, Israel" class="if uuid-3247917" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3247917.jpg"></div><h2>  Economic sphere </h2><p>  Raanana is an industrial city.  Despite its small size, the northern part of the city is completely devoted to industrial production.  Such giants of modern business as Hewlett-Packard, Sap, Europe‚Äôs largest producer of various software, work here.  In the eastern part of the city there are various cafes, restaurants, entertainment venues, shopping centers.  The city has the so-called "rarefied" construction law.  This means that about eighty percent of the total area is occupied by parks and squares.  The city administration spends a lot of money on protecting the environment and maintaining the needs associated with it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="101israel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Raanana street" class="if uuid-3247919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3247919.jpg"></div><h2>  Climate and nature </h2><p>  The nature and weather in Israel are stable all year round.  The average temperature is about twenty-five degrees Celsius.  In such a climatic zone, all kinds of plants and flowers, with which the streets are full, feel great.  At the beginning of its existence, the city could not boast of parks and gardens for walks, but over time it acquired them.  Now every citizen can spend free time in any local green corner, enjoy nature, birdsong and clean air, since it is forbidden to create industrial enterprises in the territory of the city of Raanana in Israel.  All of them are beyond his line. </p><p>  The tourist season in Raanan is year-round.  The city is not famous for its many attractions, but there are places for cultural leisure and entertainment.  Raanan is more focused on a quiet relaxing holiday without noisy parties and walks until dawn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.netzarim.co.il" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="central park" class="if uuid-3249457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3249457.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Attractions in Raanan in Israel are few, but they are.  First of all, the city is good for walking.  Here at any intersection you can rent a bike and embark on an independent journey through the streets and alleys. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is a small lake in the city park where you can rent a boat.  Above the lake is a beautiful bridge.  Many people like to walk on it in the evening and listen to the birds singing.  "Raanana Park" is the main attraction of the city.  In its center there is an excellent cafe where you can drink a cup of coffee and enjoy delicious buns that are brought here from your own bakery. </p><p>  There are also entertainments for children.  You can have a great day at Sky Park.  This is the best place for entertainment in the city of Raanan in Israel, where many of them are focused on active sports activities.  These are all kinds of turnstiles, slides, swings and trampolines.  The latter make up the pride of Sky Park.  Despite the fact that it is considered to be children's, adults with no less interest and joy spend time here. </p><p>  Another favorite leisure spot in the city is Inside Side Park.  Entertainment here is more serious.  For example, thematic quests.  A very popular game where it is necessary for a certain amount of time to complete the so-called missions, find clues, use keys, solve puzzles to get answers to questions.  It will be interesting to spend time here for adults and high school students. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dambis.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Center Raanana" class="if uuid-3249456" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3249456.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  If you decide to spend a vacation in Raanan in Israel, the city offers several excellent hotels with high-quality service for tourists.
