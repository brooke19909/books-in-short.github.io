    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  Nicotera Beach Village 4 * complex was built not so long ago, so its architecture and location are very conceptual.  It is located among the groves of trees characteristic of the local coast - pines and citrus fruits.  Therefore, the air in its territory is simply drunk with health.  The hotel is suburban, to the nearest civilization - the resort village of Nicotera - about four kilometers in a straight line.  There are several supermarkets where you can buy everything that you lack in a hotel.  What else interesting tourists noticed in the location of Nicotera Beach Village 4 *?  Lamezia Terme (Lamezia Terme) is an airport, as well as one of the main transshipment points where the train from Nicotera goes.  From there you can leave not only to the capital of the region - Reggio Calabria, but also by night trains to Turin, Rome, Milan, Florence.  In fine weather, you can see Sicily from the windows of the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How come here </h2><p>  Planes from <span>Italian cities</span> most often arrive in Reggio Calabria, and charter flights from Russia arrive in Lamezia Terme.  Transfer from the airport to the Nicotera Beach Village 4 hotel (Italy) will take you about an hour and a half time.  But the journey will not seem long and tiring to you - the road is very beautiful, and the guides usually tell a lot of interesting things about Calabria, so this is a mini-tour.  If you are in your own car, it is best to get from the airport via the A-3 motorway.  A train from Rome or Florence arrives at Rosarno Station, which is eight kilometers from the hotel.  But the train from there goes to the village of Nicotera. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicotera beach village 4 reviews" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/520326.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  How to feed </h2><p>  This is one of the few hotels that accepts vacationers according to the all inclusive system.

Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served here.  This restaurant specializes in seafood as well as the freshest cheeses.  By the way, here only water, wine and beer are served from drinks.  Cafe "Grill Pizzeria" is open only at lunchtime, and mainly offers grilled fish and barbecue meat, various Italian and Calabrian snacks, pasta.  Pizza is baked on wood here.

There is a separate kitchen for children, where you can order soup, porridge or something else to the taste of the child.  Alcohol is very high quality, and you can take as much as you like - both in the restaurant and in the bar. </p><h2>  Where to swim and sunbathe </h2><p>  It is known that untouched nature and the amazing sea are the two main reasons why tourists come to a place like Calabria.  Nicotera Beach Village 4 * stands directly on the sea.  From any of its buildings to the beach go no more than a hundred meters.  In addition, you will march to the sea through a beautiful cedar forest, and the smell of needles will envelop you in an invisible cloud.  The sea, according to reviews of almost all vacationers who have been here, is simply magical - in color, temperature and tactile sensations.  It is called "velvet."  The beach is very well maintained and clean.  There are many sun loungers, and they always are.  You cannot reserve them with towels.  The pool is large and very clean, especially considering that during the season about eight hundred people rest at the hotel at the same time.  Someone from the staff is always on duty near him, monitoring order and safety.  There is a children's section in the pool.  Swimming is required in hats. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicotera beach village 4 pics" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/520333.jpg" width="390"></div>

    <h2>  Where to go and go </h2><p>  First of all, tourists who visited Nicotera Beach Village 4 * devote their reviews to the surroundings.  They are advised to walk there, walk around the surroundings, for example, visit the neighboring town of Nicoter.  You can go right along the coast along the sea, then the road will take more than an hour, or even a half.  And if along the path through a pine forest - then no more than forty minutes.  In the upper village you can see the very beautiful medieval quarter of Borgo.  For shopping, especially for branded items, it is recommended to go to one of the main cities in the province - Reggio Calabria.  Tasting tours are very popular.  A lot of good, and even enthusiastic responses about a sea voyage to the island where <span>the Stromboli volcano</span> is located (when it gets dark, you can even see a mini-eruption).  Many tourists coming to Calabria use their stay here for trips to Sicily, especially since there are regular ferry services.  You can buy an excursion to this island, which includes a visit to the volcano Etna or the city of Taormina.  But experienced vacationers are advised to take a car, without which you will not learn the secrets of this beautiful land.  In an extreme case, it is recommended to take an electric train if the excursions seem expensive.  Without fail, according to vacationers, you need to visit cities such as Tropea, and only then choose trips to your liking. </p><h2>  What is the price </h2><p>  The hotel is one of the best accommodation options in the Calabria region.  Nicotera Beach Village 4 * is not a cheap resort complex.  Room prices at this hotel start at sixty euros per day in low season.  In high maybe 100-125 –Ñ.  However, it's worth it.  It should also be remembered that upon arrival at the hotel, as is customary in Italy, a tourist tax of one euro per day is taken (but the total amount does not exceed ten).  ‚ÄúAll inclusive‚Äù comes out a little more expensive than breakfast, but gives significantly more bonuses.  Rent a scooter per day (if you take it at the hotel) - about forty euros per day.  Taxi from the hotel to Nicotero is about 20 –Ñ.  Internet access will cost <span>1 euro</span> per hour or twenty-five per week.  The cost of a trip to Sicily or the cities of Calabria is from fifty euros per person.  Therefore, excursions are advised to buy in Lower Nicoter - they are half or even three times cheaper there than in a hotel.  The trains are not very expensive - a ticket to Reggio Calabria costs about four euros.  If you have a child under two years old with you and you want to use the children's menu and playpen, you need to pay the hotel another 10 –Ñ per day. </p><h2>  Nicotera Beach Village 4 * (Calabria) - reviews (conclusions) </h2><p>  The main advantage of this hotel, from the point of view of tourists vacationing there, is the feeling of complete relaxation.  The hotel is designed for the Italians themselves, as well as holidaymakers from Europe - the Czech Republic, France, Germany.  Tourists leaving their reviews about traveling and staying in the hotel recommend it for families with children, couples who want to spend time among romance and nature, as well as those who are crazy about Italy, and especially Calabria, who are fascinated by the local culture.  Even people who brought six-seven-month-old babies fell in love with this hotel, and they assured that they had no problems.  There is a very friendly atmosphere, there are no drunkenness and loud cries at night.  Rest here leaves not only pleasant impressions, but also sweet memories.  You will see many beautiful places, learn to live truly leisurely, in ‚Äúsweet doing nothing‚Äù, and also observe how the southerners spend their time with their leisurely and measured schedule.  Perhaps you should not say that you want to come back here - this goes without saying.  Indeed, many of us are so tired of the bustle of big cities. </p>
