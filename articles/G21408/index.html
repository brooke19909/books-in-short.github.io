The trend did not start today, but there is no need to talk about the complete departure of classical solutions.  Still, the love of a large part of consumers for mechanics does not disappear.  This particularly illustrates the situation in the segment of push-button telephones, where combining a traditional keyboard with new features provides manufacturers with high demand.  No less interesting solution was prepared by the developers of the <span>Fujifilm X100S</span> camera <span>, a</span> review of which will help to find out its features, advantages and disadvantages. </p><h2>  Model Overview </h2>

    <p>  Before the advent of digital cameras, there was a stereotype about the dependence of the size of the device and the quality of the resulting images.  Later, this opinion changed and it became obvious that the sensor has a direct effect on the characteristics of photographs.  Already in our time, only mirror models were supplied with such elements.  Later, very worthy mirrorless cameras began to appear.  In this context, the position that the Fujifilm X100S occupies in its segment is particularly unusual.  Technologically, it is rather a mirrorless device, but it is equipped with a large fixed lens and a CMOS sensor.  The result is a compact camera with a finely implemented and modern filling.  The external styling for classic <span>film cameras</span> also gives the model a charm, for which both amateurs and professionals appreciate it.  I must say that this concept with technical implementation is not the first time used by the manufacturer.  For example, in 2012, the X100 model was released.  The device in the first version was largely imperfect, which, however, did not prevent it from gaining quite a high popularity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The shooting possibilities of the camera are wide and, most importantly, they are supported by thoughtful optics.

    <p>  At the first glance at the camera, it becomes clear that the alliance of designers and designers Fujifilm worked wonderfully.  The choice of materials and assembly does not raise the slightest doubt about the quality of the apparatus.  By modern standards, the dimensions are large, but otherwise everything is impeccable - backlashes and areas with unpainted plastic are not nearly observed.  But the retro style is implemented in the best traditions of cameras of the last century.  The upper and lower areas are made of aluminum, which provides the Fujifilm with strength and durability.  The central part of the body is encircled with soft rubber, similar in texture to the skin.  It is especially pleasant that this solution has not only a decorative, but also a practical function - the coating provides a comfortable and reliable grip.  As for the lens, he switched to this model from its predecessor and is located in a central place on the front panel.  The protrusion beyond the line of the case is a couple of centimeters - here the diaphragm and focus adjustment rings are made.  On the front panel there is also an AF lamp with a viewfinder mode switch. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Screen and viewfinder </h2><p>  One of the main disappointments for the sophisticated amateur photographer may be the display of the model.  Still, 460 thousand pixels with a diagonal of 2.8 "are such indicators even in budget DSLR models are considered an exception to the rule. But this nuance does not cause serious difficulties during operation - all the elements on the screen are clearly distinguished and located. The hybrid viewfinder deserves special attention. Since the beginning of its appearance in the X100 line, there have been rumors that it does not fit with some lenses, but this is not so, you can use the Fujifilm X100S converter from the WCL series to convert the <span>focal length</span> to equivalent 28 mm.  Between optical and electronic viewfinders are instantaneous. Switching can be done both manually and automatically. Optical viewfinder mode provides output of graphic information. In the settings list you can find focus points, horizon level, compositional grid and distance scale. All indicators are updated automatically by as changes in the operating parameters of the camera, a fully electronic viewfinder mode is also provided, in which the picture is transmitted directly from the sensor. </p>

    <h2>  Device functionality </h2><p>  Thanks to the convenient adjustment of the focal length, the model can be considered as universal and does not require a change in optics.  The device has a rather high aperture ratio in f / 2.0, which also increases the shooting efficiency.  There are also pleasant things for those who like to synchronize flashes at ultrashort shutter speeds - this is ensured by a central type shutter.  A filter with a neutral density is provided in the lens itself, which allows you to shoot saturated landscapes even on a sunny day on an open aperture.  In addition to conventional photography, the Fujifilm X100S is equipped with slide film simulation modes.  Support is also provided to recreate the image as new films and filters for shooting with miniature effects.  Tools for panoramas are also implemented at a decent level - with one touch of a finger you can get a 120 or 180-degree view with wiring the device in any direction.  The camera also has the ability to shoot in RAW format, which in itself is a good reserve for professional photography.  The developers provided support for 14-bit RAW, which resembles the quality of images from expensive DSLRs such as <span>Nikon D4.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Additional options </h2>

    <p>  In addition to the standard shooting settings, the user will be able to more finely adjust the tone of light and shadows, sharpness, noise reduction level, and <span>white balance</span> to fit his needs <span>.</span>  All these indicators in this case are regulated outside the scope of the dynamic range.  Unfortunately, there is no built-in stabilizer in the model, however, for a fixed focus fixed lens, this is not so scary.  But there is a flash that improves the quality of shooting in low light.  It is worth noting the video shooting capabilities of the Fujifilm X100S, which have noticeably progressed compared to the predecessor of the device.  Recording is performed at a decent frequency of 60 frames, stereo sound and progressive scan.  A MOV container is also provided, but for some reason, the creators threw this function far into the menu, and did not display it with a separate button.  It can be seen that, on the whole, the developers did not make a special emphasis on video recording, although the quality of the materials obtained is very decent. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The device comes with the same battery as the X100.  This, in principle, is a familiar element of the brand NP-95, providing 1,700 mAh.  As noted in the Fujifilm manual, a full charge should be enough for 330 photographs.  Such a high result was achieved due to optimized power consumption, which allows you to rationally use the capabilities of the battery according to the CIPA standard.  True, in the practice of using the device, the number of pictures in the range of 290 - 310 is noted. The deviation is small, but this is not even the point.  In fact, the charge lasts for one day of shooting, which is not always convenient.  Unfortunately, this is a problem not only for Fujifilm, but for most models, even from the middle level. </p><h2>  Shooting quality </h2>

    <p>  In terms of photo quality, the model deserves the most generous and harmonious epithets.  The colors are natural and at the same time saturated.  Body shades are also optimal: the cover shines, but does not break out into the light.  Even in difficult conditions, exposure control works fine, and even premium SLRs can envy the speed of autofocus.  In many ways, the survey provides such high results due to the company's rejection of the Bayer grid.  The creators at the same time abandoned the low-pass filter and, accordingly, from the moire.  For all the benefits of low-pass filters, they adversely affect sharpness.  As the Fujifilm X100S tests show, the noise level is also within the acceptable range.  Even at maximum light sensitivity, the image looks very good. </p><h2>  Positive reviews about the camera </h2><p>  Owners, first of all, praise the excellent matrix, which minimizes the noise level.  This allows you to not only take high-quality pictures during the day, but also at night.  There are many positive opinions regarding the qualities of the lens.  For example, its aperture and clarity are noted.  The developers have provided the ability to open the aperture to create portraits with blurry backgrounds.  Although many digital cameras have similar capabilities, reviews on the development of Fujifilm highlight several rare qualities.  For example, a company allows you to shoot with stylization for an outdated corporate film.  The owner‚Äôs arsenal also includes a filter for dramatic landscapes with bright colors, and options for soft portrait shooting, as well as other tools that make it possible to turn to retro-style photographs with a digital device again. </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Among the shortcomings of the model, the owners note the smooth work of autofocus, the lack of a stabilizer and high cost.  Sometimes the absence of interchangeable lenses is also mentioned, but this is a fundamental decision for the Fujifilm X100S product line.  Reviews also criticize the model for some gaps in ergonomics.  For example, there are delays in the transitions of the menu, the implementation of settings and adjustments.  The same thing is observed when viewing captured images.  As a result, the overall shooting progress slows down. </p><h2>  How much is? </h2><p>  For its characteristics, the model is not cheap, but the overpayment is compensated by a number of noticeable advantages.  First of all, this is the original performance.  Of course, the manufacturer is not at all new to retro-style operation, but in this case the symbiosis of several directions with the inclusion of a sensor and new digital technologies is interesting.  But the main advantages are reduced to the quality of images Fujifilm X100S.  The price, in total, is on average 60-70 thousand rubles.  Again, the nominal characteristics do not promise anything supernatural, but practice shows that it was the implementation of the technical stuffing that provided significant progress against the background of the basic X100 model. </p><h2>  Competitors models </h2><p>  Different manufacturers offer similar capabilities.  For example, compacts with APS-C sensors in the spirit of Sigma DP1, as well as mirrorless devices from Sony and Samsung, can compete with this model.  If we talk about a comparison on design features, the Pentax brand in the fresh MX-1 and Olympus, which released the OM-D E-M5 camera, also successfully combined retro style with a similar filling.  If we talk about the quality of shooting, which has a Fujifilm camera, the closest characteristics are noted in the device CyberShot RX1 from Sony, which is also provided with an interchangeable lens.  The characteristics of the optics are comparable in the two competitors, and the difference is expressed in a better screen of the RX1, its improved matrix and a full-fledged 35 mm focal length.  True, the cost of the offer from Sony is much higher. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  The model confirmed the prospects for the development of the concept proposed in the first version of X100.  Moreover, the novelty demonstrated the results of successful work on errors.  In particular, the Fujifilm X100S camera significantly improved image quality, gained a higher focusing speed, and its controls became more responsive and more convenient.
