The devices of the Finnish manufacturer can be safely called a legend.  For the first time, a model with such an index appeared in 2004.  She replaced the not-so-popular <span>Nokia 3100</span> phone. Why was it not in demand?  The reason is the overpriced.  Looking at the successor, you can see that the manufacturer has radically changed its approach by releasing a budget copy.  And this decision was definitely true!  The Nokia 3120 quickly won the hearts of customers.  The target audience was mainly composed of young people.  People in adulthood rarely paid attention to this model.  But this did not affect sales volumes too much.  Considering that the selected index is easy to remember, the company decided to continue the line by adding the prefix Classic to the well-known name.  It is the characteristics and features of this device that will be considered in the article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 3120" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1799198.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Packaging and equipment </h2><p>  Nokia 3120 Classic - a typical "budget", designed to make calls.  The phone index is a direct confirmation of this.  Naturally, belonging to a certain segment was clearly reflected in the packaging.  For the design of the box were chosen nice colors.  All are warm shades of green.  On the front panel arcuate lines are used.  There is also a photo of the phone.  The name of the model is presented under it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Greater requirements for a set of equipment should not be presented.  The reason for this is the same low price.  In addition to the device and the battery, the user is offered a small bonus in the form of a monaural headset.  She is a wired type.  Equipped with a control button with which you can receive calls.  Earphones are plastic, foam tabs are absent.  Also included is a Nokia 3120 Classic charger.  It is quite large.  Unfortunately, although a USB port is provided, the buyer will not find the cable in the box. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Particular attention of buyers was attracted by the Nokia 3120 Classic.  It is completely spared from sharp corners.  All lines are smooth, the lower end is arched.  The phone weighs only 85 g, which is an indisputable advantage.  Also, you can not ignore the dimensions.  They are optimally selected by the developers - 111.3 √ó 45.4 √ó 13.4 mm.  The surface of the case is of two types: on the front side - glossy, on the rear - matte.  According to users, this solution is quite practical.  All Nokia 3120 Classic phones are decorated in three colors.  At first glance, there seems to be nothing special in the design, but the device immediately catches the eye. </p><p>  During use, the owners do not feel discomfort.  Due to its light weight, it is convenient to hold it in your hand when talking.  There are no problems wearing either.  It fits everywhere - even in pockets, even in a bag. </p><p>  The back cover looks impressive, mainly due to the original design of the space near the lens.  It is placed in a transparent plastic plate that rises slightly above the body.  The camera window itself is located in the upper part, and in the bottom - the brand name and resolution of the optical matrix.  On the left you can see the flash.  Above it is a hole for the speaker.  Under the cover, the user will find a battery.  The Nokia 3120 Classic works with one SIM card, so right below the battery is a slot for installing it.  But the slot for the memory card is brought to the end.  To replace the drive, you only need to remove the cover. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The front panel of the phone is designed typically for push-button monoblocks.  The upper part is occupied by the screen, the lower part is the keyboard.  We‚Äôll talk about the latter in more detail a little later.  The display is framed by a black frame.  The name of the manufacturer, located above it, immediately attracts attention.  Also at the top there is a speaker and a peephole of the front camera. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 3120 classic" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1799199.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Controls </h2><p>  The lateral sides of the phone can be safely called non-functional.  In addition to the volume control key, which is displayed on the right side, there is nothing more.  The rocker is comfortable.  Due to the fact that it protrudes significantly beyond the line of the body, it is easy to press it, and it is not even necessary to find it with the eyes. </p><p>  The power button Nokia 3120 Classic is located typically for devices of this brand.  By briefly clicking on it, the user will be able to quickly access the profile menu.  Unfortunately, a standalone key to activate the camera is not provided. </p><p>  At the bottom, the manufacturer has located almost all the important elements.  This is a connector for connecting audio devices that are equipped with a 2.5 mm plug, microUSB port.  The latter is covered by a plug on silicone mounts.  On its front side there is a special designation.  At the same end, the manufacturer brought out a connector for connecting a device for charging the phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also at the bottom, closer to the back cover, you can see the hole for attaching the strap.  The owners claim that threading it is a matter of one second.  You will need to remove the cover and just throw the rope on a plastic hook.  Then close the back of the case so that a characteristic click sounds. </p><h2>  Nokia 3120 Classic: display specifications </h2><p>  In comparison with its predecessors, the phone received a pretty good display.  In its manufacture, the developers used a TFT-type matrix.  The diagonal, of course, is small - only 2 inches.  The maximum permissible resolution with which a picture is displayed is 320 √ó 240 pixels.  The color rendering ability is worthy of respect.  Few button phones (apart from modern ones) can display up to 16 million colors.  On the Nokia 3120 Classic, any picture will look realistic, rich and bright.  The clarity is a little lacking, but given the year of manufacture of the phone, the display clearly refers to the strengths. </p><p>  High contrast in sunny weather from the TFT-matrix should not be expected.  The plastic with which the screen is protected greatly glare, which leads to a low level of readability.  The picture looks like black and white. </p><p>  Font change is available in user settings.  In total, up to 11 lines are placed on the screen: 8 of them are text, the rest are official. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 3120 phone" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1799200.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  The Nokia 3120 Classic is equipped with a mechanical keyboard.  It consists of a digital unit and a control panel.  Right below the screen are two soft keys that are used to work with the phone menu.  Below them, the reset and receive buttons are symmetrically displayed.  In the center there is a 5-way joystick.  Conditional arrows are made in the form of a chrome frame. </p><p>  Large keys are used for the digital block.  All of them are rectangular in shape with the exception of "*" and "#".  They are practically not divided among themselves - the distance is literally 1 mm.  In the horizontal row - 4 keys, in the vertical - 3. For those who prefer to work blindly with the keyboard, there are two special droplets on the ‚Äú5‚Äù.  For the central vertical row, the manufacturer chose a U-shape.  It goes well with the overall concept of the case. </p><p>  The surface of the buttons is glossy, flat.  Their move is pretty soft.  The response is clearly felt.  When pressed, a characteristic click is heard.  The digital unit has a white backlight, making it convenient to use the phone in any light. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 3120 charger" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1799205.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Performance and memory </h2><p>  The Nokia 3120 Classic is a simple way to make calls.  These devices do not require a processor.  There were no user comments on performance.  The device works the same as other similar devices. </p><p>  A very small volume of native memory storage - only 30 MB.  About 5 MB is already taken by the installed software.  To download files, the user only needs 25 MB.  However, the possibilities of the Finnish device are not limited to this.  The developers have provided for the use of microSD flash drives.  Officially, the manufacturer claims that the phone can operate with memory cards, the volume of which does not exceed 4 GB. </p><h2>  Battery characteristic </h2><p>  When buying a mobile phone, each buyer looks at certain characteristics.  One of the most important criteria is autonomy.  Only with a sufficient indicator will the device really be mobile.  Did the manufacturer fail the Nokia 3120 Classic?  The battery is made using a lithium-ion chemical composition.  Model - BL-4U.  The capacity is not bad - 1000 milliamps per hour.  To restore the resource you will need to spend about 2-2.5 hours, provided that you use the original charge. </p><p>  Manufacturer Specifications: </p><ul><li>  standby time - 300 hours; </li><li>  active conversation - 3.5 hours </li></ul><p>  Owner reviews on the autonomy (MTS mobile operator in Moscow and the region): </p><ul><li>  4 days - the duration of calls does not exceed 15 minutes, the number of messages is about 10. </li><li>  3 days - active communication by phone lasting up to one hour per day. </li><li>  3-4 days - with daily calls up to 20 minutes and short-term use of other functions. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Camera Overview </h2><p>  Features Nokia 3120 Classic complement two cameras.  The rear is equipped with a 2 megapixel module.  In poor lighting, you can turn on the flash, it also works in automatic mode.  Due to the fact that the lens is slightly recessed into the body, its surface is not scratched.  But there is also a drawback.  The user will notice that dust is constantly accumulating in the recess.  No autofocus.  Image resolution: maximum - 1600 √ó 1200 px, minimum - 160 √ó 120. The latter is mainly used for installation on the subscriber in the phone book.  There are 3 types of compression available in tinctures: high, basic, normal.  The manufacturer has provided standard effects.  There is also a quick shooting mode - up to 3 photos at a time.  There is an 8x digital zoom.  However, the owners of this phone do not recommend using the function, as the quality is violated, and the picture is simply cropped.  To save, you can select the storage card or phone.  The quality of the images is acceptable only when shooting outdoors in sunny weather. </p><p>  Using the rear camera, you can shoot video.  The format of the clips is 3GP.  The maximum allowable resolution is 352 √ó 288 px.  Evaluating the quality of the video is a threesome.  According to the owners, it does not reach the average.  All camera settings can be used for video editing.  The minimum clip length is limited by the size for MMS, the maximum - how much memory is enough. </p><p>  The front camera, as they say, is just for show.  Its permission is enough for video calls.  It makes no sense to use it for pictures, as it is low-quality (VGA). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 3120 classic specifications" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1799201.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Applications, Themes, Games </h2><p>  Each user can choose an interesting screen design to their taste.  Themes, although simple, but very pleasant.  There are four of them.  When you select a specific topic, the photo of the main screen is set automatically, designations and application icons may also change.  Undemanding gamers are presented with six games.  They are standard and already familiar from previous models.  Most of the available applications are in the ‚ÄúCollections‚Äù tab.  To access the Internet, the popular Opera Mini browser is provided, there are world clocks, a converter, and a widget program.  A good assortment of wallpaper.  Each user will be able to choose according to their taste and color.  There are images with nature, sea fish, flowers. </p><p>  When you dial a number, a white bar appears at the bottom of the screen, on which the numbers are displayed.  The font is quite large, but the more characters, the smaller it becomes.  When an incoming call, information is displayed at the top of the screen.  There you can see the word ‚Äúcalls‚Äù, and the number or name of the caller appears. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  Nokia 3120 Classic has two interfaces for data transfer.  The first is the wired method (USB).  The phone synchronizes with PC Suite and Windows Media Player with a cable connected. </p><p>  The second interface is Bluetooth.  The device uses version 2.0 with EDR.  Owners are invited to work 11 profiles.  File transfer speed, synchronization, and connection are unobtrusive.  Everything works without failures, which is quite typical for devices of the Finnish manufacturer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 3120 photo" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1799202.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Competitors and analogues </h2><p>  At the start of sales, they asked about 6,000 rubles for the Nokia 3120 Classic.  In order to understand whether such a cost is justified, consider the devices that made up the direct competition for the Finnish telephone.  The main comparison parameters are functionality and price. </p><p>  The most striking competitors are four models: two of them are of the same brand, the rest are Sony Ericsson.  They occupy positions in the middle price segment. </p><p>  <span>Sony Ericsson K800</span> has a number of undeniable advantages.  First of all, it is a camera and multitasking.  The described model is significantly inferior in these parameters.  The remaining characteristics are almost identical.  But the Finnish apparatus succeeded in the amount of cost - the difference is 1000-1500 rubles in favor of Nokia. </p><p>  Sony Ericsson G502 has a bright beautiful design.  Also, the manufacturer used optics with autofocus in the device.  And of course, the same multitasking. </p><p>  <span>Nokia 6300,</span> although it went on sale a few years earlier than the 3120 Classic, but it could well compete with it.  It was rightly called the flagship, since for the first time the manufacturer released a thin (by the standards of 2006-2008) phone.  The equipment of the new device has not changed, the only other version of the platform was used.  Definitely, the 6300 model is positioned as a fashion device with a stylish design, and the Nokia 3120 Classic is a typical ‚Äúmiddling‚Äù. </p><p>  And the last bright competitor is Nokia 6120 Classic.  Recall that this phone is a smartphone that runs on the Symbian platform.  The cost of the two devices is the same, but the functionality of the latter is much higher.  The remaining differences are insignificant. </p><h2>  Dismantling Nokia 3120 Classic </h2><p>  In most cases, when the owner does not use a case, dust, small particles of sand and other dirt get clogged in the phone case.  This can lead to a malfunction over time.  In order to prevent damage, which will require a paid repair, it is necessary to carry out cleaning.  Dismantling the device does not require special knowledge, so you can save by working on your own.  To do this, you need a tool.  Necessarily screwdrivers and a thin stiff iron blade, such as a scalpel.  If you act carefully, you can even replace it with a regular plastic card.  It is very convenient to open special fasteners with such an object. </p><p>  So, let's start the disassembly: </p><ol><li>  Remove the back cover. </li><li>  Remove the battery, external drive and SIM card. </li><li>  Carefully remove the front panel, given the presence of plastic mounts.  The latches must be opened very carefully, as they break easily. </li><li>  Having removed the front panel, access to the internal "filling" is opened.  The board rests on the screws.  There are 6 of them. Having unscrewed the four upper ones, you can remove the metal plate under which the connector is located. </li><li>  Having unfastened the connector, we remove the display. </li></ol><p>  After these simple manipulations, you need to wipe the dust and collect the device in the reverse order. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p> According to the owners, the device in functionality does not reach the price category of 7000 rubles.  A more attractive cost for it is a maximum of 5000 rubles.  The functions that the phone is equipped with are basic.  The design is attractive, classic.  In use, the device is simple and intuitive.  It is very convenient to hold in hands, carry with you.  The speaker speaks clear, loud.  During the call, the interlocutor's speech is heard clearly.  Noises, hum, crackling are completely absent.  There are no comments on stereo speakers either.  The sound of an incoming call is clearly audible even in the noisiest places.  You can evaluate the performance of the speakers by four with a plus, that is, above average.  The vibration option is not thorough.  In its level, it is not powerful enough.  For example, in a woman‚Äôs handbag it‚Äôs almost impossible to feel or hear the vibration.  Communication, as always, is on top.  The signal of the mobile operator is stable, failures are rare.  Also, the advantages include the battery life and color screen.  However, the camera became a fat minus.  There is no point in talking about the frontal one, but the main one is equipped with a weak module. </p>
