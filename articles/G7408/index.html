You can embroider a memorable date on the background of the picture, the names of lovers or the parameters of the newborn.  Do you like the quote of a great man?  Choose your favorite alphabet scheme and depict what was said on the fabric.  It will result in a small commemorative pattern for cross-stitch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alphabet embroidery pattern" class="if uuid-2755336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2755336.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, the most popular options for embroidering letters are the metrics of newborns, marriage, but try to move away from the patterns.  Embroider happy birthday on the canvas.  Or portray a funny humorous phrase and hang it in the room where you receive guests.  After this decor, guests will often visit you. </p><h2>  Schemes for a fantasy flight </h2><p>  It is worth making this type of circuit separately.  It's about monochrome pictures.  Rather, even about patterns of cross-stitching small pictures in one-color design. </p><div class="photo" data-original="za.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="monochrome dog embroidery pattern" class="if uuid-2755333" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2755333.jpg"></div><p>  Because as a result, your creation can turn out to be multi-colored from any number of flowers.  In this case, the revelry of your imagination begins.  After all, now you can use any color, any shade, melange threads with a smooth transition of one color to another, make colorful crosses in a chaotic manner, or embroider a picture in rainbow colors. </p><h2>  A game around the world </h2><p>  Embroiderers from all over the world combined their interests in one popular game called "Round Robin."  Several participants form a single circle.  Each of the players selects any topic, prepares their outline and marks it out for each participant.  The bottom line is that each of the players will embroider small pictures on the canvas of each other participant.  In turn, everyone sends the fabric to the next.  And so in a circle.  The cuts of the canvas of each of the embroiderers will pass through your hands, and as a result, your “Round Robin” will return to you. </p><p>  This is a kind of exchange of experience, a way to see the skills of other people who are passionate about embroidery.  You will communicate and keep in touch with each other throughout the game.  Everyone will find new friends, good friends or like-minded people. </p>
