It stretched along the coast of the Red Sea and several of its bays.  Holidays in each of them can vary significantly due to weather conditions and infrastructure development.  The most remote from the city center and the youngest resort area is Nabq Bay.  It has many advantages, such as the presence of an unusually rich world of marine life, the impressive width of sandy beaches, crystal clear waters.  The hotels here are basically all new, and each has its own zest. </p><p>  The four-star Hauza Beach Resort is famous for its vast territory with exotic birds and animals, many pools, its own water park.  Rest here is possible at any time of the year, only each season has its positive and negative sides.  To make the vacation a wonderful one, and stay at the Hauza Beach Resort was remembered only on the good side, you need to know all its features in advance, as well as the nuances of relaxing in the resort of Nabq.  The hotel itself is considered quite young.  It was opened for tourists in 2000, after which a series of reconstructions took place here.  The latter was carried out in 2007.  In addition, the hotel has changed and the owners.  All this, of course, affects the quality of the services provided.  Let's take a virtual walk around the hotel and see how things were here in 2015. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  In a fairly pleasant, albeit remote from the vibrant tourist center of Sharm el Sheikh, Hauza Beach Resort is located.  The map clearly shows that the hotel is located near the coastline, and that on the left side (if you face the sea) three more five-star Rehana hotels have been built, and on the right there is a stretch of coastline free from buildings, where people who want to get maximum peace can always to retire.  From the airport to the hotel about 10 km, or 12-15 minutes by transfer, to Naama Bay - about 15 km, and to the Old Town, famous for the oriental market and a cliff with waterfalls - about 25 km.  Near the hotel runs the excellent asphalt road El-Salam, which shuttle buses and buses.  You can also get to the center of Sharm El Sheikh by taxi.  A one-way trip will cost from $ 10. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hauza beach resort on the map" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1061253.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Hauza Beach Resort has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã122,000 square meters.  On this rather vast territory, which has several levels, buildings of different floors harmoniously located in Egyptian and Middle Eastern designs, several pools with artificial waterfalls, water slides and a suspension bridge, bars, restaurants, an amphitheater, sports grounds and children's attractions, two walls for climbing, shops, parking.  There are a lot of greenery, flowers, exotic trees, wide alleys, which are nice to walk along.  Previously, there was even a small zoo, but now only a pond is left of it, where beautiful pink and white flamingos live, which can be reached quite close, and a small pond with sea turtles, and on it is a small patch of land on which their land brothers live .  Both those and others can be fed.  It can be seen that the Hauza Beach Sharm Resort was built on a large scale.  At first he had a category of 5 stars, now only 4. </p><p>  The reception is located in a separate building and is open around the clock.  Most of the staff speaks and understands Russian, but there are also employees who need to speak English.  At the reception you can call a taxi, buy excursions, call a doctor, hand over clothes for washing, leave things in a locker room, solve all everyday issues, rent a car, as well as equipment for sports games. </p>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Hauza Beach Resort (Sharm El Sheikh) can offer its guests 505 rooms in freestanding buildings with storeys from 1 to 3 (without elevators).  The design of the rooms is simple but pleasant.  The rooms are decorated with paintings on the walls and matching curtains - very dense, excellent protection from the hot Egyptian sun.  There is no carpet on the floor, only small rugs by the beds or under the coffee table.  The views from the windows are different (it depends on the location of the building in which the number was provided).  You can admire the sea, territory, pools.  But those who are unlucky with accommodation, let's say, are forced to be content with dull "landscapes" - the walls of neighboring buildings and outbuildings.  However, does that mean people go to Egypt to spend time in four walls?  Balconies are in the rooms on the 2nd and 3rd floors, while on the 1st there is only a small veranda surrounded by a lawn.  Want to share in a good room?  This can always be agreed at the reception of Hauza Beach Resort.  Reviews of Russian tourists say that this manifestation of goodwill and hospitality of staff costs from $ 40. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hauza beach resort photo" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1060847.jpg" width="592"></div>  Categories:

    <p>  You can grab a bite between the main meals at the pool bar and on the beach, where they cook french fries, pizza, hamburgers, salads.  Here you can take a variety of drinks. </p><p>  In addition to the main restaurant, the hotel has two <span>a la carte</span> menus <span>.</span>  In one of them you can enjoy Indian cuisine, in the second - fish and seafood dishes.  Both restaurants have free admission once a week.  To use this service, at the reception on the day of arrival you need to take special cards. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  A unique cascade of pools is famous for Hauza Beach Resort.  The photo clearly demonstrates the interesting design of one of them.  The reservoir is arranged at different levels, and is divided into zones by decorative stones, so it seems that there are many pools.  One of the zones is heated in winter, several have <span>artificial waterfalls.</span>  The second pool, larger in size, is located near the bar.  This hotel is sometimes called Hauza Beach Resort Aqua, because in one of the pools are equipped with several slides.  The depth here is about 3 meters, which must be taken into account by vacationers with children. </p>

    <p>  Free sun loungers, <span>parasols</span> and mattresses in the sunbathing zone can always be found, there is no problem with this.  For sports enthusiasts, tennis courts are equipped on the territory, there are areas for playing darts, bocce, volleyball, mini-golf, basketball, futsal.  You can play big chess.  The hotel building has a good fitness room with new exercise equipment, while relaxation lovers can enjoy a jacuzzi and massage treatments. </p><p>  Animation at the hotel is present, but its quality depends on the team.  Some reviews say that all the fun was listening to music.  But most tourists report that the hotel animators have fun exercises, water aerobics, comic quizzes, evening shows.  As for discos, they are either arranged in this hotel, or tourists are invited to transfer to the neighboring bars by transfer.  This service is paid. </p><h2>  Service for children </h2><p>  Hauza Beach Resort has a children's pool for young tourists, located next to what is intended for adults.  The depth in it does not exceed 70 cm. The hotel also has a couple of good playgrounds with swings, slides, ladders.  Parents can request cots in rooms.  The restaurant has the opportunity to take highchairs.  A special menu for babies is not provided, which is noted by many as a minus. </p><p>  To occupy the young guests, a teacher works in the mini-club.  Also, parents can order a baby sitter.  But this service is paid. </p><p>  Day and evening, the hotel has children's animation, including exercises, fun games, mini-disco, learning dancing with children. </p><h2>  Sea and climatic conditions </h2><p>  Hauza Beach Resort has an excellent private beach.  Egypt is a country where you can relax and swim in the sea all year round, since the water temperature even in January rarely drops below +20 degrees.  But Nabq Bay, where the hotel is located, has some climatic features that affect beach vacations.  One of them is the wind, which gives the desired coolness in the summer months and is so refreshing in winter that it is uncomfortable to be in open areas of the beach.  In addition, the wind causes waves at sea to make navigation difficult.  On some days, they are so large that entry into the sea is prohibited.  The second not very pleasant feature of this place is the ebbs and flows.  During the latter, the water leaves so much that you have to go about 800 meters to a more or less decent depth. </p>

    <p>  The third feature is quite strong undercurrents, especially noticeable at depth. </p><p>  The advantages of Nabq Bay, according to reviews, are sandy and fairly wide beaches, a very clear sea, corals that have not yet been cleaned, and the mass of their unique inhabitants. </p><p>  All of the above applies, of course, to the beach of the Hauza Beach Resort.  Reviews of tourists note its impressive size, cleanliness, always free presence of sunbeds and umbrellas.  Many mention the fantastic beauty of the fish, which can be seen from the shore or from the pontoon.  Napoleon fish is particularly delighted.  They even gave her a name - Grisha. </p><p>  A big plus of the beach is a good, comfortable, without stones and coral entry into the water, which is especially suitable for children.  The depth near the coast is shallow, so here is a real paradise for them. </p><p>  Good swimmers prefer to go down to the sea from a pontoon, where the depth is more than 30 meters. </p><p>  From the entertainment on the beach you can go diving (the hotel provides all the equipment for hire), snorkeling, ride a camel on land, and on water banana and water skiing, play volleyball. </p><p>  The beach bar, open until 17 p.m., offers tourists several types of drinks and snacks.  You can stay on the beach before sunset. </p>

    <h2>  Sightseeing vacation </h2><p>  For outdoor enthusiasts, there is plenty of entertainment outside the Hauza Beach Resort.  Sharm el-Sheikh is rich in night clubs, bars, restaurants, hookahs, theatrical shows are also organized here, but the bulk of all this is concentrated in Naama Bay.  You can get to the bay by taxi for $ 15 or by minibus for $ 1, but as a rule they don‚Äôt happen late at night.  In the center of Nabq, which is best reached by shuttle bus, there are also interesting places.  Almost all of them are located on or near La Strada.  Especially popular are the shopping centers Metro, Al Khan.  In addition to them, there is a colorful Arab shopping center, in Russian called "Jasmine."  You can have fun in the Hard Rock institution: in the afternoon it is a cafe, and in the evening - a night club. </p><p>  In Nabq there is a famous national park where excursions are organized, and you can order an extreme safari.  An interesting feature of the Hauza Beach Resort is its location: approximately opposite the island of Tiran, a visit to which will leave an unforgettable experience. </p>
