    <p>  In addition to his services to his native country, the admiral was presented to international awards.  There was no place for medals on his dress uniform.  Fokine has become the country's pride and role model. </p><h2>  The legendary cruiser named after Admiral Fokin </h2><p>  The history of the famous ship began in 1960 (the date the cruiser was laid in the <span>North Shipyard).</span>  A year later, the ship was launched.  Before joining the Pacific Fleet (1964), the ship was called Vladivostok.  After he was renamed in honor of Admiral Fokine.  RRC "Admiral Fokin" kept its watch on the expanses of the Pacific and Indian oceans with the aim of friendly visits to the ports of Asia.  All those present at the appearance of the cruiser in the port admired the power and military staffing of the personnel.  The cruiser Admiral Fokin was considered a prestigious ship for service.  The ship went on long voyages under the command of M.F. Pichkur, <span>captain of the first rank.</span> </p><h2>  Cruiser Features </h2><p>  In the process of an arms race with the NATO bloc, the Soviet command decided to create a ship, not only not inferior in technical characteristics to similar enemy ships, but also superior to it.  Our ships were distinguished by the lack of air platforms and the inability to protect themselves from the air.  It was decided to create a missile cruiser - project 58. Initially, it was planned to lay more than a dozen ships, but in the end only four missile cruisers were launched.  A peculiarity of this type of ship was the hull design, the analogues of which were not even abroad.  The project 58 cruiser was considered the most efficient, powerful and unparalleled.  The series of these ships included Grozny, Admiral Golovko, Varyag, and Admiral Fokin.  Nowadays, cruisers are no longer used, their service time is over. </p>

    <h2>  The last years of the admiral's life </h2><p>  In the circles of the naval forces there are many legends and gossip about the death of the admiral.  It is believed that the trigger for an extensive heart attack was a fiasco when performing the transfer of fleet forces to Cuba.  In 1962, the operation was planned to redeploy the naval forces by breaking through the submarines through the US anti-submarine barriers on a narrow front.  Vitaliy Alekseevich was responsible for the preparedness and control of the operation.  The transfer of forces to Cuba was not successful.  The culprit of the failure and failure of the plan was Fokine.  The situation around the admiral was the most unfortunate way, she put pressure on him and his reputation for two years.  As a result, Vitaly Alekseevich died of an extensive heart attack in 1964.  His grave can be found at the Novodevichy cemetery in Moscow. </p>
