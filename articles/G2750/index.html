  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to replenish a kiwi wallet in Belarus. Overview of methods.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Qiwi (or Qiwi) is already perhaps one of the most popular electronic payment systems in Russia.  However, in Belarus it did not work right away.  And until now, users from the territory of the republic have certain questions to the service, to which it is not always possible to quickly get an answer.  The most common question: how to replenish a kiwi wallet in Belarus.  Although it is quite difficult to do this, it is possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="infinityloop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kiwi logo image" class="if uuid-2963119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2963119.jpg"></div><h2>  Why replenishment is a problem </h2><p>  The Qiwi electronic payment system came to the Belarusians much later than their neighbors.  And she still works with significant functional limitations.  In particular, it is still difficult to replenish the qiwi wallet account in Belarus, because the opportunities provided by the system are seriously curtailed. </p><p>  Even after Qiwi was transformed into the Visa QIWI Wallet electronic payment system, and it began to be dealt with by the international company Visa, the problem, including the transfer of funds, was not completely resolved.  Therefore, the need to analyze specific methods and find out which of them works and which does not, is more acute than ever. </p><div class="photo" data-original="qiwi-koshelek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wallet with money on the background of the inscription EPS" class="if uuid-2963122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2963122.jpg"></div><h2>  Methods That Will Not Work </h2><p>  The most obvious answer to the question of how to replenish a kiwi wallet in Belarus will be incorrect.  It is impossible to attach the Belarusian card to the Qiwi account in order to quickly replenish it from anywhere with Internet access.  If any person promises you that with his help this opportunity can be opened, then you should not trust him.  Typically, such a tempting offer will be fraudulent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Presumably working methods </h2><p>  At the moment, some users claim that the method of replenishing the Russian kiwi wallet in Belarus has already appeared and this can be done through another electronic payment system - Yandex.Money.  This system in the republic functions fully and allows you to deposit funds, including from a card.  After replenishing the Yandex.Money wallet, rubles from the account can be freely converted in a huge number of online exchangers, where you can even choose your preferred rate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="voicesevas.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yandex Money emblem" class="if uuid-2963118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2963118.jpg"></div><p>  The advantage of the method is that at this stage it is the only way to replenish a qiwi wallet in Belarus via telephone.  This is done using electronic systems applications and online versions of online exchange offices.  However, there is a significant minus, and it consists in rather large commissions, which the Yandex.Money system itself takes, as well as some exchangers.  If among the methods of how to replenish a kiwi wallet in Belarus, you choose just such a difficult exchange, then be prepared for deductions in percent, which ‚Äúbite off‚Äù a significant part of the amount. </p><h2>  Officially authorized replenishment methods </h2><p>  This, of course, is the payment terminals that are installed in Belarus at the points of the largest concentration of people, as a rule, these are shopping centers, supermarkets, train stations.  The terminals have a fairly noticeable design, so it is impossible to miss them.  Of the minuses of such a replenishment method, the following can be distinguished: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  The terminal does not give change.  Therefore, care must be taken to ensure that the funds are of the required denomination.  But as a compensatory measure, you can replenish the balance of the mobile phone with the rest of the money or make any payments through the ERIP. </li><li>  You need to know exactly where the terminal is located.  On the Kiwi website in Belarus there is a map on which you can find the nearest installed devices. </li><li>  Impossibility of instant replenishment.  The user wants to choose the fastest method, how to replenish a qiwi wallet, but in Belarus he will have to definitely sacrifice the recharge speed.  Still, getting to the right terminal to simply transfer a small amount to the account is rather unprofitable. </li><li>  You need to understand that Belarusian legislation is extremely negative about anonymous wallets in payment systems.  This must be taken into account if you want to often pay for some services and, moreover, receive money in your account. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="obankax.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kiwi system terminals" class="if uuid-2963120" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2963120.jpg"></div><h2>  Impressions from the work of "Kiwi" among Belarusian users </h2><p>  Due to so many restrictions, the system is not very popular among Belarusians.  Most of them admit that they would take a closer look at Qiwi if it were not for such severe restrictions that require many additional actions where an ordinary Russian user does not bother at all. </p><p>  However, people working with Russians start a kiwi wallet precisely because of its great popularity in Russia.  However, the majority tries not to do this with the help of the Belarusian telephone number.  Many hope that in the future the policy of the system will change and the conditions of use for Belarusian citizens will become more loyal.  Considering that the popularity of Internet payments has grown among Belarusians in recent years, this can bring a significant profit to the company. </p>
