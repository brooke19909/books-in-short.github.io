Watching them is a pleasure for both children and adults.  In 2006, the first and only dolphinarium was opened in the Republic of Tatarstan.  In Naberezhnye Chelny perform artists who have moved from Anapa.  Among them are dolphins, sea lions and <span>fur seals.</span>  Each of the artists is an individual with his own character, disposition, with his own moods and preferences.  But all of them are certainly very talented.  They do not just perform tricks invented by trainers.  They themselves suggest ideas for new issues.  That is, each performance that the dolphinarium in Naberezhnye Chelny demonstrates is the result of the joint work of man and animal.  In addition, marine artists also know how to draw.  And they do it right during the presentation.  And after that, such pictures are acquired at the auction by the audience.  For example, the work of the dolphin Savely was once sold for 10 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolphinarium in Naberezhnye Chelny" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10520/302159.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  In addition, the dolphinarium in Naberezhnye Chelny boasts its own "kindergarten."  In addition to adult artists, there are also very young ones who are still too early to go out, or rather, swim out onto the stage.  Some dolphins and seals arrived with their mothers or trainers from Anapa, and some were born here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Anapa Dolphinarium branch is located at the base of the Dolphin pool in the village.
