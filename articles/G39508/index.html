At the same time, the issue of choosing a hotel plays an important role, especially if you prefer the all-inclusive concept.  Indeed, in this case, on the territory of the hotel, guests spend most of their vacation, leaving it only for walks in the surroundings and trips on excursions.  In this regard, it is very important not to make a mistake in choosing a hotel, so as not to overshadow the experience and even more so not spoil your vacation.  An indispensable means of acquaintance in absentia with a particular hotel is to study the reviews of real people who have already been here.  As a rule, tourists try to mention not only the merits, which in most cases are obvious, but also tell about the shortcomings, which helps to make a more realistic idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel in question.  But the search process for such reviews often takes a lot of time.  In order to save your strength, we offer you the generalized comments of our compatriots regarding their stay at the Radisson Sas Park Inn 4 * (Egypt, Sharm El Sheikh).  Looking ahead a bit, we note that the vast majority of reviews by Russian tourists are positive.  So, according to travelers, this hotel is well worth the money spent and corresponds to its four-star category.  But we learn more about everything. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  For the most part, our compatriots were pleased with the rooms offered by him at the hotel.

    <h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  According to most tourists, as a rule, there are no problems with this item in the Radisson Sas Park Inn 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh).  So, our compatriots note that the maids at the hotel always try to please the guests.  They carry out cleaning daily.  Towels are updated several times a week and bed linen once every few days.  Maids also regularly fill the refrigerator in the room with bottled drinking water and replenish personal hygiene products in the bathroom.  In addition, many guests note that almost every day, upon returning to their apartments, they found on the beds amusing figures made of towels (swans, hearts, elephants, etc.), as well as fresh flowers in a vase on the table.  Our compatriots really liked this attitude.  In addition, if you need something, then you can always contact the cleaner, who are almost the whole day in the building.  So, he can be asked to bring an ironing board and iron, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="radisson sas park inn 4 reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1048919.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Check in, check out </h2><p>  In general, as noted by travelers, check-in at this hotel is carried out according to all the rules.  That is, room keys are issued to new guests after two in the afternoon, even if they arrived at the hotel early in the morning.  However, according to our compatriots, in most cases, if you offer the administrator a small amount of money (about $ 15) at the reception, he will do everything possible so that you can check in soon.  In addition, as tourists say, often newcomers are offered to pay extra immediately to get a room better than it was booked.  Experienced travelers are advised not to rush to give money, but first to look at the apartment.  In most cases, according to them, these numbers are quite worthy, and there is no need to spend extra money. </p><p>  As for the day of departure, it is necessary to free your room before noon.  If necessary, you can extend your stay for several hours at an additional cost.  But if you do not want to spend money, and leaving the hotel is supposed only in the evening, then you can leave things in the luggage room, and continue your rest yourself.  After all, guests have the opportunity to use the entire infrastructure of the hotel, with the exception of the housing stock, until their departure.  Therefore, you can eat and swim in the beach or in the pool and sunbathe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="radisson sas park inn 4 egypt sharm" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1048920.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, the own territory of the Radisson Sas Park Inn 4 *, the reviews of which we are considering, is very large, green and well-groomed.  Some guests say that in the early days they even had to stray a bit.  However, they quickly figured out the location of residential buildings and infrastructure.  Tourists in their comments indicate that the hotel complex has a lot of beautiful statues, fountains, picturesque gardens.  So there is where to take a walk and take beautiful photos as a keepsake. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Most travelers agreed on this point, which, admittedly, is not so common in relation to hotels both in Egypt and other countries popular with our compatriots.  So, according to many tourists, meals at the Park Inn are organized at a very decent level.  Of course, here you will not be offered to try expensive delicacies.  But the level of the hotel and its pricing policy do not imply such an opportunity.  In general, as guests note, it is simply impossible to stay hungry here.  So, for breakfast you can taste several types of cereals, cereals, puddings, eggs cooked in various ways, delicious fresh pastries, boiled and fresh vegetables, fruits, desserts, dairy products, tea and coffee.  For lunch and dinner, restaurant visitors can satisfy their hunger with a variety of dishes of fish, meat, poultry, soups, salads, snacks, pastries, desserts, vegetables and fruits.  In the evenings, cooks always cooked something on the grill. </p><p>  In addition, in their reviews, tourists note that the restaurant always has free places.  So, the waiters will meet you at the door and lead you to a free, previously cleaned table.  A big plus is the fact that guests do not have to come to the very beginning of the meal in order to have time to try all the delicious dishes.  After all, cooks replenish food trays as needed.  Therefore, even if you come to the restaurant half an hour before the end of lunch or dinner, you will have the same choice as the visitors who came here more than an hour ago. </p><p>  By the way, guests of the Radisson Sas Park Inn 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt) can also eat during the day in the snack bar by the pools or on the beach.  Here you can taste fast food.  In addition, in the daytime in a special booth on the territory of the hotel everyone is treated to ice cream. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="radisson sas park inn 4 charm" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1048922.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beverages </h2><p>  As many people know, the concept of ol inclusive implies the ability to not only eat throughout the day, but also to drink alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks of local (in this case, Egyptian) production.  According to our compatriots, most of all at the Park Inn they liked beer and rum.  Drinks can be enjoyed either in one of the bars on site or on the beach. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Radisson Park Inn is located on the second coastline, this did not cause any difficulties for the guests.  So, according to them, the sea can be reached from the hotel in a special open-top minibus that runs along the hotel-beach route throughout the day.  Therefore, you do not have to walk ashore under the scorching sun. </p><p>  As for the beach itself, it is quite large.  However, due to the fact that guests of as many as three hotels use it, there are always a lot of people here.  But according to tourists, sunbeds and umbrellas on the beach are always enough for everyone.  If you want to take a deck chair closer to the sea, then travelers recommend coming here immediately after breakfast.  There is a bar on the beach where you can either treat yourself to your favorite drink or, if you wish, have a bite to eat pizza, hamburger, french fries, sandwich, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="radisson sas park inn 4 pics" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1048921.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Entering into the water on the private beach of the Radisson Park Inn hotel, according to our compatriots, is gentle, with a sandy bottom.  Corals are found here and there, but this is not critical.  Since it‚Äôs far enough to go from the shore, even small children can safely swim here.  Moreover, they will be happy to watch small fish swimming from time to time. </p><p>  Adult vacationers can go down to the sea along the ladder from the pier.  Please note that here you will immediately fall to a depth of up to 20 meters.  But in this place is a coral reef, inhabited by a mass of amazing and vibrant marine inhabitants.  So be sure to "arm yourself" with a mask for snorkeling and, if desired, flippers. </p><h2>  Pools </h2><p>  For guests of the Radisson Sas Park Inn 4 * (photo of the hotel complex can be seen in this article) water activities are by no means limited to the opportunity to visit the beach and swim in the Red Sea, watching its interesting inhabitants.  So, on the territory of the hotel there are several swimming pools designed for both adult tourists and children.  In addition, water slides are equipped here, which vacationers of various ages enjoyed using.  The only minus of our compatriots is the fact that the slides work in turn.  Therefore, you often have to use not the hill you want to ride on, but the one that is currently working.  However, this did not become any serious problem that could overshadow anyone else.  In general, the water in the pools, according to tourists, is very clean, without a lot of bleach.  Many guests noted with pleasure that they clean the pools every day with the help of a special unit resembling a vacuum cleaner. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The hotel in question offers ample opportunities for leisure activities.  So, animators work all day at the main pool.  They invite everyone to take part in water aerobics, gymnastics, yoga, zumba, play volleyball, darts, water polo, etc. In the evenings, entertaining performances are held in the amphitheater.  According to our compatriots, the majority of the shows did not impress them much, as they are standard for many Egyptian hotels.  However, it is quite possible to visit them.  After completing the performance, you can go to one of the nightclubs of Sharm El Sheikh (for an additional fee of about $ 20) in the company of animators. </p><p>  In addition, the Radisson Park Inn has several sports fields and tennis courts, a spa, gym, tour desk, Bedouin tent, dry cleaning, beauty salon and much more.  Also, the youngest tourists were not ignored here.  For them, a mini-club works during the day, and in the evening a children's disco is held. </p>
