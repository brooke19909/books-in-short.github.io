    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Clermont-Ferrand is currently the capital of the French region of Auvergne.  The city is located on the slopes of an extinct volcano at an altitude of 400 meters above sea level. </p><p>  The double name of this place hints at its unusual origin.  The fact is that until the 17th century there were two warring cities.  The ancient Clermont was once the abode of powerful bishops who had great influence throughout the region.  And Montferrand was owned by the Auvergne counts, who for a long time opposed church authority. </p><p>  It is not known how this confrontation could end, but, fortunately, the decree of King <span>Louis XIII</span> forced the rivals to unite, and since then a new unusual city has appeared on the map of the country. </p><h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  The capital of Auvergne became famous all over the world not only due to its rich history of interesting facts.  Residents are proud that it was here that the famous Michelin tires appeared and the most famous way of evaluating the Red Guide restaurants was invented. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, the city is known in narrow circles thanks to the festival of short films, regularly held in it. </p>

    <h2>  Clermont Ferrand City Attractions </h2><p>  If you want to see the oldest part of the city, then you should look at the place between Place Delille and Place de Jaude.  Do not forget to look at <span>Victory Square,</span> and then inspect the Gothic Cathedral of the Assumption of Our Lady. </p><p>  This grandiose building was built in the 13th century from black volcanic stone, and inside it there are unique stained glass windows depicting scenes from the Bible and sketches from medieval life.  Nearby is the Notre-Dame-du-Port Basilica, built in the 11th century.  Compared to the cathedral, it looks quite ascetic, but it is among the best buildings of the Romanesque period. </p><p>  For history buffs, we recommend visiting the Central Tourist Office, which is located near the Cathedral, and buying a single ticket for ten euros for a single visit to all the museums in the city. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Most tourists prefer to spend their free time in local cafes or walking through the city streets.  Also a must-see item is shopping at local stores.  Active lifestyle enthusiasts can rent bicycles and explore specially equipped routes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Do not forget to visit another natural attraction - Mount House.  It‚Äôs best to go there in the morning or in the evening.  In this case, you can enjoy magnificent views without encountering crowds of tourists walking.  During this excursion that is useful in all respects, you will receive a small bonus - the opportunity to see the ruins of an ancient Roman temple located at the foot of the House and to see the memorial dedicated to the exploits of aviator Eugene Renault. </p>

    <h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  Having studied the history of the city, you will undoubtedly get hungry and want to relax in one of the local restaurants and cafes.  It is worth warning that the local cuisine is quite specific.  For example, a visiting card of local chefs is an Aubernian scar, stuffed with beef giblets and seasoned with plenty of spices. </p><p>  If you are not ready to try exotic products for ordinary Russians, then stop at the truffade dish, which is known in our country as French fries.  And do not forget that Clermont-Ferrand is famous for its five sorts of cheese.  Mention of the oldest of them (cantal) can be found in the records of Pliny the Elder, a Roman writer who lived in the 1st century. </p><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  Which accommodation method is better to choose if you decide to visit Clermont-Ferrand?  Hotels in the city are quite diverse, but not numerous.  Most of them are located around the historic city center and train station. </p><p>  If you decide to spend your vacation here, it is better to choose a hotel closer to the historic city center.  If you want to spend several nights in the capital of the region or travel with friends, then opt for one of the municipal campsites. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You can get to the capital of Auvergne very easily - just buy a plane ticket in one of the major cities in Europe or France.  The central airport is just seven kilometers from the city center.  If you decide to travel by train, it will be most convenient to take a ticket from Paris.  And motorists can get to the city through one of the central highways. </p><h2>  Visa to France </h2><p>  When you decide to come to this wonderful country from Russia or one of the CIS countries, you will have to fulfill a number of requirements: </p><ol><li>  Get a Schengen visa. </li><li>  Have a passport with a validity period of three months. </li><li>  Book a ticket and place at the hotel. </li><li>  Carry documents proving your financial viability. </li><li>  Pay a visa fee of 35 euros and a service fee - a little more than a thousand rubles. </li><li>  Another important requirement that is valid in this country and must certainly be fulfilled is to have three blank pages in your passport. </li></ol><p>  A visa to France can be obtained independently or with the help of travel agent agents.  It is important to remember that if you are under the age of 18, you will need the officially certified consent of the parents.  Pensioners and unemployed citizens should have a <span>sponsorship letter</span> from their children, spouses or immediate relatives. </p><p>  Applications for short-term visas are accepted by <span>French visa centers</span> from citizens, their immediate family or representatives of a travel agency accredited for these purposes.  The only exception is the center in Moscow, since only here you can submit documents through an authorized person. </p>
