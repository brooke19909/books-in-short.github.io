    <p>  In the 21st century, society is developing rapidly.  At the same time, the appearance of settlements is changing, new cities are emerging and existing cities are growing rapidly, a modern lifestyle is being born.  In huge production halls, human labor was replaced with automatic robots, some activities were transformed beyond recognition compared to past centuries and even with past decades, while others completely disappear into oblivion.  In this regard, the concept of ‚Äúendangered professions‚Äù appeared.  We will describe them in detail below. </p><p>  Along with changing reality, many names of professions go down in history.  Some simply transform their name into another designation, but there are those that completely cease to exist.  You will no longer meet their representatives on the street, information can be found in historical archives, and you can only see it in a movie or a theater production. </p><h2>  Professions that are not </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Disappearing professions are no longer relevant.  Due to the rapid development of science and the technological process, some specialties lose their relevance.  Machines replace human hands and cope with almost all crafts much faster and more efficiently.  Automation of many processes significantly reduces the cost of production and at the same time increases the productivity of any process.  Serious negative consequences of this are the loss of jobs, the growth of unemployment, as a result - the impoverishment of the population and an increase in <span>social tension</span> in the world.  Therefore, today the state makes a lot of efforts so that everyone can master the profession relevant to the current reality.  It is important for everyone to learn and acquire skills in those areas that humanity needs. </p><h2>  Excursion into the past </h2><p>  Let's recall the old professions that have lost their popularity and remained only in the pages of history.  The names of some of them are known, others sound alien and completely unfamiliar. </p>

    <p>  TOP professions that have ceased to exist: </p><ul><li>  <em>Daguerreotypes</em> .  They created the first portrait photographs.  Then there were no cameras, but there were silver plates on which the very first pictures were created.  They were replaced by photographers who clicked on the film.  But this is a completely different kind of work, therefore, we can safely say that the daguerreotypes have already become part of history. </li><li>  <em>Chimney sweeps</em> .  They regularly went out in search of dirty chimneys.  Not a single family could do without their efforts and work.  The modern generation knows about this specialty only thanks to the myths and fairy tales that have come down to our days.  Chimney sweeps were held in high esteem, since <span>cleaning chimneys,</span> pipes and fireplaces prevented fires. </li><li>  <em>Pied Piper</em> .  Surely many did not hear such names of professions.  But in reality it was a very important and dangerous position, these people could be compared with superheroes.  They saved entire cities from the invasion of rodents, which were real carriers of dirt and disease.  It was the rats that brought the plague, which in the 16th century exterminated half of Europe.  Today in many countries they strictly monitor order, preventing the spread of sewage and garbage.  If necessary, regularly clean public areas using strong poisons and other pest control agents.  In the past, tens of thousands of rats were destroyed by hand. </li></ul><h2>  List Continuation </h2>

Hard labor, during which people died.  Workers crushed the rocks used for construction around the clock.  Now stone mining is being done by specialized man-driven machinery. </li><li>  <em>Lamplighters</em> .  Every evening, they went out to work with long sticks, lit streetlights and maintained lighting in the city.  Of course, it‚Äôs hard to imagine that once there was no electricity. </li><li>  <em>Telephone operators</em> .  They were just recently, but today, in the "world of mobile phones", such old professions ceased to exist.  And once, in order to hear the desired subscriber, it was necessary to contact the telephone operator, who redirected the signal to the desired point. </li><li>  <em>Typists</em> .  Women in all printing establishments typed for hours, knocking like a machine gun on the keys of a typewriter.  It is hard to imagine that today someone is working on this outdated device. </li><li>  <em>Counters</em> .  At the workplace of these women there were only bills and paper with a pen for notes.  In each company, an accountant in the subordination was a lady who knows how to knock down numbers on bone accounts in seconds.  Indeed, a few decades ago, there was no calculator, and complex calculations were done precisely on the accounts.  Only women were hired, as they approached her more responsibly and were particularly persevering. </li><li>  <em>Coachman</em> - a cab driver, controlled a horse-drawn carriage.  But with the advent of the car, people stopped moving in wheelchairs and phaetons, which is why the need for this specialty has disappeared. </li><li>  The profession of <em>shoe shine</em> was once very much in demand.  Dirty shoes are bad taste, so all the high-ranking and simply tidy men regularly stood at the high chairs, around which young men with brushes and shoe polish swirled. </li></ul><h2>  Little-known disappeared professions </h2><p>  The list of professions that have disappeared includes those that are heard by many.  And there were also little-known ones: bakers, booths, coopers, komashniki. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the 15-18 centuries, the post of the kisser was widespread.  These people mainly monitored the replenishment of the treasury, the peasants' pay of capitation and dues (why not the tax inspectorate?), And participated in lawsuits and police supervision.  Upon assuming office, they took an oath of honesty and kissed the cross. </p><p>  In construction, they could not do without digging, embankments, deliveries and slab.  Today, their work is carried out by excavators, cranes and other equipment. </p><p>  There were many other specialties, without which it was difficult to imagine society in the past. </p><h2>  Professions that disappear </h2><p>  Specialists regularly keep records of <span>demanded specialties</span> and those that are on the verge of extinction.  Disappearing professions today are known to all.  Super-fast technological progress and the development of the Internet are creating new jobs, but at the same time you have to say goodbye to familiar crafts. </p>

    <p>  We give examples of professions that will no longer exist.  These are an <span>irreversible process.</span>  However, many can be comforted that the old ones are being replaced by new activities, the list of which is constantly updated. </p><p>  Disappearing professions: </p><ul><li>  <em>Packer</em> .  Enterprises will no longer need manual packaging, people will soon be replaced by robots.  Cars do not require days off, they do not need sick leave, and they do not argue with the authorities.  Already many firms and factories are moving to full automation of production. </li><li>  <em>Conductor</em>  Modern public transport is equipped with a turnstile.  It is installed in front of the entrance.  To use the bus, you must insert a card or lower the desired bill.  It turns out that there is no need for a person who catches ‚Äúhares‚Äù and sells tickets. </li><li>  <em>Postman, cashier.</em> </li><li>  <em>Librarian.</em> </li><li>  <em>Journalist</em>  They will be replaced by numerous copywriters. </li><li>  <em>Call center operator.</em> </li><li>  <em>Watchman, concierge, elevator, waiter.</em> </li><li>  <em>Logistician.</em> </li><li>  <em>Miner.</em> </li><li>  <em>Seamstress, weaver, potter.</em> </li><li>  <em>Accountant, economist.</em> </li><li>  <em>Architect.</em> </li></ul><h2>  Reducing the list of village artisans </h2>

    <p>  Many rural professions are disappearing.  There are fewer mowers, field laborers, fruit pickers, blacksmiths and shepherds.  Their work is performed by combines, cultivators, garden equipment.  There are almost no horses in farms, so there is no work for blacksmiths.  And cows are increasingly seen only on large farms, so shepherds disappear.  The process of reducing rural processes in the economically developed capitalist countries is especially pronounced, while manual labor in the fields is still in demand in developing countries. </p><p>  Simple and understandable specialties are closely intertwined with the world of high-tech technologies.  Science and electronics are rapidly gaining momentum, and many countries simply do not keep pace with progress.  Perhaps that is why in some parts of our country there are professions that have long gone down in history in Europe. </p><h2>  One of the consequences of the collapse of the USSR </h2><p>  Separately, it is worth noting the professions of the USSR, which ceased to exist with the collapse of the country. </p><p>  Everyone studied and sought to take their place in the nomenclature of the party.  Even the most outstanding instructor of the CPSU district committee ‚Äî it sounded proud and solid.  Not to mention the secretaries of the district committee and others.  The pioneer leaders who set the pioneers on the right path and organized their leisure time went nowhere.  Many professions of the USSR disappeared simultaneously with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. </p><h2>  Indirect consequences of the disappearance of many professions </h2><p>  50 years ago, the career was linear in nature, was calibrated and stable.  In his youth, a man chose a profession for himself, received an appropriate education, and throughout his life he was engaged in one thing.  Today the picture is completely different.  In the age of ultra-fast technology, this model no longer works.  A person has to learn all his life, mastering new, as a rule, narrow specialties. </p>

    <p>  High competition, fear of unemployment and constant mental stress - all this negatively affects a person‚Äôs health, his psyche, causing neurosis, depression and mental disorders.  As a result of permanent employment - insufficient attention is paid to the family, children, simple human connections are lost.  This, in turn, gives rise to child crime, which very quickly develops into an "adult." </p><p>  One of the consequences of the rapidly changing reality and the disappearance of many professions is the growth of unemployment, the impoverishment of the population, the decline in fertility, which in a chain reaction creates a <span>demographic crisis</span> and social tension. </p><p>  This is the ‚Äúblack‚Äù relationship built by the New York analytical agency. <strong><br></strong> </p><h2>  Professions of the future </h2>

    <p>  Dying professions will be replaced by new ones that meet modern realities.  Leading educational institutions are certified annually to obtain permission to learn new crafts.  And they are directly related to robots, nanotechnology and computers. </p><p>  Here is a list of specialties that are likely to be needed in the future: </p><ul><li>  <em>Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãYard</em> - will restore order on the Internet. </li><li>  <em>The city caretaker</em> is responsible for landscaping the city. </li><li>  <em>The master printer</em> is a specialist in 3D printing. </li><li>  <em>Personal chronicler</em> - establish all your roots and create a family chronicle. </li><li>  <em>Specialist in microflora.</em> </li><li>  <em>Drone operator.</em> </li></ul><p>  Today these are just theoretical conclusions.  But once the astronaut was considered a fantastic profession. </p>
