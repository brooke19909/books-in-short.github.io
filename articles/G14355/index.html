By the way, the <span>Nokia 5310 XpressMusic,</span> which will be the subject of our today's review, also entered this model range. </p><h2>  About the line </h2><p>  The product line of the Finnish company generally laid the foundation for the strengthening of the manufacturer in the market.  It was a truly thoughtful and powerful move in terms of consequences.  Yes, the company's popularity has grown, and as a result, sales have crawled up.  Nevertheless, the active development, which was characteristic at that time for the XpressMusic product line, required the company to take appropriate steps. </p>

    <p>  For example, it was necessary to create a variety of solutions for subsequent devices, which, by the way, included devices that worked on the platform under the name S40.  There are several advantages that they can boast of over their competitors.  These include, for example, increased performance compared to devices from the S60 line.  We will not forget about other dimensions. </p><p>  In principle, it is possible to note the sound quality of melodies and calls.  But this parameter is in no way connected directly with the platform.  Logically, it depends only on which of the additional chips is built into the overall hardware iron composition, and that's all.  Well, and accordingly, software features, including the equalizer, have a significant impact. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  For youth - youth solution </h2><p>  Old-timers and lovers of the Finnish manufacturing company perfectly remember what a sensation the model under the name 6500 Classic made.  But not everyone realizes that it was she who served as the prototype for the creation of the new device.  In fact, the Nokia 5310 phone, the price of which at the time of entering the market for cellular devices amounted to about 10 thousand rubles, is nothing more than a direct follower of the 6500 model. </p>

    <p>  We will not particularly delve into the history of creation.  However, we note that the analogue of the corresponding device was presented to the audience as a musical solution for young people.  In principle, the reasons for the development lie on the surface.  Let's think: would it be nice if in the arsenal of the Finnish manufacturer there would appear just two models similar in functionality?  It seems not.  Otherwise, it would become a source of competition.  Why does the company need internal competition, which will certainly result in lower sales efficiency? </p><h2>  Special equipment </h2><p>  Thus, <span>Nokia 5310,</span> firmware for which is available on the company's official website, was the first device to officially introduce the XpressMusic product line.  No, of course, before that there was still the Nokia 5700 model, but it does not so clearly express the positioning of the line's phones.  In any case, one of the differences between the 5310 device was a separate sound chip.  The second ‚Äútrick‚Äù immediately catches the eye.  It is as much about design.  It was converted to a youth, with the expectation of a purchase by the appropriate audience. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The package includes the Nokia 5310 itself, a battery (with a capacity of 860 mAh), and a charger.  This is for the classics.  Now let's look at the add-ons.  Among them, you can find a wired stereo headset of average quality.  Also included is a cable standard MicroUSB - USB.  Depending on the country in which the phone is purchased, the equipment may be supplemented by a microSD card (2 gigabytes).  Well, the package ends with a disk on which there is software, and a flyer on which you can find data to enter the Nokia Music Store service. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The dimensions of the device are averaged for such a segment.  In all three planes they are 103.8 x 44.7 x 9.9 mm.  At the same time, the mass of the device is only 71 grams.  Let's face it: the phone is quite thin.  If someone had experience with a <span>Sony Ericsson W</span> 880i phone, he will immediately notice the similarity of the two devices in this regard. </p>

    <p>  The device does not stick out at all in the pockets.  He lies there calmly, comfortably.  It is quite possible to carry it in pockets and, most likely, is even necessary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Color schemes </h2><p>  In this regard, the Finnish manufacturer did not bother much.  The device is available on the market in just two colors.  But this time, not white and black, but blue and red.  Probably what is needed for the music line.  The corresponding colors were allocated and the area that runs along the perimeter of the screen.  There are inserts made of metal panels. </p><p>  The name of the company printed on the rear surface of the device is engraved in the same color. </p>

    <h2>  Production material </h2><p>  The case of Nokia 5310 XpressMusic is made of plastic, of course.  Another, in principle, would be naive to expect.  The material is opaque to the touch.  It has a dark gray color close to graphite.  In general, it should be noted that plastic is not so bad.  On the contrary, it is of good quality.  That allows you to operate the device for a long time. </p><p>  The back cover is made in a dot.  That's just these points to wipe quite simply.  And after that, the presentation of the device deteriorates sharply, since the back cover begins to seem completely worn out.  The rest of the case is quite durable and resistant to mechanical stress. </p><h2>  Left side </h2><p>  There is a connector on which you need to connect the charger.  This is a 2 millimeter standard network adapter. </p><h2>  Top end </h2><p>  There is a power management key.  It is intended to turn the device on and off.  Nearby, there is a 3.5 mm jack, in which you need to connect a wired stereo headset to listen to music or radio.  Well, the MicroUSB standard connector complements the ensemble, with which the phone can be synchronized with a personal computer or laptop.  For protection, it is covered with a plastic plug. </p><h2>  Rear panel </h2><p>  It has a camera eye (2 megapixel resolution).  Unfortunately, the company's engineers did not add an extra key to the phone, with which you could control the shooting of objects. </p>

    <h2>  Right side </h2><p>  There is only a key with which you can adjust the volume of music and video.  It also allows you to transfer the device from one sound mode to another. </p><h2>  Front Panel </h2><p>  There is <span>a light sensor.</span>  It helps to automatically adjust the level of the backlight of the screen, as well as the keyboard.  He is brought closer to the spoken speaker, or rather, to his right.  Here, not far from the keyboard, is a microphone. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  We all remember very well that the <span>Nokia 6500 was</span> not equipped with a protective glass.  The engineers of the company took this flaw into account and this time went to meet the target audience.  So we have what we have.  Namely, Nokia 5310, whose screen is covered with a layer of protective glass.  The edges on the forerunner of the subject of our review today were mirrored.  Nevertheless, the eye constantly clung to visual asymmetry, although in fact it was not there. </p><p>  The diagonal of the display is only two inches.  The resolution is 240 x 320 pixels.  In millimeters, this is 31 x 41. The screen is designed to display 16 million colors.  It should be noted good quality.  The colors are saturated and vibrant, and the picture is quite bright.  Our model differs from competitors in that its display is designed unmatched better.  Especially if we compare this parameter with the creations of Sony Ericson. </p><p>  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using TFT technology.  In principle, the picture in natural light does not disappear, the display in the sun does not limp.  Most likely, this was achieved through the use of protective glass, and now we see that it was justified.  Nevertheless, at a certain angle, the device begins to glare.  And then endless turns in search of convenience begin.  You can forget about the maximum comfort of using outdoors (in sunlight) because of this.  Yes, and a small screen size affects.  But this will have to be reconciled, because such a decision is nothing but a compromise that the Finnish manufacturer had to make. </p>

    <p>  What can I say more?  Unless the screen can fit three service lines and nine text lines.  In most situations, the font that is is enough.  But the user can change the standard font using the appropriate settings. </p><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  In terms of communication quality, it will not work to dig into the device.  The reviews indicate that the interlocutor is audible distinctly, the microphone works almost perfectly.  The vibrating alert has neither great, but not low intensity.  In any case, it is felt through the pocket.  The main drawback of the model noted by users is the low volume of the main sound speaker.  However, if you listen to music exclusively with headphones, then there is nothing wrong with this drawback. </p>
