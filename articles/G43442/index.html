The best way is to go out of town on a picnic or fishing trip.  Especially lucky for those who have a cottage near the reservoir.  But what about the rest of the inhabitants of the capital who do not have such an opportunity?  Is there really no place in a multi-million city, where you can relax and escape from the summer heat?  Of course, there are, and not one, but at least several dozen.  But before collecting a swimsuit and towel, you need to find out where the most popular Moscow beaches are and what they can offer.  Some places previously allowed for swimming are closed, so you need to have up-to-date information.

    <p>  By order of the Government of Moscow, out of 11 zones intended for relaxing with bathing, only 7 passed the test, bathing is prohibited in the rest.  But this does not mean that next year everything will remain so.  Now rest zones such as Lake White are banned, water here does not meet the requirements, Toparevo and Beach Club were also closed.  But there are still many places in the city where you can enjoy the cool water.  These include Moscow beaches, such as: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Meshchersky; </li><li>  recreation area "Big City Pond"; </li><li>  "Silver Forest"; </li><li>  Beach on the School Lake; </li><li>  "Lake Black" </li><li>  "Left-bank". </li></ul><p>  These beaches have all the conditions for a comfortable and safe stay.  On weekends and holidays, entertainment events are held there.  True, each place has its own characteristics, advantages and disadvantages. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Recreation area "Meshcherskaya" </h2><p>  The first beach on our list is located in the west of <span>Moscow, in Solntsevo</span> , on Voskresenskaya street.  This place occupies a relatively small area on the coast.  It is very pleasant that there is a forest where you can hide from the sun.  Here you will find everything you need, there are even sports fields.  But the situation with the cafe is bad, here they are not.  You have to bring everything yourself. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Big City Pond </h2><p>  This is a completely free place, it is located in Zelenograd, on Lake Alley.  There is everything you need for swimming: changing cubicles, showers and a place to sit.  There is entertainment for children.  There are many playgrounds, and the area under the "paddling pool" is fenced off in the water.  True, here you will not see the usual sand, but everything is covered with green and soft grass, which is so nice to have a picnic on.  But this is not the most popular place that Moscow can boast of. </p><h2></h2><h2>  "Silver Forest" </h2>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>This beach</span> is located in the north-west of the capital, the entire recreation area is of the same name.  In especially hot weather, a huge number of people gather there, come here both families and large youth companies.  In fact, there are many beaches here, but they are combined into three separate zones, which carry the corresponding numbers.  Unfortunately, only 2 and 3 are available now, but they will be enough for a good rest.  There is everything that Moscow beaches can offer: children's and <span>sports grounds,</span> free Wi-Fi, ping-pong tables, a boat station, and you can always rent a sun lounger or sports equipment.  It is especially pleasant to be there after new benches and booths, new sand were brought here last year.  Admission is free to both beaches. </p><h2></h2><h2>  School lake </h2><p>  This is a no less popular holiday destination in the 10th microdistrict.  The territory is small, part is covered with sand, and part is grass.  There are cabins, a toilet, and sports grounds for playing volleyball and basketball.  Rental locations will be happy to offer you a boat or catamaran for a boat trip.  There is plenty of cafes here, so all you need to bring with you is a swimsuit, towel and good mood. </p><h2></h2><h2>  "Left-bank" </h2>

    <p>  Moscow beaches can sometimes be closed even in the middle of the swimming season, as, for example, this has happened more than once with Levoberezhniy.  But this does not stop him from opening every year again.  It is located on the sandy shore of the Khimki reservoir.  Vacationers are provided with a convenient descent into the water, a fenced area for <span>bathing children,</span> children's and sports grounds, a medical post.  Rescuers work here, as well as police officers and an ambulance on duty.  There is a cafe and tents with cold drinks.  The beach is absolutely free, so in the summer there is nowhere for an apple to fall. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Other </h2><p>  The remaining <span>beaches of Moscow</span> are notable for their small size, for example, on the <span>Black Lake</span> in Kosino.  It is free, but there is practically nothing on it, everything will have to be brought from home.  From the infrastructure there is only a playground.  Another of the available places is a recreation area in <span>Troparevsky park.</span>  Water here is not the best, so most just come to sunbathe next to the pond, and dare not swim.  But there is a chess club, a playground and a boat station.  There are places for barbecues, so you can arrange gatherings with barbecue.  There are enclosures in the park where pheasants are bred, and horses are also brought here for horseback riding.  That's what Moscow beaches can please.  The photos you can find will confirm all of the above, so take out your bathing suit to be fully armed by the summer. </p>
