And to go to the airport for long, because he has his own Agadir, called Al Massira. </p><p>  But the most important thing for tourists is its direct proximity to the sea.  The beach is at a distance of 250 meters from Blue Sea Le Tivoli 4 *. </p><p>  In addition, various attractions are concentrated nearby.  For example, the Amazigh Museum of Cultural Heritage is located within a 3-4-minute walk, and a little further - the house of active activity (club), as well as Suk al-Had (the largest shopping area in all of Morocco), saturated with local color. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, you can get anywhere from the hotel.  Indeed, 200 meters from the building there is a stop of the route 11-22-97-98.

In general, all that may come in handy. </p><p>  The hotel staff speaks five languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Arabic, English, German, and also Spanish and French.  Nobody speaks Russian here, so it is better to take a phrase book with you if there are difficulties with explanations in a foreign language. </p>

    <h2>  What else do guests say? </h2><p>  In general, this hotel will be a good option for those travelers who are planning a budget vacation, but nevertheless want it to leave an unforgettable experience.  The hotel is decent and well maintained, but for such a low price you can forgive the shortcomings, if they are located.  However, when something does not suit you, you just need to contact the reception, and the problem will be fixed.  Additionally, they will clean the apartments, change the burned out light bulb, bring fresh towels, insert new batteries into the remote control from the air conditioner.  And they will do it as quickly as possible. </p><p>  The rooms in the early days are quite quiet, the only sounds that come in the morning are the cries of gulls and the singing of birds.  Sometimes you hear the sound of the ocean. </p><p>  And yet, while staying here on vacation, it is worth going at least for one excursion.  To do this, you need to contact the reception - the hotel is in contact with a good local licensed company that provides its services at reasonable prices.  The most popular destination is an excursion to Legzira, a luxurious, beautiful beach, untouched by civilization, with soft, reddish sand and clean, cool water.  Only there you need to wear comfortable shoes - the descent is difficult. </p><p>  In general, the Blue Sea Le Tivoli hotel (Agadir, Morocco) will definitely leave a positive impression if you want to pay a little money for a decent level of comfort. </p>
