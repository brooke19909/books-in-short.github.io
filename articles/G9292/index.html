It is on Indian territory that the highest and most inaccessible peak in the world is located - Everest (Chomolungma). </p><p>  The Himalayas in India are considered a revered natural attraction: in the mountains there are many Buddhist monasteries and shrines, yoga schools and martial arts.  Rare animals live here and alpine meadows bloom. </p><h2>  Terrain and climate features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.rei.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trail to Everest" class="if uuid-3239663" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3239663.jpg"></div><p>  The relief of the Himalayas, the mountains in India, is hard not to recognize: sharp peaks covered with glaciers and a large angle on the slopes.  The area of ​​glaciers exceeds 33 thousand square meters.  km, it is not in vain that the name of the system is translated from Sanskrit as "abode of snows." </p><p>  The climate is quite diverse, in the highlands in winter there are strong winds and frosts, the temperature can drop to -40 ° C.  In the foothills, the climate is much milder, there are 4 seasons characteristic of the Himalayas of India: </p><ul><li>  from April to June mountain meadows bloom and fragrant, the air is clean and cool; </li><li>  from July to the end of August the rainy season continues, from the abundance of moisture all the slopes are covered with rugged vegetation, fogs often occur in the mornings; </li><li>  from September to November it is warm and comfortable, a good time for hiking and professional ascents; </li><li>  in winter the weather is harsh: frosts, strong winds, but often there are clear cloudless days. </li></ul><p>  When planning a trip to the north of India, in the Himalayas, you need to choose the right time so as not to be in a mountainous country under heavy monsoon rains. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sacred places </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dookinternational.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panorama of the village of Spiti in the Himalayas" class="if uuid-3239664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3239664.jpg"></div><p>  For adherents of Buddhism and Hinduism, a trip to the Himalayas is akin to traveling to another world.  In addition to the greatest holy peak, the monastery of the gods of Kailash, there are 4 sacred places for Hindus: </p><ul><li>  Kedarnath - the sacred temple of Shiva in the mountains; </li><li>  Yamunotra - the temple of the goddess of the sacred river Yamuna; </li><li>  Gangotri - the source of the Ganges River, revered as the beginning of vitality; </li><li>  Badrinath is the place of creation of the Vedic scriptures. </li></ul><p>  Buddhists are attracted by a trip to the high mountain lakes of the kingdom of Ladakh, lost in the Himalayas of India.  Ancient Buddhist monasteries, Tibetan villages, hospitable locals will long remain in memory.  Some settlements are located at an altitude of 5000 meters, only snow-capped peaks rise above the squat houses. </p><p>  Fans of yoga prefer tours to Rishikesh, called the "Gateway to the Himalayas."  From here begins the mountain road to the four shrines of Tibet.  In this area there are dozens of centers for the study and practice of yoga, it is believed that the sacred nature of this place helps to clear the mind and open the third eye. </p><p>  On the border of Tibet and India in the Himalayas, there is the Lahaul and Spiti region, where the original Tibetan culture is preserved, not changed by external interventions.  Locals call this valley, located at an altitude of 4,500 meters, "Precious place": about 30 Buddhist monasteries, considered the oldest in the world, have been preserved here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Monasteries of Indian Tibet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tibet.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hall in the residence of the Dalai Lama" class="if uuid-3239665" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3239665.jpg"></div><p>  At an altitude of 1700 meters, the town of Dharamsala is located, which in the middle of the last century became a refuge for many Tibetans: the residence of the Dalai Lama was built, schools and institutes were built.  If you're lucky, you can attend the teachings of the Dalai Lama, which lasts several hours.  The pass is ordered in 4-5 days, you can use the audio translator.  At the entrance they will ask to leave the phone and photo equipment in a special locker. </p><p>  Recreated in 2003 at a new location, Norbulinka Monastery became a museum of the former history and culture of Tibet: a functioning temple, a large park and centers for the training of traditional crafts.  The upper floors of the temple are equipped with chambers and an office of the head of Tibet, nearby there is a room in which ancient books and scrolls rescued from the destroyed monasteries are stored. </p><h2>  Unique nature parks </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourmyindia.com" data-author=": Arun Joshi, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inhabitant of the Nanda Devi Park" class="if uuid-3239666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3239666.jpg"></div><p>  At an altitude of 3,500 meters above sea level, at the foot of the mountain of the same name, there is a closed biosphere reserve Nanda-Devi.  Almost all sides of the territory are surrounded by high snow-capped mountains, and in the west the park ends with a deep gorge and a stormy mountain river flowing along its bottom. </p><p>  Under the protection of the reserve status, more than 80 species of endangered animals live here: black Himalayan bear, blue ram, Himalayan musk deer, many rare bird species. </p><p>  A strange attraction of the park is Skeleton Lake (Roopkund).  During the first research expedition in 1939, many skeletons of humans and animals were found ashore.  They put forward many versions, but they did not find the reason for this terrible phenomenon. </p><p>  To visit the reserve in the Himalayas in the north of India, you need to get permission at least one day in advance, a group of maximum 5 people and no more than four groups per week. </p><p>  The Valley of Flowers National Park in the Western Himalayas is not so closed to visitors, but large groups of tourists are not welcome there.  In addition to the interest of botanists in the unique vegetation of alpine meadows, local residents revere these places as sacred. </p><h2>  Ski resorts </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.xavierleonti.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Extreme track in the Himalayas" class="if uuid-3239668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3239668.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the abundance of snowy slopes, the ski resorts in the Himalayas of India are few and the service differs from the usual European one.  Although the amazing mountain scenery and fresh air quickly compensate for minor inconveniences: </p><ul><li>  The most prestigious and popular resort is Gulmarg: the state of the tracks is monitored by experts from the United States, and the start starts at an altitude of 3980 meters.  The ski platform is located at an altitude of 1330 meters, you can get to it from the village of the same name, reminiscent of Swiss settlements in the mountains. </li><li>  Experienced skiers are sure that the best slopes are in Auli: 10 km pass among centuries-old pine and spruce forests.  The ski station is located at an altitude of 2500 meters, the season begins in November and ends in March. </li><li>  Fans of extreme descents like to come to Solang, a resort located 22 km from Manali.  In addition to the slopes for a quiet ride, here is an excellent training ground for free ride: start from the Rohtang La pass at an altitude of 3978 meters, and then untouched snow.  The extreme route Black Ranz is popular, in the high season the HeliSky base works. </li><li>  The slopes of the oldest resort in the mountains of India, Kufri, have been known to skiers since the mid-19th century.  Guests are attracted by the secluded location of the station, tracks of different difficulty levels and the proximity of the Himalayan Nature Park. </li></ul><p>  When the snow melts, life in the resorts does not freeze, in the Himalayas of India there are many beautiful trekking routes, lost mountain lakes and fast rivers for rafting enthusiasts. </p><h2>  Tours or independent travel </h2><div class="photo" data-original="parallelsandmeridians.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Travel India" class="if uuid-3239671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3239671.jpg"></div><p>  Travel agencies offer a huge selection of different thematic tours of the Himalayas in India: for yoga, meditation, Ayurveda and sightseeing.  You can choose a group or individual tour, usually guides meet guests at the Delhi airport, and from there the road begins to the foot of the mountain ranges. </p><p>  For those who want to see the unique color of the country outside the bus window, try local dishes and chat with the inhabitants of mountain villages, it is better to travel on their own.  With this method, you can get directions through the most attractive cities and attractions, and do not always follow the chosen travel schedule. </p><h2>  In order not to spoil the rest </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bbc.com" data-author=": Jenny Matthews, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photo of indian girl" class="if uuid-3239719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3239719.jpg"></div><p>  Traveling on your own, you need to remember the simple rules that are important for the local population: </p><ul><li>  Do not take pictures of girls and women without permission.  Also, do not remove the open entrance of the temple, this is considered disrespect. </li><li>  In some temples, only residents of the country are allowed to enter, only for Hindu signs indicate this. </li><li>  Before entering the temple you need to take off your shoes; you should not have leather goods with you. </li><li>  On the streets of Indian cities in the Himalayas, tourists are often offered to try unfamiliar food or drinks.  You should not risk it, the concepts of hygiene are rather vague and street tasting can be harmful to your health. </li><li>  Do not try food or touch objects with your left hand, for Indians it is unclean. </li><li>  To smoke or drink alcohol in public places, this faces serious fines. </li></ul><p>  Attentiveness to the customs of the country and courtesy will make the trip to the villages and cities of the Himalayas bright and unforgettable. </p><h2>  Traveler Reviews </h2><p>  It is simply impossible to visit the amazing mountain region, get acquainted with the customs of benevolent Tibetans and not share with friends impressions and photos of the Himalayas of India.  Here you can feel the unity with nature, forget about the bustle of everyday life and, having left, dream of seeing the mountain peaks again. </p><p>  Many people note in reviews the beauty and diversity of nature, the majestic Himalayan peaks, the old cities of India, like legends and living myths that fill and conquer your heart forever. </p><p>  Himalayas in India - an incredible place!  This is written by everyone who has been here. </p>
