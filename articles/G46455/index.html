But this does not stop people from dreaming, investing in shared construction, and spending a lot of time getting to know construction sites.  LCD "Clear Sky" (St. Petersburg) - a striking representative of modern complexes, combining innovation, high technology and maximum comfort for each resident.  Reviews of the first customers will help to make the most detailed review of the complex. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  Surely you are wondering what is the Clear Sky LCD.  The reviews give the right to call it a comfort class residential complex, rebuilt in one of the most prestigious and well-maintained areas of the Northern capital.  The construction took place on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã98 hectares and started in 2014.  When planning to purchase an apartment here, it is important to understand that the work will stretch over the next few years, so you should definitely not expect to receive the keys soon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="trend-spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="curfew" class="if uuid-3078384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3078384.jpg"></div><p>  LCD "Clear Sky" (St. Petersburg) - a project of houses of varying numbers of floors (from 8 to 25 floors), divided by Commandant Avenue into two blocks, for which a single pedestrian zone is provided. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  Currently, a huge number of large-scale residential complexes with their own infrastructure are being built in the Northern capital, and young, little-known construction companies are often the developers, which raises a lot of questions.  What about LCD "Clear Sky"?  Customer reviews of the project are very positive, and Setl City, the leader in the construction market of the North-West region of Russia, acts as the developer.  The company has dozens of successfully implemented projects of various levels: from economy to business class housing.  Among the main advantages noticed by buyers of apartments and residents of new buildings from Setl City are attention to detail, a professional approach and the desire to satisfy the needs of each buyer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Architecture, Technology </h2><p>  The building of the housing complex "Clear Sky" is made of brick-monolithic technology.  The first floors will be reserved for commercial infrastructure, and under them will be organized car parking and storage rooms for each apartment.  It is precisely this feature that many buyers are focusing on, because they will no longer have to litter their apartments, as well as spend a lot of time looking for a free parking space. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prn.spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd clear sky reviews" class="if uuid-3078383" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3078383.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  What place was chosen for the implementation of the LCD project "Clear Sky"?  The reviews confirm that the construction has unfolded in one of the most prestigious areas to date - Primorsky.  This is a real business center of the city with numerous offices of major companies.  Yuntolovsky Park is located within walking distance from the complex, which will definitely become a favorite place for outdoor recreation at any time of the year.  Only 20 minutes by car or public transport to the Park of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, the venue for city events and festivals.  Those who managed to visit the construction site emphasize the advantages of the location: from the windows of the new building, a stunning view of the surroundings of the city opens. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  Commandant Avenue is a great option to stay, even if your family does not have a private car.  The metro station of the same name can be reached in just 10-15 minutes.  In addition, by the time construction is completed, another subway station, Shuvalovsky Prospekt, will be opened right at the new building, and additional public transport routes will be launched in its direction. </p><p>  The lively streets of Korolev and Plesetskaya pass near the complex, and in the near future it is planned to organize a congress to Parachute Street.  Currently, residents of the district do not have difficulty with movement, traffic congestion is rare for this area. </p><h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  Everything necessary for a comfortable stay will appear on the territory of the residential complex "Clear Sky".  Reviews are the main confirmation of this.  A special pride of the project will be a 1.5 km-long courtyard, isolated from cars, there will be playgrounds and sports grounds, walking and bicycle paths, relaxation areas with shady arbors, swings and benches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="novostroy.spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD clear sky St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-3078387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3078387.jpg"></div><p>  The developer paid special attention to landscaping: rare species of plants and shrubs will be planted here, and qualified landscape designers will be involved in the work.  As planned, a stunning green view should open from the window of each apartment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Security </h2><p>  Calmness for every resident of the new building will be ensured by a 24-hour video surveillance system with full coverage of playgrounds, playgrounds, parking and entrance groups: not a single square meter of area will go unnoticed.  Moreover, a unified security point and a checkpoint at the entrance are planned. </p><p>  Parents will appreciate the presence of closed courtyards, that is, completely isolated from through traffic.  You no longer have to worry, waste your nerves, letting the child go to the playground near the house: there he will definitely be safe.  All game and sports areas are equipped taking into account the physiological characteristics of children, and also comply with all safety requirements. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The complex is being built in an area with developed infrastructure, where there are enough social facilities, as well as shopping and entertainment.  Nevertheless, the developer made every effort to ensure the comfort of every resident of such a large scale upon completion of the project.  Interest holders of the Clear Sky residential complex confirm that a kindergarten for 200 children has already been opened on the territory.  Currently, the construction of a second kindergarten for 190 children with a huge playroom and even a swimming pool, as well as a school for 1100 children, has already been launched.  In total, by the time the complex is commissioned, 8 kindergartens and 4 secondary schools will be built - and all this in one closed territory.  Just imagine: your children don‚Äôt have to get up early, get to school by public transport: everything is right at your side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kolizey78.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd clear sky cases" class="if uuid-3078396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3078396.jpg"></div><p>  On the first floors of the buildings there are network grocery stores, pharmacies, laundries and dry cleaners, beauty salons and bank branches - all that is necessary to ensure the life of a modern resident of a metropolis.  In comfortable yards, all conditions are created for games and sports for both children and adults. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  A variety of planning decisions is the pride of the project.  All apartments in the Clear Sky residential complex are thought out literally to the smallest detail and designed in the European style so popular today, which has a large kitchen-living room, isolated rooms and a wardrobe or pantry for household utensils.  A choice of tenants is offered small cozy studios, comfortable one and two bedroom apartments, as well as spacious three bedroom apartments, where each member of your family will be comfortable.  Interest holders of the Clear Sky residential complex emphasize that they managed to use every square meter of the area, arrange all the furniture, preserving the spaciousness and lightness. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spb.vkomplekse.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD clear sky layout" class="if uuid-3078393" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3078393.jpg"></div><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  Well-thought-out layouts of the Clear Sky residential complex are far from the only advantage of the project.  All apartments are finished and finished, respectively, completely ready to move in: metal entrance doors with high-quality German furniture, non-woven wallpaper for painting on the walls, water-based paint on the ceiling, 32 class laminate flooring, modern veneered interior doors with fittings, German double-glazed windows, imported plumbing in the bathroom and toilet, as well as radiators with a temperature regulator in each room. </p><p>  Apartment owners who monitor all stages of work, regularly visit the construction site, note that all the finishing work is done with high quality, using advanced technologies and modern materials, which is fully consistent with the presentation from the builder. </p><h2>  Terms of purchase </h2><p>  If you have been dreaming of your own apartment for a long time, the Clear Sky residential complex will be an excellent option, because you will be able to purchase a set of obvious advantages at an attractive price and on favorable terms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="novostroika78.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd clear sky" class="if uuid-3078394" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3078394.jpg"></div><p>  So affordable for average families is LCD Clear Sky?  Apartment prices start at 2.5 million rubles per studio and from 7.5 million rubles for a spacious three-room apartment for a large and friendly family.  Do not forget that we are talking about new buildings in a prestigious area, as well as fully finished apartments.  Moreover, at the moment, the developer gives installments of payment for the period of construction of the entire complex, you have enough time to pay off the entire cost of the apartment without overpaying to banks.  Well, of course, you can always buy square meters for a mortgage, cooperation with leading banks of the country and city allows the developer to offer the most favorable credit conditions. </p><h2>  Opinion of interest holders </h2><p>  Among the main advantages of the project, noted by buyers, I would like to highlight the reliability and excellent reputation of the developer, as well as the opportunity to purchase an apartment with high-quality finish.  Just imagine: you do not have to get involved in a lengthy and expensive repair: immediately after receiving the keys and paperwork, you can drop into your cozy family nest.  The developer‚Äôs reputation is so impeccable that many residents of the Northern capital really dream of living in a new building from him. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.anrosdom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd clear sky prices" class="if uuid-3078389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3078389.jpg"></div><p>  The buildings are really being built in a prestigious area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.  The address of the residential complex "Clear Sky": 1. Komendantsky Prospekt. Interest holders admire the rapid pace of construction, and this without loss of quality of work.  If we compare residential buildings and quarters of residential areas, they are clearly losing out on this indicator.  The scale of the project, the presence of a huge pedestrian zone, which will become a favorite place for walking, recreation for all residents of new buildings, are impressive.  Many people call the project "city in the city": every detail and trifle in it are so thought out, everything necessary in the literal sense of the word is "at hand". </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="60.03783439999999" data-lng="30.225613599999974" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/3/3/2/14332.png"></div><p>  For the objectivity of the review, mention should also be made of those shortcomings that were nevertheless possible to identify.  First of all, it is a dubious ecology, because the complex is located near the landfill and the industrial zone.  The builder tried to compensate for this shortcoming due to large-scale landscaping of the house adjoining and adjacent to the buildings.  Some complain of a sharp disgusting smell from the window, again due to the proximity to the city dump.  The developer also promises to minimize and completely eliminate this drawback in the shortest possible time. </p><p>  Today, getting to the metro station is not as convenient as it is presented by the developer, and the new station will not open in 2020, but in 2035.  One can only hope for additional bus routes that should at least temporarily solve the problem of crowding at stops at the so-called rush hour. </p><p>  The project definitely deserves special attention, detailed consideration and personal acquaintance.  That is why those who are in search of a suitable option for future housing are recommended to visit the construction site and office of the company that leads it in order to form their own opinion. </p>
