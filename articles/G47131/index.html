    <h2>  Disbursement of funds </h2><p>  Cash receipt by an accountable employee is carried out at the cash desk of the enterprise.  The basis for this is an expense order.  It should indicate the purpose of the funds. </p><p>  The head of the enterprise issues an order stating the list of employees entitled to receive funds for household needs.  In the same local act, time limits are established for which amounts can be issued. </p><h2>  Filing an expense report </h2><p>  This document is submitted to the accounting department within three days from the end of the period for which funds were issued.  The form is handed over with the documents confirming the spending of money.  In this case, the employee calculates the cost and balance of funds. </p><h2>  Sample expense report: front </h2><p>  The document is provided in one copy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you take any sample expense report, you can see that it is filled on both sides.

    <h2>  Back side </h2><p>  The reverse part of the sample expense report is intended to indicate a list of documents confirming the costs.  They may include: </p><ul><li>  Travel certificate. </li><li>  Checks KKM. </li><li>  Receipts. </li><li>  Commodity, transport consignment notes. </li><li>  Invoices, etc. </li></ul><p>  The accountable employee also indicates the amount of expenses for the documents.  The numbering of securities attached to the report is carried out in the order they are indicated on the form. </p><h2>  Nuance </h2><p>  On the front side there is line 1a, and on the reverse side - 6 and 8. In the expense report, these fields are filled in if the funds were issued to the accountable person in foreign currency.  For example, an employee was sent on a business trip abroad. </p><h2>  Recommendations for an accountant </h2><p>  The specialist first fills the front side of the form.  First of all, in the table ‚ÄúAccounting record‚Äù it is necessary to enter information on the numbers of offsetting accounts and amounts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The back of the form reflects the expenses accepted for accounting.  In the expense report, this information is entered in columns 7 and 8. In addition, the accounts (sub-accounts) are indicated for the debit of which the costs are posted (column 9). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="expense report sample" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2186447.jpg"></div>

    <p>  After that, supporting documents are drawn up, the correctness of the design of the form and targeted spending of funds is checked.  Having completed all the procedures, the accountant puts a mark on the report.  He indicates that the document has been verified and the amount of expenses has been approved (it is written in numbers and in words). </p><p>  On the front side, a receipt is also filled out, which is transmitted to the accountable employee. </p><p>  On the form should be the signature of the person checking the document and Ch.  accountants with transcripts. </p><p>  If necessary, the report form contains information on the amounts of the balance or overspending, details of the documents (orders) for which the final settlement will be carried out. </p><h2>  Approval by manager and write-offs </h2><p>  The verified report is submitted to the director of the organization.  He must sign it.  To do this, in the upper part on the front side of the document there is a corresponding column.  Signing the form can be done not only by the manager, but also by another authorized employee.  After approval, the report is accepted for debit. </p><p>  The rest of the advance is due at the cash desk of the enterprise. </p><h2>  Bans </h2><p>  If the accountable person is in arrears on previously made advances, the issuance of funds is not allowed.  In addition, it is forbidden to transfer money received by employees to third parties. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="expense report sample fill" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2186448.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Storage time </h2><p>  They are established by law.  Different documents have their own storage periods.  As a rule, enterprises choose the maximum period. </p><p>  Based on sub.  8 1 of paragraph 23 of the article of the Tax Code, tax and accounting papers and other certificates must be stored for at least 4 years.  Clause 4 283 of the Code provides a 10-year period for documents confirming losses.  It is worth saying that information about expenses is used by organizations to reduce the taxable base. </p><p>  In Federal Law No. 402 it is established that the initial documentation must be stored for at least 5 years from the date of completion of the reporting period. </p><h2>  Work in "1C" </h2><p>  <span>An advance report is usually issued</span> on a computer.
