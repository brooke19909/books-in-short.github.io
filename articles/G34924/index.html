How can I start?  Is there any principle or "formula for success"?  In this article we will try to help you deal with these issues and advise the most common schemes.  We hope this article will guide you into the world of chess and help you learn the truth of this game. </p><h2>  Chess game structure </h2><p>  Chess is an intellectual game.  It has a beginning, middle and ending.  Let's look at each element of a chess game: </p><ul><li>  The end of the game is called the endgame.  This is an “optional stage” of each game, but most often it is there that the advantage gained during the whole game is finally realized: more harmonious development, advantage of two bishops, extra pawn or quality, etc. </li><li>  The middle of the party is the middlegame.  The amount of fear received at the very first glance at a word is directly proportional to the complexity of the game in a given period of the game.  In the middlegame, the choice begins: attack the enemy king or play positionally.  Of course, the answer to the dilemma comes from assessing the position, its capabilities. </li><li>  What is the beginning of a chess game called?  The answer is simple - debut.  It is precisely in it that the possibility of a “middle-choice choice” is decided, because there is always the possibility that your opponent, and not you, will set the pace of the party’s actions. </li></ul><h2>  About debut </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=": MargaritaLuchn"><img itemprop="image" alt="Starting position" class="if uuid-3096864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123386/3096864.jpg"></div><p>  The beginning of a chess game can be played in different ways.  It depends on various factors, which we will now talk about.  In the future, this information will be useful for finding a new repertoire for you.  So, let's look at the types of debut: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  The name “start” depends on White’s first move.  For example: beginning 1.4, beginning 1.g3, etc. </li><li>  The name “debut” comes from White’s second move: “Retty's debut” - 1.kf3-d5 2.g3, “Nimtsovich’s debut” - 1.kf3-d5 2.b3, etc. </li><li>  The name "party" - from the third move of whites: "Scottish party", "Russian party". </li><li>  The name "defense" should not be associated with dependence on the move number, but depends on the ideological concept of blacks: "Sicilian", "Dutch", "French defense", etc. </li><li>  The name "gambit" unites all opening constructions in which a pawn or piece is positionally sacrificed on the first moves without immediate acting out: "Evans' gambit", "royal gambit", etc. </li></ul><h2>  Debut Principles </h2><p>  The time has come for a "formula for success."  In fact, there is no “omnipotent” debut, thanks to which you can win, say, in 4 moves (if your opponent is not so weak as to miss the “Baby Mat”). </p><p>  There are certain rules of an optimal development plan at the beginning of a chess game, suitable for all opening schemes, and which every self-respecting chess player must observe: </p><ol><li>  Grab the center.  The rule refers to "take control of the center of the board."  This can happen both actually (to put a pawn in the center), and indirectly (“follow this field”, bring out a piece or pawns so that they attack these fields). </li><li>  Bring out light shapes.  This is logical: the more soldiers in the attack, the stronger the attack of the army, its mobility. </li><li>  Do not walk one piece twice at the start of the game.  Chess is also called a “tragedy of pace", it is impractical to spend time on pointless pieces exiting and reread rule 2. </li><li>  Make a castling.  As you know, the main goal in a chess game is to checkmate the king.  By castling, the king becomes, in a way, protected, it is not so easy to get to him. </li><li>  To withdraw the queen, i.e.  connect the rooks.  Roughly speaking, at this stage the stage of the beginning of a chess game ends.  The last heavy figures enter the battle, and the real battle begins. </li></ol><h2>  The best beginnings of chess games.  For white </h2><p>  Firstly, in this case it is a synonym for the debut, not its appearance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Secondly, I would like to remind you that there is no "omnipotent" beginning of chess games.  And if you study some kind of system of options, this does not mean that you will automatically become a winner.  As we have already seen, a chess game is not a debut, it has other parts (middlegame and endgame).  You must harmoniously develop your skills in all areas of chess.  Only then can you make strong progress. </p><p>  How to start a chess game? </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=": MargaritaLuchn"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italian party" class="if uuid-3099910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123386/3099910.jpg"></div><p>  For a beginner, it is most often advised to play 1.4 and with a subsequent choice of 1 ...- e5 between the "Italian" (photo 1) or the "Spanish" (photo 2) games. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=": MargaritaLuchn"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spanish party" class="if uuid-3099914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123386/3099914.jpg"></div><p>  More advanced players should study chess principles depending on their nature of the game.  For example, active players can try to play gambit systems, positional choice on 1.d4 or 1.c4. </p><h2>  The best beginnings of chess games.  For black </h2><p>  For blacks, in turn, they advise starting with 1 ....- e5 versus 1.e4.  And the further continuation depends on the choice of White’s debut. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=": MargaritaLuchn"><img itemprop="image" alt="The main continuation" class="if uuid-3099922" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123386/3099922.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, professional players need to expand their debut database.  And this also needs to be done deliberately.  Choose opening constructions according to your style.  An example is a comparison of the “Sicilian defense” (1 ....- p5), suitable for attacking players, and the defense of “Karo-Kann” (1 ....-p4), with the opposite nature of the positions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=": MargaritaLuchn"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sicilian Defense" class="if uuid-3099929" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123386/3099929.jpg"></div><p>  And the difference of the first move is just one cell! </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=": MargaritaLuchn"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caro Cannes Defense" class="if uuid-3099930" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123386/3099930.jpg"></div><p>  To summarize.  We talked about the structure of the chess game, informed about the types of opening, explained the principles of the beginning of the game, and identified the most common constructions and opening systems.  We directed you along this path, pushed you to the desire to study chess.  Therefore, we wish you success, patience and good luck in your chess career! </p>
