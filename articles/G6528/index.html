Despite the fact that many customers use only online products, even cardholders have a need to visit the branch, for example, to replace the card at the end of the term.  To do this, customers should know what days Sberbank works. </p><h2>  Features of the operating mode of the largest bank in the country </h2><p>  Sberbank PJSC, like all banking institutions, is interested in visiting customers with offices.  But not everyone knows what the office hours are and how the system works. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.baeren-messebau.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which Sberbanks work on holidays" class="if uuid-2932361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2932361.jpg"></div><p>  Sberbank's schedule does not differ in regime from most other banks.  More than 92% of branches begin their work at 09:00.  At the same time, the working day can end in different ways: </p><ul><li>  Large branches, with the number of managers from 5 people or more, work until 19:00 and later.  In the capital, offices are open until 22:00 inclusive. </li><li>  Medium format offices (3-4 sales managers) are open until 18:30. </li><li>  Small branches (1-2 specialists) work until 18:00, and some even until 17:00. </li></ul><h2>  What determines the operating mode of Sberbank? </h2><p>  It is impossible to guess exactly what mode a particular bank office will operate in.  The schedule of branches is based on the number of customers, geographic location and the presence of other banks in the neighborhood. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, the days of work of Sberbank in the central square of the city will be close to the schedule drawn up for citizens by the State Duma.  It will include official holidays taking into account all transfers and shortened working days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what days does sberbank work" class="if uuid-2932369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2932369.jpg"></div><p>  Offices on the outskirts of the city operate mostly only from Monday to Friday.  The number of visitors per day in such branches does not exceed 100 people, so they provide their services only in the 5/2 format (5 working days and 2 days off). </p><p>  If at a distance of less than 1 km from the branch of the bank there is another branch of Sberbank, the operating modes at these offices are different.  In order not to make a mistake with the visit, it is recommended to clarify in advance on what days Sberbank works in each case. </p><h2>  Office hours: weekends </h2><p>  Most banks, despite their commercial activities, also have days off.  Sberbank is no exception. </p><p>  Depending on the significance, each branch operates according to the established schedule, which includes weekends and holidays.  As a rule, there are no ‚Äúfloating‚Äù schedules in Sberbank, that is, each branch works on the same days of the week. </p><p>  Over 89% work from Monday to Saturday.  From Monday to Friday, Sberbank provides customers with full-time services, and Saturday is considered a shorter day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.szekesfehervar.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what savings banks work on weekends" class="if uuid-2932362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2932362.jpg"></div><p>  If the client needs to visit the branch on Sunday, you need to know in advance which Sberbanks work on weekends.  These are large offices located in the city center.  Most often they are called "head offices".  The branch, operating on Sunday, provides services also on a reduced working day. </p><h2>  Moscow branches working 7 days a week </h2><p>  There are more than 515 branches of Sberbank in Moscow.  Most of them work on Saturday, but there are offices seven days a week.  Here is some of them: </p><ul><li>  9038/01691.  The department works at: pl.  Sokolnicheskaya, 9, 1. On Sunday, the office provides services from 09:00 to 17:00. </li><li>  9038/01799.  Over the weekend, the branch receives customers from 10:00 to 22:00.  Located at: sh.  Enthusiasts, 12, 2. </li><li>  9038/01098.  Office on the street  Yartsevskaya, 25A invites customers to come on a weekend from 10:00 to 21:00. </li></ul><p>  On what days Sberbank works in Moscow, customers can find out in more detail on the company's website, in the "Branches and ATMs" section. </p><h2>  Bank work during the holidays: features </h2><p>  Sberbank adheres to the regime of the majority of enterprises in Russia, however, it can provide services to customers on holidays.  The schedule of offices that work on holidays is set at least 10 days before the due date.  This enables customers to set up their schedule and visit their branch even on a day off. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Which Sberbank offices operate during the holidays, establishes the leadership of the regional branch.  As a rule, these are large branches and offices in the city center. </p><p>  Information about office hours is placed on the front door of the office.  It indicates: </p><ol><li>  Branch number and its working hours during the holidays. </li><li>  What other Sberbanks work on holidays, with addresses and branch numbers. </li></ol><p>  A distinctive feature of the work of offices is that on weekdays, that on holidays is a full range of services.  Even on holidays, customers can apply for a mortgage or transfer funds abroad, exchange a card or cash at the bank's cash desk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="awards.brandingforum.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which offices work during the holidays" class="if uuid-2932363" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2932363.jpg"></div><p>  On holidays, only the branch schedule changes: it works on Saturday or Sunday.

The schedule is indicated depending on the region in which the branch is located. </p><h2>  Are there any breaks at the box office of Sberbank? </h2><p>  Having learned what days Sberbank works, the client should also clarify whether there is a break at the office or specialist.  More than 90% of branches have switched to uninterrupted operation since 2015.  But there are also small offices, for example, with one universal employee, who work with breaks on schedule. </p><p>  The break is set in the calculation from 30 minutes to 1 hour, with a full or partial stop of the provision of services.  In the case of a break for the entire department, for example from 13:00 to 14:00, employees are required to notify customers of the suspension of service at least 10 minutes before the break. </p><p>  Customers must leave the department during a <span>technical break</span> .  Office work will resume exactly after the specified time in the schedule.  It will be impossible to resume service at the previously set time: in offices with an electronic line-up, customers will not be able to take a service ticket. </p><p>  Branches without an electronic queue will also not be able to work during the break due to the inclusion of bank programs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="working days of Sberbank" class="if uuid-2932366" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2932366.jpg"></div><p>  Most offices work without interruption.  Temporary suspension of service may occur in the event of a banking need, for example, when receiving valuables from the collection service at the cash desk or when changing employees. </p><h2>  How to find out about office work?  All ways </h2><p>  To be aware of what days Sberbank works, customers can use: </p><ul><li>  Schedule at the branch door.

Such branches work together with one of the additional offices for individuals.  They are located at the same address with them, but office numbers may vary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="awards.brandingforum.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="on what days does the sberbank of Russia work" class="if uuid-2932364" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2932364.jpg"></div><p>  For example, in Moscow on sh.

Since almost all branches work on Saturday, customers manage to get quality service even when working with a 5-day schedule. </p><p>  Those who are busy even on Saturday can go to weekend wards.  In every city with a population of over 150 thousand people there are such offices. </p><p>  Sberbank customers do not like office breaks.
