It is already impossible to imagine communication without a phone, the appointment of important business meetings and just romantic conversations.  Anyone who has already been using their phone for more than a year is clearly tied to it, because everything is already so clear, so simple, and the memory, which is tied to some kind of scratches on the case, to messages or special functions.  But it happens that your favorite phone is affected by external factors and may break.  There are many such problems: from the breakdown of the display to the breakdown of the main microcircuits. </p><p>  Sound problems </p><p>  In addition to cracks in the case or other external damage, the speaker performance is often degraded.  This can happen if a person does not part with the speakerphone and loud music, well, or from a fall.  The speakers are replaced within a period of 1 to 2 days. </p><p>  Screen issues </p><p>  The most terrible problems with the screen will seem to owners of touch-screen screens.  Damage occurs from a fall factor.  This often happens with athletes when the phone falls out of pocket from a disadvantage.  The protective glass itself may crack, or the internal screen may.  In the second case, the problems are much more serious, but <noindex>  <span>Repair service RemFon</span> </noindex>  always has all the necessary accessories for repairing any kind of display.  This is not such a problem, but delayed repairs can cause more serious problems, so you need to contact a repair service right away. </p><p>  In addition to repairing mobile phones, it is often still necessary to repair their components or just accessories.  Accessories Repair: </p><p>  They often complain about the charger: it either leaves during charging, then it cannot fully charge the phone.  But what if the charging is unique?  Need to carry to the service center.  Usually, such work lasts no more than an hour, if there are no more clients, so at this time you can go and have tea and come to pick up your device. </p><p>  Headphones.  What about this topic, it can be said that half of the passengers on public transport spend their entire trip with headphones.  No wonder, because it is this miracle device that helps to disconnect from this world and get into the magnificent world of music affecting the heart.  If you buy simple vacuum headphones for 50-100 rubles, then you can buy new ones in the event of a breakdown, but if you are sorry to part with them (branding, affection, obligation), you can repair them.  It‚Äôs one thing, if the headphones are connected through a wire, and the wire itself is torn, then this is one thing, but if the headphones work on Bluetooth wireless technology, then you need to contact a specialist.  Columns also fall into such categories. </p><p>  Also, there are special, unusual devices, such as a radio-controlled car for Sony Ericsson.  Such devices are very fragile and not everyone can fix such a thing.  Here, the help of a specialist is needed, because a person who sees such a machine for the first time may break it. </p></div></article>
