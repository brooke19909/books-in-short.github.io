And not all parents can buy every week technological innovations.  And even to the most modern radio-controlled models, children's interest is rapidly weakening.  Therefore, do-it-yourself toys will be a great option.  This will instill in the child a love of work and develop fine motor skills.  And if you make not only decorative products, but also toys that carry some kind of interactivity, then interest in such a creation will not weaken for a month.  In this article you will learn how to make a boomerang origami with your own hands, well, or with the hands of a child. </p><h2>  Simple model </h2><p>  How to make an origami boomerang?  The easiest way is to fold it from A4 paper. </p><ul><li>  To do this, make the sheet square. </li><li>  Take one corner and pull it to the opposite side. </li><li>  The sheet remaining at the bottom is carefully cut off or torn off using a ruler. </li><li>  Now you can proceed directly to the simulation.  To facilitate the work, it is necessary to fold the square in half lengthwise and crosswise, and then deploy the resulting structure. </li><li>  These were preparatory steps to make the paper more plastic. </li><li>  The next step is to separate the extra half.  It can be cut off or gently torn off. </li><li>  The corners of the rest of the sheet are pulled to the center.  And again we are doing preparatory folds. </li><li>  The upper corner of the triangle must be lowered and raised back.  Now we bend the right part of the structure through the formed center to the left side. </li><li>  We perform the same maneuver on the left side. </li><li>  The angle formed on the right side is bent inward and straightened. </li><li>  The boomerang origami is almost ready, it remains to complete the final actions. </li><li>  We put the finished design "horns" to ourselves.  We lower the lower corners of the center to each other, and bend the upper part. </li></ul><p>  The boomerang is ready, a detailed visual cheat sheet will be given below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="origami boomerang" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/1983565.jpg" width="392"></div>

It is better to immediately make a boomerang of beautiful paper.  For this purpose, you can use a wrapper from gifts.  And you can also stick light sequins that will shine merrily in the sun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself origami" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/1983369.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Complex model </h2><p>  It‚Äôs easy to make a beautiful origami boomerang with your own hands.  But it takes a little patience. </p><ul><li>  To get started, prepare an even number of sheets.  It is desirable that there should be at least eight.  Further, according to the scheme described above, we make a square from each paper rectangle. </li><li>  Now we add all the corners of one of the squares to the center.  We rotate the paper model with an angle to ourselves and pull the two upper corners to the center.  As a result, we should get two triangles: one big at the top, another small at the bottom. </li><li>  Turn the small triangle back.  If everything was done correctly, one big triangle should lie in front of you.  We turn it in half.  One part of the model is ready. </li><li>  We repeat this operation seven more times or as many as the leaves were prepared. </li><li>  The last step is bonding.  Rectangular triangles stick together at the lower indirect angle between them.  As a result, you should get a model, as in the picture below.  With the caveat that here for the decor another row of triangles was added.  Particularly painstaking paper enthusiasts can repeat this decorative element.  But keep in mind that origami boomerang flies better if it weighs less. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make origami a boomerang" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19607/1986515.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Cardboard boomerang </h2><p>  Even a child can assemble a boomerang-origami from thick paper.  The scheme is very simple. </p><ul><li>  You need to cut three rectangles.  For beauty and better flight, all sharp ends need to be rounded, but you can not do this. </li><li>  At the end of each part, you need to draw a small square, which on one side rests in the center, and the other - in the free edge.  Carefully cut the geometric hole. </li><li>  The next step is to insert the parts into the formed grooves.  In order to keep the product better, you can fasten it with clerical gum or glue. </li></ul><p>  Origami boomerang is ready.  To make the cardboard design look prettier, it can be painted with pencils or felt-tip pens.  Paint does not need to be used, as the top paper layer may be deformed. </p><h2>  Boomerang on a stick </h2><p>  Origami paper boomerang is a standard spinner.  These are sold in a children's park on City Day or on public holidays.  It is very easy to make such an origami design with your own hands.  You can use any scheme above and collect the boomerang itself.  In its center you need to insert a wand.  Wooden skewers that can be bought at any grocery store are perfect for this purpose.  We attach the stick to the paper base with glue.  The boomerang is ready. </p><p>  It‚Äôs easier to launch it, you unwind the wand in your hands and launch the paper structure in free flight.  To make the product look festive, a rope with beads or light beads can be glued to the corners of a boomerang. </p>
