But history has preserved evidence of the empress‚Äôs frivolous and sensual enjoyment lifestyle.  Next, consider the biographies of several favorites of the Russian sovereign. </p><h2>  Short biography of Elizabeth Petrovna </h2><p>  <span>Elizabeth I</span> (1709-1761) became empress due to the palace coup of 1741.  Dissatisfied with the reign of Anna Ioannovna pinned their hopes on the daughter of Peter I, but did not consider her decisive enough to become the head of the plot preparing.  Taking advantage of the fall in the authority of power, the 31-year-old Elizabeth proclaimed herself the new autocrat and was crowned in 1742. </p><p>  She ordered the arrest of minor Ivan VI, all relatives and supporters of Anna Ivanovna.  The favorites of the former sovereign were first sentenced to death, and then exiled to Siberia.  This was done in order to show the tolerance of the new autocrat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alexey favorite elizabeth" class="if uuid-2518163" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2518163.jpg"></div><p>  The empress in many ways continued the program of her father.  Domestic policy was distinguished by stability and focus on the growth of the authority of state power, strengthening the autocracy. </p><p>  In cultural life during this period, there was a transition of Russia to the Enlightenment.  The time of Elizabeth Petrovna was marked by the increasing role of women in society.  Ladies are now not only increasingly involved in the affairs of estate management, but also in their brutality sometimes surpassed men. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For the rule of the absolute monarchs of the seventeenth century, and especially the successors of Peter I, was characterized by favoritism.  Persons who enjoyed the favor of the empress spent the state treasury, and in the last years of the reign of Elizabeth Petrovna actually ruled the state. </p><h2>  Empress personal life and character </h2><p>  Already at a young age, the princess was distinguished by the freedom of morals.  There was a rumor that she was secretly married to Alexei Razumovsky, but no evidence has been preserved on this score.  It was rumored that the autocrat had a son from Razumovsky and a daughter from Shuvalov. </p><p>  All this became the reason for the appearance of a large number of impostors who call themselves the children of Elizabeth Petrovna.  The most famous is the so-called Princess Tarakanova, who in 1774 declared her right to the throne and even found support from a small number of supporters. </p><p>  The beginning of the reign of Elizabeth was a time of excesses and luxurious life.  Balls and so-called ‚Äúmetamorphoses‚Äù were constantly held in the palace, when the ladies dressed in men's suits and men in ladies' suits.  The Empress herself was a trendsetter.  After the death of Elizabeth in her wardrobe counted about fifteen thousand dresses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Razumovsky favorite Elizabeth Petrovna" class="if uuid-2518160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2518160.jpg"></div><p>  Elizaveta Petrovna was distinguished by excessive emotionality and inconstancy of character.  Sudden flashes of anger swept through her.  Memoirists confirm that she could beat a person at the ball for any inaccuracies in his suit or behavior. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Interesting fact: despite the reputation of a frivolous person, the autocrat was very pious.  Directly from the ball, she went to the matins, regularly made pilgrimages to the nearby monasteries, especially in the Trinity-Sergiev.  In the processions along the Trinity Road, Elizaveta Petrovna was accompanied by the whole courtyard and favorites. </p><h2>  Favorites of Elizabeth I Petrovna </h2><p>  The list of favorites includes both men (mainly) and women who enjoyed her favor and occupied a special place at court.  Some appeared in the intimate life of the princesses and the empress, were her lovers, while others were just friends who received favors from the empress who was favorable to them.  They often spent public funds on their own needs. </p><p>  Favoritism and the constant change of lovers during the reign of Elizabeth Petrovna became part of politics.  The same thing was observed under her successor Catherine the Great.  Apart from short ties, only A. Razumovsky and I. Shuvalov played an important role in the political life of the state.  Recall some of the most famous favorites of Empress Elizabeth. </p><h2>  The first obvious favorite of the Crown Prince: Alexander Buturlin </h2><p>  In 1720, Alexander Buturlin, the 26-year-old son of the captain, future earl, field marshal and Moscow city governor, was granted Peter Batman as orderlies.  The young man enjoyed the confidence of the emperor, carried out his secret assignments.  Under Elizaveta Petrovna, he not only rose to the chamberlain, but also became the first favorite of the Tsar‚Äôs daughter. </p><p>  Buturlin was known as Elizabeth‚Äôs lover, but perhaps this is only a rumor.  An obstacle to communication with the princess could have been not the first wife of the military commander Anna Golitsyna, who had already passed away by that time, but a quarrel with I. Dolgorukov.  Alexander Buturlin was sent to Ukraine.  Subsequently, he was appointed commander in chief of Little Russia, and on the day of the accession to the throne, Elizabeth was promoted to general-anshefa. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.vologda.kp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander Butrulin" class="if uuid-2518128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2518128.jpg"></div><p>  The rapid development of the career of favorite Elizabeth 1 continued.  Soon he received the count's dignity and was granted the rank of Field Marshal. </p><p>  Alexander Buturlin also managed to establish personal life.  He married the daughter of associate of Peter I Boris Kurakin - Catherine.  Three children were born in this marriage: Peter (married Maria Vorontsova, became secret adviser and chamberlain), Varvara (married to Vladimir Dolgorukov) and Ekaterina (was married to Yuri Dolgorukov). </p><h2>  Rumors about a secret marriage with Semyon Naryshkin </h2><p>  The Naryshkin family was associated with the ruling dynasty, but the degree of kinship is deliberately exaggerated in historical literature.  Favorite Elizabeth Petrovna was the fourth cousin of Peter I, although he is often called the second cousin or cousin of the Empress herself. </p><p>  As for Semyon Naryshkin and Elizabeth I, there were many rumors, especially among foreigners.  It was rumored that a secret marriage had been concluded between them.  But the reigning Peter II intervened and sent the favorite Elizabeth, who was the aunt of the emperor, outside the country. </p><p>  Under the reign of Anna Ivanovna, Semyon settled in Paris, and after ascending the throne, Elizabeth became a chamberlain and went as an envoy to Great Britain.  Soon, however, the empress returned him to the capital, where Narshykin became known in high society for his love of horn music and luxury. </p><p>  In 1746, he married Maria Balk-Field.  A very beautiful girl was jealous of Elizabeth.  The following case is known, for example.  Once the empress called Naryshkina to her and, with all those present, she cut off with a pair of scissors the lovely jewelry that the wife of the favorite put on that day. </p><h2>  The most modest favorite of the empress: Ivan Shuvalov </h2><p>  The son of the captain of the guard, Ivan Shuvalov, ended up in the palace thanks to the patronage of two cousins ‚Äã‚Äã- Alexander and Peter Shuvalov, active participants in the palace coup, as a result of which Elizaveta Petrovna became empress. </p><p>  Over time, the 40-year-old sovereign drew attention to the 22-year-old Ivan.  The young man was promoted to junk chamber, he became a favorite of Elizabeth, who remained until her last days.  The empress was attracted not only by the youth and beauty of Shuvalov.  He received a good education, by the age of 14 he knew four languages. </p><p>  In the last years of the reign of Elizabeth, the favorite Shuvalov was the only speaker, composed texts of orders and announced decisions of the autocrat to dignitaries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivan Shuvalov" class="if uuid-2518142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2518142.jpg"></div><p>  A distinctive feature of Shuvalov was amazing modesty.  Elizaveta Petrovna prepared a decree granting him the title of count, the rank of state senator and the salary of ten thousand serfs, but Ivan Shuvalov categorically refused.  He agreed to accept only the rank of adjutant general. </p><p>  Under Catherine II, the former favorite of Elizabeth was expelled abroad, although she was formally on sick leave.  When he became close to Marie Antoinette, the new Russian empress began to attract Shuvalov to carry out diplomatic missions.  Fruitful activity led to the fact that he was granted the rank of Privy Councilor even before returning to Russia. </p><p>  Shuvalov is known as the organizer of the first literary salon in Russia, where G. Derzhavin, Ekaterina Dashkova, D. Fonvizin, the creator of the Dictionary of the Russian Academy, the first explanatory dictionary, the founder of Moscow University and the Academy of Arts, regularly visited. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rosimperija.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Favorites of Elizabeth I Petrovna" class="if uuid-2518149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2518149.jpg"></div><h2>  Beloved Elizabeth I: Alexey Shubin </h2><p>  Favorite Elizabeth Alexei Shubin was the ensign of the Semenovsky regiment.  It is known that she loved him very much.  The verses of Elizabeth I written to her lover have been preserved.  The French ambassador even claimed that they had a daughter who was brought up at court, but under the guise of a distant relative. </p><p>  The connection between Elizabeth and Alexei Shubin ended with Anna Ioannovna ordering the arrest of the favorite.  Formally, he was accused of conspiracy, but in fact there was nothing of the sort.  Favorite Elizabeth Petrovna was exiled to Kamchatka and forcibly married to a local resident. </p><p>  After ascending the throne, Elizabeth ordered to find Alexei Shubin.  He was granted the rank of major general of the regiment and endowed with rich possessions in the Vladimir province.  The following year, Shubin quit and settled on his estate.  He was dissatisfied with the preferences shown by the empress to another lover. </p><h2>  Chamber-Junker of the Groom Elizabeth: Pimen Lyalin </h2><p>  Pimen Lyalin belonged to an old, but impoverished noble family.  Elizabeth drew attention to the young man only after a forced separation from Alexei Shubin.  They say that a special role in the origin of their relationship was played by a sailor suit in which Pimen rolled the crown prince along the river.  The favorite of Empress Elizabeth Petrovna was known for harsh statements that got away with him. </p><h2>  The most famous favorite.  Alexey Razumovsky </h2><p>  Favorite Elizabeth Petrovna became the one for whom she traded Shubin after his arrest.  Alexei Razumovsky was in the Russian capital by accident.  The nobleman Anna Ioannovna was sent to Hungary in 1731 to purchase wine.  On the way back, he stopped in a village in the Chernigov province.  In the local temple, the nobleman heard a voice of wonderful beauty.  He was introduced to the owner of the voice.  It turned out to be Cossack Alexei, the son of Rozum.  The nobleman took it with him and arranged it as a singer in Moscow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.h-rf.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexey Razumovsky" class="if uuid-2518135" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2518135.jpg"></div><p>  According to legend, the secret wedding of Alexei Razumovsky and Elizabeth Petrovna took place in a rural church on November 24, 1742.  Favorite of Elizabeth Razumovsky held his exclusive position until the death of the Empress, although in recent years another man took the place of his lover.  Rumors of joint children led to the appearance at the court of Princess Tarakanova, who claimed the throne. </p><h2>  Empress Young Favorite: Nikita Beketov </h2><p>  The autocrat's attention to Ivan Shuvalov was unusually frustrating not only to Alexei Razumovsky, but also to his friend A. Bestuzhev-Ryumin.  The Chancellor decided to ‚Äúcreate‚Äù a new favorite for Elizabeth Petrovna with her own hands.  The choice fell on the young pupil of the Cadet Corps Nikita Beketov. </p><p>  A handsome and energetic young man who played the role of the first lovers in theatrical performances in the building and at court, became the adjutant of Razumovsky.  Nikita Beketov received rooms in the courtyard.  For more than a year he lived there simultaneously with Ivan Shuvalov. </p><p>  The Shvalov brothers made attempts to remove the young favorite from the Empress.  Nikita Beketov loved to stroll in the shade of the alleys with young court singers, which caused allegations of debauchery.  Peter Shuvalov gave the young man an ointment from freckles, but from her he was covered with acne.  The empresses reported that this was the result of Beketov‚Äôs shameful behavior. </p><p>  Elizaveta Petrovna moved to Tsarskoye Selo and forbade the favorite to follow her.  He fell ill, and nearly died.  Beketov was removed from the yard, but he managed to make a career.  Nikita Beketov was appointed Arkhangelsk mayor.  He never got married. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikita Beketov" class="if uuid-2518145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2518145.jpg"></div><h2>  The failed suitors of Elizabeth Petrovna </h2><p>  At different times, the Empress got married: </p><ul><li>  Louis XV - King of France from the Bourbon dynasty, whose reign was one of the longest in world history, </li><li>  Moritz of Saxony - French commander, </li><li>  Peter II - the grandson of Peter I, </li><li>  Karl-August Golshtinsky - the younger brother of her sister‚Äôs husband, who died in St. Petersburg, never reaching the altar, </li><li>  Nadir Shah is the Shah of Iran. </li></ul>
