    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Banking houses are inseparable from the global economic environment.  <span>The banking system of the Russian Federation,</span> like the whole world, is feeling the consequences of the crisis, functioning in a special mode against the backdrop of uncertainty, structural changes, the emergence of new international capital centers, offshore financial flows, and accelerated capital migration.  The sanctions of major powers add additional instability to the banking sector. </p><p>  The operation of the system is complicated by the consequences of an ongoing global financial crisis, instability in Europe, and the transition to Basel standards.  The domestic banking system is still objectively behind the systems of developed countries.  Causes of instability: </p><ul><li>  Economic growth is tied to commodity exports. </li><li>  Lack of clarity on which model to build the banking system. </li><li>  Insufficient <span>investment attractiveness of the</span> sphere, including due to its low capitalization. </li><li>  Banking infrastructure is far from optimal development. </li><li>  Continued outflow of capital. </li></ul><p>  Perhaps banking houses due to the flexibility of management have some advantages in a number of banking areas when working with the local population and organizations in their region.  Bank "Banking House" - confirmation of this.  The company overcame the recent financial crisis in Russia without consequences.  It works with profit.  Attractive interest rates on deposits and their low entry threshold allow people with any income to increase their funds.  Important advantages are the absence of hidden fees and understandable contract terms. </p>
