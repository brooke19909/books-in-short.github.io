He forever <span>left a mark</span> in history as a talented commander.  A descendant of the Georgian royal house. </p><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Petr Bagration, whose biography (with a photo of the monument) is in this article, was born on 11.11.1765 in the North Caucasus, in the city of Kizlyar.  He came from a noble and ancient family of Georgian princes.  The boy was the great-grandson of the Kartalin king Jesse Levanovich.  Peter's father, Prince Ivan Alexandrovich, was a Russian colonel and owned a small plot of land in the vicinity of Kizlyar.  In 1796, <span>Peter's father</span> died in poverty. </p><h2>  Service enrollment </h2><p>  Their family was not rich, despite the noble title and royal kinship.  There was only enough money to provide the most necessary, but there was no money left for clothes.  Therefore, when Peter was called to Petersburg, the young Bagration did not have ‚Äúdecent‚Äù clothes. </p><p>  To get acquainted with Potemkin, he had to borrow a butler's caftan.  Despite his clothes, Peter, when meeting with the prince of Tauris, was confident, without timidity, although modestly.  Potemkin liked the young man, and an order was given to enroll him in a musketeer Caucasian regiment as a sergeant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="petr bagration" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1639813.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  In February 1782, Peter Bagration, photographs of the portraits of which are in this article, arrived in the regiment, which was in a small fortress, in the Caucasian foothills.  From the first day, combat training began.  In the first battle with the Chechens, Peter distinguished himself and received the rank of ensign as a reward. </p><p>  In the musketeer regiment, he served ten years.  Over the years, he passed all military ranks to the captain.  Repeatedly received combat distinctions for clashes with the highlanders.  Peter was respected for fearlessness and courage, not only friends, but also enemies.  Such popularity once saved Bagration‚Äôs life. </p><p>  In one of the skirmishes, Peter was badly wounded and left in a deep swoon on the battlefield among dead bodies.  He was found by enemies, recognized and not only spared, but also bandaged his wounds.  Then they carefully delivered to the regimental camp, without even requesting a ransom.  For the difference in battle, Peter received the title of second major. </p><p>  For ten years of service in the musketeer regiment, Bagration participated in campaigns against the Sheikh-Mansur (false prophet).  In 1786, Pyotr Ivanovich fought with the Circassians under the command of Suvorov over the river.  Labu.  In 1788, during the Turkish War, Bagration as part of the Yekaterinoslav Army participated in the siege, and then in the assault on Ochakov.  In 1790 he continued military operations in the Caucasus.  This time opposed the Highlanders and the Turks. </p><h2>  Military career </h2><p>  In November 1703, Bagration Petr Ivanovich, whose brief biography cannot fit all the interesting facts from his life, became prime minister.  He received a transfer to the Kiev Carabinieri Regiment as a squadron commander.  In 1794, Pyotr Ivanovich was sent to the Sofia military unit, where he received a division under his command.  Bagration and Suvorov went through the Polish campaign in full and at the end received the rank of lieutenant colonel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Feats of Bagration </h2><p>  The biography of Peter Bagration is full of many exploits that went down in history.  For example, one of them was committed near Brody.  In a dense forest there was a Polish military detachment (1,000 foot soldiers and one gun), as they were sure, in an inaccessible position. </p><p>  Bagration, who was distinguished by courage from childhood, rushed to the enemy first and cut into the enemy ranks.  The Poles did not wait for the attack, and the attack of Pyotr Ivanovich turned out to be a complete surprise to them.  Thanks to the tactics of surprise, Bagration and his soldiers managed to kill 300 people and capture another 200 together with the squad leader.  At the same time, the Carabinieri grabbed the enemy banner and gun. </p>

    <p>  Another memorable feat occurred in the eyes of Suvorov.  This happened in October 1794, when Prague was stormed.  Bagration Petr Ivanovich, whose photo is in this article, noted that the Polish cavalry was going to attack the Russian assault columns during a fierce battle. </p><p>  The commander waited for the moment when the enemies began to move.  Then Bagration, having made a rapid throw to the flank with his soldiers, threw the Poles to the Vistula River.  Suvorov personally thanked Pyotr Ivanovich, and since then he has become his favorite. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  General rank </h2><p>  In 1798, Bagration received the rank of colonel and was appointed to command the sixth jaeger regiment.  He stood in the Grodno province, in the city of Volkovysk.  Emperor Paul ordered all military records to be delivered to him.  Any deviation from orders entailed removal from service. </p><p>  Many regiments were cleaned.  She did not affect anyone only in the military unit of Bagration.  Two years later, for the excellent condition of his regiment, the commander was promoted to the rank of "general."  Peter Bagration, whose biography did not turn off the military path, continued his service in a new capacity. </p><h2>  Procession to glory with Suvorov </h2><p>  In 1799, he and the regiment were at the disposal of Suvorov.  The latter, when the name of Bagration was named, in front of the entire audience with joy embraced and kissed Pyotr Ivanovich.  The next day, the generals led the soldiers with a surprise attack in Cavriano.  Two great military leaders continued their ascent to glory and greatness. </p><p>  Suvorov sent a letter to the emperor, in which he praised the courage, zeal and zeal of Bagration, which he showed during the capture of the Breshno fortress.  As a result, Paul I granted Peter Ivanovich to the Knights of the Order of St. Anne of the first class.  Later, for the battle of Lecco, Bagration was awarded the commanding order of St. John of Jerusalem.  So Peter Ivanovich appeared among the awards Maltese cross. </p><p>  For the defeat of the French near Marengo received the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky.  After the victory at Trebius, the emperor was granted the village of Sima as a gift to Pyotr Ivanovich.  It was located in the Vladimir province, in the Alexander district.  In the village there were 300 peasant souls.  Bagration became one of the youngest generals with high insignia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bagration Petr Ivanovich biography" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1639820.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A feat near Shengraben </h2><p>  In 1805, Pyotr Ivanovich completed another feat.  This happened near Shengraben.  The enemy troops seemed to have won, but Bagration with 6,000 soldiers came out against the 30,000th army.  As a result, he not only won, but also brought prisoners, among whom were one colonel, two officers of junior ranks, and 50 soldiers.  At the same time, Peter Ivanovich Bagration also grabbed the banner of the French.  For this feat, the great commander was awarded the Order of St. George of the second degree. </p><h2>  Military talent </h2><p>  Pyotr Ivanovich was able to prove his military talent during the service.  Bagration distinguished himself in the battles of Friedland and at Price-Eilau.  Napoleon spoke of Peter Ivanovich as the best Russian general of that time.  During the Russo-Swedish War, Bagration led the division, then the corps.  Headed the √Öland expedition, went with his troops to the Swedish coast. </p><h2>  Royal disfavor </h2><p>  Glory and imperial goodwill increasingly increased the circle of envious Pyotr Ivanovich.  Enemies tried to make Bagration, while he was on campaigns, a "fool" in front of the king.  When in 1809 Pyotr Ivanovich commanded troops on the Danube (already in the rank of general from infantry), envious people were able to convince the sovereign of the general‚Äôs inability to fight.  And they achieved the fact that Bagration was replaced by Alexander I by Count Kamensky. </p><h2>  Patriotic War </h2><p>  After the Russo-Turkish war, for which Peter Ivanovich was awarded the Order of St. Andrew the First-Called, he became commander in chief of the second Western Army, consisting of 45,000 soldiers and 216 guns.  When it became clear that war with Napoleon was inevitable, Bagration showed the emperor a plan of attack. </p><p>  But since Barclay de Tolly received preference, the Western armies began a retreat.  Napoleon first decided to destroy the weak army commanded by Bagration Petr Ivanovich (1812).  To fulfill this plan, he sent his brother from the front, and in the end - Marshal Davout.  But he could not overpower Bagration, he made his way through the enemy‚Äôs barriers at the World, defeating the foot troops of the king of Westphalia, and near Romanov his cavalry. </p><p>  Davout succeeded in blocking Pyotr Ivanovich‚Äôs path to Mogilev, and Bagration was forced to go to New Bykov.  In July, he joined forces with Barclay.  There was a tough battle for Smolensk.  Bagration, despite the fact that he was supposed to conduct offensive tactics, nevertheless a little deviated to the side.  With this strategy, Pyotr Ivanovich saved his army from unnecessary losses. </p><p>  After the forces of Bagration and Barclay joined, the commanders were not able to develop a common battle tactic.  Their opinions diverged greatly, disagreements reached the highest limits.  Pyotr Ivanovich offered to fight Napoleon‚Äôs army, and Barclay was sure that luring the enemy inland was the best solution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bagration Petr Ivanovich short biography" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1639823.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The last for Bagration - the battle of Borodino </h2><p>  General Peter Bagration participated in the Battle of Borodino, which was the last in his military career.  Peter Ivanovich was supposed to defend the weakest section of the position.  Bagration was the division of Neverovsky.  During a fierce battle, Pyotr Ivanovich was seriously wounded, but did not want to leave the battlefield, and continued to command, being under enemy fire. </p><p>  But Bagration was losing more and more blood, weakness began to intensify, and Pyotr Ivanovich was carried away from the battlefield and sent to a Moscow hospital.  Rumors spread about the wounded Bagration very quickly between the soldiers.  Some even claimed that he died. </p><p>  These messages drove the soldiers into despair, and confusion began in the army.  Bagration took the place of Konovitsyn.  He, seeing the reaction of the soldiers and the loss of morale, decided not to risk it and led the army behind the Semenovsky ravine. </p><h2>  The death of the great commander </h2><p>  At first, in the hospital, General Peter Bagration, whose biography (a photo of the monument to the commander is in this article), which, it seemed, could go on, felt better.  Initial treatment was successful.  Then Bagration went to recover from his wounds at the estate of his friend, <span>Prince Golitsyn.</span>  It was autumn, the weather was disgusting, the road was very bad. </p><p>  All this, and even the decadent mood of Bagration, negatively affected his health.  Pyotr Ivanovich began a life-threatening complication of the disease.  On September 21, Bagration underwent a vein expansion surgery.  At the same time, doctors removed bone fragments, rotting flesh and parts of the nucleus from an inflamed wound.  This surgical intervention did not help, the next day gangrene was found in Bagration. </p><p>  Doctors invited the prince to amputate his leg, but this caused the commander's anger, and his condition worsened even more.  As a result, Bagration Petr Ivanovich, whose biography is full of victories, died of gangrene in September 1812. The commander was first buried in the village of Sim, inside the local church.  His body lay there until July 1830. </p><p>  The commander was forgotten due to the absence of his wife, who had gone to live in Vienna back in 1809. Bagration was remembered only 27 years after the accession to the throne of Nicholas I. He loved history and personally studied all the events of World War II.  As a result, works about this era began to appear and the heroes were finally paid tribute. </p><p>  Nicholas I ordered to deliver the ashes of the great commander to the foot of the monument on the <span>Borodino field.</span>  The lead crypt in which Peter Bagration rested was transferred to a new coffin.  Then there was a requiem and a liturgy, which was attended by a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpeople who came from different places.  A large memorial table was set in the garden. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="General Peter Bagration biography photo" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1639818.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Many noblemen and officers gathered.  People walked to honor the memory of the great commander, days and nights, in a continuous stream.  The body of Pyotr Ivanovich was accompanied by an honorary convoy in an ornate chariot to the very destination.  The procession was very solemn.  People themselves asked permission to drag the chariot.  Ahead was the clergy, behind - the Kiev Hussar Regiment. </p><p>  The trumpeters played the funeral march along the entire length of the path.  The procession ended at the borders of the village.  Then horses were drawn into the chariot, and further the procession continued in solemn silence.  Despite the scorching sun, the people followed the coffin of Bagration for 20 versts.  So, finally, with truly royal honors, the remains of Peter Ivanovich were delivered to the Borodino field. </p><p>  Later, the memory of the hero was once again immortalized by Emperor Alexander III: the 104th Ustyuzhensky Infantry Regiment was named after Bagration.  In 1932, his grave was destroyed, and the remains are scattered.  Between 1985 and 1987  the monument was restored again. </p><p>  Among the rubbish next to the old monument were fragments of the bones of Pyotr Ivanovich.  In August 1987, they were reburied.  Now the crypt of Bagration is in place <span>of the Raevsky battery.</span>  The found buttons and fragments of the hero‚Äôs uniform are exhibited as exhibits in the Borodino Military History Museum. </p><h2>  Bagration Petr Ivanovich: interesting facts about his lifestyle </h2><p>  He was similar to Suvorov.  Bagration slept only 3-4 hours a day, was unpretentious and simple.  Any soldier could wake him without any ceremony.  During the campaigns, Pyotr Ivanovich only changed clothes.  He slept always dressed, in his general's uniform.  Bagration did not part with a sword and a whip even in a dream.  Of the 30 years of service, Pyotr Ivanovich spent 23 years in military campaigns. </p><h2>  Bagration character </h2><p>  Bagration Petr Ivanovich, whose biography was closely related to the war, nevertheless, had a meek disposition.  The commander shone with a flexible and subtle mind, anger was alien to him, he was always ready for reconciliation.  These qualities were surprisingly combined with a decisive character.  Bagration did not hold evil against people, and he never forgot good deeds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="General Peter Bagration Biography" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1639822.jpg" width="341"></div>

    <p>  In communication, Pyotr Ivanovich was always friendly and polite, respected his subordinates, appreciated and rejoiced at their successes.  Bagration, although he possessed considerable power, never showed it.  I tried to communicate with people humanly, for which he was simply idolized by soldiers and officers.  All of them considered it an honor to serve under his command. </p><p>  Despite the lack of a good education, which due to his extreme poverty, his parents could not give his son, Pyotr Ivanovich had a natural talent and good upbringing.  He received all the knowledge throughout his life, especially loved military science.  The great commander was fearless and brave in battles, never lost heart, and he reacted to dangers with indifference. </p><p>  Bagration was Suvorov's favorite student, so he knew how to quickly navigate in a combat situation, make the right and unexpected decisions.  Repeatedly they saved not single lives, but the troops as a whole. </p><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  Among the favorites of Emperor Paul the First was Bagration Petr Ivanovich.  Briefly about his personal life does not tell.  It was the emperor who helped him marry his beloved.  Pyotr Ivanovich had long been in love with the court beauty, Countess Skavronskaya.  But Bagration diligently hid his passionate feelings from society.  And besides, restrained Peter Ivanovich and the coldness of his beauty. </p><p>  The emperor found out about the feelings of Bagration and decided to repay by mercy to his faithful commander.  The sovereign ordered the count and his daughter to arrive at the palace church.  And the beauty was supposed to come in a wedding dress.  At the same time, Peter Bagration received the order to appear in church in full dress.  There, on September 2, 1800, young people were married. </p><p>  But the proud beauty was still cold towards Bagration.  Then the emperor appointed him commander of the <span>Jaeger regiment.</span>  The sovereign hoped that the countess‚Äôs heart would finally melt.  But her love has long been given to another person.  The story of Bagration with his wife did not end there. </p><p>  In 1805, she went to live in Europe, in Vienna.  She led a free life and no longer lived with her husband.  Pyotr Ivanovich Bagration begged his wife to return, but she remained abroad allegedly for treatment.  In Europe, the princess enjoyed tremendous success.  She was known at the court of many countries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="General Peter Bagration" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1639817.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p> In 1810, she gave birth to a girl, presumably from the Chancellor of Austria, Prince Metternich.  In 1830, the princess remarried.  This time for the Englishman.  But their marriage soon broke up, and the princess again took the name of Bagration.  She never returned to Russia.  Despite everything, Peter Bagration until his death was very fond of his wife.  Before his death, he managed to order the artist Volkov her portrait.  The couple did not have children. </p><p>  There was talk in high society that the sovereign's sister, Princess Ekaterina Pavlovna, was in love with Bagration.  This caused great irritation in the emperor's family.  According to some reports, Bagration was not given a respite from the war precisely because of Ekaterina Pavlovna's love for him.  Emperor Alexander the First decided to remove Pyotr Ivanovich from her eyes and keep him away from the princess.  Peter Bagration fell into such an disgrace shortly before his death. </p>
