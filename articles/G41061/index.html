    <h2>  Hotel Housing Impressions </h2><p>  As for the rooms of Manousos Hotel 3 * (Rhodes), then, according to travelers, they are clean, pleasantly decorated and equipped with everything necessary.  It is noticeable that recently a repair was made.  Furniture and plumbing are not new, but everything is in good condition.  The rooms are small, but there is enough space in them for a comfortable stay.  The newlyweds were pleasantly surprised: the hotel gave them a compliment in the form of fruit and wine in the room.  There is also a safe in the rooms, which can be used at an additional cost.  Air conditioning can be used for free.  Also, tourists in their reviews note the presence of a TV with two channels in Russian. </p><p>  A small minus was some vacationers considered good audibility in the rooms.  So, according to them, if the noise from the street does not bother you when the windows are closed, then in case you get too noisy neighbors, some discomfort is provided.  Therefore, if you are used to getting enough sleep, it is recommended to take ear plugs from the house.  However, in fairness, it should be recognized that a similar problem is characteristic not only for Manousos Hotel 3 *, but also for many other hotels both in Greece and other countries. </p><p>  As for cleaning, according to our compatriots, it is of high quality and daily.  If you want towels to be changed, throw the dirty ones on the floor.  Bed linen was updated every three days.  Also, travelers are advised to pay attention to the fact that there are no <span>beach towels</span> at the hotel.  Therefore, they must be taken with you from home or bought on the spot. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews of food and hotel staff </h2><p>  As for food, then, according to tourists, breakfast at the hotel is standard European.  So, here you will be offered granola, prepared in different ways, eggs, sausages, cheeses, dried fruits, fresh vegetables and fruits, jams, pastries, tea, coffee and juices.  This is not to say that the choice is huge, but you will not stay hungry.  As for lunch and dinner, they at Manousos Hotel 3 * are offered at a price of 10 euros.  However, most guests preferred to eat in the many taverns located in the vicinity of the hotel.  Those who had lunch and dinner at the hotel claim that there were always delicious seafood and meat dishes on the menu. </p><p>  Vacationers have a very positive opinion about the hotel staff.  According to them, the staff here are polite and friendly.  Try to populate as quickly as possible.  At the same time, upon arrival, they will not ask you to fill out any forms (as in a number of other hotels).  So, here you only need to show your passport, and the administrators at the reception will give you the key to the number.  Our compatriots also pay attention to the fact that the hotel staff speaks only English. </p><p>  As for the contingent of vacationers, for the most part it is represented by young people (about 17-20 years old) from various countries.  However, those tourists who stayed at the Manousos Hotel 3 * in September-October, argue that at this time there are almost no young people here, and the guests are mainly people of retirement age. </p><h2>  Opinion about beach vacations and entertainment </h2><p>  Many travelers who spent their holidays here were delighted with the opportunity to go swimming in the beaches of the Mediterranean and the Aegean.  Go to the first for about 10 minutes, and to the second - no more than a couple of minutes.  According to tourists, the Aegean Sea is quite turbulent and waves are frequent here.  Therefore, many vacationers spent time on the beaches of the Mediterranean Sea.  In addition, the water here is warmer than in the <span>Aegean.</span>  However, when entering it, note that after a few meters from the shore, the bottom goes down and becomes deep enough.  Therefore, people who do not know how to swim, and travelers with children should be alert. </p>
