    <h2>  Required Inventory </h2><p>  In order to make cyclamen from beads, you will need: </p><ul><li>  beads of different colors; </li><li>  0.3 mm thick wire; </li><li>  threads of brown and green colors; </li><li>  nippers; </li><li>  gypsum; </li><li>  acrylic paint; </li><li>  flower pot. </li></ul><p>  When choosing beads for work, it is better to give preference to Czech or domestic.  It is more even in size and color.  For the flower you need beads of pink, silver and white.  For leaves - green and dark green.  When choosing, you can still be guided by your taste.  Of course, small deviations are allowed.  In the given master class, colors are called for convenience. </p><h2>  Bead Flowers </h2><p>  Start work with weaving flowers, as this is the longest and most laborious stage.  For a full bouquet you need 6 full-blown cyclamen and 5 buds.  Each large flower also consists of 5 petals.  True, having completed this part, it will already be possible to say firmly that more than half has been done. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  For one petal, cut off a 50 cm long wire. Mark the middle with one pink bead.  To do this, string it and thread one of the ends of the wire in the opposite direction.  Next, cyclamen from beads is weaved according to the scheme in the technique of parallel weaving.  For convenience, and so that everything is clear even to a novice, the description below is given in paragraphs, the number of which corresponds to the row. </p><ol><li>  3 pink beads are strung on the wire. </li><li>  Exactly the same as the first. </li><li>  Another pink bead is added, and there are 4 of them. </li><li>  Here you need to dial 1 white, 3 pink and again 1 white bead. </li><li>  2 white, 2 pink and 2 more white beads are collected, that is, there are 6 in total. </li><li>  Consists of 7 white beads. </li><li>  You need to increase the number by 1 bead, as a result, there will be 8. </li><li>  Collect 9 white beads. </li><li>  One more, that is 10 pieces. </li><li>  Same as row 9. </li><li>  Once again, you need to repeat the 9th row. </li><li>  Reduce the amount by 1 piece to become 9 beads in a row. </li><li>  One less, and in the end there are 8 pieces left. </li><li>  In this row, dial only 6 pieces. </li><li>  Reduce by 2 beads to 4. </li><li>  In the last row leave only 2 pieces. </li></ol><p>  At the end, fasten the wire and hide the ends well.  It is very important that all rows are strictly parallel to each other, and the beads lie exactly one to one.  Without this, it will be difficult to continue weaving with beads.  Cyclamen can just turn out unsightly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thus, you need to make 5 petals for each flower.  It turns out that all of them will need 30 pieces.  Then you need to connect them to each other at the bottom with a wire.  To complete the work with the flower, you need to put on the edge of the openwork thread, consisting of white and silver beads.  For her, take a separate wire and thread it at the base of the cyclamen.  Then dial one white, three silver and another white.  Thread the end into the next bead and repeat the set.  Do all this until you get a lace frill around the whole flower. </p><h2>  Beautiful buds </h2><p>  To cyclamen from beads turned out to be voluminous and interesting, small buds can be additionally made to it.  Weaving them is much easier than flowers.  Therefore, their manufacture can be considered a little rest before the next big stage - weaving leaves. </p><p>  On a 30 cm long wire, collect 30 white beads.  Then, in the opposite direction, thread its end through the last 15 beads.  Then you need to collect another 10 beads and thread the end of the wire through the previously created ring.  Thus, one of the three petals of the bud was obtained.  Once they are all ready, put them together.  Twist all the remaining ends of the wires together and decorate with a brown thread. </p>

    <h2>  Leaves for cyclamen </h2><p>  And of course, it is impossible to imagine a single plant without leaves.  Bead cyclamen is no exception.  For their weaving, only 2 colors are used - green and dark green.  As in the case of the flower, the work is performed according to the scheme in the technique of parallel weaving.  A detailed description will be given below, where the ordinal item corresponds to the row number. </p><ol><li>  Collect 2 dark green beads. </li><li>  The row consists of 2 green and 2 dark green beads. </li><li>  1 dark green, 2 green and 2 more dark green. </li><li>  2 dark green and 2 green alternate, there will be 6 beads in total. </li><li>  In this row - 3 dark green, 2 green and dark green, a total of 7 pieces. </li><li>  The amount of dark green increases by one, then the row completely repeats the previous one. </li><li>  In the same way as in the previous row, the amount of dark beads increases.  There will be 9 beads in total. </li><li>  In this row there are only 10 beads: 6 dark, 2 light and 2 more dark. </li><li>  One more dark green beads, and of course, one more in a row. </li><li>  A proportional increase in dark beads in the row continues.  There are already 12 of them. </li><li>  You also need to add one dark bead at the very beginning. </li><li>  This row consists of 10 dark, 2 green and 2 dark. </li><li>  In total, there are 15 beads in this row, namely 11 dark green, 2 green and 2 dark green. </li><li>  This row starts with 2 bright, then you need to dial 10 dark green, 2 green and 2 more dark green. </li><li>  In this row - 3 green, ten dark green, 2 green and 2 dark green. </li><li>  The row consists of 2 dark, 2 light, 9 dark, 2 light and 2 dark. </li><li>  From this row, the amount of beads decreases.  It will already consist of 2 dark green, 2 green, 8 dark green, 2 green and 2 dark green. </li><li>  It already has 2 less beads, namely 2 dark, 2 light, 6 dark, 2 light and 2 dark. </li><li>  You need to dial 2 dark green, 2 green, 4 dark green, 2 green and 2 dark green.  Biserin in the row was another 2 less. </li><li>  It consists of a total of 10 beads: 2 dark, 6 light and 2 dark. </li><li>  Collect 2 dark green beads, then 4 green and 2 dark green again. </li><li>  In the last row are 6 dark beads. </li></ol><p>  True, this is only half the sheet.  Now, to make the second part, you need to take another piece of wire and repeat all steps 1 to 22 of the row, only in mirror image.  In this case, in each row, the newly collected beads must be woven into the first half of the sheet.  A total of 8 leaves will be needed.  To twist the free remains of a wire among themselves and to wrap a green thread. </p><h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  Now it remains only to collect all the elements together to make a cyclamen from beads.  The photo of the finished flower, posted below, clearly demonstrates what the finished work looks like. </p>
