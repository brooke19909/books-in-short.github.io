Great relaxation and vivid impressions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sri Lanka is an island nation located in the Indian Ocean.  Although this island is associated with tea plantations, there are also opportunities for relaxation.  There are no noisy parties in Sri Lanka, but there are many amazing and informative excursions that go well with a beach holiday.  Sri Lanka in June is very popular.  A comfortable stay and vivid impressions attract tourists. </p><p>  On the coast of the country there are beaches with clean sand, and <span>coconut palms</span> and coral reefs create unique landscapes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sri Lanka in June" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/437811.jpg" width="576"></div>

    <p>  Fans of excursions must visit Colombo.  This city is famous for its monuments of architecture, temples and cathedrals.  Here you can see frescoes depicting moments of Buddha's life, which are described in legends and myths. </p><p>  The island is considered one of the most popular diving centers.  The waters around it are rich in corals, outlandish fish, whales and sharks.  Sri Lanka is especially good in June.  Tourists can visit underwater grottoes and sunken ships, admire the cliffs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sri lanka in june weather" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/437823.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Do I need a visa? </h2><p>  This is one of the first questions travelers are interested in.  If the duration of the rest is not more than 30 days, you must apply for a certain form of visa (ETA).  This will cost a smaller amount, besides the control is not so tough.  For children under the age of 12 years, a visa is free of charge. </p><p>  The territory of Sri Lanka can not import the <span>currency of Pakistan</span> and India.  This must be remembered when going on vacation so that there are no problems at the border.  It is forbidden to take precious stones and tobacco with you to your homeland; the export of national currency is strictly controlled.  It is advisable to clarify in advance all information on import-export in order to avoid unpleasant situations. </p><p>  There is one feature that Sri Lanka has.  Holidays in June, however, as in any other month, can be both budgetary and immensely expensive.  The cost of living in hotels depends on their location.  Prices in the tourist center and on the coast are quite high, but in the mountainous part of the island you can relax no less comfortably, but for a smaller amount.  The famous beaches of Sri Lanka can be visited on your own, using a car or public transport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sri lanka vacation in june" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/437812.jpg" width="550"></div>

But Sri Lanka in June may "please" with rainy weather.  But this does not deter travelers, since the coast is still quite comfortable.  Rains do not last long, 15-20 minutes, and mostly at night.  Going on a trip to see what beauties Sri Lanka is fraught with?  In June, the weather will not spoil the rest.  You can not worry about this.  But there is still one drawback - during the showers strong waves rise, the sea becomes dangerous. </p><p>  Admirers of such a noble sport as golf will be pleased with international golf courses.  Rafting along the mountain river Kelani is also impressive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sri lanka june reviews" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/437828.jpg" width="415"></div>

    <h2>  Shops and outlets </h2><p>  Sri Lanka is world famous for its precious stones.  Jewelry should be bought exclusively in specialized stores, otherwise there is a risk of running into a fake.  Ceylon tea and national products are in great demand among tourists.  In small shops and in the market it is appropriate to bargain, but in state sales points this is unacceptable. </p><h2>  Difference in time </h2><p>  When planning a flight, you need to take into account the time difference.  For Ukraine, it is 3.5 hours, and for Russia - 5.5 hours.  When choosing a tour, you can ask the agency why Sri Lanka is interesting in June.  Testimonials from other travel agency customers can be very helpful. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  The roads on the island are of high quality, but rather narrow, with <span>right-hand traffic.</span>  You can use a rental car to navigate your personal affairs.  Such a pleasure will cost about $ 20 per day.  The hotel clerk will happily tell you how to get to the nearest rental agencies.  But for those people who are not very confident in driving, it is more advisable to use the services of a driver or catch a taxi. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  Before visiting Sri Lanka, special vaccinations are not required, but walk in parks and reserves with caution, avoiding mosquitoes and other insects.  To do this, you can use clothes with long sleeves and pants. </p><p>  It is not recommended to drink running tap water, it is better to use bottled mineral water. </p><h2>  clothing </h2><p>  One of the hottest islands is Sri Lanka.  In June, the sun can burn incredibly hard, so you need to take care of suitable clothing.  But too frivolous attire can attract unwanted attention of local men.  It is worth buying a hat, and it‚Äôs advisable to wear high-heeled shoes only in the evening. </p><p>  The bag should be durable and practical.  All values ‚Äã‚Äãneed to be hidden in internal pockets, as small thieves' fishing on the island is booming. </p><p>  Due to the intense heat of the shower, one has to take very often, so you should take care of personal hygiene products.  Girls should know and take into account the features that Sri Lanka has: in June the weather is so hot (+ 29- + 31) that it makes no sense to use makeup, as the makeup will blur.  But <span>sunscreens</span> will be very useful. </p>
