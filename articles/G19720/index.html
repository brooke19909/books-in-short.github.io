Therefore, do not be upset if your vacation fell in April.  Rest at this time has its advantages.  The high season is still far away, and in many resorts you can spend time as well as in the summer.  If you like a <span>beach holiday,</span> then you should not deprive yourself of the pleasure of spending a vacation in April at sea.  "Where to go in the middle of spring?"  - you ask.  The choice of directions is quite large, so there is always a choice where to have a good time.  In our article we will try to talk about those resorts where beach vacations in April are possible. </p><h2>  Thailand </h2><p>  Many tourists mistakenly believe that the rainy season begins in Thailand in the spring, which means that a beach holiday in April in this country is not possible.  However, this is not quite true.  Rains in this period are just beginning.  The choice of resorts in Thailand is quite large, and the rainy season on them begins at different times.  Therefore, a vacation at sea in April is quite possible. </p><p>  Tourists can be advised to go to Pattaya.  The most popular resort in the country will delight guests with complete calm and sunny weather.  The air temperature at this time reaches +33 degrees.  Despite the fact that Pattaya is located north of other resorts, the weather in April is more comfortable and dry.  The water temperature in the sea reaches +30 degrees.  During the whole month no more than five rainy days can be observed. </p><p>  One of the advantages of a holiday <span>in April in Thailand</span> is a lower cost than during the high season.  On average, the budget of a trip with accommodation for two tourists is about 2 thousand dollars (115 thousand rubles).  Because of the beginning of the rainy season, local residents begin to reduce prices for services and accommodation, as the influx of guests in a sunny country is noticeably reduced. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.kuoni.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Thailand" class="if uuid-2388439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2388439.jpg"></div><p>  Pattaya is far from the only resort in Thailand where you can organize a good vacation in April.  Where to go in an exotic country?  According to tourists, in mid-spring it is worth paying attention to Koh Samui.  It is located at the very entrance to the Gulf of Thailand, and therefore rainy weather is observed in this region throughout the year.  And only from February to April is a dry period established here.  The island is close to the equator, and therefore it is always hot here, especially in the middle of spring.  In April, the air temperature reaches + 30 degrees, and water - +28 degrees. </p><p>  The tourist season in Bangkok lasts all year.  But in April the city gets very hot, the temperature rarely drops below +30 degrees.  Heat lovers will be pleased with the weather.  Rains come to the city only at the end of the month. </p><p>  Also for a vacation in April, you can choose Phuket, Krabi, Koh Lanta, Koh Chang and Koh Phangan. </p><p>  According to tourists, in Thailand you can relax in the middle of spring.  Good weather and warm sea will delight tourists.  In the middle of spring, several holidays are held in the country, including the meeting of the Thai New Year, so guests of the country can take part in the celebrations. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  April tours to Thailand attract lovers of hot packages.  On vacation during this period, you can save a lot by getting a high level of service at an affordable price. </p><h2>  Egypt </h2><p>  Vacations in April abroad are also possible in Egypt.  Tourists recommend going here for those who can not stand the heat.  Comfortable air temperature in the middle of spring will allow you to make fascinating trips to the sights of the country.  During the high season, not everyone dares to travel to interesting places.  But April is the most suitable time for this.  The coast of the Red Sea will delight you with its warmth.  In the middle of the month the weather can still be changeable, but the desert winds have already subsided by this time, and therefore the number of tourists is gradually increasing. </p><p>  According to tourists, you can go on vacation to Hurghada, Marsa Alam, Bur Safaga.  Daytime air temperature at these resorts is + 27 degrees, and nighttime temperature is not lower than +18.  The sea is not yet warmed up as much as we would like, but it is quite suitable for swimming.  On average, the water temperature reaches +25 degrees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thomascook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Egypt" class="if uuid-2388485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2388485.jpg"></div><p>  The absence of winds leads to the fact that heat is gradually coming to the resorts of the Sinai Peninsula: Dahab, Sharm El Sheikh, Nuweiba and Taba.  According to many tourists, April in Egypt is a comfortable time for relaxation for children and adults.  In the middle of spring, the season is just beginning, at this time you can get a full range of services at still winter prices.  The budget for rest per person per week is 35-40 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  UAE </h2><p>  Dreaming of a vacation at sea in April?  Then go to the UAE.  At this time, local resorts experience comfortable temperatures, thanks to which you can not only visit excursions, but also fully enjoy a beach holiday.  Where to go in April?  If you want to swim and sunbathe in the distance, you can go to Sharjah or Dubai.  The first is more oriented to sea vacations.  Local hotels are very comfortable and diverse.  In addition, a lot of our fellow citizens are resting here.  The air temperature in Sharjah in April does not fall below +31 degrees, and the water at this time warms up to +26 degrees.  There are no rains and winds during this period at the resort.  The average trip budget for two is 70 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="UAE beaches in April" class="if uuid-2388467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2388467.jpg"></div><p>  In April, for resorts in the UAE, it is worth choosing resorts located on the Persian Gulf coast, since the water temperature in it warms up to +27 degrees.  Gulf of Oman is a bit cooler.  The water temperature in it is +21 degrees.  In April, the weather in the Emirates is hot, but there is still no summer heat, and therefore the weather is very comfortable. </p><h2>  Sri Lanka </h2><p>  In search of budget tours for a beach holiday at sea in April, you should pay attention to Sri Lanka.  In mid-spring, the air temperature on the island reaches +33 degrees, and the water is warmed up to +30 degrees.  April is the last month of the season at local resorts.  Later, the region is dominated by the southwest monsoon.  But in the middle of spring you can still perfectly relax on the ocean in the rays of the warm sun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.whynotsrilanka.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Sri Lanka" class="if uuid-2388487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2388487.jpg"></div><p>  Experienced tourists recommend not to choose the southern resorts, since there is a chance of showers on them.  It is better to pay attention to the north or east coast of the island.  In April, after lunch, sometimes the sun hides behind the clouds, but this does not interfere with rest, since the temperature of the air and water is stably high.  Tourists who love Sri Lankan resorts seek to enjoy the last month of the beach season.  From May to December, vacationers have nothing to do on the island, since all this time there are equatorial showers. </p><h2>  Israel </h2><p>  Where else can you enjoy the sea in April?  A beach holiday abroad is possible in the territory of one of the resorts in Israel.  By this time, the country ends in a wet period and the tourist season begins.  In Tel Aviv, Haifa, Netanya, the air temperature reaches +25 degrees. </p><p>  For a vacation in April, it is better to choose resorts on the Dead Sea.  Here the air temperature warms up to +28 degrees.  The hottest thing is in Eilat, which is known as the country's southernmost resort.  The water temperature of the Dead Sea is +24 degrees, so rest on its coast will allow you to enjoy swimming.  A little lower by a couple of degrees the temperature indicators of the Red Sea.  However, this does not scare our tourists.  In April, at the resorts of Israel you can already meet many of our compatriots. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travel-holiday.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach Holidays in Israel" class="if uuid-2388489" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2388489.jpg"></div><p>  This is due to the fact that later in the country it becomes very hot.  Not everyone can withstand such high temperatures.  Therefore, some tourists still prefer comfortable warmth rather than heat. </p><h2>  Canary Islands </h2><p>  There are people whose priority is not only excursions, but also beach vacations.  Where in April you can have a nice time by the sea?  Experienced tourists recommend paying attention to the Canary Islands.  The most famous and popular resort of Tenerife offers a diverse vacation.  On its territory you can find beaches with white sand and black, having a volcanic origin.  However, the coast is not the only pride of the island.  The local treasures are tropical forests and volcanic mountains.  In general, a beach holiday in Tenerife can be combined with active entertainment.  April for travel is the best time.  In the middle of spring it is still not hot for excursions, although in the sun the temperature reaches +30 degrees, in the shade - +21 - +24.  But the nights are still pretty cool.  With the onset of darkness, the temperature drops to +16 degrees, so the resort will have to take a warm jacket.  But in April there is still no sweltering heat, when the main attraction for tourists are sea beaches and water sports.  In the middle of spring, you can visit all local attractions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach holidays in Tenerife" class="if uuid-2388498" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2388498.jpg"></div><p>  The sea water off the coast of Tenerife is still not very warm.  Its temperature indicators range from +19 - +21 degrees.  For adults, the sea is quite acceptable for swimming.  But the kids may have to confine themselves to a pool. </p><p>  Tenerife by the Russians is still not very studied.  Our compatriots do not so often choose the Canaries for relaxation.  All over the world, islands are considered a resort area for the British.  The stunningly beautiful nature of Tenerife, the unique black and white beaches are worthy of enjoying them lively.  The island is divided into two parts by a mountain range.  In the south of Tenerife, spring is much warmer and drier than in the north.  Therefore, in April it is worth choosing the southern region.  As for the northern part of the island, doctors recommend its mild climate for people with heart disease.  If you do not like hot weather, feel free to go to Tenerife in April. </p><h2>  China </h2><p>  China is one of those countries that can be considered for a beach holiday in April.  According to tourists, in the middle of spring is very good on Hainan.  Due to the vast territory of the country in China, there are many places that are suitable for recreation.  However, Hainan is considered one of the best resorts in East Asia.  In April, you can swim on the coast of the island.  Water temperature reaches +28 degrees.  In mid-spring, hotels are crowded with tourists. </p><p>  Comfortable air temperature allows you to devote part of the time not only to swimming in the sea, but also to excursions.  You can also go surfing in Dadonghai Bay or diving in Yaluvan Bay.  April weather is most favorable in the south of the island, in the Sanya region. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays on Hainan Island" class="if uuid-2388505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2388505.jpg"></div><p>  Here, in the middle of spring, the high season is in full swing.  In April, weather conditions do not present guests with unpleasant surprises.  The bright sun does not yet incinerate with its rays.  According to tourists, the weather at this time is very comfortable, unlike the period from May to September.  But you should be prepared for high humidity, which is the satellite of the tropics.  It's nice that daytime high temperatures give way to nighttime coolness. </p><p>  April budget vacation for two on the island will cost at least 60 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Goa </h2><p>  Goa can rightfully be called one of the best options for a beach holiday in April.  The Indian state is in the zone of influence of the tropical climate, and therefore the middle of spring in the region is the end of the dry season.  In May, rains begin.  But all April tourists enjoy the beautiful weather.  We can say that this is a transitional time in India from winter to summer.  Gradually increasing air humidity.  In April, it is practically not felt in the sun.  But in the summer, for our compatriots, this weather becomes a real test. </p><p>  When choosing a hotel for your vacation, pay attention to the fact that your room has air conditioning, since you can‚Äôt expect nightly coolness in April.  In the daytime, the air temperature reaches + 33-37 degrees. </p><p>  April is a great time for a beach holiday in southern India.  If you like to swim in the warm sea, then you should definitely visit Goa.  The water temperature here reaches +29 degrees.  And in April you can choose any resort as a vacation spot.  You can have a good time in Arambol, which is famous for its white beaches.  Palolem will be appreciated by tourists with children.  There is a very gentle entrance to the sea and there are absolutely no waves.  Go to Varca for a secluded holiday surrounded by stunning landscapes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mirror.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches of goa" class="if uuid-2388510" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2388510.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes the April stay on the beaches is overshadowed by gusts of wind caused by the waves of the Arabian Sea.  Waves are even in closed bays.  But this is not scary, since water resembles fresh milk, and therefore it is impossible to catch a cold.  But for a long time it is under the scorching rays of the sun in April is not recommended, otherwise you can get serious burns. </p><p>  According to tourists, April is a great time for a beach holiday in Goa.  Numerous positive reviews allow you to recommend the resort for trips in mid-spring. </p><h2>  Jordan </h2><p>  April is a very favorable month to visit Jordan.

Despite the high rates, the weather is very well tolerated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.responsibletravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Jordan" class="if uuid-2388521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2388521.jpg"></div><p>  The temperature of the Dead Sea reaches +22 degrees, so swimming is very comfortable.  The same temperature indicators are characteristic in April for the Red Sea.  The only drawback is that this period is not very suitable for diving due to the flowering of plankton.
