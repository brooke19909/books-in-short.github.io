    <h2>  A View Of Three Star Hotels In The Maldives </h2><p>  The <span>Maldives</span> resort <span>(</span> we attach the <span>photo of</span> hotels to the article) can offer an economical type of vacation in the form of hotels, which are assigned only three stars.  Unfortunately, guests will have to be satisfied with the services of not too high quality and they will need to live in rooms that have not seen repair for a long time.  But if there is a chance to save a couple of thousand dollars, then such things seem only trifles. </p><h2>  Popular three star hotels </h2><p>  We will begin to consider hotels in the Maldives with three-star establishments.  For not all people can afford to relax in a luxurious five-star apartment.  So, the most popular three star hotels in <span>Maldives</span> are: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1. Fern Boquete Inn.  Located in the beach area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSouth Hulumale.  The hotel offers visitors free Wi-Fi and a good restaurant.  Each room is decorated with style and taste.  It offers gorgeous views of the ocean or city.  All rooms include cable TVs, private safes and seating areas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels in maldives" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1462194.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  2. Nasandhura Palace.  The hotel is located on the northern atoll of Male.  The facility is intended primarily for business meetings.  Therefore, if you are looking for those Maldives hotels where you can relax during a business trip, then this place is just what you need.  There is a business center, banquet hall and conference rooms for small groups. </p><p>  3. Summer Villa Guest House.  This is a whole boarding house that can be found on the island of Maafushi.  Guests are entitled to a complimentary breakfast, which can be ordered directly to your room.  The hotel has six rooms equipped with ceiling fans and air conditioning.  All apartments have a telephone, safe and minibar. </p><h2>  What four-star hotels look like </h2><p>  <span>Rest in the Maldives is</span> always relevant <span>.</span>  Hotels with four stars are always in demand among tourists.  The numbers in them are bought up at a speed greater than that of light.  The level of service and equipment in institutions of this category is at a fairly high level.  The cost of a single apartment starts at $ 90 per night. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Four Star Hotels </h2><p>  If tourists are not satisfied with cheap hotels, then they can always consider more expensive offers.  In this case, the Maldives offers 4-star hotels.  In such establishments, the rooms are more elegantly furnished, and here guests are provided with a wider range of services than in institutions that have only three stars. </p><p>  Adaaran Prestige Ocean Villas is located on Hudhuranfushi Island.  The villa is perfect for those who want to spend a relaxing holiday with friends or family.  For your comfort, you will find DVD players, satellite TV, and a minibar in your room. </p><p>  Hotel Elite Inn is located in Hulhumale.  The institution has only ten rooms, but all of them will give a homely atmosphere and comfort.  They have LCD televisions, air conditioners, refrigerators and other household appliances so that guests can feel as comfortable as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maldives hotels 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1462195.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Somerset Hotel in Male is located on the oceanfront.  Each of the 30 guestrooms has a private bathroom or shower room.  A hairdryer and toiletries are provided free of charge for all guests.  Every day, staff clean the rooms.  The hotel has many opportunities for physical education, among which I would like to mention an ultramodern fitness center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What a five star hotel offers </h2><p>  Hotels (Maldives, 5 stars) offer rooms that are highly comfortable and equipped with the latest technology.  For one night in a similar hotel will have to pay 200 or more dollars.  In the most expensive institutions, this amount reaches 2.5 thousand dollars.  Not everyone can afford to rent an apartment in such a hotel.  Well, the lucky ones who can afford such a luxury get a highly professional service, breathtaking breakfasts and other delights of relaxation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maldives hotel photos" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1462191.jpg" width="600"></div>
