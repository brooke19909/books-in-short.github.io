Our inquiring consciousness sometimes touches upon such questions for which there is no clear answer, and we have to suffer guesses.  Every night, we have dreams where our body and mind are subjected to incredible tests.  We can wander through alien worlds, planets and universes.  And in the morning we don’t even remember what was in our “mysterious world”.  What do astronauts dream about?  How does weightlessness at rest affect our minds?  Why are they always trying to ignore this issue and why do we know so little about it?  Let's deal with this. </p>

    <h2>  And we dream of grass, grass at home </h2><p>  What do astronauts dream about in space?  Is there a clear difference between "earthly" and "cosmic" sleep?  In fact, there are an incredible amount of opinions and versions, some of them converge, while others disagree.  And this is not surprising, because the influence of space and weightlessness proceeds individually for everyone.  Some astronauts see “grass at home” in their dreams, relatives, loved ones and loved ones, because they experience some stress from the process of flying and being in space, while others experience crazy things in their dreams.  No matter who speaks about the serious preparation of the astronauts, still some of them at certain times manifest their human weaknesses, and this happens without exception.  We ourselves sometimes experience tragedies in dreams, but we can’t even imagine what the astronaut dreams about. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Why are they silent about this? </h2><p>  There is an assumption that “cosmic” dreams have several stages of development.  We can know so little about them, because astronauts themselves do not like to talk about it.  Sometimes their stories can shock the public, and they will be considered crazy.  As we know, mentally ill people will never be sent into space in their lives.  One has only to tell the psychologist that the astronaut is dreaming that he will immediately prescribe the appropriate treatment after such a revelation, and the astronaut will be forced to be suspended from life for life.  Hence we conclude that the "cosmic dreams" are silenced only because the astronauts themselves did not lose their work. </p>

    <h2>  What do astronauts say, what do they dream about and what do they see? </h2><p>  Nevertheless, some secrets about man in space leak out, and the inquisitive public is born of maximum interest in this information.  It's not just about dreams.  Real cases are known when astronauts, being in a cheerful and conscious state, experienced terrible things.  "The effect of someone else's presence," never heard of this?  This is when space crew members see the phantom of a “deceased relative” or hear strange whispering voices that it is undesirable for humanity to study space, because it will never achieve the result. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  What do astronauts dream about in orbit? </h2><p>  Being in orbit, the dreamer can undergo various transformations, during which he can transform into some animal or creature, which is completely incomprehensible to the human mind.  From the classical point of view, this is explained by the theory of “change of consciousness”, but humanity has not yet reached the level to begin studying such processes at the cosmic level.  Based on this, it is not yet possible to explain the regularity of the phenomenon of changes in consciousness in space. </p><p>  One American astronaut told a story about what astronauts dream of.  He talked about his friend, who managed to fly into space, let's call him K1 (astronaut-1).  During sleep, K1 transformed into a dinosaur.  The dreamer experienced sensations that most accurately describe the behavior of the ancient pangolin.  According to the descriptions of the exterior, everything also converged.  He said the following: “The first thing I felt was how huge paws began to grow in me, which immediately began to become covered with scales.  Membranes and huge claws immediately grew on the limbs.  However, for me it was not the most surprising.  At a certain point, I began to feel my horn plates with my back and moved them as I wanted.  There was no hint that it was a dream or that I was a human being.  “My voice was so sonorous and ferocious that it sounded like a vibration around me.” </p>

    <p>  In parallel with this, he constantly found himself in some kind of fantasy world, where the laws of physics are very different from the “earthly ones”, everything proceeds in a special and unpredictable way.  Each subsequent dream he was embodied in a new creature that lives in an unknown universe, where the environment is generated on the go.  Along with this, he very clearly understood the speech (or sounds) of imaginary creatures and could easily communicate with them. </p><h2>  What sensations do the astronauts experience? </h2><p>  What do astronauts dream about working days in orbit?  During the period of a dream in space, a person is transported in space and time, he can travel through uncharted cosmic bodies.  All this is perceived habitually, as if something native.  Fantastic dreams-states are born as if someone is dictating information to your head.  This vocal flow follows the person throughout the dream.  According to the dreamers, there is a feeling that behind this voice is hiding someone majestic and powerful, who cleverly manipulates your emotional-psychological sense of what is happening.  What is most remarkable is that fantastic dream states do not arise at night (not when the astronauts “hang up”), but during the working day, when a person relaxed for several minutes and lost his vigilance.  Time in a dream is very long, it feels slower than the “earthly” by 50-100 times. </p><h2>  The astronaut must have an “elastic” psyche </h2><p>  The influence of the “powerful” stream is so strong that the astronaut can admit that he “went off the roof”.  As a rule, such people no longer return to space.  That is why astronauts are selected with the most stable and “iron” psyche.  It is quite difficult to overcome your consciousness and ignore the transformation, so such dreams are inevitable for astronauts.  Many simply get used to it and never spread the rumor that astronauts dream. </p>
