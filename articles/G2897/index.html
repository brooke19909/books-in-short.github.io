Due to the large number of import options, domestic appliances have become less popular.  The opinion that they are much inferior in quality is fundamentally wrong. </p><p>  Inexpensive Biryusa refrigerators have been known since Soviet times, and they have proven themselves excellently.  They are characterized by low price, excellent functionality and reliability. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Biryusa refrigerator: characteristics" class="if uuid-2979208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2979208.jpg"></div><h2>  Product Description </h2><p>  The company was founded in 1963.  The name was borrowed from a tributary of the great Yenisei River.  The first production of Biryusa refrigerators at the plant in the city of Krasnoyarsk was a huge success.  Copies were collected for a year, but it was worth it.  The first issue of more than 300 thousand units was quickly sold out.  The plant worked successfully even during the crisis, the range was gradually expanded.  In addition to refrigerators, the company began to manufacture medical and commercial equipment.  The configuration and design of the devices are constantly changing. </p><p>  Today, not only ordinary refrigerators are made, but also wine cabinets, coolers for changing the temperature of water, ice makers, chest freezers and some other devices.  In sales, the company is among the top three leaders in the territory of the Russian Federation.  Goods are also exported to Kazakhstan, Belarus and some other CIS countries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="btest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Biryusa-129" class="if uuid-2979204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2979204.jpg"></div><h2>  The advantages of refrigerators </h2><p>  Reviews of Biryusa refrigerators have more positive points than negative ones.
