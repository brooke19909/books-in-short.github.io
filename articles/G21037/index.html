    <p>  If the employer who issued the certificate indicated inaccurate information, he is obliged to reimburse the amount of the excessively paid benefits. </p><p>  If the employee has provided a false certificate, then the amounts paid on the certificates of incapacity for work are withheld. </p><h2>  Help 182n: "maternity" </h2><p>  The employee, while on maternity leave, worked a shortened working day.  Then, in the certificate 182n in section 3, the amount of cash compensation is indicated, which was included in the base taxed by insurance premiums.  Section 4 indicates the number of days (calendar) during which she was on maternity leave, caring for a child (despite the fact that she was working on a shorter working day at that time). </p><p>  To pay sick leave for pregnancy and childbirth and to accrue benefits for caring for a child up to 1.5 years old, a woman has the right to replace the two years preceding the onset of these insured events with other years where earnings were higher.  Reference 182n must be issued in the form currently applicable.  Moreover, the maximum amount should not exceed the base for the present. </p><p>  Attention: if the organization is liquidated, then workers on maternity leave must be issued with a certificate of earnings for twelve calendar months before the month of dismissal during the decree (month of the onset of maternity leave).  The allowance in this case is calculated from the average daily earnings calculated as follows: earnings for twelve months are divided by 29.3 and by 12 (as for regular vacation pay). </p><p>  There is no approved form for such a certificate.  The accountant must compose it in any form.  The certificate should indicate the income for the months that participate in the base for calculating vacation pay, not benefits. </p><h2>  Help 182n: nuances </h2><p>  If the organization pays contributions to the Social Insurance Fund at a zero rate, then the certificate still indicates the amounts included in the base for paying contributions (even if they are zero). </p><p>  If an employee submitted instead of the original a copy of certificate 182n from another employer, then such a certificate of income cannot be used to calculate claims for insurance claims.  A copy of the document must be certified in the prescribed manner. </p><p>  The certificate for sick leave 182n is not issued to employees working under civil service contracts.  No insurance premiums are paid on social <span>security</span> payments under social <span>security agreements</span> .  The ‚ÄúContract‚Äù is not an insured person, the paid sick leave is not due to him. </p><p>  Section 4 of certificate 182n is filled out only if the employee had paid sick leave, maternity leave, childcare for one and a half years, exemption from work while retaining wages (if insurance contributions to the Social Insurance Fund were not charged on it). </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The wage certificate 182n is an important document.  The employer must take full responsibility to fill it.  The organization is responsible for false information in the certificate.  And also timely payment of sick leave to a former employee depends on the correctness of filling and timeliness of issuing a certificate. </p>
