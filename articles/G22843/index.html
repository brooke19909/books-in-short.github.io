Together with the first people, upbringing appeared, however, the science of this <span>process of personality formation</span> was formed much later.  The root cause of any scientific branch is called vital needs.  When it became necessary to generalize the educational experience and create special educational institutions for the preparation of the younger generation, pedagogy began to take shape as a separate area.  This meant the intensification of the process of isolating the theoretical principles of preparing children for independent life in society.  At first, maximum importance was given to raising children only in the most developed states ‚Äî China, Greece, Egypt, and India. </p><p>  Soon, it was also possible to find that society is developing more slowly or faster, depending on what level in it is the upbringing of the younger generation. </p>

    <h2>  Invaluable contribution.  Antiquity </h2><p>  The philosophy of the ancient Greeks is called the cradle of all European educational systems.  Her brightest representative is Democritus.  He pointed to the similarity of education and nature, arguing that education restructures the individual, thereby transforming the world around him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The science of pedagogy was further developed thanks to the works of Socrates, Aristotle and Plato.  They were engaged in the development of the most important ideas and provisions related to the formation of personality. </p><p>  The fruit of Greco-Roman pedagogical thought was the work "Education of the speaker."  Its author is Marc Fabius Quintilian, an ancient Roman philosopher. </p><h2>  Middle Ages </h2><p>  During this period, the Church was engaged in the monopolization of the spiritual life of society and the direction of education in an exclusively religious direction.  The development of pedagogy was far from the pace as in Antiquity.  The centuries-old consolidation of the unshakable principles of dogmatic education, which existed in Europe for almost twelve centuries, was observed.  <span>The pedagogical theory</span> practically did not develop, even despite the efforts of such enlightened philosophers as Augustine, Tertullian, and Aquinas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="science pedagogy" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/455672.jpg" width="423"></div>

    <h2>  Renaissance </h2><p>  This time is characterized as much more favorable for the development of pedagogy than the Middle Ages.  It is marked by the activities of a number of humanist educators - Francois Rabelais, <span>Erasmus of Rotterdam,</span> Vittorino da Feltre, Michel Montaigne and others. </p><p>  The science of pedagogy was separated from philosophy thanks to the works of Jan Amos Comenius (Czech Republic).  The result of his work - ‚ÄúThe Great Didactics‚Äù - is one of the first scientific and pedagogical works.  An invaluable contribution to the development of this science was made by John Locke.  In "Thoughts on Education", he expressed his opinion about the cultivation of a real gentleman - a man who is confident in himself and able to combine excellent education with business qualities, firmness of conviction and grace of manners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of pedagogy" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/455673.jpg" width="600"></div>

Thanks to him, a real revolution took place in the theory and practice of the science in question.  He noted that the purpose of education is to prepare for the work of life, and not for happiness. </p><p>  An important influence on the development of pedagogy was provided by Edward Thorndike and John Dewey, Maria Montessori and <span>Benjamin Spock,</span> Krupskaya and Wentzel, Makarenko and Sukhomlinsky, as well as Danilov. </p><h2>  Current state of affairs </h2><p>  In recent decades, significant successes have been achieved in a number of areas of pedagogy, and primarily in the work on new technologies for preschool and primary school education.  High-quality specialized computer programs help to manage the educational process and, therefore, achieve high results with less energy and time. </p><p>  Modern pedagogy was marked by active work on the creation of copyright schools, research and production complexes and experimental sites.  Education and training is based on humanistic, personality-oriented principles.  Nevertheless, pedagogy is a science that so far does not have a single common view on how to work with the younger generation.  For centuries, two completely different approaches have coexisted.  According to the first, children must be brought up in obedience and fear.  According to the second - with affection and kindness.  Moreover, if one of the approaches had been categorically rejected by life itself, then it would simply cease to exist.  In this situation, the main problems of pedagogy are manifested, and an exact answer to the question of what to do has not yet been found.  Sometimes the maximum benefit to society is brought by people brought up according to strict rules, and sometimes - intelligent, gentle and kind.  Moreover, the authoritarian method of working with children has a clear scientific justification.  According to I.F.  Herbart, children from birth inherent in "wild playfulness", which is why education only in severity can lead to real results.  The main methods he called threats, punishments, prohibitions and supervision. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="social pedagogy" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/455674.jpg" width="304"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The protest against this kind of impact on the personality was the theory of free education.  Its author is J.Zh.  Russo.  Jean Jacques himself and his followers advocated respect for children and stimulate the process of their natural development.  Thus, a new direction was formed - humanistic pedagogy.  This is a system of <span>scientific theories.</span>  It assigns the pupils the role of equal, conscious and active participants in the educational process. </p><p>  How to determine the degree of humanization of the educational process?  It depends on how fully prerequisites for self-realization of the individual are provided. </p><h2>  Fundamentals of pedagogy.  The selection of the object, subject, tasks and functions of science </h2><p>  The object of pedagogy is an individual who develops in the course of educational relations.  Researchers have not reached a consensus on what is the subject of this science.  Here are the opinions of different authors: the subject of pedagogy is the education of the individual as a special function of society (Kharlamov);  the system of objective laws of a specific historical process of education (Likhachev);  upbringing, training, education, creative development and socialization of an individual (Andreev). </p><h2>  Sources of the development of science </h2><p>  - Experience based on the centuries-old practice of education, secured by lifestyle, traditions, customs. </p><p>  - Proceedings of philosophers, social scientists, psychologists and educators. </p><p>  - The principles of the current practice of education. </p><p>  - Data obtained through specially organized research. </p><p>  - The experience of innovative educators developing original educational systems and ideas. </p><h2>  Tasks </h2><p>  The science in question is intended to facilitate research in order to increase the stock of developments, discoveries and designing models of educational systems.  These are scientific tasks.  As for the practical ones, among them are the <span>education and upbringing of</span> schoolchildren.  In addition, tasks are divided into temporary and permanent.  The first include the organization of libraries of electronic textbooks, the work on the standards of pedagogical professionalism, the identification of the main stress factors in the teacher‚Äôs activities, the development of a didactic base for teaching people with poor health, the development of innovative technologies for training future teachers, etc.  Among the permanent tasks are the following: identification of patterns in the field of training, education, education, management of educational and educational systems;  the study of the experience of pedagogical activity;  work on new methods, forms, means, systems of education and training;  forecasting transformations in the educational process in the near and distant future;  implementation of the results obtained in the course of research into practice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="general pedagogy" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/455676.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <h2>  Functions </h2><p>  Pedagogy is a science, thanks to which the implementation of all educational and educational functions at the technological and theoretical levels is ensured.  Consider the functions of the theoretical level: </p><p>  - Explanatory.  It consists in the description of pedagogical facts, phenomena, processes, as well as in explaining under what conditions and why the processes of education proceed in this way and not otherwise. </p><p>  - Diagnostic.  It consists in establishing the state of certain pedagogical phenomena, the effectiveness of the teacher and students, as well as in determining the reasons for success. </p><p>  - Predictive.  It consists in evidence-based prediction of the development of teaching and educational activities, including both theoretical and practical elements. </p><p>  As for the technological level, it involves the implementation of the following functions: </p><p>  - Projective, related to the development of the methodological base (manuals, recommendations, plans, programs). </p><p>  - A transformative one, aimed at introducing the achievements of pedagogy into educational and educational practice with the aim of improving and transforming it. </p><p>  - Reflective and corrective, suggesting an assessment of the impact of research on pedagogical practice. </p><p>  - Educational and educational, implemented through education, training and personal development. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="psychology in pedagogy" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/455677.jpg" width="539"></div>

    <h2>  Basic rules and principles of pedagogy </h2><p>  Science can be called mature only when it maximally reveals the essence of the phenomena considered by it and is able to predict transformations in the sphere of both phenomena and essence. </p><p>  Under the phenomena mean specific events, processes or properties that express the external sides of reality and are a form of manifestation of a certain entity.  The latter, in turn, consists of a combination of relationships, deep connections and internal laws that establish the characteristic features and directions of development of material systems. </p><p>  Without a theoretical analysis of the principles, rules and laws of pedagogy, it is not possible to organize an effective educational and upbringing practice.  Currently, the following laws of the science in question are distinguished: </p><p>  - The unity and integrity of the pedagogical process. </p><p>  - The relationship of theoretical and practical components. </p><p>  - Developing and educational training. </p><p>  - Social orientation goals. </p><p>  As stated by V.I.  Andreev, the pedagogical principle is one of the scientific categories that acts as a basic normative position, based on established laws and characterizing the methodology for solving pedagogical problems of a particular class.  According to P.I.  To the fiddler, the pedagogical principle is the main guiding principle, which implies a sequence of actions in the meaning of constancy, not priority. </p><p>  - <span>The principle of</span> individual <span>consciousness and activity</span> in the learning process is based on the realization that the learning process will be effective with the active participation of students in cognitive activity. </p><p>  - The principle of systematic training is based on a certain system of teaching and mastering knowledge, which structures materials based on cause and effect and generic relationships from the standpoint of highlighting the private and the general. </p><p>  - Adhering to the principle of consistency, teachers provide the dynamics of the progress of students' thoughts from known to unknown, from simple to complex, etc. </p><p>  - According to the <span>principle of accessibility of</span> training, the selection of didactic materials is based on the optimal ratio of amusement and complexity, as well as information about the age of students and the level of their practical and mental actions. </p><p>  - According to the principle of science, the content of the materials studied should familiarize with theories, objective facts, laws. </p><p>  Pedagogy rules - guidelines regarding specific issues of training and education.  Following them ensures the formation of the most optimal tactics of action and stimulates the effectiveness of solving various types of pedagogical tasks. </p><p>  A separate pedagogical rule can be called valuable if it is properly combined with others that obey one or another principle.  For example, in order to implement the principle of activity and consciousness, the teacher is recommended to adhere to the following rules: </p><p>  - pay attention to the explanation of the goals and objectives of the upcoming activities; </p><p>  - engage in the formation of students' motives and rely on their interests; </p><p>  - appeal to the intuition and life experience of students; </p><p>  - use visual examples to illustrate new material; </p><p>  - make sure that every word is understood. </p><p>  Pedagogical values ‚Äã‚Äãare the norms governing the activities of teachers and appearing in the form of a cognitive system as a mediating and connecting link between the established worldview of society in the field of education and the work of a teacher.  They are formed historically and fixed as forms of social consciousness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pedagogy education" class="if" height="204" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/455678.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Sectors and sections </h2><p>  In the process of development, any science expands its theoretical base, receives new content and carries out internal differentiation of the most important areas of research.  And today the concept of "pedagogy" implies a whole system of sciences: </p><p>  - General pedagogy.  This discipline is basic.  She is engaged in the study of the basic laws of upbringing, and is developing the foundations of learning processes in educational institutions of all types.  This discipline consists of an introduction to pedagogical activity, general principles, didactics, the theory of management of educational systems, methodology of pedagogy, philosophy and history of education. </p><p>  - Age pedagogy is aimed at studying the characteristics of the individual's upbringing at different age stages.  Depending on this characteristic, perinatal, nursery, pre-school pedagogy is distinguished, as well as secondary school, vocational and secondary education, higher school pedagogy, androgogy and third-age pedagogy. </p><p>  - Special pedagogy is developing theoretical foundations, principles, methods, forms and means of education and upbringing of individuals with impaired physical and mental development.  Its composition includes such sections as deaf, typhoid, oligophrenopedagogy and speech therapy. </p><p>  - Thanks to professional pedagogy, a theoretical substantiation and development of the principles of education and upbringing of a person employed in a specific field of labor are carried out.  Depending on a specific area, industrial, military, engineering, medical, sports and military pedagogy is distinguished. </p><p>  - Social pedagogy.  This discipline studies the laws of public education and training of children.  Social pedagogy includes practical and theoretical developments in the field of both extracurricular education and the education of children and adults. </p><p>  - The task of medical pedagogy is to develop a system of the educational process of classes with weakened or sick students. </p><p>  - Gender pedagogy is considering ways to create a comfortable environment for children in school and ways to solve the problems of socialization. </p><p>  - Ethnopedagogy reveals the patterns and characteristics of folk and ethnic education based on archaeological, ethnographic, ethnolinguistic and sociological methods. </p><p>  - Thanks to family pedagogy, a system of principles for the education and upbringing of children in the family is being developed. </p><p>  - The task of comparative pedagogy is to study the laws of development and functioning of educational and educational systems in different countries. </p><p>  - Corrective labor pedagogy at the theoretical level substantiates the options for re-education of persons in prison. </p><h2>  Strong relationship </h2><p>  Psychology in pedagogy is used to describe, interpret and organize facts.  In addition, the science in question is inextricably linked with physiology, since it is important to take into account the laws of vital activity of organisms to identify mechanisms for controlling the mental and physical development of students.  The most complex relationship has been established between pedagogy and economics.  The latter is able to influence the development of education of society.  Moreover, a system of economic measures can have an activating or inhibitory effect on the demand for new knowledge, and this is also taken into account by pedagogy.  Education as a system constantly needs economic stimulation. </p><h2>  Stable position </h2><p>  Currently, no one seeks to question the scientific status of pedagogy.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is universally recognized that its goal is to learn the laws of upbringing teaching and human education in order to determine on this basis the best ways to achieve the goals of teaching practice. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to most researchers, this science in a standard way consists of a theoretical part (axioms, principles, laws, topics on pedagogy) and a practical part (technology, techniques, methods).</font></font></p><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Research institutes </font></font></h2><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Russia, the development of pedagogy has long been given increased attention. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order to improve this science, two research institutes were opened in the USSR back in the USSR. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first lasted from 1924 to 1939. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the State Institute of Scientific Pedagogy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was located on the Fontanka embankment.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Research Institute of Pedagogy, formed in 1948, was engaged in the consideration of history and theory, as well as teaching methods. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 1969, he was transformed into the Institute of General Adult Education.</font></font></p><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Parting words to teachers </font></font></h2><p> The humanistic parameters of educational activity are what modern pedagogy is based on.  Topics of scientific research conducted in this area are designed to help teachers record the differences between the essential and the proper, the reality and the ideal.  A modern teacher should strive to bridge these gaps and improve, to form a clear ideological self-determination in order to effectively transfer knowledge to students and successful educational work. </p>
