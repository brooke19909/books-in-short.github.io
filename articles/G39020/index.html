People are trying to find real help in case of illegal withdrawals.  In Russia, this issue is regulated by Federal Law No. 161 ‚ÄúOn the National Payment System‚Äù.  It has been operating since 2011.  But the most important points came into force only in 2014.  The law describes the algorithm of actions in case you have withdrawn money from the card (Sberbank).  What to do first and <span>to whom to turn for help?</span> </p><h2>  Types of fraudulent transactions </h2><p>  If you briefly describe the essence of the law, then banks should increase the level of protection of customers' cash.  For a long time, this issue was not given due attention.  Banks entered into the contract a phrase stating that the customer is responsible for transactions performed using the PIN code.  Such cases still occur.  Many people keep a piece of paper with a PIN code in their wallet along with the card itself.  This is a gross violation of security measures.  And if the money was withdrawn from the Sberbank card, then in such a situation they cannot be returned back. </p>

    <p>  But fraudsters can carry out their operations without even having a plastic carrier in their hands.  It is enough to find out all the details of the card and calmly withdraw money.  Today, there are such types of fraudulent transactions: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Skimming.  Attackers read data from the magnetic strip of the card and make its analogue.  They recognize the PIN code using keyboard overlays or mini-cameras.  Then make a duplicate and cash out the money. </li><li>  Phishing  A type of fraud, as a result of which fraudsters learn the username and password of users.  Criminals send out emails or SMS with a link to a malicious site.  By clicking on it, users provide attackers with all the data to access their personal account on the bank‚Äôs website. </li></ul><p>  Here's how to deduct money from a card. </p><h2>  Protection </h2><p>  Banks are still taking security measures to protect customer funds.  Over the past year, the number of issued cards with chips has increased significantly.  They are safer.  It‚Äôs more difficult to find a duplicate for them.  ATMs are equipped with special devices that prevent the possibility of installing readers.  And customers are constantly warned that the bank‚Äôs employees under no circumstances try to find out the PIN or CVV.  But there are still many cases of fraud. </p><h2>  Withdrew money from the card (Sberbank).  What to do? </h2><p>  To begin with, calm down and not panic.  Try to remember the last time you withdraw funds.  Perhaps the notification came late.  Or the transferred amount corresponds to the annual card service or payment for SMS-information services.  If it turns out that the money was stolen from the card, then you should be patient.  The refund procedure is very long and painstaking, but still effective. </p>

    <h2>  Step one </h2><p>  So, the client was withdrawn money from the card (Sberbank).  What to do first?  Block the plastic.  To do this, call the bank‚Äôs call center number.  It is indicated on the back of the card or in the contract.  In theory, the operator can find out the amount of account balance, as well as recent transactions.  As practice shows, such data appears only 2-3 days after the operation.  You can block the card at the bank branch.  But then you have to spend time on the road and sitting in line. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Second step </h2><p>  If from a conversation with an employee it turns out that the money was withdrawn from the card, then you need to immediately go to the office and write a statement contesting the transaction.  It should detail all the circumstances, attach the account statement, as well as other documents confirming the client‚Äôs non-involvement in the withdrawal of funds.  Before drawing up the application, you should read the contract with the bank.  It should contain a clause on contesting payments, an algorithm of actions and a procedure for resolving issues. </p>

    <h2>  Step three </h2><p>  If money is lost from the card, lawyers recommend writing a statement to the police.  Such actions should stir up the <span>bank's security service.</span>  In theory, the police should open a criminal case and, based on the application received, remove the video from the ATM registrar.  If the tenant‚Äôs identity could not be established, then this is proof that a third person took possession of the funds.  In practice, police officers must first send a request to the payee.  This process can be complicated if the recipient does not have a registration address.  <span>Law enforcement agencies</span> do not carry out email requests. </p><h2>  Fourth step </h2><p>  Be patient and wait.  If during the consideration of the paper additional facts become clear that may affect the result, then it is worth writing another statement.  In this case, the credit institution will have to send a turning request to the receiving bank for a refund. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stole money from the card" class="if" height="459" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/749985.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Fifth step </h2><p>  So, you have withdrawn money from the card (Sberbank).  What to do if the bank refused to refund?  Lawyers advise in this case to go to court.  If strong evidence is provided (for example, the client was in Moscow, and the money was withdrawn from the card from an ATM in St. Petersburg), then the victim can expect a refund. </p><h2>  A client has lost a Sberbank card: what to do? </h2><p>  The algorithm is the same as in the case of illegal debit.  First you need to block the card and contact the office for a new one.  The client can receive unused money in cash through a bank cash desk or transfer it to another account.  Theft is dangerous because attackers can use the CVV code and pay for services via the Internet.  On the reverse side of almost all types of plastic cards there is a white strip for the owner‚Äôs signature and 7 digits.  The first 4 is part of the number, and the next 3 is the CVV (CVV2) code.  It is a kind of PIN code for transactions carried out over the Internet.  This code may not be indicated only on <span>Visa Electron</span> and MasterCard Maestro.  These are the cheapest plastic cards that apply only within one country.  So, the client <span>lost the card of Sberbank.</span>  <span>What to do</span> next?  It would be useful to write a <span>statement to the police.</span>  Perhaps the loss will be found and returned to the owner. </p>

    <p>  The situation when the Sberbank card was demagnetized is no less problematic.  What to do in this case?  Block the old one immediately.  A card can be demagnetized only if the client constantly uses it: often it is pulled out and put into a pocket, wallet or bag.  To withdraw funds from an ATM using such a plastic medium will not work.  But in case of his loss or theft, the fraudster will be able to pay for goods via the Internet.  In such situations, banks do not send SMS with a payment password, but only inform the client about the fact of debiting funds. </p><h2>  The law is in a hurry to help </h2><p>  The amendments to Federal Law No. 161 that have come into force oblige credit institutions to return stolen funds, provided that the bank cannot prove that the client has violated the rules for using a <span>bank card.</span>  Here you need to pay attention to such a nuance.  The credit institution is obliged to reimburse the funds if the client reports that they have withdrawn money from the Sberbank card no later than the next day after receiving a notification from the transaction from the operator.  In case of violation of the specified period, the bank is not liable for the transfer.  From this point of view, the client should also use the evidence base.  After talking with the operator by phone, you should send an email to the bank, indicating in it the reason for the appeal, the exact amount of funds debited, the fact of prior notification of the operator. </p><p>  The percentage of dishonest cardholders is high.  Banks perceive the new law with hostility.  Institutions are forced to expand the security staff.  Paying for qualified IT professionals is expensive.  Banks sound the alarm, suffer losses and try to find a way out of the situation. </p>

    <p>  The law says that a credit institution is obliged to notify the client of the write-off of funds.  But it is not specified exactly how, and how much this service should cost.  That is, even an email message from the bank about the fact of the transaction may become such a notification.  Using this trick, many banks raised the cost of SMS messages, which are the fastest way to find out about the fact of debiting funds. </p><p>  Another point worth paying attention to.  If the operation to transfer funds was carried out without the participation of the client, and the bank did not notify the cardholder about it, then he is obliged to reimburse the entire amount spent. </p><p>  At the same time, the law has a wording that can be interpreted in two ways.  It says that the bank is not responsible for transactions, if it proves that the client has violated the rules for using electronic means of payment.  This can include anything you want, including storing the card in the refrigerator. </p><h2>  Nine Ways to Secure Money </h2><ul><li>  Withdraw cash only at bank offices.  There are cameras everywhere.  Attackers will not be able to quietly install a reader on the ATM. </li><li>  Record the bank‚Äôs call-center phone on your mobile.  If you lose your card, call this number immediately. </li><li>  If you can‚Äôt remember the PIN code, store it in the phone‚Äôs memory under a code name. </li><li>  Set an SMS alert to instantly know about all movements of funds on the card. </li><li>  Pay for services only through trusted sites.  Their browser line should start like this: https: //. </li><li>  Never tell anyone the PIN and CVV code of the card. </li><li>  The login and password from your personal account on the bank's website should not be stored in electronic form. </li><li>  For all questions about the illegal withdrawal of funds from the card, you should call the number indicated on the card, and not in SMS. </li><li>  Keep fixed assets in a separate account, and transfer only money for current expenses to the card. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Although banks are taking steps to protect customer funds, fraudsters still have several ways to withdraw money from the card.  In recent years, this type of operation has become very popular as phishing - sending messages with a link to a malicious site.  By clicking on it, the client provides the fraudsters with a password and login from the account on the bank's website.  Having received these details, the attacker will be able to use other people's means.  To prove the illegality of operations is quite difficult.  No less problems arise if a Sberbank card is stolen.  What to do in this case?  Block the payment instrument, order the release of a new one and apply for protest of the last transaction. </p>
