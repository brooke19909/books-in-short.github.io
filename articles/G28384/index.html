    <p>  On the beach you can rent a sunbed for the whole day.  True, the local sun loungers are thick rubber mattresses, which are usually put on the sunbed itself.  Here they are placed simply in the sand.  The beach is clean enough, albeit municipal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ramada Phuket Southsea 4 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to pay attention to the reviews of tourists who managed to visit it.  Indeed, thanks to them, we can get a more realistic description of the complex.  The Ramada Phuket Southsea Hotel (photos are in the article) has an incredibly convenient location, which is confirmed by all its guests.  It is located on the first line from the coast, so the road to the beach takes a couple of minutes.  In addition, the complex is built on the main street of Karon resort.  Therefore, all the best cafes, restaurants, the market, pharmacies and other institutions are located here.  On the same street is a beautiful temple, which is certainly worth a visit.  Such a convenient location in no way affects the quality of rest of the guests, as the hotel is away from city noise and bustle in a fairly quiet place.  According to tourists, not every institution can boast of such a favorable location as Ramada Phuket Southsea (reviews confirm this).  Leaving the hotel at any time of the day, guests find themselves in the very center of events, and you need to walk no more than five minutes to the nearest entertainment. </p><h2>  Hotel room reviews </h2><p>  How are things going with the Ramada Phuket Southsea?  Reviews of tourists regarding the rooms are mixed.  Not all guests are satisfied with their interior decoration, noting that the apartments need fresh repairs and updating of furniture, which has signs of scuffs. </p><p>  Otherwise, a good set of rooms makes your stay in the hotel comfortable and enjoyable.  Despite the fact that the hotel has not been updated for a long time, it is maintained in good condition.  The cleanliness of the apartments and the quality of cleaning satisfy even demanding tourists.  Tourists note that Thais, with their usual leisurelyness, clean and tidy rooms after dinner, which is not convenient for all guests, since young children should sleep at this time.  Every day, the staff leaves a half liter bottle of water for each guest.  Very often, maids forget to replenish their supplies of detergents or put clean beach towels.  But after a reminder, everything needed appears in the room.  In general, the staff is very attentive, helpful and responds to any request. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ramada phuket southsea 4 phuket karon" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1716199.jpg" width="599"></div>

    <p>  According to the guests, the tip left does not in any way affect the speed and quality of cleaning.  In case of breakdowns or malfunctions in the rooms, you must leave a request for a reception, after which all the shortcomings are eliminated quickly enough. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  As a rule, the issue of nutrition causes a lot of controversy among tourists.  Ramada Southsea <span>(Karon Beach, Phuket)</span> was no exception <span>.</span>  The complaints of some tourists are caused by the insufficient variety of dishes on the buffet during breakfast.  Is it really so difficult to judge, since many remain fully satisfied not only with the range of dishes, but also with their quality.  In the mornings, the restaurant chef offers to taste European and Thai food: fruits, omelets, scrambled eggs, snacks, vegetables, cereals.  In general, breakfasts are represented by a standard set of products with the addition of national Thai dishes. </p><p>  For lunch and dinner, the restaurant offers √† la carte dishes, among which you can look for something suitable. </p><p>  In the immediate vicinity of the hotel there are numerous cafes and restaurants offering a wide variety of food.  Even if you are a fan of Thai dishes, you can always find places with European and even Russian cuisine.  Central Street (Karon) is rich in all kinds of cafes, among which you can find the most expensive and very democratic establishments. </p><p>  In addition to the main restaurant, the hotel has a cafe and poolside bar.  During the day, they offer guests refreshment with pleasant cold drinks and cocktails, as well as a snack.  Within walking distance from the hotel there is a market selling fresh fruits and other products.  In general, there are no problems with food in Ramada Phuket Southsea 4 * (Phuket, Karon Beach).  Each guest has the opportunity to appreciate the advantages of the cuisine of the local restaurant and the nearest establishments in order to determine their preferences. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Ramada Phuket Southsea Hotel (described in the article) has a developed infrastructure, thanks to which tourists are provided with all the most necessary things for a vacation.  In the complex you can not only have a good time relaxing by the pool, but also visit the spa and gym.  On the ground floor, the reception has even a small library. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ramada phuket southsea reviews" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1716200.jpg" width="564"></div>

    <p>  The hotel staff deserves special attention.  If there are minor flaws in the hotel, then all of them are compensated by friendly workers who help guests in resolving any issues.  Arrival in the room upon arrival is fast enough and even before the appointed time.  One hundred dollars are taken as a deposit at the reception, which are then returned during your departure. </p><p>  In Ramada Phuket Southsea (Thailand) there is absolutely no animation, as in other hotels in Thailand.  Therefore, if you are a supporter of active entertainment, then you have to organize it yourself, since the center of all parties in the Karon district is located within a five-minute walk. </p><p>  The hotel, as we mentioned, has a small pool with a children's area and a jacuzzi.  It is noteworthy that the reservoir is located between the two buildings, so the guests living on the first floor have their own access to it.  The pool is cleaned and changed daily.  Near it there is also a shower and a bar.  Despite all the advantages of the reservoir, there are practically no people near it, which is understandable.  There is a beautiful sea near the hotel, so everyone wants to spend more time on its coast.  The hotel area is small, but at the same time neat and well-groomed. </p><p>  The restaurant has an outdoor terrace with sea views.  Having breakfast on it in the morning to the sound of the sea is a real pleasure.  In general, Ramada Phuket Southsea 4 * (Thailand, Phuket, Karon) makes the most pleasant impression.  Numerous positive reviews confirm this.  The hotel has its own small, but cozy territory, some kind of homely atmosphere.  There is no sensation of crowd and noise.  According to tourists, the Ramada Phuket Southsea 4 * hotel was created for a quiet relaxing holiday for those people who want to stay in silence.  The main contingent of tourists is couples with children and senior citizens.  Fans of noisy parties and nightlife, apparently prefer more noisy establishments. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  Ramada Phuket Southsea Hotel (article reviews from tourists) is located in the heart of Karon, next to the beach of the same name.  According to guests, the location of the complex can be attributed to one of the best institutions in the area.  The famous beach is located across the street from the hotel, which is incredibly convenient.  Getting to the sea will not be difficult for either children or the elderly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Ramada Phuket Southsea Description" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1716201.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <p>  Karon Beach, as you know, is considered one of the most calm and not crowded in Phuket, for which tourists appreciate it.  The infinitely long and wide coast is covered with clean white sand, which will pleasantly hold under your feet.  On the beach area for hotel guests is fenced off with special tags.  According to tourists, the sea periodically there is excitement.  And during periods of calm, the water becomes clean and transparent.  But the underwater world is not at all interesting; here you will not find an abundance of underwater inhabitants. </p><p>  Karon Beach is one of the largest beaches in Phukta.  And the presence of numerous expensive hotels near it obliges the coast to be more comfortable and clean.  Many beaches in Phuket are located in the bays.  But Karon Beach is a completely open coast.  It is for this reason that there are waves. </p><p>  If desired, guests can visit the no less famous, but more crowded Patong Beach, a ten-minute drive from the hotel.  The hotel provides a free shuttle service three times a week (Friday, Saturday and Sunday).  At other times, tourists can take a taxi or rent a tuk-tuk.  In the hotel at the reception you can rent a moped.  Having your own transport makes it much easier to move around the resort and makes it possible to independently visit the nearest attractions.  Therefore, experienced tourists recommend taking this opportunity. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Phuket is a terrific resort where all categories of tourists will find classes to their liking.  It is no secret that a significant part of vacationers come here every year precisely in search of nightly entertainment and active parties. </p><p>  The island has an incredible number of diving centers, schools and rental equipment for diving.  Here you can go through not only the basics of diving, but also improve your level, as well as make a fascinating dive into the waters of the Andaman Sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel ramada phuket southsea photos" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1716202.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <p>  The endless sandy beaches of the island are certainly beautiful, but the resort is of interest not only for beach holidays.  Phuket has such a huge number of interesting places and attractions that it is simply impossible to see all of them during a two-week vacation.  And this means that you will always have a reason to return to the resort again. </p><h2>  Phuket Attractions </h2><p>  Tourists who are not ardent fans of diving, but still have a desire to see the underwater world and its inhabitants, can visit the famous Phuket Aquarium.  Although not very large, several hundred marine inhabitants and fish live in it.  The whole aquarium is divided into different sections.  In one of them, visitors can see clown fish and butterflies, known for the famous cartoon "Finding Nemo."  On weekends, aquarium workers arrange shows with feeding the inhabitants, among which there are predatory sharks.  The pride of the aquarium is the underwater tunnel, a walk through which is more like diving to the seabed.  A visit to this place will appeal not to adults, but to their children. </p><p>  The most famous landmark in Phuket is the statue of Big Buddha.  It is so huge that it is clearly visible from different parts of the island. </p><p>  A lotus statue sits on Mount Nakaked in Chalong and guards the temple.  Numerous believers come to worship the shrine.  And tourists come here to enjoy the stunning scenery from the observation deck.  The complex was conceived in the early twentieth century.  The place for its construction was chosen not only beautiful, but also shrouded in legends. </p><p>  No less interesting place for visiting tourists is the Botanical Garden.  It is deservedly recognized as one of the most impressive places on the island.  The garden was created not long ago, it has been working since 2012.  Currently, it occupies almost 10 hectares.  Its entire territory is decorated in the national Thai style, it is decorated with fountains, various decorative elements, artifacts and wood carvings.  Guests have the opportunity to see dozens of varieties of cacti, hundreds of plant species and unique palm trees.  And walks along the flowering alleys of the garden with ponds will bring great pleasure to nature lovers. </p><p>  Women who come to Phuket, as a rule, do not miss the opportunity to visit local farms that grow pearls.  The guides accompany the boat trip to the island of Nakha with a story about how the process of forming the real pearl occurs.  Farm workers not only demonstrate all stages of production, but also demonstrate their skills in making jewelry to guests.  Favorite pearl jewelry can be purchased at your local convenience store. </p><p>  Oddly enough, but among vacationers, a visit to a snake farm is especially popular.  On its territory you can watch an amazing show of pythons and royal cobras.  True, such a spectacle is not to everyone's taste.  During the show, trainers demonstrate all kinds of tricks with poisonous snakes. </p><p>  In Phuket, there are currently more than thirty Buddhist temples.  One of them is Wat Chalong.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is still not known exactly when it was built. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Legend has it that the temple is at least 150 years old. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Outwardly, the complex is more like a fairy-tale palace, consisting of several buildings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the main temple there are statues of three monks, but the entrance to it is closed to ordinary people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only monks can be in the building.</font></font></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ramada phuket southsea 4 reviews" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1716203.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <p> Tourists of all ages should visit the famous Sirinat Park, which is a favorite vacation spot not only for guests of the resort, but also for its residents.  The vast territory of the park covers almost eight thousand hectares.  There are three equipped beaches, as well as wild rainforests untouched by a human hand.  The park has built the island‚Äôs largest water park called the Jungle Splash.  The stunning water complex consists of a network of pools, extreme slides and attractions.  For active tourists, the park organizes trips through virgin mangroves.  Tourist routes pass through the most beautiful places. </p><p>  Another amazingly interesting place in Phuket is the entertainment complex "Fantasy".  A visit to this unusual place will be a real holiday for the whole family.  The park has numerous activities involving tropical animals.  In addition, the complex has numerous cafes and restaurants.  Unusual colorful shows await guests daily. </p><p>  Holidays on the island - this is the contemplation of seascapes and stunningly beautiful flowers, which the resort has an incredible amount.  The most common of these are orchids.  Fans of these plants have a unique opportunity to visit the Orchid Garden, in whose territory you can see 1,500 varieties of various shapes and colors. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, relying on numerous positive reviews from tourists, we can recommend the Ramada Phuket Southsea hotel for a comfortable stay.
