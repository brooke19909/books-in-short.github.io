The hotel is ideal for people who prefer a relaxing, economical vacation.  Konstantin offers tourists cozy rooms with modern interiors, furnished with pastel shades that reflect the Mediterranean style.  There are terraces and balconies with stunning views of the sea and the witching landscape. </p>

Even many children know that the country to which the island of Zakynthos belongs is Greece.  The hotels here are simply wonderful, and this even more captivates potential travelers.  In "Constantine", for example, there is everything that a modern tourist needs.  This is a parking lot, a shop, a jacuzzi in the central pool, free Internet, a conference room that seats about a hundred people.  There is also a restaurant, bar, currency exchange, safe.  On the beach you can take advantage of free umbrellas and sunbeds.

The hotel infrastructure is as follows: on the territory there is a beach hotel, parking, a restaurant and two bars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zakynthos Hotel Constantine" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/470295.jpg" width="600"></div>  Interestingly, some tourists before the trip try to learn at least a few basic phrases in Greek.  And it is right.  After all, it is no secret that the state to which the island of Zakynthos belongs is Greece.  The hotels are full of staff who speak English, but there are people who would like to have a good word with them in a local language.

    <h2>  Hotel Mimoza Beach </h2><p>  This hotel is very nice, comfortable and not crowded.  It is recommended primarily for people who would like more peace and quiet, rather than noisy entertainment.  There is a main building and a bungalow.  The first is a large modern building with many rooms of different comforts.  I would like to pay special attention to the bungalow.  They have two exits: one to the street, the second to the terrace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zakynthos Greece Hotels" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/470297.jpg" width="312"></div>  Plumbing works without interruption: there is hot water all day.  Air conditioning can be adjusted as you wish.  The room has everything you need to feel comfortable - a bed, a bedside table, a wardrobe, a TV, a refrigerator.  Shutters are installed on the windows and on the terrace door.

Mimoza Beach has very polite staff who will help solve any problem, find answers to all questions.  They will not refuse to fulfill even a request that is not part of the job responsibilities of the maintenance staff.  The bungalow is cleaned every day, towels are regularly changed.  The hotel is located in a wonderful place: cypresses, eucalyptus trees, pines, arborvitae, peaches and other trees and shrubs grow in the park, making the air fragrant with freshness.  Walking here is a pleasure.  Perhaps even the best hotels in Zakynthos can not be compared with Mimoza Beach.  Here, instead of the beach, in a certain sense of the word, there is a green lawn, and one and a half meters from it are sea waves.  Great, isn't it?  The sea is not very deep, it is notable for its sandy bottom and very clear water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zakynthos Island hotels" class="if" height="293" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/470296.jpg" width="590"></div>  The hotel is located near the capital, so if you want you can get to the city on foot.  There are many places where you can sit, eat, relax, listen to music.  This is a cafe, taverns, restaurants.  It is important that in Argassi there are many small tourist offices that organize excursions with guides who speak different languages.  So, for those who would like to find privacy, this hotel fits perfectly.  No one has regretted staying here.  However, not everyone has the opportunity to get into comfortable Zakynthos hotels.  4 stars, for example, is the choice of fairly wealthy people.  And tourists with a small income can not afford this.

    <h2>  Matilda is another great hotel </h2><p>  In a beautiful area of ‚Äã‚Äãresorts on the island of Zakynthos, called Vasilikos, Hotel Matilda is located.  It rises right in the center of the green grove.  Its location is very successful, since the distance to the city of Zakynthos from here is only 9 kilometers.  The hotel, located on the wonderful bay of Porto Zoro, is visible from afar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels of Zakynthos" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/470298.jpg" width="600"></div>  There are beaches of <span>indescribable beauty.</span>  Shops are just around the corner from the hotel.

    <h2>  Kitchen, services, pool </h2><p>  Renovation is carried out annually, so that the buildings and premises are in good condition.  The cuisine here is international and local, that is, for every taste.  It is very important that good conditions are created for children.  There is everything: a pool and a playground.  You can call the nanny.  Such employees are invited to many hotels in Zakynthos, because sometimes their help is simply necessary for vacationers.  There will be no problems with transport - you can rent a car, parking is located nearby.  As for the services, the hotel has an ATM, lobby (with satellite TV), laundry, safe.  There are conditions for water sports, you can go to the pools and slides.  Many tourists spend most of their time there.  The outdoor pool has umbrellas and sunbeds. </p><h2>  Varied leisure </h2><p>  To maintain beauty and health, you can choose a procedure such as massage.  Entertainment is varied, leisure activities are organized: dance evenings and yoga classes are offered, and bicycles are available for rent.  The national composition of tourists here is mixed.  The best vacation, of course, is on the seashore, which is about half a kilometer from the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zakynthos map" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/470300.jpg" width="448"></div>  A beach with warm sand invariably attracts tourists, there are always a lot of people here, but everyone has enough space on the shore.  Hotel Matilda can be recommended for families with children, as the rest here is quite calm.  And this is exactly what people who are tired of everyday worries need.  Zakynthos hotels allow you to forget about all the problems and immerse yourself in the fabulous world of the island.

    <h2>  Food and service </h2><p>  Matilda is not a very large hotel in size, located in a very picturesque place.  This attracts travelers.  Judging by the reviews, many are delighted with the menu, which is quite diverse, the dishes here are inexpensive.  So, the cost of lunch, for example, is about 20 euros, and the portions are large and tasty.  However, some are unhappy that there are practically no cafes or restaurants nearby where you could have a bite to eat and just have a good time.  People would like to visit such establishments, despite the fact that the hotel has excellent food.  The main language spoken by employees is English.  People who do not know him are advised to visit Zakynthos hotels with a phrasebook.  Indeed, sometimes it becomes necessary to ask a question to an employee.  Service at the hotel mainly meets the needs of vacationers, the staff is quite friendly, as elsewhere in the resorts. </p><h2>  The perfect place to relax </h2><p>  Internet here is free, but only at the pool and at the reception.  The rooms have good furniture - albeit not new, but everything is in order: the beds are comfortable, there are chairs and a table on the balcony, which makes for evening conversations.  And if the purpose of the trip is to forget about the hustle and bustle, enjoy the peace and quiet, relax and take a break from the city noise, just get enough sleep and, in the end, spend some money, then this hotel is like no other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4 star hotels in Zakynthos" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/470299.jpg" width="600"></div>  Everyone retains only the best memories of being in this place.  Zakynthos, whose map allows you not to get lost on the island, will forever remain in the hearts of those who have visited here once.  You involuntarily think about how lucky the locals of this island are, because they can admire the fantastic nature every day.  But for a tourist who comes here, for example, once a year, everything causes genuine delight.  Probably only for the sake of such vivid emotions and worth living.
