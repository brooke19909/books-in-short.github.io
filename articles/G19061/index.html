It occupies a worthy third place among the banking infrastructure in terms of the number of functioning offices.  The coverage of a wide geographical space - from Kaliningrad to Kamchatka - allows serving a mass of visitors in one working day.  Deposits, loans for various purposes and credit cards - these are products that the bank offers its customers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank Orient Express reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11501/30432.jpg" width="253"></div>

    <p>  Of course, these are dry statistics, and it’s much more interesting to find out what customers say about Vostochny Express Bank.  Reviews of any financial institution can be easily seen in various forums.  Currently, most citizens interested in obtaining services from banks are trying to find out most of the information not from an official source, but through communication with already held clients of the object of interest. </p><p>  What is the Orient Express <span>Bank?</span>  <span>Reviews</span> about him are very different ... </p><p>  After a little analysis, we can answer that, like any other bank, good and bad are said about it.  Let us consider the details that are important to us. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Positive feedback on Vostochny Express Bank concerns mainly rather high <span>interest rates on deposits</span> compared to other banks <span>.</span> </p><p>  As you know, from the onset of the global crisis, all financial institutions not only suspended the issuance of all types of loans, but also significantly reduced deposit rates.  The crisis is almost over, but the rates are rising very slowly and reluctantly .... </p>

    <p>  This omission on the part of financiers made up for the Orient Express Bank.  Customer reviews have become much better.  The right policy chosen by the board raised the rating!  Another plus is the quality service.  Of course, there is no such excitement as in Sberbank, each client is accepted as a "native".  Agree that this is an undeniable advantage! </p><p>  But what did the East Express Bank “offend” customers with?  Reviews left by disgruntled people suggest that there are negative aspects, mainly regarding the processing of loans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Orient Express Bank reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11501/32355.jpg" width="300"></div><br>  The most discussed issue is the presence of extremely important, but at first glance invisible details that “pop up” after the signing of the contract, and even much later.  I would like to note that most of the banks existing in the financial arena have such a "skeleton in the closet."  It’s just that customers, “delighted” with a positive response to a loan, most often do not pay attention to such things, which are subsequently blamed by banking institutions.  Therefore, it is better to carefully re-read the contract several times, especially what is written in small print - most often "the very salt" is there.

      <p></p>
    <p>  In addition, users of credit products note an increase in interest rates after the conclusion of the contract.  The moment is unpleasant, but not prohibited by law, so the claims in this case are inappropriate. </p><p>  In a word, which bank to contact and with whom to cooperate is a purely personal matter!  Orient Express <span>Bank, reviews</span> of which were analyzed in this article, can in principle be recommended.  Just be careful when signing documents, and then negative moments that cause distrust of customers and affect the reputation of banks will not arise! </p>
