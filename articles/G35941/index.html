    <p>  The buyer has the right to know that the product is presented on the domestic market by the Russian company Dialogue.  It is under its own brand that the manufacturer sells this acoustics in the territory of the post-Soviet countries, including partially the European market.  As for production, everything here is quite complicated: production is carried out at the factories of friendly China.  Naturally, quality control is carried out both at the plant and in each representative office of the Dialog company.  Here the user can be sure: marriage to the retail sale is not allowed. </p><h2>  Form factor and its features </h2><p>  It is better to start with the fact that the considered acoustics is classified as a system 2.1.  This means that in the kit for two stereo speakers there is one low-frequency speaker, called a subwoofer.  This form factor is considered the most acceptable both for office use and for installation in a residential building.  However, for such systems, there are a number of requirements that the future owner is guided by, who has looked after the very Dialog 2.1 W 3000: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  the material for the manufacture of the speaker enclosure and subwoofer (MDF or wood is a priority); </li><li>  frequency range (20-20 000 Hz); </li><li>  convenient management; </li><li>  the presence of a bass reflex; </li><li>  additional functionality. </li></ul><p>  Such requirements may seem strange to many readers, because we are talking about a budget product, the price of which does not exceed 4000 rubles, but even in this segment there is already a struggle among manufacturers who do everything for the sake of customers. </p><h2>  Acquaintance with the product and first impressions </h2><p>  A huge cardboard box of wood color is unlikely to surprise the buyer with anything.  Speakers Dialog W 3000 belong to the budget class, so the manufacturer‚Äôs prudence can be understood.  However, one does not need to think that the plant did not pay attention to protecting the acoustics from shock during transportation.  This is a complete order, because in addition to the columns, the user will find in the box a lot of foam plates. </p>

    <p>  As for the configuration, it is minimal: instructions for connecting and cables for connecting.  The user will not be able to detect any excess waste paper in the form of advertising brochures or quality certificates for an electronic device in the package.  In general, the impressions of the product at the initial stage of dating are positive.  Speakers without physical damage are equipped with all the necessary interface cables. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The right approach to the buyer </h2><p>  On the market, the user can meet several modifications of the device, which differ only in color.  So, you can choose the columns of steel, black or cherry shade.  Even experts believe that this is the right approach to a potential buyer on the part of the manufacturer.  After all, the acoustics of Dialog W 3000, the photo of which can be seen in our article, are easy to pick up even before purchase directly under the design of furniture in the room.  And this fact is no less important both for the office and living rooms. </p><p>  Taking this opportunity, I would like to note the fact that the color of the speakers does not affect the sound quality.  It is not known for what reasons many buyers believe that the case of the device is still wooden and the ‚Äúnut‚Äù sounds better than the ‚Äúoak‚Äù and ‚Äúcherry‚Äù.  In fact, the material MDF (compressed at high temperature sawdust with glue) is used the same for all acoustics.  And the color is responsible only for the paint, which covers the casing of the columns during production. </p><h2>  Appearance and build quality </h2><p>  <span>The speaker system</span> Dialog W 3000 is completely made of wood, or rather MDF, but this does not play a special role for customers who decide to purchase a good kit in a budget class.  The main thing is that there are no plastic elements.  As for the appearance, it is quite presentable - the speakers can be placed even in the most prominent place in any room, and they will look like decor elements.  By the way, neither the speakers nor the subwoofer have any stand in the form of legs.  Accordingly, the acoustics can be installed both vertically and horizontally, which is very convenient. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  But users have questions about the build quality, at least in the reviews of the owners there is a negative regarding some product elements.  There are no questions to the wooden case - gluing of MDF-plates is of high quality, but some elements of the columns have visible defects.  For example, there are barbs on the metal base of the speaker, and the power button is pressed hard due to skew. </p><h2>  Declared Specifications </h2><p>  You can not even look at the total peak power.  Most users are already versed in acoustics and understand what it is and how such small speakers can give out 1 kilowatt of power.  A potential buyer is only interested in RMS power.  Speakers Dialog W 3000 Black (and other colors) are able to give a total of no more than 55 watts.  It is an acceptable indicator for such a system, given that the power of the subwoofer is 25 watts, and the satellites give out 15 watts per channel. </p><p>  <span>The</span> manufacturer does not hide the <span>frequency range</span> , but rather, on the contrary, advertises.  True, for a budget class device, such data looks very suspicious, because only high-quality speakers can demonstrate 20-18 000 Hz.  It should be noted that the subwoofer is given a range of 20-250 Hz, and satellites - 100-18 000 Hz.  Also, the manufacturer announced the presence of magnetic shielding. </p><h2>  Control Panel </h2><p>  What the Dialog W 3000 Cherry speakers really lack (as well as other shades) is the wireless remote control.  As practice shows, it is this accessory that is most in demand among most users, judging by their reviews.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter how many functions the console performs, even if we are talking about one power button and three controls. </p><p>  In a <span>budget device,</span> as in more expensive products, an amplifier power protection system is implemented.  The manufacturer installed a power switch on the back of the subwoofer.  It is he who turns on the amplifier, or rather, supplies power to the control board.  On the front of the subwoofer there is a large <span>volume control</span> and two small controls for controlling frequencies. </p><p>  In terms of comfort, the Dialog W 3000 speakers have a very convenient volume control.  Using it is really easy to find an acceptable sound.  But frequency controllers, on the contrary, cause indignation among many owners. </p><h2>  Performance characteristics </h2><p>  Although large and heavy speakers are positioned as an acoustic system for home and office, however, many users, judging by their reviews, have a lot of questions to the manufacturer regarding convenience.  Satellites are not designed for wall mounting.  This is evidenced not only by the absence of slots for the mounting bracket, but also by the power button, which is located on the rear wall of the Dialog W 3000 speakers. Cable connections are also made only to the rear speaker panel. </p>

    <p>  In terms of amenities, the opinions of users differ here.  For most owners, the built-in power supply in the subwoofer enclosure is indeed a salvation that frees up a lot of free space on the desktop.  On the other hand, a power element in the form of a transformer near a woofer negatively affects the sound quality, distorting it. </p><h2>  Hidden Opportunities </h2><p>  The elegant plastic grille on the satellites not only protects the two Dialog W 3000 speakers from dust, but also from the eyes of the owner.  Not every user who knows a little about acoustics will be pleased to know that the speaker cones are made of paper.  This fact makes many owners think that such speakers are not just in the budget segment. </p><p>  By the way, lovers of order and cleanliness who move around the room with a wet rag to eliminate dust should be extremely careful when wiping diffusers: it is very easy to damage them.  Also, experts recommend that you do not disassemble glued columns unnecessarily.  Violating their performance is easy, but recovering without the appropriate experience is problematic. </p><h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  In fact, all acoustics are bought to listen to music.  This is no secret to anyone, so it's time to move on to testing the Dialog W 3000-2 system.  It‚Äôs better to start with the fact that this speaker system is universal and does not have a link directly to the sound card, as it is implemented with Sven, Creative, Microlab and other equally well-known brands.  This is a plus for all users who do not have at hand an expensive Hi-End device for playing music. </p><p>  So, the subwoofer.  The low-frequency speaker copes with the declared <span>frequency range</span> , however, even at medium volume settings, the device makes the table on which it is installed vibrate.  There is only one conclusion: if the user plans to listen to loud music, the subwoofer should only stand on the floor (on a carpet or laminate). </p>

    <p>  But the satellites of the device sound implausible.  Mid frequencies are not heard at all, and the highest threshold of the range is only 16 800 Hz.  Everything else is an unpleasant noise. </p><h2>  Easy hand movement </h2><p>  This is not all the information we would like to tell about the Dialog W 3000 speakers. The review continues.  Many enthusiasts noted that to achieve better playback quality is quite possible even at home.  As the practice of using Hi-Fi systems and 5.1-format acoustics shows, mid-range and high-frequency speakers should not be placed close to the user, but try to distance them by several meters, placing them at ear level. </p><p>  Yes, to fulfill such wishes you will need a place to install satellites, it is necessary to solve the problem with a short cable.  However, such a solution is worth the user's attention.  As for the subwoofer, nothing depends on the user here - the length of the low-frequency waves will not change, wherever this huge speaker is located.  Logically, it is better to put the subwoofer where it simply will not interfere with the user.  Naturally, this is only a floor installation. </p><h2>  Error handling </h2><p>  About the Dialog W 3000 speakers, user reviews begin with a proposal to replace the speakers built into the satellites with something more interesting.  In fact, there is no difference what kind of speakers the owner will install, the main thing is that they are suitable for power and have decent quality.  It is worth noting that such a substitution will be heard immediately, the sound of the reproduction of acoustics will be different. </p><p>  But the speaker of the subwoofer is better not to touch, it is excellent in operation and does not cause resentment from users.  Unless the removal of the transformer outside the low-frequency speaker enclosure is regarded positively by most owners, who have already noticed that the transformer is a little buzzing the first 15 minutes after turning it on. </p><h2>  Originality and convenience </h2><p>  The power indicator looks quite attractive from the outside - a blue laser is able to illuminate even a small room at night.  However, this decor quickly bothers the owners of the Dialog W 3000 Black speakers (the same applies to other colors), and they begin to look for ways to get rid of the bright display. </p><p>  There are many options for solving the problem, and all of them depend only on the desire of the user.  The easiest way to paint the LED.  You can do this with dark nail polish or a marker.  Glow at night will stop, but during the day the owner will contemplate the spoiled appearance of the speakers. </p>

    <p>  You don‚Äôt have to hurry with the sticker to close the LED: the power indicator is still a guarantee of safety, especially if there are small children in the house.  It‚Äôs better to use a soldering iron to install a less bright LED, which will not interfere with the user with its bright glow. </p><h2>  Elimination of all restrictions </h2><p>  For an ordinary undemanding user who plans to install Dialog W 3000 speakers on the desktop, the connection characteristics of the device will seem acceptable.  After all, you only need to connect the satellites to the subwoofer with an audio cable and connect the base to the computer.  It would seem that there are no problems.  However, in these very cables hides a lot of inconvenience. </p><p>  First, an RCA connector is used for interface cables, referred to by experts as nothing more than a ‚Äútulip‚Äù.  Naturally, the cable itself has a fixed length, which does not satisfy most users, judging by their reviews.  That is, due to the manufacturer‚Äôs greed, the user does not receive proper amenities. </p><p>  There is only one way to eliminate the problem.  Buy the cable of the desired length and connect the speakers correctly.  Alternatively, you can increase the wire with a soldering iron, but most experts do not recommend this, because changing the cable cross section can adversely affect the quality of sound transmission. </p><h2>  Problem amplifier </h2><p>  Like any other computer equipment, the speaker system is prone to breakdowns.  In this article, the reader is invited to get acquainted with the basic problems that the Dialog W 3000 may have. Failures primarily arise in the operation of the amplifier.  The blame for all is the poor-quality parts that the manufacturer installed at the factory, trying to reduce the cost of their products on the market. </p><p>  Cheap capacitors most often fail.  They simply inflate.  It is noteworthy that the speakers continue their work, however, the user will constantly hear a strange noise in the subwoofer, even at low volume. </p><p>  Also Dialog W 3000 is buzzing due to the failure of the diode bridge.  One of the 4 diodes burns out, and the amplifier begins to distort the sound very much.  In this case, the interference affects not only the subwoofer, but also the satellites, which begin to emit a high-frequency hum. </p><h2>  Problems with speakers </h2><p>  All users should not forget that any electronics, whether it is a TV, printer or speakers, is simply not designed to work in a humid room.  As mentioned earlier, the speaker cones are made of cardboard, which means they can quickly absorb moisture.  Of course, the speaker core will not vomit due to the high volume, but the playback quality will noticeably decrease for the Dialog W 3000 speakers. Faults of this kind can be solved in just one way.  Acoustics should be installed in a dry, ventilated area. </p><p>  Also, music lovers need to fight against dusting the speakers, especially if there are pets in the room.  Speakers, like vacuum cleaners, quickly attract debris and dust, and, accordingly, become clogged.  Fans of loud music are not recommended to install satellites on the subwoofer, as midrange frequencies may be distorted due to the interference of the woofer. </p><h2>  Negative user reviews </h2><p>  The most interesting thing is that it‚Äôs not so easy to find negative reviews on the Dialog W 3000 speakers.  Many users believe that you can‚Äôt complain about such an inexpensive product.  Indeed, initially, by acquiring a device worth 4000 rubles, a potential buyer a priori agrees to minor flaws that will certainly affect the ease of use.  The same short audio cable or a strange paper cone is a trifle that owners turn a blind eye to. </p>

    <p>  But what about the hum?  In fact, due to poor-quality components on the amplifier, all competitor products that are presented in a budget class have similar problems.  There are several solutions to problems: correct errors in the work as they appear or buy expensive speakers. </p><h2>  Advantages of the speakers </h2><p>  Convenience, compactness and design are the main criteria that users are guided by who do not understand the sound quality at all.  These people were just lucky to buy the Dialog W 3000 speakers, because in addition to their wishes they got quite high-quality and inexpensive acoustics.  But in fact, nothing more is needed. </p><p>  Touching upon the quality, it is worth noting that most owners appreciated the work of the woofer.  Even at maximum volume, it does not choke and does not wheeze, but shows very deep bass.  This is really a good indicator, because it is the subwoofer that is destined to stretch the sound of the entire composition when playing music.  But you should not get carried away with high frequencies, since tweeters can not cope with the task.  High-frequency speakers not only reduce the sound range, but also can reduce the playback quality. </p><h2>  Scope of use </h2><p> ,             .   ,   Dialog W 3000     . , ,        ,         ,       .        ,   :     . </p><p> But for apartment and house owners who want to purchase inexpensive acoustics for multimedia and entertainment, the product will be interesting, the main thing is not to forget that the subwoofer should only be on the floor.  Accordingly, no one bothers to purchase speakers and an office for joint professional use and entertainment. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  This is not to say that the Dialog W 3000 speakers can be safely called the best choice of a potential buyer in a budget class.  These are the usual 2.1 form factor columns.  Yes, they are cheap and look beautiful, but along with such advantages there are a number of disadvantages that the user will have to face during operation.  The main thing here is to find a compromise between need, quality and price.  After all, it is these three factors that determine the appropriateness of a purchase. </p>
