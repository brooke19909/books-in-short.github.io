This, in turn, explains the rather hectic nightlife of the resort. </p><p>  Recently, Sharm el-Sheikh is considered quite a popular destination among Russians.  And it is justified.  Here you can not only relax comfortably, but also go diving, go on excursions and just have a good time.  Nevertheless, not only young people are found among tourists, but also <span>couples</span> with children, as well as elderly people who come mainly from Europe and Russia. </p>

The resort has about two hundred hotels with different price levels.  Their infrastructure is somewhat different from the European level of service.

They are guaranteed to provide comfortable service, quality food and many other services that are not in hotels with less "star rating".  Among them, the five-star Experimental Kirosize Park Land, located in the Naami Bay area, is not the last one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  general information </h2><p>  This hotel was built in 2004.
