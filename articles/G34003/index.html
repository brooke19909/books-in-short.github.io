    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tourists with experience recommend visiting Morocco from early spring to autumn.  Tangier at this time is especially attractive. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Although Tangier is known to many as a beach resort, lovers of a secluded and relaxing holiday are unlikely to like it.  According to tourists, the city beaches of Tangier are very crowded and noisy.  If you want to sunbathe and swim in the sea with comfort, we recommend that you drive a little to the west of the city.  At the foot of the hills, there are wide sandy beaches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation tangier morocco reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1093152.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Scientists have not yet come to a single conclusion regarding the history of the origin of the pillars of Hercules.  But Greek mythology has its own opinion on this matter.  According to an ancient legend, the legendary Hercules (Hercules) created this natural monument, on the account of which there are many heroic acts.  Hercules, wandering the Earth, outlined the final point of his travels, which was supposed to indicate the edge of the Earth. </p><p>  Using the heroic power presented to him by the gods, Hercules struck a mountain, water poured into the formed channel.  So the ancient Greeks believed, the Strait of Gibraltar was formed.  And two rocks on its shores began to be called <span>Herculean pillars.</span> </p><p>  Both rocks are framed by deep caves.  In the Middle Ages they were visited by wealthy Europeans and had picnics in them.  Today, souvenir dealers have chosen them, because every day many tourists come to see this natural wonder. </p><p>  These caves, preserved from the Neolithic, attract archaeologists.  During excavations, many valuable artifacts were discovered here, for example, tools of ancient people. </p><h2>  Dar el Maksen Palace </h2><p>  Many interesting buildings are famous for Morocco.  Tangier has its own architectural and historical monument - the palace of Dar el Maksen.  A beautiful building is located in the old part of the city - Medina.  At its highest point stands a snow-white palace.  It was built in the 17th century, and originally belonged to the Sultan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights with the description of tangier morocco" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1093151.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The luxurious building, decorated with mosaics and other exquisite decorative elements, is made in the Arabic style.  This palace complex has a patio and numerous galleries.  Only two sultans of Morocco lived in this magnificent palace, then it became the residence of Pasha Tangier.  The halls of the palace make a great impression.  Their wooden ceilings are decorated with oriental wood carvings and colorful murals. </p><p>  The walls and floor are covered with bright mosaics.  The last reconstruction of the building took place in 1922, after which the museum began to work in it.  Today there are two of them - a museum of Moroccan art and a museum of archeology. </p><h2>  Grand Bazaar </h2><p>  Like many other <span>cities in Morocco,</span> Tangier is famous for its bazaars.  The largest and most popular of them is Gran Sokko.  It is located in the center of the Medina, not far from the Sidi Bou Abib Mosque with its pointed minarets. </p><p>  The Grand Bazaar is the most populous and noisy place in Tangier.  Each merchant tries to shout down his competitor, inviting buyers to his shop, offering tourists a variety of copper utensils, souvenirs.  The sounds of drums are carried around the market, the smells of delicious fried meat are intoxicating. </p><p>  The main thing in this place is not to get confused and be very attentive to your things.  Decide in advance what you want to buy at the Grand Bazaar.  Reject all other offers immediately.  Locals are well aware of the words "no" and "do not." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Morocco Tangier" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1093149.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you have made a choice, you can bargain.  Moroccans are a polite and friendly people - they are happy to give way to their customers a little in price.  And one more subtlety - the concept of "surrender" in the Moroccan markets does not exist. </p><h2>  Holidays in Tangier (Morocco): reviews </h2><p>  According to tourists vacationing in this city, their vacation did not disappoint.  Great hotels, excellent conditions for active pastime, a rich excursion program that allows you to get acquainted with the historical and cultural monuments of the city.

Nevertheless, this does not spoil the overall impression of the rest. </p>
