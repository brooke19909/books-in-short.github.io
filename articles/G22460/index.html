Many tourists advise paying special attention to the choice of a hotel where you will spend several days or even weeks of your overseas vacation.  After all, even if you consider yourself to be unpretentious people, you still should not underestimate the importance of comfort and service during your vacation.  Otherwise, your vacation experience may be far from expectations.  In order to help you draw up a more complete and closer to reality picture of Chanalai Flora Resort 4 * (Phuket, Kata Beach), we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized reviews of travelers from Russia recently staying at this hotel.  A little ahead of the events, we note that almost all tourists liked this hotel as a whole.  But we learn more about everything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chanalai flora resort 4 phuket kata" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1097242.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  The rooms of this hotel, our compatriots, judging by their comments, were mostly satisfied.  So, according to them, the apartments here are quite spacious, pleasantly decorated, comfortable and bright.  All rooms have a beautiful view.  Even if you don‚Äôt see the sea from your window, you can admire the beautiful orchard or pool.  So no one complained about the view from the apartment.  As for the equipment of the rooms, then, as guests note, there is everything you need here.  Furniture and appliances are in good condition, everything works without interruption.  If some kind of breakdown occurs, then after notifying the administrator at the reception, the problem will be fixed as soon as possible.  As a plus, guests note large and very comfortable beds, high-quality linens without any stains (which is sometimes found in other hotels), the availability in the rooms of a free electronic safe and a full set of personal hygiene products (ear sticks, <span>shower</span> caps <span>, gel for soul,</span> soap, shampoo, etc.).  In addition, tourists liked that the bathroom has both a shower and a bath.  As for the shortcomings, many travelers noted that they would like to be able to use the wireless Internet in the apartments.  Now free Wi-Fi at the hotel is available only at the reception. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chanalai flora resort 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1097241.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, according to them, they saw nothing wrong with that.  So, as our compatriots note, the maids at Chanalai Flora Resort 4 * (Thailand, Phuket, Kata Beach) do not always do their job well.  So, according to the guests, the floors in the rooms were not washed every day.  In addition, maids often forgot to replenish supplies of bath accessories and change towels.  By the way, former guests are advised to throw used towels on the floor.  Otherwise, the maids will simply stack them, even though they may be wet.  However, bed linen was changed a couple of times a week.  Guests of the hotel have no complaints about this point.  If you find that the maid forgot to bring something to you, then tell her directly (if you meet her) or inform the reception. </p><h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  Our compatriots considered the fact that even in case of an early arrival at the Canalai Flora Resort, in most cases, they will give you the room keys almost immediately.  So tourists will not need to wait a few hours to check in.  As for the day of departure, you should leave the occupied apartments before noon.  At the same time, if your departure from the hotel is planned only in the evening, you can extend the room for an additional fee or leave things for storage in the luggage room and continue your rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chanalai flora resort 4 thailand phuket kata" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1097240.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  In their reviews, many travelers, both from Russia and from other countries, note that they really liked the Canalai Flora Resort area.  According to them, although it is small, it is very green and beautiful.  There are many fruit trees, flowers, green lawns.  So on-site you can always stay in a picturesque place and relax from the bustle of the city. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Chanalai Flora Resort 4 * offers tourists, when booking, choose one of the options regarding food.  So, you can immediately pay for breakfast or refuse them.  Our compatriots advise those who want to save additional money to choose the second option.  In this case, you can buy, for example, sandwiches, fruits and coffee in a supermarket next door or from street vendors.  But if you decide to have breakfast at the hotel, you can do it for an additional fee (about 300 baht). </p><p>  As for lunches and dinners, the Canalai Flora guests preferred to eat in cafes, which in the vicinity of the hotel there are quite a lot.  According to tourists, here you can choose a variety of dishes for every taste and budget.  Also, travelers are advised not to be afraid to buy food at the mashinakh (mobile stalls) and in the markets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel chanalai flora resort 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1097243.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The indisputable advantage of this hotel, according to most tourists, is its proximity to the popular <span>Kata</span> Beach.  You can get to it from the Canalai Flora Resort in just five minutes.  The road passes through the city streets, so along the way you can buy fruits and other products, drinks or some other necessary things.  The beach itself is quite large, fine sand, clean.  Waves are rare here, so Kata is great for families with children.  In addition, experienced travelers are advised not to be lazy and at least a couple of times to walk to the nearby Kata Noi beach.  You can reach it in about 20 minutes.  The rest of the beaches of the island can be visited by reaching them by taxi or tuk-tuk. </p>
