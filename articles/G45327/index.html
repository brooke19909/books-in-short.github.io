Later, during the reign of Catherine II, she and the members of her government openly acted on the side of the Swedish bourgeoisie, as they were guarantors of the parliamentary state system that once existed in this country.  Such a policy was contrary to the plans of King Gustav III, who wanted to have full power and, in addition, with the help of military force to return the territories that had previously been withdrawn to Russia.  The conflict arose and served as the cause of the Russian-Swedish war of 1788-1790. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nl.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="King of Sweden Gustav III" class="if uuid-2532586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2532586.jpg"></div><h2>  Utopian plans of King Gustav </h2><p>  How exactly the <span>Swedish king</span> planned to implement his plans can be understood from archival materials stored in Stockholm.  First of all, Gustav III intended, having concentrated a significant contingent of ground forces in Finland, to pull the Russian army away from St. Petersburg and leave the Baltic coast without proper cover.  Then, taking the initiative in the sea in their hands, inflicting a crushing defeat on the Russian fleet and, blocking Kronstadt, throwing naval and ground forces into the capture of the Russian capital. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The beginning of hostilities </h2><p>  Taking advantage of the fact that a significant part of the Russian army was involved in the war with Turkey (1787-1791), on June 21, 1788, the Swedish king ordered his troops to cross the border and begin to bombard the Neyshlot fortress, located on the territory of Eastern Finland.  At the same time, he presented Catherine II with a series of deliberately unacceptable demands, in response to which the empress ordered the Swedish embassy to be sent from St. Petersburg.  Thus began the Russian-Swedish war of 1788-1790. </p><p>  Despite a significant numerical superiority of forces, the outbreak of hostilities for King Gustav III was extremely unsuccessful.  He failed to capture Neyshlot, and soon his pretty battered units were forced to leave Russia.  However, further the Swedes managed to win the land battles that took place in the Finnish cities of Valkial, Pardakoski and Kernikoski. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thoughtco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Empress Catherine II" class="if uuid-2532575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2532575.jpg"></div><h2>  The ratio of the naval forces of the belligerent powers </h2><p>  Encouraged by the success, the king began to develop military operations at sea.  He knew that the Russian fleet, which had long been in need of modernization, was significantly inferior in quality to its naval forces, but surpassed them in the number of ships.  In addition, all the most combat-ready ships were in the Russian-Turkish theater of operations, and therefore the Baltic squadron was extremely weakened.  Even before the start of the Swedish aggression, it was supposed to relocate the rest of the fleet to the Archipelago.  Fortunately, Gustav III did not know about this, and began military operations before the Kronstadt raid was empty. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The ratio of naval forces at that time was as follows: the Russians had 48 battleships and 26 frigates (all shabby and unsuitable for battle), the Swedes had 22 first-class battleships, 12 frigates and 145 rowing ships.  At the head of the Baltic squadron was an experienced naval commander, one of the heroes of the Catherine era - Admiral Vasily Yakovlevich Chichagov. </p><h2>  Hogland battle </h2><p>  The first major naval battle of the Russian-Swedish war of 1788-1790.  occurred July 17 in the Gulf of Finland, near the island of Hogland.  From the Russian side, 18 battleships participated in it against 16 Swedish ships, but the enemy had 7 more frigates.  On his side was a general numerical superiority in the guns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gogland Sea Battle" class="if uuid-2532606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2532606.jpg"></div><p>  According to the command plan, the Russian squadron was divided into three parts on the way to the battlefield, however, for several reasons, the rearguard (the group of ships that covered the main convoy from the rear) was seriously behind, and entered the battle with the Swedes very late.  Despite this, the rest of the ships, barely approaching the enemy at the distance of a cannon shot, opened fire.  The battle continued throughout the day, and luck alternately accompanied one side or the other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Convincing victory </h2><p>  Analysts believe that if the rearguard did not lag behind, the battle would have been won by the Russians in the initial period, since its belated appearance brought a decisive turning point in the course of events.  A few hastily retreating Swedish ships were sunk, while the rest were scattered within the bay.  The admiral ship "Prince Gustav" was able to capture as a combat trophy.  On that day, the commander of the Swedish squadron, Vice Admiral Wachtmeister, and 539 sailors and officers were captured by the Russian sailors.  The losses of the Baltic squadron were limited to one battleship Vladislav. </p><p>  For the heroism and courage shown in the Battle of Hogland, many officers and sailors were presented for awards, and the captains of the ships of the retarded rear guard - Baranov, Kokovtsev and Valrond - were put on trial, followed by demotion to sailors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tolyanmy.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Landic naval battle" class="if uuid-2532633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2532633.jpg"></div><h2>  √Öland and the First Rochensalm battle </h2><p>  In the future, all the main events of the Russian-Swedish war of 1788-1790.  also unfolding at sea.  The next striking episode in its history was the battle in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island of √ñland, which broke out on July 26, 1789.  In it, Russian Admiral V. Ya. Chichagov, who commanded a squadron of 25 ships, won a brilliant victory, forcing 37 enemy ships to retreat, some of which were sunk during the pursuit. </p><p>  After that, on August 24 of the same year, a battle broke out that went down in the history of the Russian-Swedish war of 1788-1790 as the First Rochensalmskoe (ten months later, guns rattled there again).  According to preserved information, a squadron of 48 Swedish ships took refuge in a raid near the modern city of Kotka.  Separating them from the sea, the Rochensalm Strait they blocked, having sunk 3 merchant ships in it. </p><p>  The Russian squadron under the command of Vice Admiral Nassau-Siegen attacked the enemy, having previously divided into two groups, one of which distracted its main forces, and the other cleared the passage to the harbor.  Five hours later, Russian sailors managed to break into the raid.  It was truly a rainy day for the Swedish fleet.  Of the 48 vessels sheltering in the raid, 39 were sunk, including the admiral's ship.  The Russians lost 2 ships, whose crews were saved. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blurppy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In the heat of battle" class="if uuid-2533250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2533250.jpg"></div><h2>  Revel battle </h2><p>  After the victory won in the Rochensalm Strait, Russian sailors defeated the Swedes on May 13, 1790 in a battle on the roads of the city of Revel.  This episode also became a highlight of the Russian-Swedish war (1788-1790).  Briefly, its significance can be defined as follows: as a result of the defeat suffered by the fleet of Gustav III, his plan for establishing dominance at sea finally collapsed.  It was not possible to carry out the previously planned attack on St. Petersburg, since on land the circumstances were not the best. </p><h2>  Battle of Red Hill </h2><p>  However, despite the fact that the goals of the Russian-Swedish war of 1788-1790 set by Gustav III in front of his army were becoming less achievable, the hostilities did not subside, and on June 3, 1790 was marked by a new naval battle.  This time it happened near the Kronstadt coastal fort, called the Red Hill. </p><p>  On that day, 18 Russian battleships attacked an enemy squadron approaching the Kronstadt Naval Base, consisting of 34 ships and led by the Duke of S√ºdermanland (future King of Sweden Charles XIII).  Between them a battle ensued, lasting two days.  Despite the numerical superiority, the Swedes could not seize the initiative, and events developed in a direction unfavorable for them.  By the evening of June 4, the duke received a message that the Revel squadron was hurrying to help the Russians, and he, not wanting to tempt fate, gave the order to retreat.  After that, his ships ceased fire and hastened to take refuge in the Vyborg Bay. </p><div class="photo" data-original="allart.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gunpowder smoke over the sea" class="if uuid-2533268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2533268.jpg"></div><h2>  Vyborg and Second Rochensalm battle </h2><p>  Exactly one month after the events described above, another major battle of the Russian-Swedish war of 1788-1790 was played out in the waters of the Vyborg Bay, which also proved the failure of Gustav III‚Äôs military ambitions.  Two Russian squadrons - Kronstadt, under the command of Vice Admiral Cruz, and Revelskaya, led by Admiral Chichagov - managed to block large enemy forces in Vyborg Bay.  For several days, a continuous artillery duel continued, and despite the fact that the Swedes eventually managed to break the blockade, they lost 67 ships, while the Russian fleet did not suffer losses. </p><p>  The second battle of Rochensalm, which took place on July 9, 1790, ended the Russo-Swedish war (1788-1790).  The results, however, were very disappointing.  After a continuous series of naval victories, the Russian squadron under the command of Admiral Karl Nassau-Siegen suffered a heavy defeat.  Of the 155 Russian ships, almost a third were sunk.  However, this could no longer affect the general alignment of forces.  Russia vividly demonstrated to Gustav III all the failure of attempts to impose her will on her by force.  After the guns finally fell silent, diplomats set to work. </p><h2>  The results of the Russian-Swedish war of 1788-1790. </h2><p>  In the late summer of 1790, representatives of the warring powers met in the Finnish city of Verela (now V√§r√§l√§).  On August 14, they signed a peace treaty that drew the line under the two-year period of the Russian-Swedish war of 1788-1790.  Briefly about it, we can say the following: it was a series of articles governing further Russian-Swedish agreements.  First of all, Gustav III refused all previously put forward territorial claims against the government of Catherine II.  Thus, the state borders of both powers remained unchanged. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thesun.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Andrew's flag" class="if uuid-2533303" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2533303.jpg"></div><p>  In turn, the Russian side committed itself to abandon the support of Sweden‚Äôs political circles, who advocated a return to parliamentary form of government.  In this regard, the outcome of the Russian-Swedish war of 1788-1790.  was for King Gustav III very favorable. </p><p>  In order to establish peaceful and good-neighborly relations between the two powers, the Russian side agreed to provide the Swedish king with large cash subsidies designed to cover his personal debts.  This clause of the contract was classified at the request of Gustav III and was not subject to disclosure. </p><p>  The news of the end of the war and the signing of a peace treaty was gladly received both in the Swedish army and in the Russian.  The benevolence between the officers of both powers quickly recovered, and the soldiers thanked God for once again relieving them of the need to die. </p>
