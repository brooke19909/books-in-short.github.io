    <h3>  Persistent patient </h3><p>  This lady was different from the usual “bum”, in that she confidently claimed that she was Brezhnev’s great-granddaughter.  Representatives of law enforcement agencies decided that the place was right for the relative of the Secretary General - at <span>Kanatchikova’s dacha,</span> next to other “prominent people” or their descendants.  The times when the mentally ill imagined themselves Bonapartes and Kutuzovs are long gone.  New times give rise to new mania, as the doctors decided, and embarked on therapeutic measures. </p><p>  But the truth nevertheless revealed in all its glory to honored specialists with many years of experience.  The patient seemed stubbornly insistent to them, stubbornly repeating the telephone number on which they should call.  Having collected it, the doctors were convinced that before them was really Galina Filippova, the great-granddaughter of Brezhnev. </p>

    <p>  The condition of a relative of the late Secretary General was terrible.  She had not watched her teeth for a long time, and caries affected most of them.  There was also pediculosis, to put it more simply, overwork.  A thirty-three-year-old woman lived for a long time as an asocial element, interrupting vagrancy and begging.  But, despite this, with a thorough examination, the commission found that Brezhnev’s great-granddaughter is sane and mentally healthy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  She talked about how she got from the elite of Soviet society to Moscow pavements without concealing details. </p>

    <h3>  Family and childhood </h3><p>  The family in which this woman was born in 1973 was not just elite.  The children of the last Russian emperor were brought up incomparably more modest and stricter than the descendants of the head of the CPSU.  The granddaughter of the "dear Leonid Ilyich" Victoria was, apparently, the most beloved creature in the world, the head of the Country of Soviets.  He really wanted her life to be better than that of Galina’s daughter, windy and unbalanced.  But the granddaughter didn’t have <span>family happiness</span> either, despite the fact that the couple gave birth to a pretty girl Galochka.  In 1978, Brezhnev’s great-granddaughter found a new dad.  He was Gennady Filippovich Varakuta, an <span>intelligent man,</span> educated and with a good position. </p><p>  The girl studied at a beautiful school, next to the children of other prominent and simply well-settled people, apparently learning the simple idea that, although in the USSR everyone is equal, she is somewhat “equal” to the rest. </p>

    <h3>  After the death of great-grandfather </h3><p>  Great-granddaughter of Brezhnev went to second grade when her great-grandfather died.  The subsequent general secretaries did not treat the family of Leonid Ilyich not so badly, but, of course, not like in his lifetime.  Households lost a fair amount of privileges and privileges, but were not subjected to special harassment.  It is not known whether the girl entered the philological department of Moscow State University, relying on a high level of knowledge, or if the magic of the famous surname worked, but be that as it may, she became a student.  And she married an engineer.  They had no children. </p>

    <p>  In the new economic conditions that arose after the <span>collapse of the USSR,</span> difficulties arose for which many descendants of the Kremlin celestials were not ready. </p><p>  Things didn’t go very well with her mother, and then it was completely bad.  She tried to make money on inherited real estate, but suffered a complete collapse.  All that was enough for the notorious “party money” was a modest house in the village.  Apparently, there was no place for her daughter in him. </p><p>  Help came from the children of Galina’s first husband (Alexander and Natalia), that is, the adopted grandchildren of the Secretary-General, who had lived in the United States for a long time.  After a long separation, they realized how dear to them Galina Filippova, great-granddaughter of Brezhnev.  A photo of a shaved bald patient in a psychiatric clinic can cause sympathy for everyone, despite the silly behavior.  After all, she herself was not to blame for her own helplessness, she was cared for, cherished and raised not for such a life.  Today, Ms. Filippova is forty, but she does not know how to do anything.  Probably, everything will have to be studied again ... </p>
