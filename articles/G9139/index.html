Despite its modest dimensions, each model hides a specific speaker with a special sound.  Gadgets are also distinguished by a set of functions, design and some other operational features. </p><p>  The main task of portable equipment of such a plan is to reproduce sound in those places and in such situations where familiar audio systems cannot be used.  Bluetooth speakers will come in handy during a bike ride or a morning run, on a picnic in the forest. </p><p>  Today's market offers a wide range of similar equipment.  Experienced consumers have long identified interesting models for themselves, while beginners are asking a logical question: which portable bluetooth speaker is better than the other and why?  We‚Äôll just try to deal with this problem and help with choosing the best gadget. </p><p>  So, let's try to find out which bluetooth speaker will be better in a particular situation, as well as what to pay special attention to when choosing a technique.  As specific examples, we denote the rating of the most popular models on the domestic market. </p><h2>  Critical Settings for Portable Audio </h2><p>  In order to answer the question, which bluetooth speaker is better than the other and why, it is necessary to weigh the key characteristics of such a technique.  This will help determine the choice and filter out unnecessary options. </p><h2>  Number of channels and speakers </h2><p>  The sound is mono or stereo and is determined by channels.  In the first case, one channel, and in the second - two.  A mono speaker produces less surround sound.  The speakers are responsible for the bands and frequencies - low, medium and high. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Experts strongly do not recommend buying a gadget where the number of speakers is less than the bands.  To choose a bluetooth speaker with good sound, you must pay attention to the frequency range.  The wider it is, the better the sound. </p><p>  For low frequencies, the limit of coverage will be in the region of 20-500 Hz.  The sound output will be much juicier if this indicator is minimal.  If bass is extremely important to you, then it is best to look at models from the premium sector, because even the best low-cost bluetooth speakers from the budget sector, alas, cannot boast of decent reproduction of low frequencies. </p><p>  The limits for high frequencies are in the region of 10 000-25 000 Hz.  Raise such a threshold under the force of almost any column from the mid-price segment.  Worthy options can also be found in the public sector.  High frequencies are especially important for those who prefer tracks where instrumental parts predominate. </p><h2>  Power </h2><p>  This parameter does not affect the sound quality, but is only responsible for the maximum volume level.  The simplest models from the budget sector produce about 1.5-2 watts per speaker.  Gadgets of the average hand - about 16-20 watts. </p><p>  The best bluetooth speakers, and at the same time the most powerful ones, rattle at 50, or even all 100 watts.  This figure is comparable to multimedia acoustics.  In addition, most serious models are additionally equipped with a subwoofer.  The latter has its own power. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  Well, when, in addition to the bluetooth protocol, the gadget has additional interfaces for connecting third-party peripherals.  Some speakers have a USB output for recharging mobile devices.  Also there are models with a micro-USB and AUX interface at 3.5 mm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The latter allows you to listen to music through headphones.  In addition, the gadget may have a micro-SD slot for working with flash drives.  In this case, your favorite songs will always be at hand.  Judging by the reviews and ratings, bluetooth speakers and a flash drive are very popular. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Features of portable equipment require their own power sources - batteries or built-in rechargeable batteries.  Naturally, the higher the capacity indicator, the better and the longer the column will work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gearpatrol.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bluetooth speaker portable rating" class="if uuid-3228900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3228900.jpg"></div><p>  Budget "kids" are equipped, as a rule, with batteries in the region of 1500 mAh.  This is enough for about 8 hours of continuous operation at an average volume level.  Devices that occupy first places in the top of the best bluetooth speakers in terms of autonomy can be equipped with batteries for 20 or more thousand mAh. </p><p>  Such "monsters" can work day and night.  But such devices have one significant minus - this is the weight.  Capacious batteries have never been lightweight.  So here we have a double-edged sword, where you have to choose - autonomy or mobility. </p><h2>  Protective qualities </h2><p>  Since we are dealing with portable equipment, which is supposed to be used in traveling conditions (dust, dirt and moisture), it is clearly not out of place to pay special attention to the protective characteristics of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This indicator is usually marked with the IP index.  For the portable speaker segment, there is a scale of one to ten.  For example, a device with the IPX3 index is not afraid of dust and splashing water, while a device with an IPX7 protection level is not afraid of rain and bathing in the bathroom.  Naturally, the models that occupy first places in the ratings of portable bluetooth speakers have acceptable protective characteristics. </p><h2>  Other qualities </h2><p>  The appearance of the devices, along with ergonomics and some additional ‚Äútricks‚Äù, are all individually.  But here you need to understand that each subsequent ‚Äútwist‚Äù will significantly add value to the device. </p><p>  For example, if you liked the portable speaker with bluetooth and a flash drive in the next rating, then be prepared to give more for such a set than if you bought everything separately.  So sometimes it‚Äôs better to give up extra bells and whistles and look for classic ‚Äúbare‚Äù options. </p><p>  Next, we consider specific devices that have distinguished themselves by a high-quality component and a large number of positive reviews from consumers. </p><p>  Rating of portable bluetooth speakers: </p><ol><li>  Marshall Kilburn. </li><li>  Harman / Kardon Go + Play Mini. </li><li>  GZ Electronics LoftSound GZ-44. </li><li>  JBL Charge 3. </li><li>  Sony SRS-XB41. </li><li>  JBL Flip 4. </li><li>  JBL Go 2. </li><li>  Xiaomi Mi Bluetooth Speaker. </li></ol><p>  We will analyze the remarkable characteristics of each model. </p><h2>  Marshall kilburn </h2><p>  In the first place of our ranking of bluetooth speakers in 2019, there is a model from the well-known brand ‚ÄúMarshall‚Äù.  Judging by consumer reviews, this is the best that this segment can offer.  The model attracts primarily with its appearance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.courts.com.sg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marshall kilburn" class="if uuid-3228897" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3228897.jpg"></div><p>  It can be seen that the manufacturer paid special attention to the design of his brainchild.  The best portable bluetooth speaker received a stylish retro body with greetings from the 70s.  The design was also distinguished by the presence of gilded elements and a convenient carrying handle. </p><p>  On sale you can find two stylistic modifications.  One is covered in white and the other is black vinyl imitating the skin.  The mesh covering the speaker is very similar to the velvet protection of guitar cabinets. </p><p>  The main speaker and a pair of tweeters are responsible for delivering sound.  There is also a built-in equalizer responsible for setting the modes.  You can emphasize high, mid or low frequencies.  The sound quality here is at the highest level and consumers have no complaints about the model. </p><p>  As for the assembly, it can also be called ideal: you will not see or hear any backlashes, gaps or creaking.  The brand once again proves that its products are of exceptional quality without any compromises, and this model rightfully takes first place in the ranking of the best bluetooth speakers.  Naturally, all this will have to pay a lot of money. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  great sound; </li><li>  attractive appearance; </li><li>  wide range of frequency adjustment; </li><li>  exceptional build quality; </li><li>  seamless connection with any mobile gadget via the bluetooth protocol. </li></ul><p>  No flaws were identified. </p><h2>  Harman / Kardon Go + Play Mini </h2><p>  In second place in our ranking of the best bluetooth speakers is the premium model of a well-known brand.  The gadget is a development of the series and one of the variations of the classic modification of Go + Play.  The appearance of the column is very presentable, and it immediately shows that it belongs to a noble caste. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dice.bg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Harman / Kardon Go + Play Mini" class="if uuid-3228899" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3228899.jpg"></div><p>  The model is quite bulky and heavy, so that as a walking satellite is not suitable.  She feels great in the office, at home or in the lap of nature.  Of course, you can take a walk with the gadget through the streets, since the design allows this, but your hands get tired very quickly from impressive weight. </p><p>  However, large dimensions have their own advantages.  The manufacturer equipped the model with an impressive battery capacity, which lasts for a long time.  Yes, and the power of the column is noticeably greater than that of other miniature analogues - 50 watts. </p><p>  It is also worth noting the presence of USB and AUX interfaces, which are located at the rear of the device.  The control buttons are located on the top panel, and you can easily reach them while carrying. </p><p>  Four full-time speakers do an excellent job of processing both high and low frequencies.  It is also worth noting the presence of competent automatic tuning of modes.  The device itself adjusts the equalizer depending on the song being played.  In this case, each track is fully revealed and sounds in full force. </p><p>  Another feature of the model that consumers are extremely flattering about is the lack of linear volume switching.  The manufacturer completely abandoned the classic version and introduced a more advanced solution in his brainchild: the lower the sound level, the more comfortable and smooth it is regulated. </p><p>  The gadget has more advanced features.  For example, you can combine a mobile phone and a speaker into one system and answer calls through a Go + Play microphone.  In a word, this device is worth the money spent on it and it was not in vain that it received an honorable second place in the ranking of mini bluetooth speakers. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  four full speakers; </li><li>  excellent implementation of high and low frequencies; </li><li>  decent volume margin; </li><li>  long battery life; </li><li>  synchronization with any mobile or desktop platform; </li><li>  attractive appearance. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  massive and heavy construction; </li><li>  long recharge time. </li></ul><h2>  GZ Electronics LoftSound GZ-44 </h2><p>  In third place in our ranking of bluetooth speakers is a very presentable model from the well-established Singapore brand.  This unit is not suitable for a beach or a street party.  It looks too expensive: a stately metal case, genuine leather and gold inserts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.e-katalog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="GZ electronics LoftSound GZ-44" class="if uuid-3228903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3228903.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, one of the best bluetooth speakers has a high level of ergonomics.  Judging by the reviews of the owners, managing it is just a pleasure.  Convenient and easily removable strap, competently placed controls and optimal dimensions - all this contributes to comfortable use. </p><p>  The model perfectly copes with music of any genre and direction.  In addition, the high power indicator of the speaker allows you to set a decent volume level.  The gadget showed itself well in reproducing both classical compositions, where a number of individual instruments predominate, and modern rhythms, where low frequencies are primarily important. </p><p>  Users were also pleased with the local microphone.  If you synchronize the column with a mobile phone, you can safely answer incoming calls.  Fortunately, the device synchronizes with all relevant platforms without any problems. </p><p>  As for the assembly, there is nothing to complain about.  No backlash, crevices or creaking.  The device looks solid, and each element of the body is tightly fitted to each other. </p><p>  The only drawback that prevented the model from rising higher in our bluetooth speaker rating is its battery life.  At an average volume level, the battery lasts no more than 6 hours.  But many do not consider this moment critical, because they use the gadget in the office or at home. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  excellent sound of all frequencies; </li><li>  non-linear volume switch; </li><li>  high-quality assembly; </li><li>  attractive design; </li><li>  excellent ergonomic component. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  some were not satisfied with the autonomy of the device; </li><li>  lack of protection against water. </li></ul><h2>  JBL Charge 3 </h2><p>  In fourth place in our ranking of bluetooth speakers is a model from a well-known American brand.  Here we have a stylish and thoughtful design along with sound efficiency and high performance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ceneo.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="JBL Charge 3" class="if uuid-3228901" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3228901.jpg"></div><p>  With its appearance, one of the best bluetooth speakers resembles a barrel.  The manufacturer used silicone and high-quality plastic.  In addition, the model boasts not only a reliable design, but also excellent protective characteristics.  Dust, dirt and diving to the depths of it in no way with protection class IPX7. </p><p>  The users were also pleased with the ergonomic part of the device.  The device is small and fits perfectly in the hand.  It is convenient to carry and operate with it.  For the column there is a place in a deep pocket or in a women's handbag. </p><p>  The third series was a kind of work on the mistakes of past generations.  The manufacturer managed to include two broadband speakers in the case, working in tandem with passive emitters.  Power of 10 watts is enough for a small beach party or an individual musical mood. </p><p>  A wide frequency range (65-20,000 Hz) allows you to work with music of any direction, from romantic compositions to heavy rock.  Users in their reviews note that the sound at the output is smooth and balanced. </p><p>  In addition, the model synergizes well with third-party gadgets, whether smartphones or other speakers.  For these purposes, the manufacturer has developed a proprietary application JBL Connect +.  With it, you can combine peripherals into a single system. </p><p>  Also pleased with the battery life.  A capacious 6000 mAh battery allows you to enjoy your favorite songs for up to 20 hours in a row, and at the maximum volume level.  A significant drawback that did not allow the model to rise higher in the ranking of bluetooth speakers is the wireless protocol itself. </p><p>  The fact is that the device fully reveals its capabilities through a wired connection.  But it is according to the bluetooth protocol that the sound at the output is slightly worse than it actually is.  Nevertheless, the average user in the vast majority of the difference in sound between the wired and wireless connection does not feel. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  excellent protective characteristics; </li><li>  high-quality assembly; </li><li>  sensible built-in microphone; </li><li>  high ergonomics; </li><li>  Verbank mode; </li><li>  good autonomy. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  lower quality sound using the bluetooth protocol; </li><li>  sometimes there are involuntary inclusions. </li></ul><h2>  Sony SRS-XB41 </h2><p>  The famous brand has always pleased and pleases with high-quality equipment, and the portable speaker segment was no exception.  This model is a vivid representative of the combination of new technologies and the responsible attitude of the manufacturer to its fans. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestbuy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony SRS-XB41" class="if uuid-3228902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3228902.jpg"></div><p>  The model received a sturdy case without a hint of backlash and creaking.  The design of the column can be called classic, but this does not make it any less attractive.  Pleasant features of the case and well-built color display will come in handy in any interior, whether it is a strict office or a friendly weekend in the country. </p><p>  Consumers have no complaints about the sound quality.  Sony took into account all user reviews about past generations and increased the range of supported frequencies to a minimum threshold of 20 Hz.  This largely affected the sound quality only for the better.  Bass in the end literally ‚Äúpump‚Äù the unit and make it vibrate. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the LEDs on the speakers are not a simple decoration.  The indication in time with the music changes from one color to another and pleases with its responsiveness, and not just blinking.  The backlight is variable, so you can turn it off if desired. </p><p>  As for autonomy, there are no problems with this.  A capacious battery allows the device to work up to 10 hours at maximum volume and with activated backlight.  If you reset the value to average and turn off the display, then the column can play for almost a day. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  good sound of all frequencies; </li><li>  interesting and well-built lighting; </li><li>  decent battery life; </li><li>  extremely high-quality assembly; </li><li>  work with NFC; </li><li>  attractive design. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  mediocre microphone; </li><li>  the device is heavy for hiking. </li></ul><h2>  JBL Flip 4 </h2><p>  Another representative of JBL, but already with the Flip gadget.  The fourth model of the series is a bit similar in appearance to the JBL Charge 3, but in this case, the manufacturer noticeably expanded the line in terms of visualization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ghumtipasal.com.np" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="JBL Flip 4" class="if uuid-3228904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3228904.jpg"></div><p>  Stylish and cute device has a large selection of colors.  And we are talking not only about ordinary colors, but about entire collections.
