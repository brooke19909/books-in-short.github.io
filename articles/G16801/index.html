Thick corrugated cardboard holds its shape well, it is convenient to cut and glue it, giving the product the necessary configuration.  The smooth top surface of the boxes is beautifully painted with paints or markers.  If necessary, parts can be stapled with office brackets or even stitched with threads.  What can be done out of the box, we will consider further in the article. </p><h2>  Set for the game in traffic </h2><p>  Having cut the bottom in a large box, you can make your son a mobile corner of the road, which can be moved from place to place, taken for a walk or go to the neighbor to play cars.  From the remaining cardboard, you can make small multi-colored cars or construct them at home, build bridges or even tunnels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.manandvans.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="box for traffic" class="if uuid-2753480" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2753480.jpg"></div><p>  What to do out of the box without investing extra money?  Of course, a play area for the boys.  You can entrust a child to draw a road with turns and intersections on its bottom.  A senior school student for his little brother will be able to do such a craft. </p><h2>  Kid's Kitchen </h2><p>  What to make out of the box for girls?  Consider a sample of the manufacture of children's kitchen in the photo below.  Here you will need a large box for carrying a washing machine or refrigerator, or two smaller items.  The back side of the plate is represented by an integral part of the product, and the surface itself is made of a side plate.  It cut a rectangular hole for the sink and oven.  You can make several shelves below, where the child can put toy dishes or plastic vegetables. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ar.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kitchen out of the box" class="if uuid-2753449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2753449.jpg"></div><p>  An interesting article looks pasted with bright color self-adhesive.  Small details can be drawn with markers or made with applique. </p><h2>  How to make a house out of the box </h2><p>  Lodges are most often made of packing cardboard.  From a shoe box you can make a table house for dolls.  But if you take large products, you can create a building in which a child can fit.  Everyone knows how children love to climb into small enclosed spaces, hide in cabinets and cabinets.  Parents simply must make their child a small house after buying a refrigerator or gas stove.  Any big box will do. </p><div class="photo" data-original="matome.naver.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="big box houses" class="if uuid-2753442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2753442.jpg"></div><p>  If you do not know how to make a house out of the box with your own hands, then carefully consider the photo above.  The box is placed in a vertical position and one rectangular or rounded door is cut out from below.  You can make a double-leaf, opening in different directions.  It cuts out windows of any shape. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Further in the house out of the box windows and a roof are made.  To do this, you need to give the upper part a triangular shape and, bending the sheet of cardboard in half, strengthen it from above.  You can decorate the roof with rectangular pieces of cardboard that perform the function of tiles.  With the help of self-gluing of different colors, the children's house will gain brightness and originality. </p><h2>  Fortress for games </h2><p>  Let's look further at what to do out of the box for knightly tournaments.  To create an old fortress you will need a small box, in which the upper part is cut off, and all the sides on top are made with square cutouts, as in a real fortress.  Round towers are made of cardboard bushes from toilet paper or kitchen napkins. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cardboard fortress" class="if uuid-2753467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2753467.jpg"></div><p>  To cut the semicircular windows and the door, you need a sharp knife and a wooden plank.  It is advisable to pre-draw the contours with a simple pencil, so that the slices are performed correctly.  You can decorate the fortress to your liking, having examined the ancient buildings in the photographs. </p><h2>  Furniture for dolls </h2><p>  Girls love to play with dolls, which these days are expensive.  For games, in addition to various accessories and clothes, you will need furniture.  These are beds, armchairs, wardrobes and different bedside tables.  If you do not know what to make out of the box, then look at the beautiful bed in the photo below and make your daughter a similar one, saving considerable money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.listinspired.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cardboard bed" class="if uuid-2753451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2753451.jpg"></div><p>  If the box is small, for example, from under children's shoes, then the doll‚Äôs bed can be made directly from the cover by simply pasting it with beautiful self-adhesive and making the legs out of coils or plastic bottle caps. </p><h2>  Typewriter </h2><p>  The box is suitable for the manufacture of a small machine for board games or for exhibiting equipment at school, or for an outdoor car in which a child can fit.  It all depends on the size of the box and the imagination of the master. </p><div class="photo" data-original="verhuisdozendeal.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="machine for a boy" class="if uuid-2753465" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2753465.jpg"></div><p>  The wheels can be made movable by attaching them to sticks or wire.  It‚Äôs easier to make a craft according to the drawing.  They draw the same sides and a rectangular bottom, which is extended on both sides.  Then, in the right places, they make bends and stick with adhesive tape on the inside of the craft.  The wheels in the photo above are simply glued onto PVA glue. </p><h2>  Airplane </h2><p>  What can be done out of the box under the refrigerator?  Of course, something big and significant.  If your baby already has a house, then make him also a plane.  Wings and a screw are cut from the long sides of the box.  Places for the pilot and passenger are cut out in the tank itself, and the back of the aircraft is reduced to create a tail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="airplane out of the box" class="if uuid-2753515" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2753515.jpg"></div><p>  So that the ends of the wings do not fall down, they are strengthened with sticks or painted branches.  You can use large cardboard sleeves from napkins.  The screw is attached to the bolt, fixing the structure with a nut from the inside. </p><h2>  Artwork </h2><p>  Using old boxes made of thick cardboard, you can not only do crafts for children, but also create real works of art, for example, animal figures such as in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thegreenhead.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful sculptures" class="if uuid-2753489" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2753489.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, from the boxes you can create a variety of crafts.  The main thing is to have desire and imagination.  Creative success! </p>
