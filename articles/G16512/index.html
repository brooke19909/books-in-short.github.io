    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The apartments offered in this hotel, our compatriots generally liked.  According to them, the rooms here are quite spacious, with freshly renovated and pleasantly decorated.  True, for some guests the lack of balconies was a minus.  However, experienced travelers claim that this feature is characteristic of many modern <span>hotels in Nha Trang.</span>  Otherwise, the guests had no particular complaints about the rooms.  So, tourists say that the beds here are very comfortable, large, clean and high-quality linens, the rest of the furniture and appliances are in good condition.  As for Internet access, it is available throughout the Yasaka Saigon NhaTrang Resort Hotel Spa (Vietnam, Nha Trang).  True, according to vacationers, Wi-Fi does not always catch Wi-Fi in rooms.  But in public areas of the hotel there are no problems with the Internet. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also in their reviews, guests note the next moment for those who want to live in a room with a sea view.  In this case, your windows will also face a very busy roadway.  Therefore, if you are used to relaxing during the daytime or want to go to bed early, then such noise can cause you inconvenience.  In the rooms, whose windows overlook the surroundings of the hotel, they are almost always quite quiet. </p><p>  In addition, with regard to the minibar, experienced tourists are advised to immediately take out all the contents from it and put it separately, and fill the refrigerator with purchased products.  This will save you a lot of money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel yasaka saigon nhatrang resort hotel spa" class="if" height="239" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1115497.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Yasaka Saigon <span>Nha Trang</span> Hotel <span>4 * (Nha Trang, Vietnam)</span> offers tourists, when booking, choose one of the options regarding food - only breakfast or half board.  Most vacationers stop at the first option.  According to the guests, breakfasts are the same every day, however, a fairly large selection of dishes and products allows you to diversify your menu.  So, in the mornings in the hotel restaurant you can eat soup, side dishes, noodles, meat dishes, dumplings, eggs in different variations, fruits and vegetables, pastries, juices, tea and coffee.  Breakfast is buffet style from six to nine in the morning. </p><p>  Guests can also have lunch and dinner in the hotel restaurant.  But here already the dishes are brought by the waiters.  Cooking here, according to vacationers, is very good.  However, the prices in the hotel restaurant are slightly higher than in the cafe next door.  Therefore, most tourists preferred to eat outside the hotel.  Moreover, the choice of establishments here is very wide.  By the way, experienced travelers are advised to choose cafes that are not located on the first line if possible.  After all, their prices are 15-20 percent lower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yasaka saigon nha trang hotel 4 nha trang vietnam" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1115494.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  An indisputable plus for most tourists is the fact that the Yasaka Saigon NhaTrang Resort Hotel Spa is located on the first coastline.  Only the carriageway separates it from the beach.  Experienced travelers advise crossing it carefully and carefully, since most drivers in Vietnam are not used to let even pedestrians moving along the zebra pass. </p><p>  As for the beach, it is municipal.  Hotel "Yasaka" on it has a small area with sunbeds and umbrellas, which its guests can use for free.  Here, a hotel employee will give you beach towels.  However, vacationers note that there are very few loungers at the hotel.  Therefore, if you want to stay for free, it is advisable to go ashore in the morning - at 7 o‚Äôclock. However, if you are not used to getting up early, then you should not be upset.  After all, you can rent a deck chair in the neighborhood.  It costs quite inexpensively (about a couple of dollars a day). </p>
