The answer to this question is given by history itself.  In the article we will try to figure out who was considered a witch, and why burning was the most radical way to get rid of witchcraft charms. </p><h2>  Who is the witch </h2><p>  Witches were burned and persecuted during the time of the Roman Empire.  The struggle against witchcraft reached its apogee in the 15th ‚Äì 17th centuries. </p>

    <p>  What had to be done so that the person would be accused of witchcraft and burned at the stake?  It turns out that during the Middle Ages, in order to get accused of practicing witchcraft, it is enough just to be a beautiful girl.  Any woman could be blamed on completely legal grounds. </p><p>  Witches were considered those who had a special mark on their body in the form of a wart, a huge mole, or just a bruise.  If a cat, owl or mouse lived with a woman, she was also considered a witch. </p><p>  A sign of involvement in the witching world was both the beauty of the girl, and the presence of some kind of bodily ugliness. </p><p>  The most important reason to be in the dungeons of the holy Inquisition, could be an ordinary denunciation with accusations of blasphemy, bad words about power or behavior that arouses suspicion. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Representatives of the <span>Holy Inquisition</span> arranged interrogations so masterfully that people confessed to everything that was demanded of them. </p><h2>  Witch Burning: Geography of Executions </h2><p>  When and where did the executions take place?  In what century were witches burned?  An avalanche of atrocities falls on the Middle Ages, and mainly countries in which the Catholic faith was involved were involved.  About 300 years old witches were actively subjected to destruction and persecution.  Historians claim that about 50 thousand people were convicted of witchcraft. </p><p>  Inquisitorial bonfires burned throughout Europe.  Spain, Germany, France and England are countries where thousands of witches were burned en masse. </p><p>  Even young girls, under the age of 10 years, were classified as witches.  Children died with cursed lips: they cursed their mothers, who allegedly taught them the skill of witchcraft. </p>

    <p>  The proceedings themselves were carried out very quickly.  Those accused of witchcraft were interrogated soon, but with the use of sophisticated torture.  Sometimes people were condemned in whole batches and mass witches were burned at the stake. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Torture prior to execution </h2><p>  The torture applied to women accused of witchcraft was very cruel.  History has documented cases where suspects were forced to sit for days on a chair studded with sharp spikes.  Sometimes the witch was put on large shoes - boiling water was poured there. </p><p>  The witch‚Äôs test of water is also known in history.  The suspect was simply drowned, it was believed that it was impossible to drown the witch.  If a woman turned out to be dead after being tortured with water, she was acquitted, but to whom was it easier? </p><h2>  Why was burning preferred? </h2><p>  Execution through burning was considered the "Christian form of execution", because it occurred without the shedding of blood.  Witches were considered criminals worthy of death, but since they repented, the judges asked them to be ‚Äúmerciful,‚Äù that is, to kill without bloodshed. </p><p>  In the Middle Ages, witches were also burned because the Holy Inquisition was afraid of the resurrection of a convicted woman.  And if the body is burned, then what is the resurrection without the body? </p><p>  The very first case of the burning of a witch was recorded in 1128.  The event took place in Flanders.  The woman, who was considered the ally of the devil, was accused of the fact that, after she doused one of the rich with water, he soon became ill and died. </p><p>  At first, executions were rare, but gradually became widespread. </p><h2>  Execution procedure </h2><p>  It should be noted that the justification of the victims was also inherent in <span>the Middle Ages.</span>  There is statistics indicating that the number of acquittals of the accused corresponded to half of the trials.  A tortured woman could even receive compensation for her suffering. </p><p>  The condemned woman was awaiting execution.  It should be noted that the execution has always been a public spectacle, the purpose of which is to intimidate and intimidate the public.  The townspeople hurried to execution in festive clothes.  This event attracted even those who lived far away. </p><p>  Mandatory during the procedure was the presence of priests and government officials. </p><p>  When everyone was assembled, a wagon with an executioner and future victims appeared.  The public did not have sympathy for the witch, they laughed and teased at her. </p>

    <p>  The unfortunate were chained to a pole, surrounded by dry branches.  After the preparatory procedures, a sermon was obligatory, where the priest warned the public against communication with the devil and engaging in witchcraft.  The role of the executioner was to set fire to the fire.  Servants watched the fire until there was no trace of the victim. </p><p>  Sometimes bishops even competed among themselves, which of them will be able to carry out more <span>executions of women who</span> are accused of witchcraft.  This type of execution for the torment experienced by the victim is equated with a crucifix on the cross.  The last burnt witch is recorded in history in 1860.  The execution occurred in Mexico. </p>
