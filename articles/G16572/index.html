Drive to Hurghada seventeen kilometers.  But often tourists are satisfied with a sightseeing tour, because the hotel itself provides any service that you just wish or could imagine.  And right from the beautiful gates of the main territory, a shopping street begins with a variety of shops, souvenir shops, bars.  Young people can use the services of animators to get to the famous nightclubs of Hurghada.  But if you do not want to go so far, then you can find entertainment and closer.

In Hurghada, almost all hotel lines are represented, such as Hilton, Sheraton, Sofitel, Intercontinental, Marriott and so on.  All of them have their own beaches and coral reefs, and everywhere you can relax with your children, because the entrance to the water is usually sandy and gently sloping.  Many of them provide tourists with <span>water slides</span> or even whole water parks.  But each such hotel has its own zest, which attracts vacationers.  For example, in "Dana Beach" there is a river along which you can swim to the beach by boat.  Bars are bursting with drinks and all kinds of cocktails (although, on the other hand, this increases the risk of stumbling on drunk tourists).  Many of these hotels have gorgeous sea views.  But Golden 5 Sapphire Suites Hotel (Hurghada) is interesting in that it offers a luxurious suite, food and service as in the "five", but at the price of a four-star hotel.  We can say that not a single resort hotel will provide you with such a variety of entertainment and services.  Perhaps that is why on the tourist sites the name "Deluxe" is often added to the name of this hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden 5 sapphire suites 4 golden live sapphire suites" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/707831.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Where exactly is the building "Sapphire" </h2><p>  The Golden 5 Sapphire Suites Hotel is located, on the one hand, close to the main gate of the Golden Live City complex.  If you are guided by the generally accepted standards of the hotel business, then we can say that it is on the second line, because you need to go to the beach from it through the entire territory of a large hotel city, or ride a special bus.  In addition to it there is also a train with which you can go around the entire territory of Golden Live.  <span>This building is</span> adjacent to the Topaz building, which also belongs to the Quartet.  Both of them are a separate complex, which is located near the main territory of Golden Live City.  We can say that he is even beyond its limits.  The territory of Golden Live and Topaz-Sapphire is separated by a road.  The distance from the Golden 5 Sapphire Suites Hotel 4 (Hurghada, Egypt) to the sea, according to various estimates, is from eight hundred meters to one and a half kilometers.  But tourists write that there is nothing to worry about.  On the contrary, this arrangement can be considered an additional bonus.  Indeed, walking once again (even if the walk takes 20 minutes) through a very beautiful park with sculptures and manicured lawns is not difficult.  Very close is a street with shops.  Many of them are state-owned, with fixed prices.  It is much cheaper than in the market. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sapphire suites hotel 4 hotel sapphire suites hurghada" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/707808.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Golden 5 Sapphire Suites <span>Hotel de luxe</span> 4 is a three-story building.  In fact, it is one with Topaz, and the pool at these two hotels is the same.  From the windows of the rooms you can see the entire territory of the huge complex Golden Fives.  The rooms in the building are very good.  They are large, comfortable, with new furniture.  There are only eight rooms of the Standard category.  But they have a very large area - forty-three square meters.  One hundred rooms of this hotel building are categorized as Superior.  They have a living room and cover an area of ‚Äã‚Äãsixty-three square meters.  Therefore, this building also has the additional name "Deluxe".  The fact is that most of his rooms are suites.  Golden 5 Sapphire Suites <span>Hotel de luxe</span> 4 tourists appreciate it for the convenience and style of housing and interior.  Each superior room has a very spacious balcony with a table and chairs, two televisions (one of which is located in the living room), a hairdryer, a safe, an split air conditioning system, configured for heating and cool, sofas.  The minibar is refilled once.  Vacationers are constantly provided with mineral water and a small package of juice for children (daily), and once a week - a liter bottle with a sweet soft drink.  The room also has a wardrobe, dressing table, electric kettle and everything you need for making coffee.  There is also a mini-kitchen in the Familyrooms.  Rooms are cleaned, of course, every day, and bed linen is changed three times a week, sometimes more often.  Tourists arriving repeatedly are served a fruit platter in the room.  If something stops working, contact the reception, and within a quarter of an hour the issue will be resolved.  If someone doesn‚Äôt like the number, they relocate to another without any problems.  By the way, rooms in "Sapphire", according to tourists, are better than in the "fives" of this complex.  On the day of eviction, a bracelet is cut off from you and another is put on, allowing you to eat in all restaurants until the end of the day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden 5 sapphire suites hotel 4 hotel in hurghada" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/707816.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions, shopping </h2><p>  After the arrival, vacationers usually collect a hotel guide, explain the features of holidays in Egypt and hand out brochures with descriptions of various excursions and their prices.  One of the most interesting rides that Golden 5 Sapphire Suites Hotel 4 offers in Hurghada is an ATV safari.  In addition to skiing in the desert, you call in a Bedouin village, they feed you dinner there, dance and show shows, carry camels.  Not inferior in popularity to tourists and sea excursion to "El Gouna".  On the way, you can sunbathe in the open sea on a luxury yacht, dive by the reefs, go fishing.  Paradise Island with snorkeling and lunch on deck is also good.  Lovers of antiquities, of course, prefer a trip to Luxor - mysterious ancient temples, City of the Dead, Valley of the Pharaohs ... Well, those who want to see Cairo and the pyramids should break away from the hotel for two days ... True, tourists recommend making such distant trips in winter - in summer the air temperature can exceed fifty degrees in the shade ... By the way, do not rush to buy excursions at the hotel.  Travel agencies on the beach sell them cheaper, but the quality is the same.  And if you want to rush through shops and benches, go for a walk in the night of Hurghada.  There you can buy everything that you wanted to bring from Egypt, especially if you know how to bargain. </p><h2>  Golden 5 Sapphire Suites Hotel (Egypt, Hurghada): reviews </h2><p> Tourists like this hotel for its wonderful large park, delicious food, nice and helpful staff, very decent and safe slides in the water park.  Since the building is located outside the main territory, the rooms are quiet, you can not hear the noise of discos.  The price of living in it is small - from thirty-eight thousand rubles for ten nights for two people.  And at the same time, you can use almost all the services and infrastructure, designed for guests of the ‚Äúfives‚Äù.  Just walking, you go to any hotel in the complex, sit in a bar, eat in a restaurant and move on.  The rooms are huge, the size of a two-room apartment.  Good animation that allows you to warm up, which is especially useful with the all-inclusive system.  Many different evening shows - fakirs, dervishes dancing, swallowing fire ... Food in the hotel is suitable even for kids - they always find something tasty for themselves.  Chefs in the restaurant try, and the waiters knock down to provide a warm welcome.  Guests also praise the Topaz massage parlor.  Many people recognize the healing and relaxing effects of the procedures carried out there.  In general, tourists consider a good stay at Golden Five Sapphire Suites Hotel 4. The hotel is recommended to friends and acquaintances.  This building is especially suitable for a relaxing family vacation, lovers, lovers of walks.  Although more active young people in the evenings can just walk to the main territory and "come off" there. </p><h2>  Which hotel can you compare it with </h2><p>  In some ways, the hotel we are describing resembles the Golden Suites Hotel (Kuala Lumpur).  This is a boutique hotel in the center of the Malaysian capital, close to many restaurants, nightlife and shopping centers.  It provides an excellent opportunity to relax a couple of days from the daily rush and at the same time be a stone's throw from the various temptations that this wonderful city has to offer.  In addition, the hotel offers easy access to the most famous sights of Kuala Lumpur.  Like its Egyptian "namesake", the Malaysian Golden Suites provides guests with amazing service and chic rooms.  The rooms are large, with the highest level of comfort and amenities, with king size beds.  These are mainly superior rooms, family rooms, and suites.  True, this hotel is small because it is urban.  There are only thirty eight numbers. </p>
