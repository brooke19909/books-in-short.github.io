    <p>  Let us dwell on such a one as biophysics.  This is a science that appeared around 1945 and has become an important part of the entire biological system. </p><h2>  What is biophysics? </h2><p>  To answer this question, first of all, one should point out its close contact with chemistry and biology.  In some issues, the boundaries between these sciences are so close that it is difficult to make out which one is specifically involved and in priority.  Therefore, it is worth considering biophysics as a complex science that studies the deep physical and chemical processes that occur in living systems at the level of both molecules, cells, organs, and at the level of the Biosphere as a whole. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Like any other, biophysics is a science that has its own object of study, goals and objectives, as well as worthy and significant results.  In addition, this discipline is closely correlated with several new directions. </p><h2>  Objects of study </h2><p>  They are for biophysics biosystems at different organizational levels. </p><ol><li>  <span>Microorganisms (bacteria,</span> viruses, unicellular fungi and algae). </li><li>  The simplest animals. </li><li>  Individual cells and their structural parts (organelles). </li><li>  Plants. </li><li>  Animals (including humans). </li><li>  Ecological communities. </li></ol><p>  That is, biophysics is a study of the living in terms of the physical processes taking place in it. </p>

    <h2>  Science Objectives </h2><p>  Initially, the tasks of biophysicists were to prove the presence of physical processes and phenomena in the life of living beings and to study them, finding out the nature and significance. </p><p>  The modern tasks of this science can be formulated as follows: </p><ol><li>  To study the structure of genes and the mechanisms that accompany their transmission and storage, modifications (mutations). </li><li>  Consider many aspects of cell biology (the interaction of cells with each other, chromosomal and genetic interactions and other processes). </li><li>  To study polymer molecules (proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides) in combination with molecular biology. </li><li>  To reveal the influence of cosmogeophysical factors on the course of all physical and chemical processes in living organisms. </li><li>  More deeply reveal the mechanisms of photobiology (photosynthesis, photoperiodism, and so on). </li><li>  Introduce and develop methods of mathematical modeling. </li><li>  Apply nanotechnology results to study living systems. </li></ol><p>  From this list it is obvious that biophysics studies a lot of significant and serious problems of modern society, and the results of this science are important for man and his life. </p><h2>  Formation history </h2><p>  As a science, biophysics was born relatively recently - in 1945, when <span>Erwin Schr√∂dinger</span> published his work "What is life from the point of view of physics."  It was he who first noticed and indicated that many laws of physics (thermodynamic, laws of quantum mechanics) have a place to be precisely in the life activity and work of organisms of living beings. </p><p>  Thanks to the works of this person, the science of biophysics began its intensive development.  However, even earlier, in 1922, the Institute of Biophysics was created in Russia, led by P.P. Lazarev.  There, the main role is assigned to the study of the nature of excitation in tissues and organs.  The result was the identification of the importance of ions in this process. </p><p>  Further, a series of discoveries by various scientists makes it possible to understand that biophysics is a complete, capacious, and complex science, which is necessary for understanding all processes occurring in living systems. </p><ol><li>  Galvani discovers electricity and its importance for living tissues (bioelectricity). </li><li>  A. L. Chizhevsky is the father of several disciplines that study the influence of space on the Biosphere, as well as ionization radiation and electrohemodynamics. </li><li>  The detailed structure of protein molecules was studied only after the discovery of the XRD method (X-ray structural analysis).  This was done by scientists Perutz and Kendru (1962). </li><li>  In the same year, a three-dimensional structure of DNA was discovered (Maurice Wilkins). </li><li>  Neer and Zakman in 1991 were able to develop a method of local fixation of electric potential. </li></ol><p>  Also, a number of other discoveries allowed the science of biophysics to embark on the path of intensive and progressive modernization in development and formation. </p>

    <h2>  Sections of Biophysics </h2><p>  There are a number of disciplines that make up this science.  Consider the most basic of them. </p><ol><li>  Biophysics of complex systems - considers all the complex mechanisms of self-regulation of multicellular organisms (systemogenesis, morphogenesis, synergogenesis).  Also, this discipline studies the features of the physical component of the processes of ontogenesis and evolutionary development, the levels of organization of organisms. </li><li>  Bioacoustics and biophysics of sensory systems - studies the sensory systems of living organisms (vision, hearing, reception, speech and others), methods of broadcasting various signals.  It reveals the mechanisms of energy conversion during the perception of external influences (irritations) by organisms. </li><li>  Theoretical biophysics - includes a number of subsciences involved in the study of the thermodynamics of biological processes, the construction of mathematical models of the structural parts of organisms.  Also considers kinetic processes. </li><li>  Molecular biophysics - examines the deep mechanisms of the structural organization and functioning of such biopolymers as DNA, RNA, proteins, polysaccharides.  He is engaged in the construction of models and graphic images of these molecules, predicts the behavior and formation of them in living systems.  Also, this discipline builds supramolecular and submolecular systems in order to determine the mechanism of construction and action of biopolymers in living systems. </li><li>  Cell biophysics.  It studies the most important cellular processes: differentiation, division, excitation and biopotentials of the membrane structure.  Particular attention is paid to the mechanisms of membrane transport of substances, potential differences, properties and structure of the membrane and its surrounding parts. </li><li>  Biophysics of metabolism.  The main <span>processes</span> under consideration <span>: photosynthesis,</span> solarization and adaptation of organisms to it, hemodynamics, heat regulation, metabolism, the influence of ionization rays. </li><li>  Applied Biophysics.  It consists of several disciplines: bioinformatics, biometrics, biomechanics, the study of evolutionary processes and ontogenesis, pathological (medical) biophysics.  The objects of study of applied biophysics are the musculoskeletal system, methods of movement, methods of recognizing people by physical features.  Of particular note is medical biophysics.  She considers pathological processes in organisms, methods of reconstruction of damaged sections of molecules or structures, or their compensation.  Provides material for biotechnology.  It is of great importance in preventing the development of diseases, especially of a genetic nature, in eliminating them and in explaining the mechanisms of action. </li><li>  Habitat biophysics - studies the physical impact of both local creature habitats and the influence of near and far outer space entities.  Also considers biorhythms, the influence of weather conditions and biofields on creatures.  Develops methods of measures to prevent the negative effects <span>of environmental conditions.</span> </li></ol><p>  All these disciplines make a tremendous contribution to the development of an understanding of the mechanisms of vital activity of living systems, the influence of the biosphere and various conditions on them. </p>

    <p>  It is very important to give a good start to future professionals.  Hard work awaits them.  The biophysicist is obliged to understand all the intricacies of the processes occurring in living beings.  In addition, students must understand physics.  After all, this is a complex science - biophysics.  Lectures are structured in such a way as to encompass all the disciplines related and constituting biophysics, and cover the consideration of issues of both a biological and physical nature. </p>
