    <h2>  How to make the trip enjoyable </h2><p>  Tourists nevertheless strive to get the maximum of impressions and vivid emotions, which is quite realistic, given the beauty of the countries that have to travel.  So the film can be watched at home, and not everyone considers such a trip a routine ritual. </p><p>  The best option is an audiobook, which makes it possible to look out the window and at the same time perceive information.  Women often do needlework along the way.  A long trip in the car is an event during which everyone should be comfortable.  Relatives often bother each other at home.  Now, with loved ones will have to be in a closed space and not quarrel somewhere along the road. </p><p>  If there are children in the cabin, the task is complicated at times.  It can be hard to calm them down.  And it‚Äôs good if the child has a calm character.  Not everyone manages to sit in one place for a long time.  It's good to play games in the style of the "Word".  They are distracting and suitable for all members of the company, as they do not require inventory and movement. </p><h2>  The importance of communication </h2><p>  Also, a trip is a great time to share interesting stories or read them aloud, and not separately, with subsequent discussion.  If in everyday life everyone is running about their business, not having time for a simple heart-to-heart talk, that very right moment has come. </p>
