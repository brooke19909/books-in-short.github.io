  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY do-it-yourself helicopter made from waste material</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A homemade helicopter can be made absolutely out of any junk material.  Before work, consider what parts the craft consists of, how many elements will be needed, how individual parts will be attached together.  You can make a simple static figure, for example, at an exhibition in a school or kindergarten, and if you try, it will be interesting to create a helicopter with moving parts - wheels and a screw. </p><p>  To create a homemade helicopter, you can use wooden blocks, wire, cardboard, plastic bottles or containers of detergents, corrugated cardboard packaging or egg cells.  The main thing is to recreate all the components of this type of transport.  This is a round or elongated case, from the bottom you can make either wheels or two skid gear.  Above the roof of the case there is always a rotating screw of 3 or 4 blades.  On the back of the helicopter make an elongated tail with a small vertical propeller. </p><p>  In the article, we consider several options for making a homemade helicopter and aircraft from a variety of materials.  The photographs presented will help to reproduce a similar structure at home, because the difficulties in work consist only in fixing structural elements to each other.  Here you need to use strong glue or wire.  Learn more later in the article. </p><h2>  Wire helicopter </h2><p>  To create a wire helicopter, you can use both ordinary thin wire and the material in the shell.  An option looks like an interesting combination of both, for example, the body and tail are twisted from wire in a bright colored shell, and all other elements are made from ordinary aluminum or copper wire, as in the main photo in the article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wire helicopter" class="if uuid-2705870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2705870.jpg"></div><p>  For work, you will need a coil of wire and tongs with rounded edges for fastening parts by turns.  Such a helicopter can be made at an exhibition at school or as a model on a shelf.  This option is not entirely suitable for a child, because nothing moves in it, and children like brighter and more dynamic toys. </p><h2>  We use cardboard packaging for eggs </h2><p>  Such home-made helicopters can be made with older preschool children in kindergarten in manual classes.  The blanks of the body and the tail can be cut by the tutor.  To attach the screw, you need to cut two strips out of cardboard, a bolt and a nut, a plastic bottle cap, gouache paints for decoration, thick PVA glue or a glue gun will also be useful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Egg Helicopter" class="if uuid-2705902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2705902.jpg"></div><p>  How to make a homemade helicopter, educator or teacher tells children in detail before class.  First, the tail is glued to the body and the bottle cap is on top.  It is best if an aperture is made on it.  Older children will be able to do this themselves on a wooden plank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Then two identical strips of yellow double-sided cardboard are cut along the lines under the ruler, and a hole for the bolt is made in the center.  Before connecting the parts, it is advisable to paint the helicopter with paints by drawing a windshield and painting the body.  After drying, you can attach the screw on top by inserting a bolt, and tighten the nut tight from below. </p><h2>  Option of plastic container </h2><p>  Such a simple homemade helicopter can be done by kids under the guidance of adults.  You will need a liter container of any color, 3 or 4 plastic bottle caps, several wooden ice cream sticks to create a screw and skis.  If desired, you can decorate the craft with bright adhesive tape, paints or gluing small details - flowers, letters or geometric shapes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kolag.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Helicopter from a plastic bottle" class="if uuid-2705889" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2705889.jpg"></div><p>  Consider carefully the finished work in the photo above.  Making a craft is quite simple.  Super glue or glue gun, attach one cover on top and two on the bottom.  Prepare ice cream sticks in advance by painting them with gouache paints in different bright colors.  Attach them to the top cover with a snowflake.  From below, two parallel sticks will serve as ‚Äúskis‚Äù for the helicopter.  It remains only to decorate the model at will with different elements or colors. </p><h2>  Ice Cream Sticks Helicopter </h2><p>  You can also make a homemade helicopter from one of the wooden sticks of ice cream.  It is best to pre-draw his diagram on a piece of paper, calculating how many sticks will be needed for one or another part.  You can achieve the required size of parts with strong scissors or a hacksaw on a tree.  To prevent the edges from becoming shaggy, treat them with sandpaper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="warganet.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ice Cream Sticks Helicopter" class="if uuid-2705892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2705892.jpg"></div><p>  Connections are made with a glue gun, and moving parts are held on screws. </p><h2>  Wooden models </h2><p>  If you have the abilities of a joiner, then you can make a child a <span>toy helicopter</span> or plane from wooden planks or the remains of plywood.  You will need a jigsaw and a grinder. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wooden helicopter" class="if uuid-2706089" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2706089.jpg"></div><p>  Options for making models already depend on your skills and imagination.  The material will go a bit, you can glue the crafts from individual trims. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wooden plane" class="if uuid-2705884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2705884.jpg"></div><p>  The article presents the crafts of helicopters and airplanes from various materials that can be done at home with children.  Accustom children to manual labor, the ability to fantasize and plan work.  Making homemade toys is interesting to all the guys, especially the boys.  After all, how nice it is to brag to friends that the toy is made independently. </p>
