  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Primitive society</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  History is divided into two layers: primitive society and civilization.  The initial <span>stage in the development of mankind</span> is the primitive system, which covers a period of more than two million years, when there were no state entities, legal norms have not yet been formed. </p><p>  During its existence, primitive society has passed a significant evolutionary path, during which there has been a change in its sociocultural image and economic structure.  There are two main stages of primitive society: the first is the appropriating economy, the second is the producing economy.  The change of stages occurs in the Neolithic era <span>(Neolithic revolution),</span> in the 8-3 millennium BC </p><p>  The first stage is characterized by the formation of <span>man as a biosocial being.</span>  <span>People</span> used the simplest stone tools, lived by appropriating the products of nature (gathering, fishing, hunting), led a wandering lifestyle, united in local groups under the leadership of the leader.  This simplest form of life and social organization, reflecting the low level of development of production, social and cultural relations, is called the primitive herd or great community.  However, despite the randomness of the internal life of the herd, it traces the first <span>social norms of the</span> primitive society, rules, standards and other behavioral stereotypes. </p><p>  Natural instincts begin to recede before sociocultural stereotypes.  Relations within the group are egalitarian.  The distribution of food and other resources occurs evenly.  The basis of such equality is the equivalent exchange (as food, tools, and wives, etc.).  The leader‚Äôs power over the group is very expressive.  His will is perceived by the herd as the norm. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The increasing complexity of social ties, changes in marriage (the appearance of exogamy prohibiting marriage between blood relatives) and the Neolithic revolution led to the emergence of family-clan groups.  There was a change of herd to a <span>tribal community,</span> which was based on kinship.  Community relations could be built according to the principles of matrilineal or patrilineal. </p><p>  The history of primitive society after the Neolithic revolution enters a new round.  People are moving to a manufacturing economy, which allows them not only to ensure their survival, but also to begin to purposefully provide themselves with food and other items necessary for life.  This became a prerequisite for the transition to a settled lifestyle.  Gradually, separate family-clan groups establish control over a certain territory.  The primitive herd turns into a strong group of producers that has expanded numerically and connected with a certain territory.  The new social organization is based on self-government and self-regulation. </p><p>  At this stage of development, primitive society moves to a fixed division of labor, food distribution, and <span>marriage and family relations.</span>  The principles of equality and egalitarianism are still maintained.  But, at the same time, the distribution of production could be made taking into account the role functions of its participants (on the basis of sex, age, etc.).  Advantages in the team were possessed by its leader.  Around him were concentrated members of the group, who, in return for the benefits they provided, recognized the authority of the leader.  So there was a pre-state form of government. </p><p>  In tribal communities, there are already rules of conduct that are mandatory for all members of her team.  Generic norms were associated with totems, had a mythological coloring.  The distribution of production becomes regulated, the leader takes control of this process.  <span>Social relations</span> are self-tuning: they are supported by interests, religious beliefs and other value orientations.  But this did not exclude compulsory adherence to the norms developed by primitive society.  With taboo violations, the perpetrator could even be expelled or put to death. </p>
