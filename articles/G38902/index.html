There are many ways, so you can start learning in very simple ways.  This article will discuss how <span>to make an origami kitten</span> with your own hands. </p><h2>  Materials and Tools </h2><p>  Before you start creating an origami kitten from paper, you need to prepare: </p><ul><li>  colored paper; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  marker and simple pencil; </li><li>  eraser; </li><li>  a ruler. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Origami kitten" class="if uuid-2233539" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62827/2233539.jpg"></div><p>  You can not do without PVA glue, as some schemes of origami kitten from paper are made of two parts.  In such cases, thick paper is chosen for the body so that the head holds well.  Marker pens or markers are used to draw faces.  On volume origami glued eyes look beautiful.  They can be cut out of paper or purchased ready-made. </p><h2>  Simple origami kitten </h2><p>  The most important thing is to know the correct sequence of actions.  For those who are just starting to get acquainted with this technique, simple (flat) origami is suitable.  The first easy way is to craft from one square.  On a piece of paper, draw a square with a simple pencil and cut it out.  Bend opposite corners to make a triangle.  Two angles are connected along the fold line, the center is pressed, it will be the middle.  The left and right edges are bent from the marked center so that a figure resembling a tulip is obtained.  Take the upper corner and bend to yourself.  The resulting figure is turned over to itself and a muzzle is drawn with a marker (eyes, antennae, nose, mouth). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Origami kitten made of paper" class="if uuid-2233511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62827/2233511.jpg"></div><p>  There is another easy way to create a muzzle.  To do this, take a square from paper and bend diagonally.  Then fold in half again, bending is not smooth.  This is done in order to mark the center line, which will help origami to be symmetrical.  The workpiece is positioned so that the fold line is below.  The lower corners bend upward, while the central corner should be visible.  It is bent down a little.  Turn the resulting origami over and draw it up. </p><h2>  Origami kitten made of two squares of paper </h2><p>  You will need two squares of the same size, which are cut out of colored paper.  The first square is bent diagonally (from left to right).  The right corner is slightly bent to the left side to get the tail of a kitten.  The torso is ready. </p><p>  To make a kitten‚Äôs head, take a second square from paper, place it at any angle upward and bend it in the middle.  The result should be a triangle.  Two upper corners are taken from him and folded so that their vertices are aligned with the top of the lower corner.  Gently push the folds and these same corners do not completely bend up.  You should get two triangles and a corner looking between them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="esmeraldaarribas.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make an origami kitten" class="if uuid-2233522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62827/2233522.jpg"></div><p>  Then gently stretch the corners in different directions and straighten the folds that were done earlier.  The result is again a triangle, in which the vertex is at the bottom, and it has four fold lines.  Bottom layers of paper begin to separate.  And the folds that have formed are pressed inward.  Thus, the figure of a rhombus with ears should turn out.  The upper corner is bent back, while the bend is well ironed and tucked into a layer of paper.  The torso is inserted inside the head and the legs are spread out to the sides. </p><h2>  Modular origami </h2><p>  Although this technique can be mastered independently, the most difficult is the modular origami.  The whole figure consists of individual elements (modules), which are attached to each other by nesting each other.  Such an origami kitten will look voluminous and impressive, so the effort expended will justify itself. </p><h2>  Some tips </h2><ol><li>  To make the craft look spectacular, take colored paper. </li><li>  To put an origami, it is made of thick paper. </li><li>  A great addition would be a paper kitty house. </li></ol><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="eOh2LGP1z4E" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOh2LGP1z4E" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/2/1/7/217.jpg"></div><p>  The origami technique is great for practicing with children, contributes to the development of logic and thinking. </p>
