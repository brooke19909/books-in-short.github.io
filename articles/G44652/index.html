After all, you can make both complex and simple flowers from balls.  Beginners should take note of the easiest ways to create a composition, for this you need to act in the following order: </p><ol><li>  Choose balls, it is usually easier for beginners to work with small round ones. </li><li>  Using a pump, inflate all elements. </li><li>  Connect the balls with a thread in the form of a flower. </li><li>  You can combine colors in a chaotic manner or create a semblance of natural colors by taking white and yellow balls. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.balloonexperts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Balloon Flowers for Beginners" class="if uuid-2594282" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45125/2594282.jpg"></div><p>  These daisy flowers will decorate the wall for someone‚Äôs birthday or will be a great substitute for living bouquets. </p><h2>  Bouquet of long balls </h2><p>  To create unusual presents use balls for modeling, they are called SHDM for short.  Products are oblong, resemble a sausage or sausage.  Round shapes may also be used.  Working with this type of material and creating various shapes from it is called twisting.  In order not to make mistakes and not waste time wasting flowers from balls, it is recommended to study the master class before starting the process. </p><p>  Work steps described in steps: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  First of all, you need to choose the right balls.  Despite the apparent similarity, the products are different, which affects the complexity of creating compositions from them.  There are ShDM of different lengths, diameters, colors.  Before you buy the main material, you need to familiarize yourself with the markings written on the package. </li><li>  When the balls are acquired, you can begin to create.  The first step in the process is to inflate the elements of the future flower.  You can inflate the SDM with a hand pump or with your own efforts.  The main thing is that 3 centimeters remain free from air at the end of the product on a ball designed for the flower itself. </li><li>  When the element is ready, you need to make a circle out of it, firmly connecting the beginning and end of the ‚Äúsausage‚Äù. </li><li>  Then this ring needs to be twisted several times in the middle, having previously folded the composition in half.  Then you need to repeat, creating the third ring. </li><li>  The next step is to twist the prepared element in the middle.  Fold all three coiled rings together with an accordion.  In the middle, fix the ball with your fingers and twist.  After that, you should get a figure similar to the petals of a flower. </li><li>  Then you can begin to create a stalk.  To do this, fully inflate the green ball.  The end must be tightly tied so that air does not exit the product.  Having retreated approximately 10 centimeters from the top of the ball, twist the ball.  This will be the middle of the flower.  After inserting the middle into the flower, the product can be considered completed. </li></ol><p>  You can give one ball to the person for whom it is intended, or create a whole bouquet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="whatssogoodaboutpubliceducation.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Master class on creating flowers from balloons" class="if uuid-2594248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45125/2594248.jpg"></div><h2>  Round Ball Flowers </h2><p>  Experienced creators of compositions from SDM can make incredible figures and bouquets from balls of various shapes.  In addition to long products, round ones are also used.  To make a whole composition of flowers from balls, the instruction will be required even by the most experienced master.  For work should prepare: </p><ul><li>  Round and long balls of different colors. </li><li>  Pump. </li><li>  Thread or tape. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.celebrateitballoons.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY balloons" class="if uuid-2594271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45125/2594271.jpg"></div><p>  The sequence of actions is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Inflate the balls and make the right amount of daisies. </li><li>  Then five round balls are inflated and connected into a flower so that one of the SDMs is at the top, while the others can firmly stand on the surface. </li><li>  Daisies with ribbons or threads are attached to round balls, namely under the bottom of the one that protrudes upwards. </li><li>  Then all the daisies must be raised up and tied in the middle of the stems with a beautiful ribbon or a bright ball.  This will make the composition complete and aesthetic.  Thus, the flowers will look like a real huge bouquet that will impress and delight both adults and children.  In addition, it will be the most original decoration of the festive table, and no one will be allergic to it. </li></ol><h2>  What event is this bouquet suitable for </h2><p>  Having studied the master class on making flowers from balls, everyone will understand that there is nothing complicated in creating such a composition.  You can use imagination and come up with a variety of shapes from flowers.  Such a creation will be a great gift: </p><ul><li>  To birthday, in order to surprise the birthday boy. </li><li>  To the wedding. </li><li>  To the international women's day for the fair sex of the whole team. </li><li>  For children's birthday. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.thesprucecrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flowers from balloons master class" class="if uuid-2594335" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45125/2594335.jpg"></div><ul><li>  For those people who are allergic to fresh flowers. </li><li>  On New Year's holidays. </li><li>  On a date.
