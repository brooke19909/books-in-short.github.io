    <h2>  Hydronym </h2><p>  The name of the lake in translation into Russian means "black".  It received such a hydronym because of the dark green color of water.  However, this does not mean that the pond is dirty, it just reflects conifers growing around.  These forests surround Crno Jezero so densely that its surface appears black.  That is why it is called Black Lake. </p><h2>  Briefly about the main thing </h2><p>  <span>Black Lake</span> is glacial.  It is considered one of the most beautiful in this region and the largest among similar reservoirs of Montenegro.  The water in it is not at all cloudy, but crystal clear, and therefore, in calm weather, you can easily see the bottom.  The lake itself and the surrounding area have gained worldwide fame thanks to its incredible beauty and grandeur, which are described in the works of many writers.  Now this place is quite popular not only among residents of Montenegro itself, but also among visiting tourists from other countries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crno Jesero" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1361982.jpg" width="600"></div>

You can drive from the center of Zabljak in just a few minutes (distance of about 3 km).  If you look at this pond from a height, you can easily see that it consists of two lakes: the Big and the Small.  They are interconnected by a narrow channel 60 m long. In the hot season, it completely dries up.  As a result, Black Lake (Montenegro) turns into two separate bodies of water.  Large covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 0.6 km <sup>2</sup> .  It stretches more than 800 m in length and does not exceed 700 m in width. The maximum depth here reaches almost 25 m. Small Lake covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 0.2 km <sup>2</sup> .  Its width is about 400 m, and its length is 600 m. But the depth of this reservoir is almost half more than in the first (almost 50 m). </p><h2>  Local legend </h2><p>  The local population has one <span>interesting legend,</span> which is associated with the Black Lake.  It is believed that one saint, when walking through this area, was unjustly accused of theft, and all the villagers pursued him.  In punishment for this, he sent a flood to them, as a result of which the village was under the Small Lake, and the surrounding area - under the Big. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="black lake montenegro how to get" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1361980.jpg" width="600"></div>

The conifers themselves in the lower parts of the trunks are covered with moss, and wild berries grow at their foot. </p><p>  Around the lake is Durmitor Park, which has many paths for cycling and hiking.  Many mountain streams flow into the reservoir, the largest of which is Mlinsky.  In spring, when the snow begins to melt, they turn into beautiful waterfalls. </p><p>  Black Lake (Montenegro) is not the only body of water in these places.  In the park you can see others, however, they are much smaller, but also very beautiful. </p><h2>  Rest on the lake </h2><p>  In summer, the air temperature in this region averages +20 ¬∞ .  The water in the lake is not warming fast enough.  Therefore, the temperature difference is quite noticeable.  The discrepancy is about 4 ¬∞ C.  However, this does not stop tourists.  They come here not only to ride boats and sunbathe, but also to swim. </p><p>  For a good rest, all the necessary conditions are created here - arbors, benches are set, even a local restaurant functions, to which a specially constructed hiking trail leads.  This food service serves a variety of national dishes.  There are signs throughout Durmitor Park that make it impossible to get lost or go astray. </p><p>  Fishing on the Black Lake in Montenegro also deserves attention.  Trout, of various species, lives in large quantities in the reservoir.  This is a lake, California, river.  You can catch it only on artificial baits.  The unique thing is that even sitting on a boat, you can see how a fish swims to the hook - so clear water in the lake.  Fishing is paid, and it is advisable to discuss all the nuances with the caretaker in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing on the black lake in montenegro" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1361983.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mount Bobotov Cook </h2><p>  In these places, tourists are offered a varied recreation program.  Of course, in the summer season what could be nicer than sitting on the banks of a clean reservoir.  However, those who prefer an active holiday, it is recommended to visit one of the highest mountains - Bobotov-Kuk, next to which is Black Lake (Montenegro).  The height of the peak is 2523 m. Its slopes are quite steep, so climbing is recommended only under the supervision of experienced instructors.  Those who are already considered professional climbers will not be difficult to conquer the peak.  Climbing on average takes about 7 hours.  And in the winter, tourists are invited to visit the Ice Cave, which is also located near the lake. </p><h2>  Black Lake (Montenegro): how to get there? </h2><p>  Many tourists are interested in how to get to the Black Lake.  Given the local roads, the best option would be to rent a car.  Those who use the navigator or map will find it useful to know the coordinates of this place: 43 ¬∞ 08‚Ä≤43 ‚Ä≥ s.  w.  and 19 ¬∞ 05‚Ä≤23 ‚Ä≥ in.  can also be reached by public transport that travels from Budva or Kotor.  However, flights are made only twice a day. </p>
