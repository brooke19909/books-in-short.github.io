    <p>  Among the <span>attractions of Pokrovsky</span> Square, located in the center of Rostov-on-Don, the Pokrovsky Church, which is located in the central part of the square and has a rich history, deserves special mention.  It is also worth noting that other architectural monuments located in the square deserve no less attention. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main feature of Pokrovsky Square is not only the historical component, but also the fact that the square, like other parks in Rostov-on-Don, has become a real center of cultural life of the city. </p><h2>  An excursion into the history of the temple </h2><p>  The history of the temple began back in the 18th century with the founding of the fortress of St. Anne (currently this place is not far from the village of Starocherkasskaya), whose main function was to protect our southern borders from Turkish troops.  Later, due to the improper location of the fortress, constant spring floods, it was abolished.  And in its place, according to the decree of Empress Elizabeth, the so-called Temernitsky customs was built, which was needed for trade with the Turks and control of imported goods. </p><p>  At the same time, the construction of the famous St.  <span>Demetrius of Rostov,</span> which was of very strategic importance and was the largest military facility in southern Russia.  It was from this fortress that the formation of Rostov-on-Don began.  The temple was erected on the central square of the fortress, its parts were transported from Anninsky fortress.  For a long time the status of the church was defined as serfdom, the reason for this is that the military made up the bulk of the parishioners, but over time, when the population increased, the church acquired the status of a parish. </p><p>  It is worth mentioning separately the distinguished guests who visited the temple - these are A.V. Suvorov and Fedor Ushakov, who began his service in this fortress.  Even Emperor Alexander I, who traveled the southern lands in the last years of his life.  Later the temple had to go through several perestroika, and in the XX century, due to mass unrest in the Don, which included a severe civil war and revolution, the temple was destroyed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Temple today </h2><p>  The church in Pokrovsky Square in Rostov-on-Don was recently restored: the construction was completed in 2007 with the voluntary donations of patrons.  The church was built by the famous architect Shevchenko G.A. </p>

    <p>  The Art Nouveau temple with elements of the Orthodox style was built.  The decoration of the church impresses with its majestic marble walls, large arches, burgundy granite floor and iconostasis, which was carved from white marble by Ural craftsmen.  The painting of the building itself was carried out by artists from the city of Novocherkassk.  Today we can contemplate the temple on the central square of Pokrovsky Square. </p><h2>  Monument to Elizaveta Petrovna </h2><p>  In 2007, Pokrovsky Square in Rostov-on-Don was enriched with another piece of art.  A stately bronze figure of the Empress Elizabeth Petrovna appeared near the temple, which is rightfully considered one of the founders of the city.  In her hands is a decree on the foundation of the Temernitsky Customs, which gave rise to the formation of Rostov-on-Don.  The monument stepped over a seven-meter mark in height, and its weight reaches three tons.  The author of the monument is artist Sergey Oleshnya, whose sculptures adorn many cities in southern Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Few people know the history of the creation of this magnificent monument.  It all started with a competition for the best design of a monument that would decorate the historical part of the city.  All Rostovites participated, leaving their wishes.  The decision on the appearance and decoration of the monument was made by a special commission.  It included eminent architects, artists, historians and members of the city administration. </p><p>  For the accuracy and reliability of the monument, the sculptors spent a lot of time studying the fashion of that time and portraits of Elizaveta Petrovna.  The Empress‚Äôs jewelry was ordered from a real jeweler - Alexander Ordynsky.  He created bronze replicas of the crown, earrings and bracelet worn by the empress. </p><h2>  Tribute to the first water supply in the city </h2><p>  Another charming monument of the square does not in vain deserve the attention of tourists.  This monument belongs to the first water supply in the city, which appeared in the XIX century.  According to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe author, Sergey Oleshni, it is a column next to which a woman stands, because it was she who was supposed to provide her family with drinking water.  The height of the monument reaches two meters. </p>

    <p>  The appearance of the monument is associated with the initiative of the water utility of Rostov-on-Don.  Its opening was accompanied by a bright costumed performance on the theme of the first water supply, where the main role was played by the actor depicting the mayor - Andrei Baykov, who made an invaluable contribution to the development of the city, and it was with him that the first water supply began to work. </p><p>  It is known that the length of the city water supply in the second half of the 19th century was only 5 km.  In our time, the development of infrastructure and urban facilities has greatly simplified life for Rostov residents. </p><h2>  Events in the Pokrovsky square of Rostov-on-Don </h2><p>  <span>This square</span> has long acquired the status of the center of the cultural life of the population.
