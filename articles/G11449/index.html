    <p>  Braslav lakes, photos of which cannot but fascinate even the most sophisticated tourists, are located in the Vitebsk region.  This means that from the capital of the state, the city of Minsk, to the lakes, it is necessary to overcome a distance of about 250 km. </p><p>  How to get there depends on the vacationers themselves.  On the whole, we note that you can get to the lakes by any <span>type of transport</span> (own car, bus, taxi).  Regular flights are carried out from Polotsk, Vitebsk and Minsk to Bratslav. </p><p>  However, travelers should remember one thing: if they go to the Braslav Lakes, the recreation centers must be picked up and booked in advance, because there are only five of them.  During the season, rooms or houses may not be available. </p><p>  In addition, the park has many tourist camps with ennobled toilets, wooden gazebos, safe ramps to the water, stone bonfires and fenced waste bins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Rest on the Braslav lakes.

    <p>  Braslav Lakes is a national park in which the ponds themselves contributed to the creation of a large variety of flora and fauna. </p><p>  The main wealth of this area is the aquatic ecological, incredibly diverse and unique system.  The flora of this region is represented by more than 800 species of plants, including rare ones, listed in the Red Book of the World. </p><p>  Braslav lakes, reviews of which, as a rule, are the most enthusiastic, are rich in their living creatures.  About 40 species of fish are found here. </p><p>  It should also be noted that 35% of the <span>birds of Belarus</span> nest in this territory.  Among them we can distinguish a mute swan, which several years ago almost completely disappeared as a species.  Now, fortunately, its population has been restored. </p><p>  In addition, wild boars, <span>brown bears,</span> lynxes, elks, badgers, roe deer, flying squirrels and so on are found in large numbers in the district. </p><p>  Also in the lakes live relict vertebrates, which, of course, indicates the purity of the water. </p><p>  In the southern part of the park are forests that cover an area of ​​about 31,000 ha.  Spruce forests are especially widespread here. </p><h2>  Walk on Castle Hill </h2><p>  Whatever <span>type of vacation</span> you choose in the territory of the Braslav Lakes park (sanatorium, camp site or tent city), you must definitely visit local sights. </p><p>  Why not go to conquer the local heights?  Castle Hill is a historical monument, an ancient fortification located in the center of Braslav.  Castle Hill is a high hill with steep slopes and a flat mountain that rises above the modest houses located at the base.  The Castle Hill site is surrounded by shafts on all sides, some of them are 7 meters high.  On the commemorative sign affixed here, it is indicated that the mountain is the place of foundation of Braslav. </p><p>  In the ancient city were found materials telling about the ancient history of the city.  Legends say that underground passages were excavated in Castle Hill, which, in the event of a siege of the fortress, led besieged citizens to Lake Drivyaty.  More legends tell of treasure chests, golden knightly armor and the mysterious shadow of the princess inside the dungeon. </p><h2>  Features of local fishing </h2><p>  Braslav Lakes is a national park that attracts all, without exception, lovers of quiet hunting. </p><p>  The local water system occupies 114 km <sup>2</sup> .  The largest lakes by area are Drivyaty, Strusto, Snudy, Troops, Nespish and Nedrovo.  In 1995, this group of lakes was officially made the core of the national park. </p><p>  To go fishing on the Braslav Lakes legally, you must either buy a ticket to a local sanatorium, or otherwise you will have to fish on free lakes. </p><p>  It should be remembered: in order to catch a good catch, skill is necessary.  But for those who are not very successful in this business, paid fishing at the ponds in Mekyan is recommended.  There are many carp of different weights and ages.  The ticket price includes permission to catch 5 kg of fish. </p><h2>  Along the ecological trail </h2>

    <p>  A four and a half kilometer long <span>ecological trail</span> stretches along the ridge of the Braslav Lakes. </p><p>  During the creation of the national park, the ecological trail has undergone enormous transformations aimed at its arrangement.  Today, along the entire path, places have been built for vacationers, points of view, walking paths and information stands about the historical heritage and natural wealth of the territory.  Such an improved ecological trail allows visitors to the Braslav Lakes to discover this land from a new perspective. </p><h2>  Unique place </h2><p>  It is simply impossible to visit the Braslav lakes, photos of which are found in all travel guides of Belarus without exception, and not to visit this settlement.  In fact, lately the most interesting place for tourists has been precisely the village of Slobodka with its surroundings and the ridge. </p><p>  It is distinguished by a wonderful church and magnificent lace lakes.  On a unique small ridge with perfectly preserved glacial relief, among rare plant species, ancient towns and villages of the Middle Ages rise. </p><h2>  What else to see next door </h2><p>  In addition to the lakes of the same name, the Castle Hill, built in the 9th-15th centuries, the Church of the Virgin Mary and the church built in 1897 also belong to the <span>sights of Braslav</span> .  Also at the beginning of the twentieth century the building of the convent was erected. </p><p>  In addition, you should definitely visit Mount Lighthouse with a height of 174 m, which is the best observation point of the surroundings and lakes. </p><p>  Not far from Braslav you can see island castles in the villages, Klyashtor Island on Lake Nespish, the town of Maskovici, barrows and so on. </p>
