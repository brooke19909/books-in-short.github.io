In general, everything related to the taxation system for older people.  This question is extremely important.  And he cares about the majority of the population.  It's no secret that people who have gone on a well-deserved rest have certain privileges in Russia.  But do they apply to real estate, property and property? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="property tax for seniors" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1199341.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Do I have to pay </h2><p>  In general, if any <span>tax notices</span> come to your address, they really need to be paid.  Not always, but often.  The fact is that <span>property tax for pensioners</span> can be divided into several categories of persons.  And very often, many payments do not have exceptions for older people. </p><p>  What does it mean?  Everything is very simple: when a payment arrives, it should be paid.  But remember, if you have an exemption or exemption from payment, according to the rules established in the region, you will have to declare them to the tax authorities.  Otherwise, you may pay and not know that you are being charged illegally.  What are real estate taxes?  Who can not pay them? </p><h2>  Eternal beneficiaries </h2><p>  To begin with, very often a property tax for retirees has a place to be unpaid.  Indeed, many elderly people simply relate in parallel to one of the mandatory categories of beneficiaries, which are generally exempted from paying most of the contributions to real estate and property. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most often these are disabled people of groups 1 and 2.  Such citizens are completely exempted from depositing funds in the state treasury for real estate.  Therefore, this fact must be taken into account.  Further, organizations involved in the transportation and transportation of persons with disabilities.  Large families quite often are also exempt from property taxes.  Veterans and heroes of the Soviet Union are regular beneficiaries.  In the end, participants in hostilities belong to this category of persons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pensioners pay real estate tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1199340.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Pensioners pay real estate tax?  If they belong to one of the above categories, then no.  This is 100%.  But all other cases will have to be considered individually. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  Transport tax is a huge issue for many.  Sometimes many taxpayers try to evade him.  Please note that this is a regional payment.  This means that the exact rules regarding him will be established exclusively in each subject on their own. </p><p>  But no one forgets about the elderly.  They are exempted from transport tax in all regions only if they have a vehicle with a low-power engine (from 70 to 150 horsepower, see the exact information in your area).  Otherwise, you have to pay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="real estate tax payment by pensioners" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1199339.jpg"></div>

Most often, older people pay only half of the payment received.  The exemption applies only to one car.  If the senior citizen owns two vehicles, you can choose only one for discounts.  And the second payment is paid in full. </p><h2>  Land </h2><p>  The next question that interests many is whether pensioners pay the so-called land tax.  In Russia, uniform rules have been established for all taxpayers.  What does it mean? </p><p>  It's simple: pensioners must pay the annual fees for the land that they own.  No discounts or features.  Although in some regions, pensioners may be allowed not to pay it.  Such a practice is extremely rare, we can say that it does not have a place to be at all.  Thus, the payment of real estate tax by pensioners, when it comes to land, is made in full. </p><h2>  Property </h2><p>  The next question that interests many is the property tax.  Just it is called "for real estate" by citizens.  This term is usually used with reference to apartments, houses and other housing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="property sales tax for pensioners" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1199338.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Little is known, but pensioners do not pay property tax.  In general, nowhere, in any subject of the Russian Federation.  Only payments anyway from year to year will come to your address.  Until you claim your rights and benefits.  So pensioners do not pay property tax at all.  Therefore, many citizens rewrite their apartments to the elderly - this is a legitimate way to evade paying tax.  Everything is according to the law. </p><h2>  Sales </h2><p>  What should I do if a citizen who has gone on a well-deserved rest decides to sell some of his property?  The tax on the sale of real estate to pensioners is due.  Moreover, there are no exceptions for them. </p><p>  What does it mean?  Upon receipt of income from the sale (or any other process), it will be necessary to return to the state treasury the statutory 13% of profits.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter if a <span>pensioner works</span> with it or not.  The fact remains.  So, when it comes to sales taxes, you will have to pay all receipts in full.  No discounts or exceptions.  These are the rules. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="real estate tax payment by pensioners" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1199337.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Where and how to contact </h2><p>  Property tax for pensioners (Moscow and other regions of the country) is supposed to be paid, as you see, almost always.  However, if you have the right to a benefit or full exemption, as already mentioned, you will have to declare this.  Otherwise, they will continue to demand money from you.  And this is not entirely good.  The appeal is extremely simple - just bring some documents to the tax authority in your region and wait for the result.  Present: </p><ul><li>  application for exemption (with several, only one is selected); </li><li>  documents confirming the right to a discount; </li><li>  disability certificates (if any); </li><li>  passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  SNILS; </li><li>  TIN (preferably); </li><li>  <span>pension certificate</span> ; </li><li>  documents of ownership (+ Title for transport); </li><li>  military ID (for military personnel participating in hostilities). </li></ul>

    <p>  If for some reason you paid property taxes when you had the opportunity to refuse this payment, a refund is processed.  True, only in the last 3 years.  It is necessary to apply for the operation to the <span>tax office</span> in your city.  The documents you need are listed above.  But they will have to be supplemented.  Than?  Attach to the list also all declarations, as well as paid payments.  The bank details of the account will be useful, where you will need to transfer funds.  There is nothing difficult about this.  The main thing is to contact the tax office if your rights have been violated.  After some time, the funds paid will be returned to you.  This process, as a rule, does not take too much time. </p>
