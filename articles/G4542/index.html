Any digital devices are most sold on the eve of the summer.  Residents of states go on vacation abroad, spend holidays that they so want to capture in photographs. </p><p>  However, before choosing a model for yourself, you should pay attention to what the buyer will shoot with this device.  If you want to take photos of the nature or architecture of the city, then you need to take note of the model with an improved lens.  The more significant it will be able to enlarge the image, the more such a device will fit.  Accordingly, you need to pay attention to the ultrasound.  The optimal solution would be a Fujifilm FinePix S2950 device.  An overview of this device is presented in the article.  It should be noted right away that the camera is capable of working with 18x zoom.  Even with this, the device has small dimensions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fujifilm finepix s2950" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1642553.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The design of the device can be called the most stylish and interesting.  Appearance sometimes resembles a semi-professional.  People who do not understand the types of cameras may think that the owner is holding a mirror or system device in their hands.  However, it would not be worth expecting a more solid design, because the price of the device does not exceed 10 thousand rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General characteristics </h2><p>  First of all, the lens is striking.  He received large dimensions, the manufacturer did not begin to hide it in the case.  Due to this, the aperture is optimal and at a high level.  Considering all ranges of focus, it must be said that this indicator, if it falls, is not critical.  Aperture characteristics: the minimum value is F3.1, the maximum is F5.6.  The Fujifilm FinePix S2950 camera (the characteristics are discussed in more detail below) received 14 optical elements, which can be divided into 11 groups. </p><p>  The manufacturer did not distinguish a sensor by anything distinctive.  The diagonal is small.  The matrix, unfortunately, was created on the basis of a long-old technology, but the developer was able to ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù out of it a maximum of indicators.  Resolution was reduced to 14 megapixels.  This is done so that the photocells do not interfere with each other during operation.  Accordingly, the buyer, acquiring the model Fujifilm FinePix S2950, ‚Äã‚Äãgets the opportunity to take pictures at high sensitivity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fujifilm finepix s2950 reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1642555.jpg" width="593"></div>

    <h2>  Low light photos </h2><p>  If there is a need to take photographs in poor lighting, it is best to change the shutter speed - increase it.  However, raising them to the maximum level is not worth it, as the noise that appears will be striking.  Moreover, even a dual photo stabilizer will not help in such a situation.  If there is a tripod, then you need to use it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When shooting in low light, it is advisable to pay attention to the flash.  She got the maximum power in the Fujifilm FinePix S2950.  Its lighting radius is 8 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fujifilm finepix s2950 review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1642572.jpg" width="487"></div>

    <h2>  Independent settings and features </h2><p>  Like most similar devices, the described one was able to manually configure.  Consumers declare that they are all intuitive and convenient.  However, the interchangeable characteristics that are available for change do not greatly affect the quality of photographs. </p><p>  Added to Fujifilm FinePix S2950 and macro function.  It works great even in conditions where the subject is only a few centimeters from the camera.  A good feature of the device can be called the fact that it allows you to shoot video.  Its resolution is 1280 √ó 720 pixels.  This is enough to get a normal image.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot able to shoot Full HD quality materials, but consumers do not complain.  After recording, they are saved in the ‚Äúavi‚Äù format, so you can watch the video on any medium. </p><h2>  Extra options </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the lens was enlarged, the developers made the dimensions of the camera itself somewhat overall.  As a result, it was decided to install a particularly capacious battery in the Fujifilm FinePix S2950.  In order not to use an expensive battery, which would increase the cost of the device, the manufacturer made it possible to use four AA batteries.  They are much cheaper and easier to purchase.  In the kit, the manufacturer supplies the first "batch" of batteries.  As a rule, they are enough for 450 shots.  If you buy more powerful batteries, such as Durasel, then this figure will increase significantly.  By the way, the camera can last longer from one charge longer than all other electronic devices combined. </p><p>  The complete set of goods contains the device itself, batteries, instructions, a disk with software for operation and installation, a USB-type cord and a lens cap.  The camera, together with the battery, weighs about 440 g. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fujifilm finepix s2950 specifications" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1644030.jpg" width="541"></div>

    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  To summarize the Fujifilm FinePix S2950 review.  The reviews suggest that the price of this model is somewhat overstated and it is impossible to justify it with the built-in viewfinder and a good quality lens.  The design is modest, but quite interesting.  The matrix, which has long been outdated, can upset some amateur photographers.  That is why consumers are advised to buy this model for beginners, not professionals. </p>
