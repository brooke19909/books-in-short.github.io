Bugrinsky bridge in Novosibirsk: construction and opening</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Novosibirsk is a city with a population of one and a half million, located in the center of the Eurasian continent on the Ob River.  It is a major transport intersection of highways connecting the east, west and south of our large-scale country. </p><p>  The bridge in Novosibirsk became a symbol of his birth as a large industrial center.  The city began with the construction of a bridge for the Trans-Siberian Railway.  According to controversial data, the choice of a place for the construction of the bridge was argued by N.G. Garin-Mikhailovsky, whose name is currently at the forecourt square in Novosibirsk. </p><h2>  City of roads </h2><p>  Novonikolaevsk, modern Novosibirsk, rightfully bears the status of the capital of the Siberian region.  In 1891, it was a village called New Village with a small number of inhabitants.  In 1893, a bridge was built here, which became a milestone in the construction of the <span>Trans-Siberian Railway</span> and at the same time the birth date of the city on the Ob.  This event predetermined the fate of the modern Siberian capital.  Currently, the city is the center of transport routes connecting six federal highways, a river port and an airport of international importance.  Therefore, the development of transport links is one of the priority areas in the urban development policy.  The city is divided by a water artery into two shores, each of which is a vast industrial zone.  Given these features, the system of transport communications should provide for the active construction of bridges. </p><h2>  The new bridge as a way to solve old problems </h2><p>  The problem that any city with a population of one million is experiencing is particularly urgent - endless traffic jams, and sometimes collapses.  In the conditions of a difficult Siberian climate with high rainfall in winter, weather anomalies and snowdrifts on the roads, the construction of alternate, secondary and bypass roads is becoming a priority area of ‚Äã‚Äãurban development. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bridge in Novosibirsk" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/568401.jpg" width="600"></div>

The new bridge in Novosibirsk has become an important link in the creation of a unified transport system, taking into account this fact.  It is provided for by the urban development master plan. </p><h2>  The bridge in Novosibirsk is a symbol of the development of the city </h2><p>  The first construction (opened March 31, 1897) is associated with the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway and actually laid the foundation for the city.  The next bridge by historical date was commissioned on January 7, 1932 and received the name Komsomolsky Bridge.  It serves to pass the cargo flow in a southerly direction. </p><p>  Communal Bridge (the official name is October) was put into operation on October 20, 1955.  He solved the problem of constant transport links between the two banks of the Ob River. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new bridge in Novosibirsk" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/560327.jpg" width="600"></div>  Prior to its <span>commissioning,</span> communication between the two industrial zones was provided by a pontoon in the summer, and in winter, when a stable ice cover was reached.  This bridge became famous not only throughout the former Union, but also in foreign countries.  And all thanks to a professional military pilot.  Valentin Privalov flew exactly under the bridge at a distance of only one meter from the water, which is why he was subsequently arrested for hooliganism.

It was built using new technology using an all-welded span without the use of bolts. </p><p>  February 1985 - the launch of the metro bridge that connected the banks of the Ob for the lines of the Novosibirsk metro.  It is currently the longest in the world.  Another interesting fact was the actual length of the bridge.  This is not a constant.  Due to the large difference in air temperature during the year, it can stretch (in summer) and contract (in winter) by about 50 centimeters.  Especially for this feature there are technical devices in the form of rollers on supports. </p><p>  In 2007, a bridge was put into operation at the gateway of a <span>hydroelectric power station (HPP).</span>  The history of the construction of bridges in Novosibirsk is a milestone in the development of the city as the largest industrial center and transport hub of the Eurasian continent. </p><p>  In 2014, the third transport highway across the Ob became the famous Bugrinsky Bridge.  The design of the fourth and fifth is on the way.  And in a strategic perspective, the sixth and seventh bridges are to be commissioned. </p><h2>  From Olovozavodsky to the Bugrinsky bridge - an era-long road </h2><p>  The need for new transportation options on the two banks of the Ob River sharply arose in the last century.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãconstruction was rapidly developing in the 80s.  However, due to subjective (protests of the defenders of the Bugrinsky Grove) and objective (perestroika) reasons, it did not materialize.  Then followed the period of perestroika and the economic crisis. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bugrinsky bridge in Novosibirsk opening" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/568410.jpg" width="600"></div>  The project cost could not be secured by the scarce budget of the city and region.  The economic realities of our time have also threatened the construction of a new structure several times.  Contrary to all forecasts about the postponement of the date of its commissioning, the opening of the bridge in Novosibirsk was timely.  So, having overcome all difficulties, the third crossing across the river was nevertheless ‚Äúborn‚Äù.  Its construction aroused great interest from the media.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The opening of the third bridge in Novosibirsk was the result of a long history.  Initially, the object was designated as the Olovozavodsky bridge.  Since in the Bugrinsk grove, near which construction was planned, the oldest factory for the production of tin was located.  Other variants of the names were "Solnechny", "Nikolsky", "Rainbow" and "Krivoshchekovsky" (they all went through more than one stage of comprehension and various votes).  In 2013, it was decided that the name is out of date.  And on December 3, the names commission made a unanimous decision on the official approval of the bridge as "Bugrinsky". </p><h2>  Technical characteristics of the Bugrinsky bridge </h2><p>  Four projects were submitted for discussion by the city administration.  Of these, two - options for cable-stayed and arched-type structures - received priority.  As a result, an arch project was approved.  The basis for the adoption of this option was the features of the geographical topography of the area, which the arch bridge in Novosibirsk corresponded to a greater extent.  The price of construction has also become a weighty argument in favor of structures with special spans. </p><p>  The Bugrinsky bridge in Novosibirsk has the following characteristics: </p><ul><li>  arch (70 m - height, 25 m - width, length - 380 m); </li><li>  throughput - 7180 cars per hour; </li><li>  metal supports - 30 pcs.; </li><li>  the number of lanes of the highway - 6; </li><li>  bridge dimensions of the navigable span: width - 140 and 100 m, height - 15 m; </li><li>  the total length of the bridge crossing is about 5480 m; </li><li>  the cost of the bridge is 14,805,462,000 rubles. </li></ul><h2>  Preparatory work </h2><p>  The purpose of the construction is to solve the bypass route for unloading city transport highways from transit routes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="third bridge in Novosibirsk" class="if" height="201" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/560324.jpg" width="600"></div>  At the preparatory stage, when the construction of the bridge in Novosibirsk took place, a large number of private houses falling into the work area had to be demolished.  This process required serious financial investments and time for the construction and commissioning of new homes for immigrants.

    <p>  Due to difficulties with resettlement, financial shortages and delays in the preparation of space for construction, there was a significant (about 3 billion rubles) appreciation of the initial cost of the project.  Nevertheless, the general contractor coped with the task of state scale.  And the commissioning of the facility took place according to the approved construction plan. </p><h2>  The third bridge: the chronicle of construction </h2><p>  The project was financed from three sources - the city, regional and federal budgets.  The general contractor for the construction, Sibmost, an open joint-stock company from St. Petersburg, proposed the most favorable conditions for the cost of construction. </p><ul><li>  In 2009, preparatory work began on the provision of construction sites by the city.  To free the land, more than three hundred houses, ten administrative buildings, garages and a beach in the Bugrinsky Grove were subject to demolition. </li><li>  In 2010, in the month of February, construction began. </li><li>  In December 2012, the construction of thirty bridge piers was completed. </li><li>  April 2014 - the shutters of the arch of the Bugrinsky bridge are closed at an altitude of 70 m. </li><li>  In October 2014, it was opened for operation with the personal participation of the head of state. </li></ul><p>  In the process of work involved and created jobs for more than one and a half thousand people.  The supplies of materials are carried out by five factories for the production of metal structures.  Nine research institutes took part in the design process.  Large-scale construction required high organization, management and coordination, therefore, it was under close attention and patronage of the government level.  Cyclists also tried to "participate" in the construction, who demanded that they have a separate bike path on the new bridge, unfortunately, they were refused. </p><h2>  <strong>Presidential participation is a sign of the strategic importance of the project</strong> </h2><p>  The new bridge in Novosibirsk (Bugrinsky) was commissioned with the personal participation of President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin on October 8, 2014.  The grand opening of the third bridge was a landmark event.  The presence of the first person of the state at the ceremony is evidence of the prospects and strategic importance of the object.  At the same time, as the media have repeatedly noted, the visit of V.V. Putin is evidence of the control of the administration and its compliance with the state policy plan in the Siberian region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="construction of a bridge in Novosibirsk" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/560321.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This is the third bridge in Novosibirsk connecting the right and left banks of the Ob.  The design construction was created in accordance with the master plan for the construction of roads and connects federal highways: the M-51 route Novosibirsk-Omsk, the federal M-52 Novosibirsk-Biysk-Tashanta and the Novosibirsk-Leninsk-Kuznetsk highway.  It has six lanes and a throughput of more than 28 thousand cars per day. </p><p>  The Bugrinsky Bridge in Novosibirsk, the opening of which was successfully covered by many Russian media, has become one of the local attractions.  It makes a lasting impression on the city guests.  A photo of the bridge in Novosibirsk from different angles was placed in tourist guides. </p><p>  The opening of the facility with the participation of the President of the Russian Federation was broadcast live on television.  Immediately after this, a traffic jam occurred due to the uncontrolled curiosity of citizens who want to "try" the structure and imprint on it.  But the very next day, the Bugrinsky Bridge in Novosibirsk, the opening of which was extremely solemn, fulfilled its direct function in full.  People rode without difficulties, comfortably and freely according to the new design.  Naturally, problems arose: on Bugrinka, several minor traffic accidents had already occurred, which led to the appearance of traffic jams due to ice. </p><h2>  <strong>The prospect of bridge building in Novosibirsk</strong> </h2><p>  New bridge in Novosibirsk is a special stage in capacity development <strong> </strong>  cities.  The development master plan provides for the construction of four new structures. <strong> </strong>  The projects of new (fourth and fifth) city bridges are under development.  In May 2014, a competition was announced for the design of a bridge in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãul.  Hippodrome across the Ob River. </p><p>  For new purposes, it is planned to combine two forms of financing - public and private.  This means that you will be charged for crossing the bridge.  The establishment of more than ten payment terminals at the entrance and exit.  At present, the fourth bridge in Novosibirsk as a project is in the stage of very active discussion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bridge over the Ob in Novosibirsk" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/568411.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The task of this construction is to unload the traffic intersections on the sections of the right and left banks in the Hippodrome region, and also to optimize the transport system of the center.  According to the preliminary plan, the cost of constructing a new bridge is estimated at twenty one billion rubles.  Excluding the cost of the planned high-speed tram line.  The coordinating control function for the preparation and implementation of the project is vested in the Central Bridge company established by the regional administration. </p><p>  The fourth bridge in Novosibirsk, the scheme of which will be presented by the end of 2014, is being developed by the Stroyproekt Institute.  Tender for construction should be announced by mid-2015. </p><h2>  Fifth bridge in Novosibirsk </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding the fifth bridge in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãExpocenter, Stantsionnaya Street, with a slightly different content, is to provide internal and external transit of transport.  The length of the bridge is planned to be about five kilometers.  Construction is fraught with high costs - the demolition of private houses in the project development area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The fourth bridge in Novosibirsk scheme" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/560320.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This bridge will become significant for residents of the Kalininsky and Zaeltsovsky districts.  They will be able to reach the left bank, bypassing the city center.  According to experts, the state of the Novosibirsk transport system dictates the need to design the seventh and eighth bridges.  Authorities say that it‚Äôs impossible to solve the traffic jam problem without them, so it‚Äôs important to start intensive work on new structures of this type right now.  Due to the difficulty in attracting investors for the construction of new bridges (there is simply not enough budget for this), more active participation of private capital is planned, and, therefore, the introduction of payment for the use of the highway.  But perhaps this is a really good solution: many Novosibirsk citizens are willing to pay for a quality road and no traffic jams.  After building the new Zaeltsovsky bridge, Novosibirsk will open the way to the next evolutionary stage.  The question of which of the two planned structures to launch in the first place has not yet been finally decided. </p><p>  The mayor of the city of Novosibirsk will discuss this issue with builders and future architects involved, but a large area of ‚Äã‚Äã709 thousand square meters in the Central, Railway, October and Leninsky districts has already been reserved for the construction of the ‚ÄúIsthmus No. 4‚Äù. </p>
