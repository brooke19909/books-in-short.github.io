    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The official historical science claims that the Russian State was formed in 862.  However, some sources try to refute this fact, as if in reality pre-Christian statehood among the <span>Eastern Slavs</span> arose at the beginning of our era.  Our distant ancestors well mastered the art of war, and since childhood.  This was led by a harsh life, the specifics of that environment. </p><p>  Having mentally returned to that era, one can imagine the conditions in which our ancestors had to live: wildlife, small settlements separated by great distances and poor communication.  How to protect yourself from numerous raids, to escape from internecine conflicts?  The Slavic sword was supposed to protect ancient people from enemies. </p><h2>  Ancient weapon </h2><p>  All types of knives, common in that era, whether spear, ax or ax, the <span>ancient Slavs</span> mastered perfectly.  Nevertheless, preference was given to the sword.  In skillful hands, it was a formidable weapon that was associated not only with power, but also with power and valor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The impressive size and considerable weight of the Slavic sword required its owner to have physical training in order to be able to crush opponents with accurate and powerful blows.  Every boy of that time wanted to get it.  Slavic sword with their own hands was made by blacksmiths and special craftsmen.  He was presented with a gift in honor of respect.  Only brave men could boast of such weapons in their home. </p><h2>  Device </h2><p>  What was the Slavic sword?  The wide warhead, called the blade, near the tip itself had some narrowing.  Often there were swords, along the midline of the blade which passed a shallow and not wide groove.  According to the version based on the traditions of the Slavs, the blood of the defeated enemy flowed down along this ‚Äúdol‚Äù.  More plausible is the explanation of the role of this element: less weight of the sword, it was easier to wield. </p><p>  A detailed description of the Russian sword by a scientist from Khorezm who lived in the Middle Ages, Biruni, is considered interesting.  The warhead was made of solid steel-structure called shapurkan.  The middle part, where the dol passed, on the contrary, should be ductile, that is, with the content of soft iron.  Thanks to such cleverly designed device, the Slavic sword was very durable to withstand powerful blows, but also not fragile. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Original design </h2><p>  You can not ignore the appearance.  Admirable handle and guard in terms of design.  Garda - an element of the sword in the form of a crosshair, which was located between the hilt and the blade, protected the warrior's hand from enemy attacks.  The sword, in the manufacture of which the master put his whole soul, was truly a masterpiece, a work of art.  The accuracy of jewelry and the complexity of the patterns, whose elements were such popular symbols of the time as Inglia (Primary Fire), Svyatodar, Kolovrat (solstice), are surprising. </p><p>  Magical drawings were also present on the blade itself.  Incrustation of the handle with precious stones emphasized the fact of how kindly the owner was respectful to him.  Slavic sword - the amulet of its owner.  It was an honor to take away the weapon from the enemy, but sometimes such trophies brought only misfortune.  People believed that this was due to witching charms. </p>

    <h2>  Who and when was allowed to wear a sword? </h2><p>  All indications are that the Slavic sword was not perceived as a weapon in the usual sense.  It was worn daily only by representatives of the elite - the prince with his warriors.  For ordinary citizens in the period between hostilities, this privilege did not extend.  Ignoring this rule of etiquette indicated bad manners, it could also be interpreted as showing disrespect for those who held a high position in society. </p><p>  The sword is not an item of jewelry that can be displayed, but above all, a weapon to protect the homeland from the encroachment of enemies.  A true warrior must have such an instrument.  Women tried not to touch the "toys" of men.  A special place was occupied in the life of every prince by a Slavic sword.  Photos of a cold weapon are published by many archaeologists who have discovered this expensive find. </p>

    <h2>  The meaning of the sword in the life of the Slavs </h2><p>  The Slavs sword was a kind of <span>heirloom,</span> which representatives of the strong half of the older generation passed on to their heirs.  Moreover, often a father with almost beggarly affluence could not leave his son after himself, except for a sword.  Terrible weapons made it possible for the brave and valiant warrior to become famous in military combat and, if lucky, improve his financial situation. </p><p>  It is characteristic that Russian speech is replete with many verbal turns containing the term ‚Äúsword‚Äù, the use of which emphasized the significance of the Slavic sword.  Here are some examples.  Word of mouth passes the legendary phrase, spoken by Alexander Nevsky about what awaits the enemy, who came with a sword to Russian soil.  Thus, the great commander not only warned the Teutonic knights.  The phrase has become not only winged, but also prophetic, as proved by the long history of Russia.  Less well-known are the following phrases: ‚Äúlevy a sword against‚Äù was used as a sign of a call to the outbreak of hostilities, and the laconic phrase ‚Äúgo with a sword‚Äù served as a call to seize the enemy‚Äôs fortress or foreign territory with the subsequent strengthening of positions. </p>

    <p>  Around the beginning of the 13th century, the following trend can be traced.  The gunsmiths of different regions of Russia in the manufacture of swords ceased to adhere to uniform standards, varieties of the sword appeared, which differed from each other in weight and shape.  This continued until the 19th century. </p><p>  Slavic sword is often used as a tattoo.  The image symbolizes perseverance, power, fortitude, in a sense, serves the patriotic education of the present and all subsequent generations of the Russian people. </p>
