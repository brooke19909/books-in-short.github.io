This is a popular card board game in recent years, which is ideal for having fun with friends.  Now on the market there are many options and modifications of this fun.  This article will discuss the most popular of them, as well as the classic version. </p><h2>  Purpose of the game </h2><div class="photo" data-original="krsk.au.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Board game Svintus" class="if uuid-3080964" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3080964.jpg"></div><p>  In reviews of the game "Svintus", those who have already tried this entertainment, argue that one of the main advantages is that there are simple rules that can be quickly explained to both adults and children. </p><p>  The goal of the game is to get rid of all the cards that you have on hand.  The first player who succeeds in doing this will receive as many points as there are cards in the hands of all his opponents. </p><p>  The game continues until one of the participants receives 30 points for the sum of all games played. </p><p>  In terms of mechanics and nature, Svintus can resemble the world famous Uno game.  It should be recognized that the Russian counterpart is much more colorful, but costs significantly less. </p><h2>  Kit </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.sima-land.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews of the game Svintus" class="if uuid-3080966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3080966.jpg"></div><p>  In total, the game uses a deck consisting of 112 cards.  64 of them are divided into four colors - orange, blue, green and red.  Moreover, they have a face value from zero to seven. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are also 48 special cards.  There are eight cards in the deck: Perekhryuk, Zahrapin, Tikhokhryun, Khapezh, Polysvin, Cotton-hoop. </p><p>  This entertainment has become so popular that many people choose it as a gift.  It will be especially appropriate for a bachelorette party or teenager's birthday.  For such cases, the premium edition of the Svintus board game has been released.  According to reviews, it looks so presentable that it is not a shame to present it to someone as a souvenir. </p><h2>  rules </h2><p>  Now let's go directly to the rules.  At the beginning of each game, players receive 8 cards.  Moreover, the number of participants can be different - from two to ten people. </p><p>  The remaining deck must be mixed and put face down in the middle of the table.  After this, the dealer turns the top card from the deck, puts it next to the pile face up. </p><p>  Next, you should adhere to the basic rules.  Each player in his turn discards one card into the game pile.  With the one that already lies at the very top, their card must match in face value or color.  For example, if there is a green "seven" in the pile, then you can discard any green card or seven of any color. </p><p>  If the participant does not have a suitable card, he takes an additional one from the deck.  If she fits, she can play it immediately; if not, she takes it in her hand.  After that, the move proceeds to the next player. </p><h2>  Features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tesera.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Svintus game rules" class="if uuid-3080965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3080965.jpg"></div><p>  It is important to remember the special rules that often affect the outcome of this game.  Before placing his penultimate card, the player must pronounce the word "Svintus", thereby warning everyone around that he has only one card left on his hand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If he ignores this rule, he receives a fine in the form of three additional cards, which he draws from the pile.  You need to catch him on this before the next player is like. </p><p>  In "Svintus" there is a rule "Interception".  If someone played a card that you have on your hand, you have the right to seize the initiative, lay out the same card without waiting for your turn.  The next move in this case will go to your neighbor.  Thus, you can get rid of cards at maximum speed. </p><p>  There is also a Translation rule.  It is valid when the player in front of you plays the Hapezh or Zahrapin card.  In this case, you can lay out the same card, then the negative property will pass to the player sitting next to you.  He also has the right to play Translation. </p><h2>  Special cards </h2><p>  Additional drama arises when using special cards in the game.  What you need to know about the property of each of them? </p><p>  When a player lays out the Hapezh card, the player following him must take three cards from the deck into his hand and skip his turn. </p><p>  The Perekhryuk card changes the direction of the game.  If before that everyone went clockwise, now they are starting to go against. </p><p>  The Zahrapin card forces the player who is sitting next to the person who posted it to skip their turn. </p><p>  With the Polysvin card, a participant can change the current color to any other or leave everything unchanged.  Polyswin can be laid out on any card, even if the player has a regular card suitable for a particular case. </p><p>  When someone puts out a Tikhokhryun card, it means that none of the participants can utter a word until someone has another Tikhokhryun.  The violator of this rule removes the ban, but must draw two cards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="krsk.au.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cottonhopper Map" class="if uuid-3080963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3080963.jpg"></div><p>  If there is a Cottonhopper card on the table, all players must put their hands on the card.  Whose hand is the last (at the very top), draws two cards from the deck. </p><p>  Special cards, except for Polysvin, can be laid out on a card of the same color or after another same card of any color. </p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  In reviews of the Swintus board game, experienced players advise placing the deck as close as possible to make it easier to handle when the Cotton Hoop comes up.  Of course, everyone else will try to do the same, so you will have to show skill and ingenuity, so that everything works out as you need.  Initially, the deck is placed in the very center of the table, but gradually each of the players seeks to pull it closer to himself. </p><p>  In reviews of the Svintus card game, players emphasize separately that it is important to maintain a high pace.  In this case, it will turn out particularly interesting and exciting, the game will become more exciting. </p><p>  <span>Reviews</span> on the game "Svintus" mostly positive.  It can be played both in a large and friendly company, and together with children.  The rules are elementary, so it will be easy for anyone to master them. </p><h2>  "Young Svintus" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="hobbygames.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Young Svintus" class="if uuid-3080962" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3080962.jpg"></div><p>  After the game became truly popular, many of its options and modifications appeared.  For example, students leave good reviews about the game "Young Svintus". </p><p>  In this option, you also need to get rid of all the cards you have, only the rules are somewhat simplified, illustrations of the relevant children's topics. </p><p>  In addition, there is an additional card that will please fans of even the classic version.  This is a "pointer".  When laying out this card, you should come up with some kind of your own rule.  All players will be required to fulfill it until someone else lays out this card and comes up with a new one.  In case of violation of the invented rule, the participant must take an additional two cards from the deck. </p><p>  In the reviews of the Young Svintus board game, those who tested it confirm that this new card adds fun and unpredictability to everything happening around the table.  As an example of a new rule, you can forbid everyone to call each other by name, order them to stand on one leg, grunt every time you take a new card, or something similar. </p><p>  The number of points to which the game continues is proposed in this version to be determined based on the number of players.  According to reviews of the Svintus game for children, it is optimal to play up to 30 points with two to four players, up to 40 points with five to seven participants, if there are eight or more people at the table, then the winner should score 50 points. </p><h2>  Swintus Deluxe </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.auchan.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Swintus deluxe" class="if uuid-3080975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3080975.jpg"></div><p>  In this version of the game, the participants are promised a special pleasure, since it will collect all the cream inherent in Svintus.  The main thing is that there are as many options as you want to achieve victory.  You can confuse an opponent with prescriptions, use vaccines and viruses, make others obey the rules of their etiquette.  Bankers should be especially careful with moles. </p><p>  According to reviews of the game "Swintus Deluxe", in this version, enthusiasm appears due to the use of additional rules and maps. </p><p>  For example, etiquette cards appear that you can play by the usual rules or out of turn when an opponent performs one of these actions.  For example, it takes too long to think about its course, answers some of your questions, addresses you by name or nickname, even simply puts a hand on the table. </p><h2>  Swintus Deluxe.  Infection </h2><div class="photo" data-original="hobbygames.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Card game Svintus" class="if uuid-3080971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3080971.jpg"></div><p>  A new Infection rule appears.  To do this, the deck has eight cards of vaccines and viruses.  When you play one of these cards, the previous participant must immediately pick up two on hand.  Vaccine and virus cards can force all rivals to take two cards on hand or give the opportunity to exchange cards with any of the participants. </p><p>  A few new additional cards are added.  For example, "pig farm".  Having played it, you need to shout out the corresponding word, and then put on top a card with a face value of no more than two.  After this, the next participant must play a card of the same value or one unit higher.  If someone is not able to do this, he takes as many cards from the deck into his hand as are indicated on the last played.  After that, the game continues according to the usual rules. </p><p>  If you played the card "Darkmaker", then put in a closed one, calling it dignity and color.  But you are not required to tell the truth.  The next one should do the same or reveal your card.  If it matches the declared one, the player takes all the cards played in the dark onto his hand.  If not, then they get that laid out a proven card. </p><h2>  Moles-bankers </h2><p>  Another innovation is mole-bankers.  A deck of 12 of these cards is placed next to the playing field.  Having selected a chip of a certain color, each of the participants puts it on the initial division.  After each game, the winner‚Äôs chip moves to the appropriate number of divisions.  Each time she passes through the molehill or stops on it, the player gets a bill of exchange.  It is impossible to finish any of the games until the participant gets rid of all the mole cards.  When the cards on the hand run out, one bill is discarded, and eight new cards should be taken instead.  You can also get rid of a bill during the ‚ÄúInterception" by returning it to the deck. </p><p>  According to reviews of the game "Svintus", this is one of the most interesting options, since it has a large number of exciting additional rules that maximize gambling stress. </p>
