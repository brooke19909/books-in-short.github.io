Knitting flowers is not only a way to take free time, but also a great option for decorating gifts, as well as adding a touch of warmth and homeliness to the finished product.  Flowers are often used as decorations for clothes: hats, scarves, sweaters, as well as for accessories and souvenirs. </p><p>  <strong>Crochet: Flowers</strong> </p><p>  If we are talking about the simplest technique, then this is a very simple lesson that is accessible even to beginner craftswomen to master.  But many craftsmen begin to invent and create flowers that have many different elements, decorating them with a variety of materials, resulting in a real work of art.  A needlewoman can express herself by <span>crocheting</span> <span>flowers.</span>  If she has already mastered the basics of needlework, then she will be able to create a variety of variations, repeat the shades and intricate forms of natural flowers, and also come up with fantastic flowers that do not exist in nature.  For those who have not yet really mastered this delicate matter, the scheme of knitting a flower can be very useful, now these can be found both in specialized publications and on the Internet. </p><p>  <strong>Crochet: flowers and landscaping</strong> </p><p>  In order to somehow green the interior of your home, you just need to take a little yarn, scissors, a hook and a necklace - all this is the material for everlasting flowers.  To begin with, armed with a crochet, create several flowers and decorate them with beads.  The style and color scheme should be chosen depending on where you are going to place your masterpieces.  And when you knit the required number of colors, you can begin to create a summer composition.  Such flowers can be used in the interior in completely different ways, so it all depends on your imagination and wishes.  By the summer, everyone wants to get something new, and inexpensively and very quickly.  Here, crochet will definitely help you.  Flowers created in this way can definitely make your interior more vivid.  You can make the simplest flowers, and then use them to decorate pillows, bedspreads, curtains, and even slippers. </p><p>  Everyone knows that color can affect mood, allows you to correct unsuccessful forms in the room, and a casual interior can easily revive a small contrasting detail.  You can make your dining table more summer and bright if you fix <span>knitted</span> flowers on the corners of each <span>napkin</span> - this will become a bright accent in the kitchen.  In winter, such details will warm the soul, casting memories of summer outings. </p><p>  For the summer, you can turn your sofa into a flowering meadow using the products you created on it.  Sew flowers to sofa cushions - this will allow you to quickly and inexpensively update and revitalize old furniture.  And if you take a thick thread and attach several knitted flowers to it, then you can get an excellent summer catch for curtains.  Any interior can be decorated with the help of flowers: with their help, the house will not only come to life, but also gain a romantic or solemn atmosphere. </p><p>  <strong>Crochet: flowers and clothes</strong> </p><p>  You can make your shoes attractive in the summer way by attaching them with a flower.  This accessory is catchy, but it fits many outfits.  And if you attach a <span>knitted flower</span> intricately decorated with beads to the <span>summer handbag</span> , this will add to it originality and hint at the owner‚Äôs light and mischievous disposition.  Such details are excellent accents, allowing not only to distinguish you, but also to demonstrate your originality and personality. </p>
