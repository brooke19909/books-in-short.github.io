The most popular Turkish Resort in the world is the city of Antalya.  Kaleichi is the cradle of a beautiful ancient city.  Everything has its beginning, and in many countries the authorities make sure that the historical past and the architectural heritage of cities are not only not destroyed, but also kept in good condition.  Kaleici is one of those places where the spirit of the past centuries is still alive. </p>

    <h2>  A place where history comes to life </h2><p>  There are many historical places in the world, but they are most often perceived by tourists as the most ordinary cultural monument.  Such a story lives only in the minds of historians, no more.  However, a different kind of story exists. </p><p>  It is not necessary to concentrate all symbolism in a separate art object.  This is fundamentally the wrong approach.  Kaleici in Antalya is not an installation.  Moreover, this area of ​​the city is developing even today.  Life never left him.  In this place, not only generations were replaced, but entire eras.  The fantastic atmosphere of the place is transmitted through the usual things.  The ordinary stone from which houses, streets and walls were built saw the whole history of this city from its very birth.  Wine poured on this stone, while blood spilled on it.  The Romans themselves walked the ancient roads, and later the Byzantine people as well.  In the narrow streets they traded spices, and at times the clang of swords and the hum of battles drowned out all the other sounds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  This area has seen and heard everything.  No, this is not a monument of architecture.  This is a real teleport to the past.  This is not even our heritage, this is the beginning of the modern city, its origins. </p><h2>  A big difference </h2><p>  Modern Kaleici and old Antalya are not the same thing.  Antalya is a very large and important tourist city.  However, the Kaleici themselves have never been such an important territory.  The city stood out little, especially in ancient times.  Then a similar style was everywhere.  Despite the strictest ban on restructuring the area or careless reconstruction, the area has changed.  Much has been destroyed over time, but the spirit of whole eras has remained. </p>

    <p>  Today it is no longer an ordinary area, it is a real Mecca for tourists.  There are no slides or noisy parties.  This place will be appreciated only by people who are keen on history. </p><h2>  Narrow streets and real labyrinths </h2><p>  It would never have occurred to modern generations to rebuild the city in this way.  Kaleici in Antalya is a fortress.  A real defensive structure.  There are not and should not be wide avenues and spacious streets.  The houses are too close to each other.  No high-rises or any modern facilities.  All architecture is made in a modern style. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Moving around this area, the gaze will involuntarily notice the smallest details that can tell a lot both about the city itself and about the life of the people who inhabit it.  In some poor houses, life has not changed much.  A walk is a great opportunity to understand a place. </p>

    <p>  The streets are like mazes.  Getting lost in them is not at all difficult.  Such a seemingly strange building is explained very simply - in ancient times it was one of the defensive elements of the fortress.  Fighting the entire advancing army was too hard.  Narrow streets forced the enemy to form small units without heavy infantry and archers, and constant bends helped to separate the enemy’s troops and arrange an effective ambush.  Losses during the assault on a well-equipped fortress have always been outrageous.  For this reason, many preferred a siege until the voluntary surrender of the city, which the Kaleichs did not face. </p><h2>  Ancient roman port </h2><p>  Kaleichi in Antalya was not only a district and a fortress, but also a full-fledged seaport.  The most amazing thing is that the port has been functioning properly for more than two thousand years and is still used from time to time for its intended purpose.  Once the port made the fortress independent.  A long siege was not a serious problem, because it was possible to receive support from the sea.  The port was the most fortified place of the fortress.  The ancient cannons are still aimed directly at the harbor and have not left their posts for hundreds of years.  Of course, now the port does not perform a defensive function, but the history in that place froze forever. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The harbor is also worthy of special mention, because it protected the whole of Antalya, which, by the way, served the harbor itself.  It was built by the Romans, and it has partially survived to our times.  Old Antalya and Kaleici once complemented each other.  This union was amazing, but in the end the fortress became only one of the areas of a huge tourist city. </p><h2>  Facade magnificence </h2><p>  How beautiful the architectural style of the Kaleici Old Town is.  Antalya is unlikely to ever be able to compare with the Kaleic.  And this is not at all surprising.  The building in the old city is very dense, but this does not prevent the front facades from going directly onto the paths.  Beautiful everywhere, you just need to look around more often and notice interesting details.  Many houses have common or even their own courtyards and they definitely do not look like modern ones.  First of all, style.  These small courtyards do not stand out as a bright spot; they organically fit into a single architectural style.  Green spaces are always neatly trimmed and well-groomed.  In some places you can find ancient statues and even operating fountains. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, this style did not take root in Antalya.  Photos of Kaleic provide a clear understanding of how people's tastes changed in different eras.  In the historical center, fruit trees grow, even right in the courtyards.  They are also well maintained, like everyone else.  Fruits do not lie on the ground, garbage cans are not crowded with household waste, and there is no unpleasant odor on the street. </p><h2>  Stone and wood </h2><p>  The ancient architecture of Kaleici, the historical center of Antalya, is surprisingly in balance between living and non-living nature.  Stone buildings are not monolithic.  The main floors are made of wood, which is carefully looked after and restored on time.  During the Roman Empire, such a building was popular.  First of all, it is really beautiful.  However, it is also much cheaper and easier to build.  Some covered courtyards and arbors are twined with ivy.  Trees grow on separate buildings and even moss looks as if it were a vision of a professional designer.  For this area, it is very important to preserve not only the traces of the ancient fortress, but also nature. </p><p>  It is pleasant to breathe in the ancient fortress, because there is no constant stream of cars, and the cool sea breeze constantly refreshes the air.  There is only one problem - in particularly busy tourist hours, when the time comes for bus excursions from all over Antalya and other cities, it is not very comfortable in the old town.  The streets are too narrow for long chains of tourists with expensive cameras.  It will be very noisy in the fresh air, and you won’t be able to enjoy all the delights of the fortress calmly. </p>

    <h2>  Not such a long road </h2><p>  How to get to Kaleichi from Antalya?  This is actually not so difficult.  For those tourists who are used to always and everywhere to choose the simplest and easiest routes, bus excursions are ideal.  In this case, vacationers do not have to think at all.  It is enough to go to the reception of the hotel and book a tour there.  If there is a lot of money, but the tour is not to your liking - there is a way out, this is a taxi.  For more free travelers, constrained in cash - you can ride on public transport.  A great opportunity to find out how it feels to live in Antalya.  It all depends on the area of ​​departure.  Antalya is a big city, in some cases there are no direct routes.  The number of the required bus must always be recognized at the hotel reception, regardless of the information available.  Often there are local townspeople who understand the Russian language and can clearly suggest a way. </p><h2>  Universal route </h2><p>  Among all public transport routes, the most popular is KL 08. It passes through the whole city, and begins in a suburban metropolitan area.  Get out of transport should be at Ataturk Square.  The way back on the same route will be a test, because it is on the way back that the vehicle does not call in Kaleichi.  Have to do a transplant. </p><h2>  Opinions of tourists </h2><p>  Reviews about Antalya, Kaleichi and other tourist areas are always of interest to tourists who have just planned a trip.  Kaleichi are famous for the fact that almost no one speaks negatively about the area.  This ancient fortress can capture the whole imagination of a person, make him mentally go back many centuries.  There are too few places like this in the world.  Absolutely all travelers note the atmosphere of this place.  All the negativity goes not to the district, but to transport logistics, because not every public bus is equipped with a good air conditioning system.  To put it mildly, an independent trip can be a real test, a sort of test of strength. </p><h2>  Where can I stay? </h2><p>  You can always settle in the city of Antalya.  Hotels in Kaleici are also available.  Moreover, there are a lot of them.  You can hardly find a cheap hostel here, but cozy family hotels are often found.  The cost of living traditionally depends on the distance to the promenade and the beach.  The Mellon Premium Hotel is not just anywhere, but right in the center of the old town.  Externally, the building resembles an authentic medieval inn.  The cost of one night is very pleasing, about 1700 rubles per room.  Of course, meals in budget rooms will be an additional service, for a fee. </p><p>  White Garden Hotel is a fairly expensive guest house.  This is a cozy place with many rooms.  The cheapest one costs a little more than 2000 rubles, and the most expensive one costs about 8000 rubles per night. </p>

    <p>  If there is an irresistible craving for luxury and a pronounced desire to spend time in the most expensive rooms - Elegance East Hotel is perfect.  The cost of only one night in this hotel can reach 35,000 rubles.  For this amount, not only a deluxe room is offered, but also top-notch service. </p><p>  Be that as it may, there are many hotels in Kaleici.  Near the promenade and the beach it is not recommended to settle for those who love silence.  But those who prefer noisy parties, obviously will not go to hotels on the outskirts and even in the city center.  You can find more affordable options, and even hostels.  There are especially many of them outside the old city.  Hostels are not necessarily far away; they may well be across the road. </p><h2>  Creative photos </h2><p>  Photos of Antalya and the old town of Kaleici can be easily found on the Internet.  In theory, this will help the tourist to make their choice, but not so simple.  In reality, everything looks much more picturesque than in the highest quality photographs.  For photography enthusiasts, Kaleici will become a paradise.  These are real Klondike scenes for atmospheric photos in medieval style.  The right approach to exposure and creative work with the camera will allow you to make a frame per million.  The ancient city is easy to photograph, because he himself poses.  There is no need to choose a good perspective for a long time.  The highlight can be found anywhere.  In other words, this is just a great opportunity for a photo shoot. </p>
