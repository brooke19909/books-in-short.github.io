Reviews about this institution are full of vivid impressions and positive moments: </p><ul><li>  the rooms are incredibly clean - just nothing to complain about; </li><li>  on a birthday, guests make pleasant compliments in the form of a festive cake (you do not even need to warn about the solemn date); </li><li>  a very big advantage is the presence of heating in the pool, so that you can ensure a good rest both in summer and in cooler seasons; </li><li>  the territory of the hotel is picturesque - literally immersed in flowers and greenery; </li><li>  the hotel staff is very attentive - ready to provide any help and find answers to any questions; </li><li>  a huge selection of entertainment, sporting events, as well as relaxing services; </li><li>  a huge advantage is the presence of a private beach, which is maintained clean and tidy. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Despite the general mass of positive comments, there are flaws in the Swissotel Resort Sochi Kamelia hotel.  Guest reviews speak of some negative points.  In particular: </p><ul><li>  a drawback can be considered that in none of the rooms with sea view, there are no separate beds (only doubles); </li><li>  the bathroom has very dim lighting, which makes shaving or makeup very uncomfortable; </li><li>  in the playroom, animation staff practically does not deal with children (kids are left to their own devices); </li><li>  breakfasts are very monotonous - they get bored after a few days; </li><li>  in some rooms there is a shower cabin - as a result, the entire floor is flooded with water, and there is also a risk of flooding the lower floors; </li><li>  repair work is being carried out in the SPA area, which makes it impossible to take advantage of the full range of services; </li><li>  Despite the fact that the layout of the bathroom looks very impressive, in practice it is extremely inconvenient to use it; </li><li>  due to the fact that the railway is very close, instead of the sound of the surf, the sound of the wheels of a train is heard. </li></ul><p>  Whatever it was, but many agree that a great option for a seaside vacation is precisely the "Swissotel Resort Sochi Kamelia" 5 *.  Sochi will open for you from a new perspective, if you are surrounded by comfort and attention.  Here you can feel the atmosphere of royal luxury and completely relax and escape from the worldly bustle. </p>
