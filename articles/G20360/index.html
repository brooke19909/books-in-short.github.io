  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scientific method</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The scientific method is a set of procedures aimed at establishing general principles and evaluating theories proposed in the description, explanation and prediction of phenomena.  It is used in various fields. </p><p>  There is a certain classification of scientific methods.  Experts divide them into two main levels: methods of theoretical and empirical knowledge. </p><p>  The scientific <span>method of empirical</span> knowledge is applicable in the conditions of experience, where the main task is performed by the senses.  This method includes: </p><ol><li>  Observation is a focused study of an object using the functions of the senses when the observer does not intervene in the phenomenon being studied. </li><li>  An experiment is the study of an object in specially created and controlled artificial conditions. </li><li>  Comparison  This method involves the determination of differences or similar features of objects or phenomena. </li><li>  A description of the results of an experiment, observation, or experiment.  For fixation, special notation systems are used (charts, tables, diagrams and others). </li><li>  Measurement - the identification of a quantitative indicator of one or another value. </li></ol><p>  The theoretical scientific method involves the use of thinking as a tool in research.  In turn, this <span>method of study is</span> divided into formalization and axiomatic method. </p><p>  Formalization is the display of knowledge using symbols and signs (formalized language).  In this case, reasoning about phenomena and objects replace operations with signs.  This, in particular, is clearly reflected in <span>symbolic logic</span> or mathematics. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the <span>scientific method of</span> formalization is not always applicable.  For example, cultural studies or philosophy are not symbolically mapped.  This method is suitable in the natural or <span>technical sciences.</span> </p><p>  The axiomatic method is the derivation of knowledge from provisions that do not require proof (axioms). </p><p>  General logical methods combine philosophical, theoretical and empirical knowledge.  These methods include: </p><ol><li>  Analysis - mentally dividing into the component parts of an object or phenomenon. </li><li>  Synthesis - the formation of parts of a single whole. </li><li>  Abstraction - the mental selection of the most basic properties of an object or phenomenon. </li><li>  Idealization is a mental operation aimed at the formation of objects, objects, phenomena idealized and not existing in reality. </li><li>  Modeling - a study using substitutes for phenomena or objects (models). </li></ol><p>  Modeling, in turn, is divided into objective (material) and mental (ideal). </p><p>  It should be noted that modeling as a research tool is used quite widely.  Its application in solving management problems is especially relevant.  Often in the face of complex problems in the absence of the possibility of conducting experiments in real life, modeling becomes a necessary and indispensable tool.  In situations that are difficult enough to use a simple assessment of causes and effects, specially designed models are used. </p><p>  Psychology uses a scientific method in many of its fields.  Here, as, incidentally, in other areas, hypotheses are derived from theoretical positions, their systematic critical assessment is carried out under conditions of controlled, objective, <span>empirical research.</span>  As a result, certain conclusions are formulated that are available for in-depth study, reproduction, and analysis. </p><p>  In the study of complex events, their separation into variables and relevant ones is applied.  Between them, in turn, using the scientific method, researchers establish and study relationships, subsequently develop and critically evaluate assumptions related to empirical results. </p>
