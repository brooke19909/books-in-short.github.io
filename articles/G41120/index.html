The establishment of diplomatic relations between the USSR and the United States began thanks to trade relations that had formed by the 1930s.  A significant role in the normalization of interaction was played by representatives of business circles in America.  They were primarily interested in establishing economic ties. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="establishment between the ussr and usa diplomatic relations" class="if" height="484" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1265405.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History of diplomatic relations between the USSR (Russia) and the USA </h2><p>  In October 1933, <span>President of America</span> F. Roosevelt sent a message to M. Kalinin, who was then chairman of the CEC.  The message suggested restoring diplomatic relations.  At that time, there were certain disagreements between the USSR and the USA, which both sides sought to overcome.  Kalinin answered Roosevelt on October 17th.  Already in mid-November 1933, Maxim Litvinov, who was the Commissioner of Foreign Affairs, and the President of America exchanged official notes.  From that moment, diplomatic relations between the USSR and the USA began to take shape.  The history of their development at the initial stages indicates a completely friendly atmosphere between the countries.  Alexander Troyanovsky was appointed as the first Soviet envoy.  At that time he was a well-known statesman.  From America, the first ambassador was William Bullitt.  After 2 years, in 1935, on July 13, a Trade Agreement was signed between the countries.  In 1937, on August 4, the countries signed an agreement on providing each other with a maximum economic favored nation treatment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="diplomatic relations between the ussr and the usa" class="if" height="489" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1265406.jpg" width="600"></div>

Almost immediately after the Nazi attack, the United States decided to provide economic support to the USSR.  During the war, America made deliveries under Lend-Lease (on loan).  Formal negotiations for help began at the end of September 1941. Roosevelt sent Harriman (his representative) to Moscow.  On October 1, a protocol was signed on the first deliveries to the Soviet Union for 49 months.  $ 1 billion. A week later, Roosevelt endorsed the document, according to which the Lend-Lease extended to the USSR.  In October 1941, the first deliveries began.  In early June 1944, the Anglo-American naval and airborne landing was transferred to Normandy.  Thus formed a second front.  At the end of April 1945, the branches of the 58th Guards.  Infantry Division of the 1st Ukrainian Front and the 69th Infantry Division of the US military met on the river.  Elbe near Torgau.  The establishment of diplomatic relations between the USSR and the USA was of key importance in resolving issues relating to the direct conduct of battles, as well as post-war organization in the world.  During the last years of the Great Patriotic War, three conferences were held between the heads of the USSR, the USA and England (in November 1943 - Tehran, in February 1945 - Yalta, in July-August 1945 - Potsdam). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="usa established diplomatic relations with the ussr" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1265407.jpg" width="485"></div>

The time of the cold war began.  This period lasted almost 40 years.  During this time, a NATO and ATS unit was formed (an organization of the <span>Warsaw Pact countries).</span>  Diplomatic relations between the USSR and the USA are at an impasse.  The rivalry that began for spheres of influence inevitably led to the expansion of the military-strategic complex in each state.  The <span>arms race has</span> begun <span>.</span>  As a result, the economies of both blocs were in an extremely tense state. </p><h2>  Caribbean crisis </h2><p>  It is considered the most dramatic period from the moment when the United States first established diplomatic relations with the USSR.  <span>The Caribbean crisis</span> arose in October 1962. At that time, the Soviet Union deployed its ballistic missiles in Cuba.  It was a response to similar steps taken earlier by America.  The United States installed rockets in Italy and Turkey.  In addition, Cuba was threatened by the invasion of the US military.  As a response, the Soviet leadership brought its forces into combat readiness.  The Caribbean crisis not only threatened the further establishment of diplomatic relations between the USSR and the USA, but also created the danger of a nuclear war.  However, a way out of the situation was found by the joint efforts of Nikita Khrushchev and John F. Kennedy.  The emerging crisis forced the leaders of countries to admit that the confrontation of states can lead to the death of all mankind.  Reaching the peak, the Cold War gradually declined.  The leaders of the two countries began to talk about the limitations of building up military capabilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="diplomatic relations between ussr and usa history" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1265408.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Period of political detente </h2><p>  Diplomatic relations between the USSR and the West began to recover gradually.  By the end of 1960  several key treaties were signed.  In particular, a memorandum was adopted on direct communications between the Kremlin and the White House (1963), the Agreement on the Prohibition of Nuclear Tests in Outer Space, on the Earth and under Water (1963), and On the Principles of the Activities of Countries in Research and Use celestial bodies (including the moon), space "(1967)," On the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons "(1968).  In 1970  several more meetings took place.  During them, countries made bilateral commitments regarding the prevention of nuclear war, disarmament and the limitation of strategic weapons.  So, in 1971, an Agreement was signed on measures to reduce the threat of war between the USSR and the USA.  The following year, states signed the ABM Limitation Treaty and the SALT-1 Interim Document.  In 1974, an Agreement was signed on measures to reduce underground nuclear tests and OSV-2.  In July 1975, the Soyuz and Apollo spacecraft were docked as part of the international space exploration program.  This was the first large-scale event of Soviet-American cooperation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of diplomatic relations of the ussr of russia and the usa" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1265409.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Jackson-Vanik Amendment </h2><p>  It was adopted in one year with the signing of OSV-2 - in 1974.  The amendment related to the United States Trade Act.  She suggested a ban on the provision of the most favored nation treatment, state loans and guarantees to countries in which citizens' rights to emigration are seriously limited or violated.  This norm, first of all, applied to the USSR.  In the Soviet Union in those years there was a restriction on emigration from the country.  After 1985, when they were removed and are still missing, the amendment lost its significance.  However, it was not officially canceled. </p><h2>  First sanctions </h2><p>  They were introduced by the United States in relation to the USSR in connection with the introduction of troops into Afghanistan in 1979. The American administration developed the ‚ÄúCarter Doctrine‚Äù (by the name of the then acting president).  It included several measures of economic and political pressure on the Soviet Union and its activity in the international arena.  In particular, an embargo on the supply of grain to the USSR was established, and scientific, technical and cultural exchanges were declining.  In 1980, most foreign countries boycotted the Olympics in Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="diplomatic relations of the ussr and the west" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1265410.jpg" width="600"></div>
