In tropical countries - Dominican Republic, Thailand, South Vietnam - the tourist season has just begun.  And in Europe it‚Äôs long gone.  It only remains that the UAE, Egypt and similar countries.  There at the end of autumn it is very comfortable to relax.  What about European countries?  Is it everywhere dank and damp, or is there a country where you can still soak up the sun on the eve of winter? </p><p>  In this article we will discuss whether it is possible to go on vacation to Lisbon in November.  Below you will find not only a summary of the weather in the last month of autumn in the capital of Portugal, but also a description of the various holidays and events that can be visited during this period.  The fact that Lisbon is a timeless city and always interesting for tourists is eloquently testified by photos taken in November.  Although this month is not the peak of the season, it has its advantages.  And we will talk about them in our article. </p>

    <h2>  Portugal and its capital </h2><p>  What is it - this small country that covered Europe from the power of the Atlantic Ocean?  Probably everyone wants to go to the ends of the world.  And what is Lisbon?  He, like Rome, stands on seven hills.  Only they are so cool that you need to stock up on comfortable traveling shoes.  But there are so many interesting things in the city that your legs will carry you along the narrow streets and stairs.  In addition, funiculars and, oddly enough, old trams that climb cats along steep slopes with catlike dexterity will come to your aid.  Small wrought-iron balconies, flower pots and drying clothes, painted tiles and architectural monuments testifying to the former imperial greatness of the city - all this attracts millions of tourists to Lisbon every year.  In November, their number decreases markedly.  It's time to go to Portugal! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  When Lisbon's Peak Season </h2><p>  Typically, tourists traveling to a country pursue several goals: sightseeing, beach vacations, gastronomic discoveries, shopping, etc. All this can be obtained in Portugal from late spring to early October.  But for those who ventured to come to Lisbon in November, all the above-mentioned pleasures are available, with the exception of a beach holiday.  But daredevils, of course, can plunge into the waters of the cool Atlantic Ocean in order to feel for themselves the full power of the elements. </p><p>  The beaches of the Lisbon Riviera are empty by November, although the weather is often warm.  The city is located on both banks of the Tagus River.  It‚Äôs not accepted to swim in it, but in November you don‚Äôt have such a desire.  But to visit one of the beaches stretching from the mouth of the Tagus to the village of Cascais is a must.  By the way, on the Lisbon Riviera, you can find yourself suitable housing.  After all, the price of hotels decreases in November compared with the peak of the season is very significant. </p>

    <h2>  Weather in Lisbon in November </h2><p>  Portugal's climate is determined by the Atlantic Ocean.  This water area smooths out the summer heat.  And the warm Gulf Stream carries water from the Caribbean to the Portuguese coast and serves as a ‚Äúheater‚Äù for all of Western Europe.  Such a mild <span>maritime climate</span> contributes to the fact that Lisbon has hot but precipitation-rich summers and very warm and snowless winters.  In the coldest month of the year, January, the daily temperature leaves + 14 degrees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What is the weather like in Lisbon in November?  In the reviews, tourists indicate that in the capital of Portugal you can still find summer.  The temperature in the daytime in the shade reaches + 17 degrees.  And since the sun in Portugal is southern, it is quite possible to wear short-sleeved clothing.  But if you are going to get out of the city, especially on Cape Roca, grab a jacket - it is windy there.  At night in Lisbon, the thermometer can drop to + 3 ¬∞ C.  In the mornings, fog creeps from the Tagus River. </p><p>  November is the rainiest month of the year.  The ratio of cloudy and sunny days is 56 percent against 44. The amount of precipitation in November is 113 mm, while in July this indicator is four millimeters. </p><h2>  Cons of Portugal Holiday at the End of Autumn </h2><p>  November in the Northern Hemisphere is less often chosen for travel because small daylight hours make it impossible to see all the sights.  But Lisbon is not St. Petersburg.  The average day length in the Portuguese capital in November is ten and a half hours.  The main problem for independent excursions is precipitation.  Rainy days in November and meteorologists and tourists counted 15. Moreover, it is difficult to say when the weather will be wet - at the beginning, middle or end of the month.  Those who arrived in Lisbon in November claim that it rained every other day.  Sometimes short-term showers flash over the city, sometimes it drizzles for a whole day. </p><p>  Another minus of a trip to <span>Portugal in November</span> is the high humidity in the reviews.  The average monthly rate is 76%.  But in the morning, relative humidity reaches 86 percent.  Fog creeps from the ocean, which makes it difficult to take colorful photos.  But a little further from the mouth of the Tagus, in the hills, the humidity is not so high. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Pros of relaxing in Portugal in late autumn </h2><p>  Nevertheless, Lisbon in November (photos confirm this) has a quite summer surroundings.  Especially at the beginning of the month.  There are cafes with outdoor terraces; in the city you can walk in clothes with short sleeves.  It is even hot in the sun in early November, and it is quite possible to sunbathe between an hour and four in the afternoon.  But Lisbon is most pleased with the daredevils who decided to come to the ‚Äúoff season‚Äù at low prices.  Tours to Portugal for a week cost from $ 560 at the beginning of the month.  And at the end of November for a slightly larger amount - 560 euros - you can relax for ten days.  As a bonus, half-empty streets near tourist sites, lack of lines and discounts on tickets to museums are offered to daredevils who have selected to Lisbon on the eve of winter. </p>

    <h2>  Where to go and what to see </h2><p>  Lisbon in November in the reviews, tourists call it a magnificent city.  Its originality is even more striking in the absence of crowds of travelers.  The facades of the houses are decorated with "azulezhush" - ceramic painted tiles.  Windows are decorated with shutters and fancy balconies.  And the narrow streets are paved with small stone tiles.  There are few ancient structures in this ancient city.  The 1755 earthquake and the associated tsunamis and fires destroyed a lot.  But what remains is very impressive, even in ruins. </p><p>  This is the cathedral, which was built on the site of a mosque in 1150, and the Carmelite monastery.  Gothic arches and dilapidated arcades against the backdrop of the autumn sky look very romantic.  You should definitely visit the palace, which served as the residence of both the Moorish emir and the <span>Portuguese kings.</span>  You should also see <span>the Belem tower</span> and the monastery of St. Jerome.  To get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat old Lisbon looked like, go to the Alfama area - it was least affected by the earthquake.  Cape of Rock - the westernmost point of Eurasia - is a must visit.  But swimming there is not recommended in the summer months, and in November even more so.  If you travel with children, they will certainly be happy with an excursion to the zoo, puppet museum or oceanarium. </p>

    <h2>  Events in Lisbon in November </h2><p>  Something always happens in this fun city.  The main event of November is Halloween, which, like everywhere in Europe, falls on the night of the first day of November.  In Lisbon, the feast of All Saints is taken seriously.  Crowds of zombies, vampires and witches walk in the streets.  They drink porto, eat presunto (local jamon), have fun and dance to a fado, romances performed on a twelve-portuguese guitar.  Closer to the middle of the month, the Christmas post begins.  But first, all of Portugal celebrates St. Martin's Day (November 11), which marks the beginning of autumn! </p><h2>  What to bring to Lisbon </h2><p>  If you are traveling early in the month, a coat, hat and boots are not needed.  Better take a sunblock - the sun in the first ten days of November still bakes.  The middle of the month is more rainy and cooler.  A light jacket or a thick sweater will come in handy.  If you plan to get to Cape Dora, warm things must be taken: there are strong winds.  In the last decade of the month, they will also be useful, because the thermometer column in the daytime will reach only + 12 degrees in the shade on sunny days and eight in cloudy days.  And you should definitely bring a raincoat or umbrella with you, no matter what time you travel to Lisbon in November.  In the reviews, tourists say that precipitation happens every other day. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Despite the fact that November in Lisbon is the rainiest month of the year, this does not interfere with a good rest.  It‚Äôs not possible to swim anymore: unless brave men and ‚Äúwalruses‚Äù climb into the stormy ocean with a temperature of + 15 degrees.  But no one will stop you from basking in the still warm sunshine on the wonderful beaches of Lisbon.  November is the best time for excursions and walks in the city.  If it suddenly rains, there will always be some interesting museum nearby, since there are several dozen of them in Lisbon.  And all this cognitive aesthetic pleasure can be tasted slowly, without crowds of tourists, freely photographing local attractions. </p>
