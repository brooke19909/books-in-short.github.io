In his youth, he was expelled from his native country, after which he spent many years in a foreign land, earning mercenaries.  Harald served in Russia and in Byzantium.  Returning to Norway, he got the throne due to him.  After this, the king with different success fought with all his neighbors.  His last campaign was a landing in England.  The death of Harald on <span>Foggy Albion</span> marked the end of the era of European Viking raids (for this reason he is often called the "last Viking king"). </p><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  The father of Harald III was Sigurd the Pig - the king of the small kingdom of Ringerike in eastern Norway.  The legendary Viking was born around 1015.  He had a half-brother Olaf II.  In the years 1015-1028.  this relative held the throne of the king of all Norway.  The accession of Olaf was actively promoted by Sigurd. </p><p>  From early childhood, Harald Hardrad became famous for his warlike and implacable disposition.  This is not surprising, such qualities were highly valued by the Vikings.  They came in handy to Harald at the age of 15.  In 1030, Olaf died, overthrown by the pretender to power, Knud Knutling (later called the Great).  Decisive in that war was the battle of Styclastidir.  Olaf lost his life, and Harald Hardrada was injured.  He managed to escape and flee to neighboring Sweden. </p>

    <h2>  Outcast </h2><p>  Having lost his homeland, Harald and in foreign countries began to do what he did best.  He assembled his own detachment and with him began to serve with Yaroslav the Wise.  The army also included the famous warrior Eiliv Ragnwaldson.  The Kiev prince at that time fought with Poland, and the help of the Vikings became a good help for him.  According to the Scandinavian sagas, Harald Hardrada was the second person in the army after Yaroslav himself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is the works of skalds that give the most complete picture of the life of a Viking outside of Norway.  In the set of sagas "Circle of the Earth" there is evidence of the service of Harald by the Byzantine emperor.  Michael IV Paflagonsky included Harald in the elite <span>Varangian guard.</span>  Under the leadership, the Norwegian had five hundred outstanding warriors.  In the service of the Greeks, Harald fought with the Mediterranean pirates.  In 1036-1040  he was in the army of the commander George Maniac.  This army acted in Sicily, where there was a war with the Normans settled there. </p>

    <h2>  Escape from Byzantium </h2><p>  The last major campaign of Harald in the service of the empire was the suppression of the Bulgarian uprising in 1041.  According to legend, the rebel leader Peter II Delyan was personally killed by the Norwegian Viking.  The following year, Harald III Hardrada took part in the Constantinople palace coup.  Then he, who fell into disgrace, had to flee from Byzantium. </p><p>  According to different versions, the Viking took refuge either in Kiev or in Novgorod.  Fortunately, he was able to take away from Greece all the money he earned.  As the head of the guard, he accumulated a significant amount.  All these precious stones and gold also began to be stored in Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Life in Russia </h2><p>  In 1043, Yaroslav the Wise sent Harald with his son, Prince Vladimir of Novgorod, on a campaign against the Byzantine Empire, where Konstantin Monomakh ruled then.  This campaign was unsuccessful.  The Russian fleet suffered a terrible defeat.  Killed 6 thousand combatants.  Harald and Vladimir managed to survive and return to Kiev. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the same winter, the Norwegian married the daughter of Yaroslav the Wise Elizabeth.  They had two children (Ingigerd and Maria).  By the way, the Viking was a Christian.  Nevertheless, many of the old traditions of the pagan past in Scandinavia have not disappeared.  Therefore, Harald was a concubine of Torah.  The future Norwegian kings Magnus II and Olaf III Mirny were born from her. </p><h2>  Again in Norway </h2><p>  The money accumulated during the service in Byzantium allowed Harald to gather a strong army and return to his homeland with him.  In Norway then it was no longer Knut who ruled, but his successor Magnus the Good.  Harald he was a nephew.  Besides Norway, Magnus ruled Denmark.  Taking advantage of this, his opponent entered into an alliance with a candidate for power in the neighboring country, Sven Estridsen.  Magnus realized that he could not cope with such a coalition, and invited his uncle to become his co-ruler.  Harald Harsh agreed. </p><p>  A year after the conclusion of the contract, Magnus died suddenly.  Harald Hardrada and Elizabeth in Norway became the royal couple of the country.  The new sole ruler began to strengthen the internal stability of the state.  The monarch recognized the importance of profitable trade and in 1048 founded Oslo, a convenient place for merchants.  It later became the capital of all of Norway. </p><p>  However, the Viking was not enough.  Denmark also belonged to Magnus, however, he bequeathed its crown to Sven Estridsen.  Harald, who dreamed of uniting all of Scandinavia, declared war on his neighbor.  The Danes were useless opponents.  They suffered several defeats, and the Norwegians even burned the large trading city of Hedeby.  In 1062, Sven was defeated in a naval battle and shamefully fled.  But despite all the successes, Harald never became <span>king of Denmark.</span>  Both ordinary citizens of the country and her nobility were hostile to him.  Realizing the futility of his claims, Harald Hardrada made peace with Sven. </p>

    <h2>  Centralization of power </h2><p>  Harald fought not only with Denmark, but also with Sweden.  In 1063, a rebellion unfaithful to the king of the nobility opened in Norway.  The Swedish monarch supported the rebellious jarls.  Harald, although he could not conquer Denmark, did not intend at all to give back what was rightfully his.  In the same 1063, he defeated the coalition army of rebels and Swedes at the battle of Venus. </p><p>  Suppressing any signs of opposition to his power, Stern did not hesitate in means and showed cruelty.  It was under him that the Norwegian etiquette and wealthy citizens for the first time completely obeyed royal authority.  All those who disagree with the policies of the king, including high taxes and constant wars, were expelled from the country or lost their lives.  Centralizing, Harald Hardrada, the last Viking king, enjoyed the support of the Christian church. </p>

    <h2>  Depart to England </h2><p>  Having achieved stabilization of the situation in Norway, the king could spend the rest of his days alone.  But what did the elderly Harald Hardrad already dream about?  The king's marriages gave him heirs, which means confidence in the reliable continuation of the dynasty.  However, the monarch was still distinguished by youthful ardor, dreamed of new conquests and the spread of his power.  Therefore, when circumstances gave him the opportunity to declare his claims to power in Britain, he did not fail to seize this chance. </p><p>  During his lifetime, Harald‚Äôs predecessor on the Norwegian throne, Magnus, concluded an agreement with King Hardecnud that after the death of the latter he would become his heir.  The reality of this arrangement is not proven by historians.  Nevertheless, it was with this argument that Harald arrived in Misty Albion, leading a significant army. </p>

    <h2>  Death </h2><p>  The King of England in 1066 was Harold II Godvinson.  It was he who resisted Harold.  The Norwegian king enlisted the support of the disgraced brother of his adversary, Tostig Godvinson.  The landing of the Vikings occurred in Northern England. </p><p>  In the first battle at Fulford, near York, the Norwegians won a landslide victory.  However, the triumph was short-lived.  Five days later (September 25, 1066), Harald the Cruel suffered a crushing defeat and died on the battlefield after falling into the throat of an enemy arrow.  300 <span>Viking ships</span> arrived in England <span>.</span>  Only 25 managed to escape. The body of the king was also returned to his homeland.  He was buried in Trondheim.  A few weeks later, Harold II Godvinson was overthrown by a new contender for the English throne - Norman William the Conqueror. </p>
