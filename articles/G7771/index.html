  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Phone with AMOLED display: model overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Quite a few manufacturers of mobile gadgets are starting to give up quite good IPS-matrices in favor of AMOLED displays.  Which phones they are installed in is pretty easy to find out.  Just look at the screen on in total darkness.  If there are at least some glimpses of light, then you have the usual LCD-backlight with IPS technology.  Phones with an AMOLED display have a completely black screen and do not light up.  This is one of the most remarkable features of this technology. </p><p>  Samsung is considered to be a pioneer in this area.  It was she who showed and told in detail what the AMOLED display on the phone is.  Samsung and its engineers were able to design an active matrix using organic LEDs.  The abbreviation AMOLED is precisely the decoding of this technology <span>(Active Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode).</span> </p><h2>  Difficulty choosing </h2><p>  Phones with an AMOLED screen have a number of undeniable advantages and there are practically no at least some significant disadvantages.  That is why many manufacturers are moving their new models to them. </p><p>  Advantages of AMOLED technology: </p><ul><li>  noticeably less energy consumption in comparison with conventional matrices; </li><li>  more varied colors; </li><li>  reduced response time; </li><li>  maximum viewing angles; </li><li>  high and at the same time comfortable for the eyes contrast; </li><li>  the ability to work with ultra-thin cases. </li></ul><p>  Also on sale you can find phones with Super AMOLED-screen.  The prefix "Super" was added by Samsung marketers to incite interest in new models.  In principle, as such, there is no difference between a regular phone and a phone with a super AMOLED display. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The only thing that can be called more or less significant is the elimination of the air gap in the gadgets marked ‚ÄúSuper‚Äù.  This gave an impetus to an even greater decrease in the thickness of the case, and that‚Äôs all, and the backbone of the technologies has remained as it is, and there are no other cardinal changes.  So for those who do not want to overpay the extra money for a millimeter of thinness, it is not at all necessary to buy phones with a Super AMOLED display. </p><p>  Some experts even track negative aspects in new screens and describe in detail flaws in thematic forums.  The fact is that smartphones with a Super AMOLED display use a sub-pixel dot layout of the PenTile RGBG standard.  This allows you to significantly increase the life of the screen, but at the same time, the picture on the output worsens. </p><p>  A good half of manufacturers, including Samsung, preferred to remain silent about this feature in their brochures, but soon corrected the situation by releasing all the same phones with Super AMOLED, with the only difference being that the new gadgets support the familiar RGB RGB format.  The latter is just used in conventional AMOLED devices without the Super prefix.  So be sure to pay attention to the variety of the standard RGB before buying a smartphone. </p><p>  Next, we consider the best phones with AMOLED display, which are distinguished by their quality component and a large number of flattering reviews from consumers.  All the models described below can be seen on the shelves of both offline and online stores.  So there shouldn‚Äôt be any problems with "look and feel". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Google pixel </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, users find this phone with an AMOLED display perfectly balanced in terms of cost and return.  The gadget on the Android platform received a rather nifty set of chipsets that can handle any modern applications, as well as an intelligent 12 megapixel camera. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="google pixel" class="if uuid-2597134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2597134.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the device boasts an attractive appearance with an original design.  5-inch phone with AMOLED-display pleases Quad-HD-scan and picture of exceptional quality with maximum viewing angles. </p><h2>  Features of the device </h2><p>  It is also worth noting that the model received a very good battery, which, in tandem with AMOLED technology, allows you to use the device with the maximum load for that all day.  The obvious advantages include the presence of a fingerprint sensor that works almost instantly, and excellent build quality without a hint of backlash, gaps, creaks and other problems. </p><p>  The only point that users sometimes complain about in their reviews is the lack of good protection.  For the money, the same "Samsung" offers almost the same gadget, but meets the class ip68. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Estimated cost of the device is about 25,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy S7 </h2><p>  The 5.1-inch phone with an AMOLED display and a resolution of 2560 by 1440 pixels got the best this technology can offer, with all the Super and Ultra consoles.  One of the main differences from competitors in this segment is the availability on board of a full-fledged slot for working with SD cards and <span>the protection class ip68.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.samsung.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="galaxy s7" class="if uuid-2597128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2597128.jpg"></div><p>  The model can please its owner with an exceptional picture, where all the data is clearly visible even in direct sunlight, not to mention the juicy image in the room and shadow.  The device works under the control of the Android platform, but this does not prevent it from being autonomous at all.  The gadget will calmly last all day at maximum load. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the model </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, users have no complaints about the build quality of the smartphone, but you don‚Äôt expect anything else for this money.  There are no loopholes, gaps, creaks or crunches here.  Owners respond positively to the appearance of the device.  A stylish case with competent contrast gives the gadget a chic, and the owner - a feeling of satisfaction with the purchase. </p><p>  Performance also did not disappoint.  The device will master everything that you offer him, and will not even choke, so new games and "heavy" applications go without problems, not to mention the impeccable operation of the interface. </p><p>  Estimated cost of the model is about 26,000 rubles. </p><h2>  OnePlus 3T </h2><p>  Another 5.5-inch phone with AMOLED display with Full HD-resolution, which boasts a very fast processor and an impressive amount of RAM.  Even some flagship models of venerable brands can envy the chipset set. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone with AMOLED screen" class="if uuid-2597129" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2597129.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the device boasts a high-quality aluminum case, excellent assembly, attractive appearance and a 16-megapixel camera that takes great pictures.  Despite the fact that this model bypasses the Galaxy S7 a bit on synthetic tests, OnePlus 3T has a weak point in resolution.  If Samsung can offer Quad HD, then here we have Full HD.  For a smartphone, this may not be so crucial, but judging by the reviews, a good half of users consider this point critical. </p><p>  The gadget has no problems with autonomy.  The battery will last a decent day, even if you properly load the device with "heavy" applications. </p><p>  The estimated price of a smartphone is about 25,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Huawei Mate 9 </h2><p>  The 6-inch device can already be classified as a phablet, but despite its massive dimensions, using it just like a phone is quite convenient.  The model can offer Quad HD-sweep with a resolution of 2560 by 1440 pixels.  The output image is juicy, bright and does not fade even with a strong change in the viewing angle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.4gltemall.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Huawei Matt 9" class="if uuid-2597131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2597131.jpg"></div><p>  Gadget performance is also up to par.  The eight-core processor boasts its speed, and 4 GB of RAM helps it digest the most powerful applications.  So there are no problems with launching games here, not to mention the steel work of the interface. </p><h2>  Phone Features </h2><p>  The appearance of the model was also a success.  The all-aluminum case has received smooth features that will appeal to any user.  In addition, the device has a 12-megapixel camera, and the output pictures are detailed and more than worthy, even without looking at the time of day. </p><p>  The obvious advantages include battery life.  The 4000 mAh rechargeable battery allows at least a day to work quietly on any downloads.  Users are very positive about the features of the phone.  In addition, the critical visual component in our case has been expanded to a 6-inch size and allows you to watch videos and play games with due comfort. </p><p>  Estimated cost of the model is about 27,000 rubles. </p><h2>  LG V20 </h2><p>  This is a flagship, but at the same time relatively inexpensive model from the famous LG brand.  The device, like the previous respondent, is rather large - 5.7 inches, but this does not prevent it from being convenient.  The screen copes well with a resolution of 2560 by 1440 pixels plus has an additional module on a regular IPS-matrix with a scan of 160 by 1040 pixels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.qore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lg v20" class="if uuid-2597133" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2597133.jpg"></div><p>  The model received an intelligent processor and more than enough RAM - 4 GB.  This allows you to run on your phone any, even the most serious applications without lags, friezes and other brakes. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the model </h2><p>  It is also worth noting that the device is equipped with a high-quality 16-megapixel camera, which can easily cope with night shooting and winter, not to mention the good sunny weather.  In obvious pluses, you can record battery life.  The 3200 mAh battery provides stable and long-term operation of the model throughout the day with maximum load. </p><p>  Users respond very warmly about the smartphone and its capabilities.  The domestic consumer was especially pleased with the cost of the gadget, which does not exceed the mark of 20 thousand rubles.  In addition, the phone pleased many with its attractive design with contrasting elements. </p><p>  The estimated price of a smartphone is about 19,000 rubles. </p><h2>  HTC 10 </h2><p>  The device boasts not only an advanced AMOLED screen with a 2560-by-1440-dot scan, but also an excellent multimedia component.  The model received stereo speakers, and they are made not just for show, but they work as they should and produce excellent sound. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nts 10" class="if uuid-2597135" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2597135.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews, many users consider the NTS 10 a very good alternative to the more expensive Samsung with its Galaxy S7.  Here we have similar specifications with the only difference being that protection from water and dust is not provided in this case. </p><p>  A set of chipsets allows you to run any modern application and without any problems process it with a decent frame rate.  In addition, the model has a reliable and effective fingerprint scanner, which works in a split second and accurately identifies the owner. </p><p>  The battery life is slightly less than the previous respondents, but clearly higher than that of other "Android" brothers without an AMOLED screen.  A 3000 mAh battery lasts almost the whole day with a serious load on the chipsets.  In mixed mode, the battery will last a couple of days. </p><p>  As for the appearance, users are ambiguous about the design of the model and call it a little one-sided and outdated.  Nevertheless, the exterior of the device inspires respect, it shows that in your hands the gadget is not for 10 thousand rubles, but a serious device.  There are also no complaints about the quality of the assembly: nothing creaks, crunches, and does not play. </p><p>  Estimated cost of the model is about 20,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Motorola Moto Z </h2><p>  The device received a smart set of chipsets, 4 GB of RAM and an excellent picture on the output in the resolution of 2560 by 1440 pixels.  This also includes the explanatory matrix of the 13 megapixel camera, which gives good pictures with a video sequence regardless of the weather. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digit.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="motorola z" class="if uuid-2597132" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2597132.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews, many users were pleased with the appearance of the model.  The original design and barely recognizable notes of the good old "Motorola" are pleasing to the eye and inspire respect.  It is also worth noting that the device is deprived of the usual 3.5 mm audio jack-type output.  The manufacturer offers a modern USB-C adapter. </p><p>  In addition, the owner has the opportunity to connect various modular systems.  Today's market offers a lot of options, so you can choose peripherals for every taste, from speakers to serious projectors. </p><p>  The smartphone also has no problems with performance.  All modern and "heavy" gaming applications run quickly, users do not notice any lags with friezes.  The only fly in the ointment for such an advanced gadget is the battery capacity - only 2600 mAh.  So the battery life varies within 8 hours at maximum load. </p><p>  The estimated price of the device is about 25,000 rubles. </p>
