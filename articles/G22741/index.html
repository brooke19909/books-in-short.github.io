It also provides for the repayment of credit debt (including third-party banks), the transfer of contributions to the FIU.  But more often than not, the population uses "Auto Payment" to pay for telephone bills. </p><p>  The holder of a registered international card of Sberbank sets a minimum threshold for the amount on the balance of the phone.  And if the limit approaches the minimum value, funds are automatically transferred to the specified account of the subscriber (in the established amount).  When the transfer is completed - the SMS notification about the operation is received to the owner of the phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Payment for communication services of any operators can be made from one card, but you can only connect the Auto Payment offer to one of the numbers to which a specific account is linked. </p><h2>  Auto Payment service settings </h2><p>  The holder of an account with Sberbank and a cell phone can set certain settings.  Several offer options allow each client to choose the option that suits him best. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable auto payment sberbank" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16531/354043.jpg" width="272"></div>  For example, write-offs may not be made upon reaching a certain threshold, but every month, week or day in a certain amount.
