  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first model of Nokia. Mobira Senator - the first mobile phone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Finnish company Nokia has been operating for a long time.  It began its activities in the late 19th century, but became world famous only in the second half of the twentieth.  Initially, the company was engaged in the production of paper and cellulose, then - rubber and rubberized cables.  For some time she was engaged in the manufacture of consumer electronics and radio equipment for the military.  The company released its first Nokia mobile phone only in 1983, almost a hundred years after its inception. </p><h2>  The first model of mobile dialer </h2><p>  Nokia has been manufacturing radiotelephones for a long time before releasing the first truly mobile phone, Nokia.  The first cordless phones were large and bulky.  They were mainly used as car telephone exchanges, since such a telephone weighed more than 6 kg.  In order to call from such a device, it was necessary to register it.  He was assigned a number that had to be indicated when calling the operator.  The communication was as follows: the subscriber called the operator, called his number and asked him to connect with another.  After that, he was waiting for an answer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theguardian.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="first Nokia phone model" class="if uuid-3158605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/3158605.jpg"></div><p>  The first Nokia mobile phone, which you could take with you and call from anywhere and anywhere (just to have coverage), appeared only in 1983.  Today it is difficult to imagine that a phone weighing 800 grams and with the dimensions of a brick could be a convenient mobile device, but then it was so.  You could take it with you - it easily fit in a bag or briefcase.  The battery lasted for 8 hours.  A PBX network was used for calls.  Calls were made as follows: first, the owner of the handset called the operator and called the phone number that he wanted to call. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first models of the Mobira series were supplied both to Western countries and to the Soviet Union.  The company had an agreement with the USSR.  They not only supplied handsets, but also built the appropriate infrastructure.  The owners of the first mobile phones were representatives of the party elite.  It is reliably known that Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev had such an apparatus, and he used it.  Therefore, the first Nokia model was sometimes called the Hump.  In 1987, an improved model was released, which weighed almost two times less than the previous version. </p><h2>  The fight of two brands </h2><p>  The first models of mobile phones released by Nokia, CityMan and Mobira Senator competed with only one company, which owns the primacy of the invention of a cell phone - Motorola.  This struggle lasted a long time, and only after 2000 Nokia prevailed over its competitor.  It should be clarified that initially the advantage was on the side of Motorola.  However, Nokia was able not only to create the first mobile phone, but also to build the appropriate infrastructure for customer service.  The first step to success was the creation of a GSM standard for signal transmission and an extensive coverage area.  Now you can make calls directly.  The operator connected the subscribers automatically, it was enough just to enter the desired number and make a call. </p><p>  Oddly enough, another competitor of the first Nokia phones was a regular landline telephone, which was installed at home or on the street (telephone box).  Calling from such a phone was easier and cheaper.  The signal was stable, and there was no interference either.  However, Nokia also coped with such a competitor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The first model that fit in the hand </h2><p>  The cumbersome first designs were replaced by the convenient and compact Nokia 1011.  It was placed in a hand or pocket and enjoyed great success not only among businessmen and politicians, but also among people with an average income.  This was the first mass release model in the history of Nokia phones.  They were released almost until 1994.  Signal transmission was carried out according to the ATC standard.  The battery lasted for a day.  The handset weighed less than 400 grams (and this was a breakthrough for the company), had a phone book with 99 addresses, and the ability to send text messages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="appleinsider.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia phone series" class="if uuid-3158618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/3158618.jpg"></div><h2>  The banana tube </h2><p>  Perhaps the most recognizable model was the Nokia 8110, which the people nicknamed for the curved shape of a banana.  By the way, this was the first Nokia model, which the company actively advertised.  So, the protagonist in the first film ‚ÄúThe Matrix‚Äù received exactly ‚ÄúNokia 8110‚Äù in an envelope. </p><p>  In total, over 50 million copies of this model were sold worldwide.  Keep in mind that in the nineties of the last century, a mobile phone was still considered a luxury.  Expensive was not so much a telephone as a communications service.  Therefore, such a sales volume for that time was a kind of record.  It was convenient to hold the phone in hand, to protect the buttons a retractable cover was installed in it.  On the first devices of this model, the cover performed an exclusively protective function, in later variations it served as a call reception button and was pulled out using a wheel, rather than longitudinal recesses on the sides. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Nokia's best-selling phone model </h2><p>  In the late nineties, other electronics manufacturers entered the cell phone market: Alcatel, LG, Sony and others.  However, the leadership remained with Motorola and Nokia mobile phones.  Due to the spread of a unified standard for GSM data transfer, the creation of infrastructure and large coverage, communication services have become significantly cheaper.  All this made it possible to realize the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan inexpensive mobile phone for everyone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.redringtones.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="first nokia models with buttons" class="if uuid-3158622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/3158622.jpg"></div><p>  The first model of the Nokia phone, which became mass, is the Nokia 1100. This simple model had a simple set of functions for its time: a phone book with hundreds of numbers, support for the basic communication standards (GSM) at that time, and the transmission of SMS messages.  A simple, unremarkable grayish-white tube, with a small black and white screen and keys protected from dust and moisture (a little trick from the manufacturer).  It was intended for sale in developing countries, but in other countries the pipes sold well.  In total, over 260 million Nokia mobile phones were sold.  Moreover, the device still sells well, however, today it is not released, but the remainder is sold from warehouses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theguardian.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia push button" class="if uuid-3158603" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/3158603.jpg"></div><h2>  Indestructible model </h2><p>  The rugged case of the push-button Nokia 5210 secured the glory of the unkillable for him.  What kind of memes and jokes about him have not been invented!  Especially often, this model is compared with modern touch phones, which are not very durable (the weak point of such phones is the large screen).  The same case was on the Nokia 3310, on which the panels could be changed.  They were colorful, and the game ‚ÄúSnake‚Äù first appeared on the phone.  He became lighter than his predecessor.  For the first time, the phone has transformed from an apparatus for businessmen and politicians into a fashion accessory. </p><h2>  Heyday </h2><p>  After the world passed through 2000, the Nokia series of phones became the most popular.  Many brands could not stand such a strong competition in all market segments.  Motorola surrendered the most.  The market was literally littered with Nokia models.  The company has captured all market segments, from simple budget models to extra-class devices. </p><p>  It is difficult to single out any Nokia model that really would be a cult model at that time.  The assortment of push-button Nokia phones at that time was simply breathtaking.  Monoblocks, folding beds, sliders, ordinary and original.  There were very unusual models, such as the Nokia 5510.  But in it, the manufacturer was too sophisticated, so sales were low.  This was not the first Nokia mobile phone, during the development of which serious marketing and technical miscalculations were made. </p><p>  In general, the company at that time had the opportunity for experimentation.  The brand was famous and popular, sales were high.  Even when Apple launched the first touchscreen phone in 2008, the market did not immediately respond.  Almost until 2012, Nokia had no problems selling mobile phones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theguardian.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia phone series" class="if uuid-3158611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/3158611.jpg"></div><h2>  Attempts to break into the laptop and handheld market </h2><p>  The Nokia company for a long time did not abandon attempts to create a mobile device that in its functionality and comfort would not be inferior to powerful, but bulky laptops.  At the same time, device users could use it both as a mini-laptop with Internet access, and as a mobile phone for calls and SMS. </p><p>  The first Nokia model with buttons on the computer keyboard was the Communicator Nokia 9000. However, the know-how was not appreciated by the market.  The phone turned out to be bulky, its mass was 400 grams, which at that time was already considered a significant drawback.  In addition, users did not understand why overpay for a low-power computer with limited functionality, when for the same money it was possible to purchase a laptop or computer and there was still money to connect a wired Internet and modem.  Less than 8 million units have been sold worldwide.  The line of such mobile devices had to be closed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theguardian.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia push button" class="if uuid-3158637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/3158637.jpg"></div><h2>  First problems </h2><p>  The appearance of touch-screen phones shook the position of the Nokia buttons a little, but it was too early to talk about the loss of the entire market.  The company tried to develop its own line of mobile devices with a touch screen, but this can hardly be called a major breakthrough.  The first model from Nokia with a touch screen - 5800 XPress - worked on the Symbian operating system, had a not very high-quality assembly, because of this the case creaked in hand.  It weighed significantly more than Samsung with the same technical characteristics, but it cost more.  In addition, Samsung worked on the more popular Android OS.  But the biggest blow to the company was not caused by large industrial giants, but by Chinese and Indian manufacturers of cheap and convenient touchscreen smartphones. </p><h2>  New attempt </h2><p>  After Microsoft acquired the Finnish company, MS management did not change the name Nokia, but released a line of touchscreen phones Nokia Lumia.  They tried to take all the best from previous Nokia mobile phones - this is a rugged case, a powerful camera and processor, and add their own.  As an innovation, Microsoft added an original case design, a large touch screen and an MS Phone OS. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theguardian.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="history of nokia phones" class="if uuid-3158612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/3158612.jpg"></div><p>  Nokia Lumia sold significantly better than the company's previous touch models.  However, the weak support from third-party software developers and the low popularity of OS Windows Phone on mobile devices led Microsoft to have to transfer some devices to OS Android.  Although the brand remained, but the company itself already has a different name and belongs to Microsoft. </p><h2>  Does the company release push-button phones today </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the company has reoriented towards the release of high-tech smartphones, it does not cease to develop and market modern Nokia push-button telephones.  New models are developed in accordance with modern quality standards and have the corresponding standardized connectors for the charger and headset.  These are mainly budget models. </p><h2>  Can I buy old phones and will they work today </h2><p>  The company ceased to produce many old phone models, but they are in large numbers in warehouses.  Older models of Nokia phones are sold by various intermediaries through online stores.  They cost less than at the time of the first release, while they are fully operational, and since the GSM standard has not disappeared anywhere, you can use them, call and send SMS, even use as a modem, as some models supported 2G- and 3G standards back in the early 2000s.  The most popular models are Nokia 1100, 6200, 6300. </p><p>  However, not all devices can be purchased cheaply.  For example, the first Nokia models of the Mobiro series are now considered rare.  They are few and they are expensive, they are sold not from the warehouse, but from the hands.  The price they have, most often, is the same as at the time when the mobile phone was new.  If there are more modern devices on the market that are several times cheaper, this price seems prohibitive. </p><h2>  The value of the company's work in the development of modern communications </h2><p>  Although Nokia has lost the market and gone under the hammer, its contribution to the development of modern communications is rated very highly.  In fact, it was thanks to her that the first standards of high-quality data transfer appeared: GSM, WAP / GPRS, and then 3G.  Nokia has developed the principle of signal transmission and installation of stations at a certain distance from each other, thus creating a large coverage area and stable signal reception and transmission. </p><p>  Many of the ideas that the company tried to implement in their devices were successfully applied by other manufacturers of mobile phones and smartphones.  Nokia has always gone a few steps ahead of its competitors, offering devices that were not always understood by users.  As a result, it lost its position and lost a large market share.  But despite the setbacks, Nokia mobile phones are still in high demand.  This brand is trusted.  They continue to fulfill their main task: to connect people in different corners of the earth. </p>
