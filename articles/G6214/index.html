Kazakhstan, Lake Chelkar - rest</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Among the reservoirs of Kazakhstan there are lakes with the same name - Shalkar (Chalkar, Chelkar).  One of them is located in the West Kazakhstan region (WKO), the other in the North Kazakhstan region (NKO).  Another small lake is located southwest of the city of the same name Chelkar in the Aktobe region.  Since 2000, the transcription of names has been changed to Shalkar.  This Kazakh word means “large”, “huge”.  The steppe wind raises waves on the surface of the lakes with a white cap of foam, which resembles the sea. </p><h2>  Chelkar Lake - the sea in the steppes of Western Kazakhstan </h2><p>  The natural reservoir is located in the West Kazakhstan region, in the southeast of the Terektinsky district, south of the city of Uralsk.  The mysteries of the steppe sea occupy the minds of researchers, and the uniqueness of nature, clean air, soft clear water and warm sandy beaches attract thousands of tourists on its shores. </p>

    <p>  The lake is about 18 km long and 14 km wide.  The oval basin is slightly elongated from north to south.  The average depth of the reservoir is 5 m, the maximum distance to the bottom is 18 m. The surface of the lake is at around 17 m relative to the level of the World Ocean, and its origin causes a lot of controversy.  A number of scientists consider the deepening a trace of the ancient Khvalynsk Sea, which gradually receded and remained within the Caspian. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Two rivers flow into Lake Chelkar (photo presented in the article) - Bolshaya and Malaya Ankaty.  Only one flows out - Solyanka, a drying <span>tributary of the Urals.</span>  The basin is filled with clean and clear water from underground sources, reminiscent of the Black Sea in its sodium chloride composition.  Mineralization varies seasonally, averaging 14 mg / l, the reaction is slightly alkaline (pH 8.5).  Water and sediment contain components that have health benefits. </p>

    <p>  Tourists stay in boarding houses on the shore, where the benefits of civilization are available.  On the coast, vacationers can rent a yurt for an overnight stay and feel like ancient nomads on the Great Silk Road.  Steppe plants exude spicy aromas into the air, the shores folded by bizarre stones, sometimes covered with fine sand, gently descend to the water.  Its temperature in the midst of summer reaches 24 ° C. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The nature of Lake Chelkar (WKO) </h2>

    <p>  In the south and north, Lake Chelkar is bordered by the hills of Sasai and Santas.  The second massif is a regional geological and botanical monument.  Features of the territory - the presence of solonetzes and a high degree of mineralization of groundwater.  Under these most difficult conditions, endemic species of flora and calciphytes adapted to life on limestone deposits grow.  On the southern shore of the lake, opposite the village of Saryumir, there is a sandbank, its length is 8 km.  Carp, bream, pike, pike perch and other fish species are found in the catch of fishermen.  The world of feathered lakes is rich; many species of mammals, characteristic of the steppe zone, live on its shores. </p><h2>  Ecology of Lake Shalkar </h2><p>  In July 2014, there was a short-term turbidity of the water and pollution of the coast with greenish silt caused by natural processes.  The incident affected the mood of tourists who dreamed of visiting Lake Chelkar.  The recreation area quickly cleared, but many travelers did not dare to go to the reservoir, not knowing the causes of a natural phenomenon.  The pollution turned out to be short-lived, and the fact of its appearance confirms the need for further research and protection of the nature of the lake.  In recent years, its level has been declining, a lot of water has gone after the earthquake. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Infrastructure problems </h2><p>  The benefits of relaxing on the coast are the extraordinary properties of lake water and air, which have a bactericidal and regenerative effect.  Some tourists are calm about the fact that the yurt to accommodate all guests and food items on the coast is not enough for everyone who wants to visit the lake <strong> </strong>  Chelkar (Kazakhstan).  <span>The recreation center</span> needs work to improve the beach, landscaping, modernizing access roads, which become impassable during rain.  There are vacationers who consider the current obsessive low-level service a temporary phenomenon, counting on improving conditions. </p>

    <p>  Differences in relief in the vicinity of the lake - from steppe foothills to mountains of medium height (1500 m).  Flora is characterized by a predominance of steppe and forest-steppe vegetation.  The islands of the forest are represented by pine forests, the steppe areas are represented by the feather-grass-motley “sea”.  Typical representatives of the fauna are ungulates (wild boar, elk, roe deer, Askanian deer).  There are hares, squirrels, predators (steppe polecat, corsac, weasel, wolf, fox). </p><p>  The southern part of the coast of the lake is higher, rocky ledges are exposed here, covered mainly with coniferous vegetation.  On the southeastern coast, gentle slopes to the water and sandy beaches open.  The narrowed part, the cross, separates the large and small Shalkar.  The width of this small strait is 200 m. Commercial fish are found in the lake: perch, crucian carp, carp and other species. </p><h2>  Holiday season on the lake Shalkar </h2><p>  The healing properties of water, good opportunities for recreation and fishing glorified Lake Chelkar.
