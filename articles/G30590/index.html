Lenovo: customer reviews, review, specifications and features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Is it any surprise to see a completely good smartphone from Lenovo on the storefront with electronics?  Of course not.  After all, the Chinese manufacturer has repeatedly produced budget models.  And to be more precise, I started with them.  Inside <span>Lenovo A 2010,</span> probably, and decent hardware.  Although, what to guess, it is worthwhile to carefully examine the smartphone and find out what Lenovo 2010 features, reviews and features are. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The manufacturer packed his device in a small box of white color, on which the main characteristics are already indicated.  Inside, everything that is needed, or rather, everything that can be put for 6000 rubles, lies. </p>

    <p>  So, in addition to the device, the package includes <span>a power adapter, a</span> USB cable for data transfer, a warranty card, an instruction manual and a headset.  As for the headphones, they are quite simple.  And if you take into account the customer reviews left about the Lenovo 2010 smartphone, then you will have to get more suitable ‚Äúears‚Äù to listen to music. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  In terms of appearance, the smartphone differs little from most similar devices.  The case is almost rectangular, since the upper and lower ends have small curves.  Speaking of rounding.  This also applies to the back cover of the device, which makes the phone seem more compact. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the expense of the material, there is no illusion - this is ordinary matte plastic soft touch.  But it is good enough, as it makes invisible scratches and other minor damage to the case.  The model can be purchased in black as well as white.  In general, no matter what, the device looks good, which is what the customer reviews left about the Lenovo A 2010 smartphone say. </p>

    <p>  It is unlikely that it will be possible to find something new among the phone's connectors.  Above the display is an auditory speaker and a front camera, and under the screen are three touch sensitive keys.  In the background, they differ: the main camera, located at the top, a flash under it, then the Lenovo logo and the bottom of the speaker grille. </p><p>  On the right side of the case there is a volume control button and a power key.  The left side is empty.  There is a microphone on the bottom, and on the top there is a USB connector and an inlet for the headset.  This is what the 2010 Lenovo A looks like.  Reviews say that this arrangement of controls and connectors is convenient. </p><h2>  Screen Features </h2><p>  The smartphone has a small (4.5 inches) touch screen with a pixel density of 218 ppi.  It is difficult to call it clear, although the graininess is not noticeable.  The display does not have the best viewing angles, and without glare in bright sunshine, information is difficult to see. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  How does the Lenovo A 2010 smartphone function?  Customer reviews suggest that the device has high contrast, but medium color rendering.  Dark is transmitted darker, and light is lighter.  Moreover, the settings are rather modest, but they relate mainly to brightness.  The sensor works well, it responds quickly to touch, but only supports two clicks at a time.  And this explains the price indicated for the phone ‚ÄúLenovo A 2010‚Äù.  Reviews, however, are not yet available on this subject.  Apparently, few people are interested in the multitouch in this model. </p><h2>  Gadget performance </h2><p>  Those devices that Lenovo refers to the ‚ÄúA‚Äù line are all budget models.  But for such a cost, the device in question has very worthy characteristics. </p><p>  So, inside the communicator is a MediaTek processor (MT6735) with a 64-bit architecture.  Of course, the frequency of 1 GHz cannot be called high, but there are four Cortex-A53 cores.  The processor is helped by the Mali-T720 graphics card with support for modern specifications that improve graphics quality. </p>

    <p>  Also, the device has 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of memory for storing data.  This is not the worst option, given that usually in smartphones of this price category more than 4 GB does not happen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In general, the filling of the smartphone is very consistent with the declared value.  And the reviews left about the phone A 2010 Lenovo are a direct confirmation of this.  It will easily launch many games, not for nothing that in AnTutu the device scores 20,000 points. </p><h2>  Smartphone cameras Lenovo 2010: specifications, reviews </h2><p>  It is clear that a multi-pixel camera in this unit is not worth the wait.  The main 5-megapixel module is equipped with an LED flash, but without autofocus.  The quality of photographs is especially affected by lighting.  If there is little light, then the image in the picture may turn out to be blurry.  With a sufficient level of illumination, the quality of photos improves markedly.  But if you read the reviews written about the phone A 2010 Lenovo, the camera is rarely noted, especially in a positive way.  There is nothing special to say about the front 2-megapixel module, except that it is equipped with a fixed focus. </p><p>  There is nothing complicated about camera control.  There are only a few functions: <span>panoramic shooting,</span> HDR mode and several filters that you can optionally apply to the photo. </p>

    <p>  Videos also do not differ in quality.  Video is recorded in a maximum resolution of 1280 √ó 720, and this happens at a speed of 30 frames / s.  But this is not a camera phone, so it makes no sense to find fault with weak cameras in this case.  Even on the forums, discussing the Lenovo A 2010 smartphone, there are practically no reviews about the quality of shooting. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The device runs on Android, version 5.1 Lollipop, which provides the device with excellent performance.  Applications, browser, multimedia files - everything opens quickly and works smoothly.  By the way, the interface of this model differs little from the previous devices of the company. </p><p>  Although there are still some innovations, for example, an updated notification panel and application manager.  Of the pre-installed programs, there is only the most necessary. </p><h2>  Multimedia features </h2><p>  To listen to music, the most common media player is installed.  There is also an FM tuner and voice recorder with the ability to enable recording during a call.  The video player is characterized in that it can trim the video.  And there is also a zoom-in function that allows you to select a specific area on the screen, and then zoom it in.  And although both players cannot boast a large set of settings, there are no complaints about their work.  This opinion is formed by most people who bought a Lenovo A 2010 smartphone.  Reviews about the multimedia capabilities of the device are mostly positive. </p>

    <p>  For typing, this model uses a regular keyboard from Google.  Working with it, of course, is convenient, but it‚Äôs worthwhile to understand that the smaller the diagonal of the display, the more difficult it is to press the desired icon.  The language is switched with one key, continuous character entry and fast dialing of numbers are also supported. </p><p>  There are three browsers installed to access the Internet: standard, Google Chrome and <span>UC Browser.</span>  Each of them has its own characteristics.  The first makes it possible to scale the page to the width of the screen.  The second can synchronize with the desktop version of the browser.  And the third seems to be the most functional.  It can adjust traffic, read mode and even screen brightness. </p><h2>  Communication opportunities </h2><p>  Great news: the smartphone can work in 2G, 3G and 4G networks.  And he does it pretty cleverly.  Where such confidence?  From users who leave gadget A 2010 Lenovo reviews.  Many of them note 4G connection for the better. </p>

    <p>  There is support for Bluetooth fourth version, Wi-Fi, GPS-module and NFC-mode.  For many it will be a big plus to have 2 SIM.  Settings allow you to assign an individual sound signal to each number. </p><h2>  Battery life and memory </h2><p>  Another important point is the autonomy of the device.  Battery capacity - 2050 mAh.  This should be enough for a couple of days, unless, of course, you constantly load the device with game and multimedia content.  Otherwise, after 5-6 hours, you will have to connect the charger.  And, given the reviews characterizing the Lenovo A 2010 phone, charging is not a quick matter.  And this process takes about 3 hours.  It‚Äôs good that there is an energy saving mode. </p><p>  As for the internal memory, its actual size differs markedly from the one indicated on the box.  Indeed, out of 8 GB, almost half is occupied by the operating system.  And this is immediately noticed by users who bought a Lenovo A 2010 phone.  Reviews about this drawback are quite common.  An additional memory card inserted in the corresponding slot will help to correct the situation.  It is located under the battery, so these manipulations without rebooting the device are impossible.  Just remember that applications cannot be installed in additional storage.  This place is only for media files. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Perhaps it's time to finish the review of Lenovo A 2010.  Characteristics, reviews, price - everything has been considered.  Summing up, we can conclude that in general the phone justifies its value.  It is powerful enough, of course, for a budget option.  It supports LTE networks, allows you to make calls and receive calls from two SIM cards and, importantly, works on OS Android 5.1. </p>

    <p>  Although, there are drawbacks regarding weak cameras, long charging time, lack of <span>light</span> and proximity <span>sensors</span> , as well as a small data storage.  In addition, there are conflicting reviews about the display of the smartphone.  For some, it is not enough, some are not satisfied with its resolution, and it is covered with glass of not the highest quality.  True, these are quite serious claims for a phone worth 6,000 rubles.  And to be honest, the device is already quite ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù to its users, unlike competitors.  Moreover, Lenovo is a company that has proved for a long time that it is capable of developing quality things. </p>
