The multinational population is about six hundred thousand people.  The modern name Makhachkala received in honor of the revolutionary Makhach Dakhadayev in 1921.  Now it is a large city in which the resort business is developing rapidly.  Makhachkala hotels are being built to all international standards.  They can satisfy the needs of any tourist, along with the resorts of Turkey and Egypt.  Golden sand beaches and rapidly developing infrastructure attract more and more guests on the Caspian coast. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Historically, at different times, armies of the Huns, Persians, Arabs passed along the Caspian coast.  This "Dagestan corridor", through the village of Tarki, passed the caravan route to Derbent and all of East Asia.  The first information about this dates back to the VIII century.  Near the village, on the site of modern Makhachkala, Russian troops laid down the Petrovskaya fortress.  And subsequently an artificial harbor and port were built.  Petrovsk received rapid development at the end of the 19th century.  Were built: the railway, a large paper mill, oil refinery, brewery and cooperage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Makhachkala Hotels" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/2026182.jpg" width="600"></div>
