    <h2>  Name history </h2><p>  Strastnaya Boulevard, like any object in the center of the capital, has its own interesting history.  In the century before last, one of its half was occupied by the <span>Holy Monastery</span> (in whose honor the boulevard was named), erected by Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich in 1654.  The place was not chosen by chance - it was here at the gates of the White City that Muscovites met the Holy Icon of the Mother of God, in honor of which the nunnery got its name.  And the icon itself was called so, because next to the face of the Virgin, two angels are depicted in it, holding in their hands the instruments of the Passion of Christ, bringing Christ physical and spiritual suffering in the last days of his life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Boulevard Monuments </h2><p>  Passion Boulevard was constantly reconstructed.  In the 19th century, the landlord E. A. Naryshkina rebuilt the narrow street at her own expense in the boulevard, which was called in her honor Naryshkinsky.  Monuments were erected throughout the boulevard at different times, of which there are 4 today: </p><ul><li>  The famous monument to A.S. Pushkin transferred from Tversky Boulevard in 1950. </li><li>  Further next to the editorial office of the New World magazine is a monument to A. T. Twardowski, who for many years was the chief editor of this magazine. </li><li>  In 1999, Strastnoy Boulevard was enriched with a monument to S.V. Rachmaninov, who lived and worked on Strastnoy Boulevard in 1905-1917. </li><li>  A little earlier, in 1995, at the very end of the boulevard a monument was erected to V. S. Vysotsky. </li></ul><h2>  Some of the famous residents </h2><p>  At the beginning of the century, the All-Union Radio Committee was located in the former building of the Museum of Visual Aids in Natural Science since 1938.  It was from here in 1941-1945 that Yuri Levitan transmitted the Information Bureau Summaries to the whole country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Passion Boulevard" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1114906.jpg" width="512"></div>  The playwright A. V. Sukhovo-Kobylin once lived in the house number 9 long ago.  Later, artist Andrei Gonsarov also lived on Strastnoy Boulevard, who in 1959 created four main panels for the Soviet exhibition in New York.  The <span>USSR Minister of Foreign Affairs</span> Andrei Andreyevich Gromyko also lived here.

I. Elagina, which is an architectural monument.  From 1920 to 1939, the editorial board of the magazine Ogonyok was located in it. Mikhail Koltsov worked in it.  The Gagarin House (architect - the famous Osip Beauvais), the cinema "Russia", the house of the merchant F. Peak and many other objects are associated with a certain event in Russian history. </p><h2>  Modern popular objects </h2><p>  The numbering of houses on Strastnoy Boulevard begins from <span>Pushkin Square.</span>  And in house number 4 is the trattoria ‚ÄúVenice‚Äù, quite popular in Moscow.  On Strastnoy Boulevard there are more than 20 different restaurants for every taste.  Venice has its fans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Venice on Passion Boulevard" class="if" height="269" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1114907.jpg" width="445"></div>  Trattoria is a certain type of restaurant decorated in Italian style with the appropriate cuisine.

    <h2>  Family restaurant </h2><p>  In Italy, this type of restaurant belongs to the family, and in Moscow it is aimed at a regular audience.  ‚ÄúVenice‚Äù has good reviews: the customers are satisfied with the design, the decor, and the quality of service.  Neither kitchen nor wine list is causing any complaints.  In the fireplace room, designed for 120 seats, there is always a cozy atmosphere, conducive to easy communication.  In the decoration of the trattoria, only natural materials of the appropriate color scheme were used for Venice.  In summer, terraces are available. </p><p>  ‚ÄúVenice‚Äù is one of the first trattorias in the city of Moscow.  Passion Boulevard was chosen to open a family restaurant more than 10 years ago.  And he really had his own regular clientele.  The experience was successful, and now there are trattorias in Stoleshnikov Lane and Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street. </p><h2>  Dating club </h2><p>  Many different interesting places are located on the central streets of the metropolis.  One of them is located at 11 Strastnoy Boulevard. ‚ÄúAcquaintances‚Äù has very opposite reviews, because the institution is extraordinary, so there is a certain interest in it.  There are a lot of similar clubs now, but higher requirements are being placed for those located in the very center of the capital. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="passionate boulevard 11 dating reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1114908.jpg" width="600"></div>  And there are very negative reviews about him, especially concerning the working methods of individual girl agents, which sometimes resemble the work of collectors.  They talk about him as a closed dating club, which also does not make a favorable impression.  Rumor has it that he serves exclusively wealthy suitors who are looking for good wives.

    <h2>  Better to see with your own eyes </h2><p>  In fairness, it should be noted pretty nice advertising and the logo of the club.  There are also enthusiastic and grateful reviews about this institution, photographs of weddings and thanks to specific girl agents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="passion boulevard 11 dating club" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1114909.jpg" width="600"></div>  To talk about anything specifically, it‚Äôs obvious that you should visit the institution located at 11. Strastnoy Boulevard. The ‚ÄúDating Club‚Äù has its own website where staff and management are ready to listen to opinions about work, accept recommendations and advice.
