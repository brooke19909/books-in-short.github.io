    <h2>  Zhangjiajie <span>National Park</span> : History </h2><p>  Thanks to several photographs in popular publications and paintings by artists that were painted in Wulingyuan, the world has learned that there is a natural pearl in the mountains of China.  The Chinese government has officially recognized the forest part of the Wulingyuan region as Zhangjiajie National Park.  It was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1992. </p><p>  Ten years later, the Ministry of <span>Natural Resources of China</span> significantly expanded this territory, and in 2004, a huge natural geopark entered the global network of national parks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zhangjiajie national park photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1442844.jpg" width="600"></div>

The park consists of huge pillars of sandstone located above the rainforest, a labyrinth of karst caves, majestic waterfalls, amazing travertines, a picturesque lake, powerful rivers. </p><h2>  Tianmenshan Mountain </h2><p>  Locals often call her Tianmen.  Its height is one and a half thousand meters.  This mountain is famous for the Celestial Gate cave located very high.  Its height is one hundred thirty two meters, length - sixty meters, width - fifty seven.  The cave arose as a result of erosion.  During the collapse of the mountain, a huge block of rock broke away.  Sometimes this cave is called fabulous due to the belief that it is connected with the sky. </p>

    <h2>  "Yellow Dragon" </h2><p>  Zhangjiajie National Park, whose photo you can see in this article, is famous for its caves.  One of the most beautiful in the world is the four-tier karst cave "Yellow Dragon".  Its height is more than 140 meters, and its depth is about fifteen kilometers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Inside there are thirteen halls, more than a hundred galleries, four waterfalls, two underground rivers and three lakes, thousands of stalagmites, stalactites, stalagmates.  The rarest stalagmite reaches twenty meters in height and only ten centimeters in diameter. </p><h2>  Yangjiajie </h2><p>  In the northeast, Zhangjiajie National Park is adjacent to this conservation area.  It includes the Xiangzhi Creek, Longquan and Baihou Valley.  These places are known for steep cliffs and the Dragon Spring Falls.  He throws streams of water from a high cliff, which is very picturesque entwined with ivy and amazingly beautiful flowers. </p><h2>  Elevator bailung </h2><p>  Every year, an increasing number of tourists are interested in Zhangjiajie National Park.  How to get here, we will tell a little later, but for now we continue to get acquainted with its attractions. </p><p>  For tourists, the park has all the conditions for a comfortable viewing of a unique reserve.  Most of the hiking trails are interconnected by funiculars and cable cars, which greatly facilitate the ascent to the peaks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zhangjiajie national park china how to get" class="if" height="484" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1442841.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The glass elevator "One Hundred Dragons" (Bailong Elevator) was created to deliver tourists to the three hundred meter mountain.  It is located in the very center of the park and connects the upper and lower levels of the reserve.  Before his appearance, tourists were forced to climb the stairs.  The road was quite tiring and long.  Today, most travelers prefer to climb quickly on a glass elevator.  If you are lucky, you can be in the front row of passengers, which will allow you to admire the stunning views that open from the observation glass of the lift. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It should be noted that this elevator is included in the Guinness Book of Records as the fastest, highest, having an open overview and also the most powerful - at the same time it can lift fifty people. </p><h2>  Glass bridge </h2><p>  This unique building was opened in the park in August 2016.  The Zhangjiajie National Park, whose photo is fascinating, became the owner of the world's longest and highest glass bridge.  The author of the unusual project was the architect Haim Dotan.  The cost of developing, and then implementing the project amounted to almost three and a half million dollars. </p><p>  The structure is located at a height of three hundred meters above a deep precipice.  The bridge is four hundred and thirty meters long and six meters wide.  The glass bridge in Zhangjiajie National Park connects two cliffs and consists of steel, especially durable structures and ninety-nine three-layer glass plates.  This structure is able to withstand eight hundred people at a time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zhangjiajie national park hunan province" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1442839.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is interesting that on the day of its grand opening, the number of people who wanted to see the building with their own eyes was a record figure - eight thousand people.  Everyone who was fortunate enough to visit Zhangjiajie National Park that day was enthusiastic.  One cannot compare the walk over a bottomless abyss that can be seen through glass plates. </p><p>  Due to the huge influx of those who wish, two weeks later, the park administration temporarily closed the bridge for reconstruction.  However, management assured that this was not due to any damage.  After carrying out preventive work to strengthen the structure, the bridge was again opened to the public. </p><h2>  Golden Whip Creek </h2><p>  This zone is recognized as the easiest to study, since it is located at the foot of the mountains in the valley and does not have steep climbs.  Along the stream, a walking trail stretched for almost eight kilometers.  From this zone you can climb Yuanjiajie or take a walk to the Yellow Stone Village. </p><p>  Tourists note that the walk here is very pleasant - you feel so desired unity with nature.  Crowds of tourists are found only in some areas, so you can enjoy the sound of the water in the stream, the cheerful twittering of birds, and picturesque views of the mountains. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zhangjiajie national park china how to get" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1442837.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In this zone, at one of the stops, very insidious monkeys live.  Tourists try to treat them with all kinds of sweets.  Do not do this.  These cute, at first glance, animals are very cunning and dexterous - they can completely imperceptibly leave you without wallets, telephones and other valuable things.  In addition, they often show aggression towards a person. </p><h2>  Vegetation </h2><p>  Zhangjiajie Chinese National Park impresses tourists with its diversity of flora and its beauty.  Scientists believe that the appearance of dense forests in Wulingyuan contributed to the tropical humid climate and diverse relief.  Vegetation here is developing much faster than in the neighboring provinces of the country. </p><p>  In the park grows more than seven hundred and seventy plant species.  Among them there are very rare samples.  These include gingko bilobate, milky chestnut (Chinese), pigeon tree, and on the plains travelers can see compact tangerine groves. </p><p>  But the visitors of the park are especially impressed by the large white stipules of the pigeon tree swaying in the wind, which resemble a huge flock of white doves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="china zhangjiajie national park how to get" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1442838.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Animals in the park </h2><p>  Zhangjiajie National Park has become a home for more than five hundred species of different animals.  Twenty-eight of them are rare, and therefore are under constant protection.  These include: </p><ul><li>  gigantic salamander; </li><li>  big panda; </li><li>  golden snub-nosed monkey; </li><li>  leopard. </li></ul><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><ul><li>  In the XX century, a waterfall unexpectedly collapsed in the gorge from the top of Tienmen Mountain.  This has happened four times.  The flow of water broke off for fifteen minutes, and then just as unexpectedly stopped. </li><li>  A staircase with 999 wide steps leads to the Heaven's Gate cave. </li><li>  Along the top of the massif, at an altitude of 1,500 m, a pedestrian path is laid.  Over particularly picturesque and steep cliffs, it was made of high-strength glass. </li></ul><h2>  China, Zhangjiajie National Park: how to get there? </h2><p>  If you want to see unusually beautiful landscapes, then you need to visit this unique place.  To see the Zhangjiajie National Park, you must first get into the city of the same name, and then get to the small villages located at the entrances to the park.  There are several ways to get to the city: by plane, train, bus.  Let's consider each of them in more detail. </p><p>  <em>By plane</em> </p><p>  If you plan to visit Zhangjiajie National Park and spend as little time as possible on the road, then this option is more suitable for you.  By plane you can fly from other major cities of the country.  The airport is located five kilometers from the city center.  Aircraft from Chengdu, Beijing, Shanghai, Xian, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Tianjin and other cities of the country fly daily here. </p><p>  You can get from the airport to the city by bus or taxi, which will take you to the park entrance for 100 yuan ($ 15). </p><p>  <em>By train</em> </p><p>  Zhangjiajie National Park is of great interest to all tourists coming to the country, so trains leave here from many <span>cities in China</span> .  We want to warn that this option is suitable for those who have a reserve of free time and patience.  A short note: the road from Beijing to the destination takes about twenty-six hours, and the ticket will cost sixty dollars (reserved seat) and one hundred (coupe).  Zhangjiajie Railway Station is conveniently located - not far from the city center and the airport. </p><p>  <em>By bus</em> </p><p>  There are several bus stations in the city.  They arrive flights from different cities of China.  Departure schedule, trip cost, travel time must be specified at bus stations. </p><p>  When you arrive in the city in a convenient way for you, it remains to find the Zhangjiajie National Park (China).  How to get to the reserve?  You need to go to one of the entrances, which have small villages.  You can stay there for the night. </p><p>  The nearest entrance to the city is 32 km away, and it is called Zhangjiajie Village.  Forty kilometers from the city is the entrance to the Wulingyuan area.  The third is the most remote from the city.  It is located on the Tianjin Mountain and is not very popular with tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zhangjiajie chinese national park" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1442840.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to live? </h2><p>  A good selection of hotels is offered in Zhangjiajie, but if you settle here, you will have to spend money and time every day on the road.  And that’s about two hours a day.  It is more advisable to stay in a village at the entrance to the park - you will save time on the road. </p><p>  Almost all of these villages have several comfortable hotels.  If you wish, you can settle in a hotel in the park, unless, of course, you are not afraid of the Spartan living conditions: there are frequent interruptions in light, water, and Internet outages.  After the park is closed, tourists cannot leave its territory, which, you see, is not very convenient. </p><h2>  Opening hours and cost of visiting </h2><p>  Throughout the year, you can visit Zhangjiajie National Park.  Opening hours depend on the season: </p><ul><li>  in the summer - from 7.00 to 19.00; </li><li>  in winter - from 7.30 to 17.00. </li></ul><p>  In summer it is not hot at all, and in winter there are no severe frosts. </p><p>  Entrance tickets can be purchased in two types: </p><ul><li>  for seven days - 298 yuan; </li><li>  4 days - 245 yuan. </li></ul><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><ul><li>  It is better to come to the park early, then you will have the opportunity to enjoy the natural beauties in relative silence. </li><li>  If you want to use the Baylong elevator, then it is also better to do this in the morning and go down to 16:00.  Otherwise, you can spend in line about four hours. </li><li>  You will have to walk a lot in the park, so prepare comfortable shoes so that they don’t rub.  The same can be said about clothes: they should be comfortable. </li><li>  To preserve your strength for exploring the park for longer, combine walking with the cable cars and a ski lift. </li><li>  Going to the park, be sure to take a card (you can buy it at the entrance), sunscreen, cash, water and food.  You can buy products in the park, but their prices are excessively high.  Fruits, corn, fried potatoes (about 10 yuan) are most available at these shops. </li><li>  Chinese and international students studying in China can purchase tickets at half price.  But this applies to young people under 24 years old.  When buying preferential tickets, you must present your passport. </li><li>  Keep purchased tickets separate from friends or family tickets.  The fact is that on each of them a number is knocked out to which fingerprints are attached.  If you take a ticket from your husband or friend, the system will refuse to let you through the turnstile. </li></ul><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Everyone who has visited the Chinese Zhangjiajie Park, consider this to be one of the most vivid and memorable trips.  The incomparable beauty of natural landscapes, rare plants and animals are admirable.  Many believe that such a trip will be interesting for children of school age. </p>
