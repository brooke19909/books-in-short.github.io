  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The deepest lake - Baikal</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The beauty of nature in Russia is unique.  On its territory there are various geographical objects that are leaders in their characteristics.  The deepest lake on the globe - Baikal, spreads in the east of Russia.  It is located among the mountain system of Siberia and therefore legally received the name "blue eye" of this territory.  If we consider the area of ​​this lake, then here it is not a leader.  However, Baikal is a leader in the volume of available water. </p><p>  This is almost a fifth of all <span>fresh water</span> that is available on the surface of the planet.  In quantity, this can be compared with the volume of water in all the <span>Great Lakes,</span> which are located in North America. </p><p>  This is the <span>deepest lake</span> that can supply humanity with fresh water for 40 years. </p><p>  336 rivers of various sizes flow into Baikal.  Due to the fact that the lake is surrounded by mountains of very hard rocks, the rivers do not bring dissolved substances into it.  This affects the purity and transparency of the water.  She is perfect.  Even from space, you can see the relief of the bottom of the lake to a depth of 500 meters.  It owes the beauty of its waters to a small endemic crustacean that filters the water and supplies it with oxygen. </p><p>  The deepest lake reaches 1637 meters in depth.  This is the Olkhon basin.  The average depth is 730 meters.  The place where Lake Baikal is located is distinguished by its beauty.  A unique climate, clean air, a rich world of plants and animals is what surrounds this geographical object. </p><p>  Lake Baikal is also considered the oldest on the planet.  About 25 million years ago, it appeared on Earth.  This determines the number of plants and animals that live in this lake.  Many of them are unique and can only be found here.  For example, the <span>Baikal seal.</span>  More representatives of this species can only be seen far in the Arctic circles in the North.  This place is located 3000 kilometers from Lake Baikal.  About 230 species of various birds inhabit this lake.  And 58 species of fish live in the waters.  Among them there are omul, taimen, grayling, sturgeon, lenok and many others. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The deepest lake has a length of almost 620 kilometers and a width of 74 kilometers.  Naturally, these parameters are different for certain sections of its territory.  The entire area of ​​the lake is about 31.5 thousand square kilometers.  Its territory can be compared with the territory of such states as Denmark or Belgium.  Baikal has a very steep coastline and several islands.  This part of the planet has a continental climate, which is why it is very cold in winter and quite hot in summer.  In winter, the lake is covered with a layer of ice equal to three meters. </p><p>  The deepest lake has always attracted scientists and researchers from around the world.  His story is rich in legends and riddles.  Since 2008, a group of scientists has been researching the lake on two deep-sea vehicles.  They study the composition of water, the processes occurring at the bottom of the lake and changing its topography, as well as numerous representatives of flora and fauna. </p><p>  Given that the lake has a rather ancient history, scientists are trying to find some artifacts that will be useful to all of humanity. </p><p>  Baikal is not the largest lake in Europe.  However, the uniqueness of its flora and fauna, the nature that surrounds it, make it one of the greatest corners of the planet.  Together with mountain systems, the lake is an important <span>natural complex of</span> Siberia.  More than 80 percent of the living organisms living here are unique. </p><p>  Recently, the issue of preserving this corner of the planet has been particularly acute.  A pulp mill built near the lake poses a threat to the whole ecology.  Many scientists and environmentalists are sounding the alarm and defending themselves.  Only by common efforts can you save the deepest lake in the world - Baikal. </p>
