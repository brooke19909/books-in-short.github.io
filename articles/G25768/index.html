After some time, the recipient will be able to use the funds transferred to him. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="bankigid.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to fund a bank card account through an ATM" class="if uuid-3192524" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3192524.jpg"></div><h2>  Foreign plastic, if there is a card </h2><p>  How to put money on a card through an ATM?  Without a card, achieving the desired result is extremely problematic.  But if you try, you will be able to achieve the appropriate goal. </p><p>  It happens that someone close asks to throw money on bank plastic, and then transfers the card.  This is not the most common scenario, but it will save a person from the problems of finding a suitable ATM to achieve the desired goal. </p><p>  What remains to be done in this situation to achieve the appropriate result?  It is recommended that you use the first guide provided.  In fact, the operation will be carried out in the same way as when replenishing a personal card.  The main thing is to know the password for access to the account.  Then there will be no problems. </p><h2>  Is there a commission </h2><p>  How to put money on a card through an ATM of Sberbank?  We clarified the situation in full.  But there is also data that it is important to remember for all Sberbank customers.  What is it about? </p><p>  For example, is there a commission for depositing funds via cash through ATM.  If a person decided to transfer money to Sberbank plastic through their own ATM, no commission is charged.  We found out how to deposit money on a card through a Sberbank ATM without a card.  And sometimes a commission is charged for these operations.  But there are exceptions. </p><p>  If the card account is replenished from an "outside" ATM, the commission will be.  In what sizes?  It all depends on whose citizen the ATM uses.  It is better to clarify this information in advance and shortly before the transfer of funds to the desired account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sbankin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ATM replenishment confirmation" class="if uuid-3192523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3192523.jpg"></div><p>  What if a person replenishes funds through an ATM of Sberbank, but the transfer is made to the cards of third-party financial organizations?  A commission for such transactions will also be charged.  The size of the additional payment depends on whose plastic the beneficiary uses.  Sometimes there are no commissions.  For example, if money is transferred to a card from Yandex.Money. </p><h2>  Transaction Time </h2><p>  We found out how to put money on a card through an ATM.  Even if a person does not work with machines from Sberbank, he can use the instructions provided.  They are considered universal.  The difference often lies solely in the signatures of the functional menu. </p><p>  How fast will the money be credited to the recipient?  This question sometimes becomes extremely important. </p><p>  If a person refills a bank plastic account through terminals or ATMs, he will receive money in a few hours.  Sometimes this process is delayed for a day. </p><p>  On holidays and weekends, money transfers may arrive late.  There were cases when citizens received the transferred money only after a few days. </p><p>  Important: in order to avoid problems in case of non-receipt of funds to the specified account, it is necessary to keep the check issued by ATM. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sravni.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rules for replenishing bank cards through Sberbank ATMs" class="if uuid-3192527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3192527.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We found out how to put money on a card through an ATM.
