    <h2>  Resorts of Egypt </h2><p>  By their popularity with Russians, Egyptian resorts can only be compared with Turkish or Cypriot ones.  The most famous of them are Sharm el-Sheikh, Hurghada, Marsa Alam, Zaafaran, Alexandria, <span>El Gouna</span> and others. Most of them are washed by the waters of the Red Sea, and here the swimming season lasts all year round, but the Mediterranean resorts are suitable for a beach holiday with April to October.  The Red Sea is famous for its coral reefs, so diving is very popular here, and there are many diving centers.  Hotel Jasmine Palace Hurghada 5 *, which we will discuss in this article, is located on the coast of Khugarda.  But before moving on to describing its infrastructure and internal structure, let's find out more about the resort itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jasmine palace hurghada" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/476475.jpg" width="600"></div>

He is the first resort in the country, which began to accept large groups of foreign tourists.  Here, earlier than in other areas of Egypt, the tourism business began to develop - many hotels, restaurants and cafes were built.  Naturally, such popularity among tourists indicates excellent conditions for a beach holiday, but, on the other hand, this also means that many hotels in the resort are old-fashioned and do not quite meet modern standards.  However, this does not apply to the Jasmine Palace <span>Hurghada</span> hotel <span>(Hurghada),</span> since it is one of the youngest and most respectable hotel complexes not only in Hurghada, but throughout Egypt. </p><h2>  Hurghada Hotels </h2><p>  Every year new hotels open on this coast, and old ones are reconstructed.  According to statistics, this city occupies one of the leading places in the world in the number of hotels per capita.  Among deluxe hotel complexes, one can see such loud signs as Hilton, Sunrise, Marriott, Intercontinental, Sheraton and many others. </p><p>  If you want a high-class vacation - go to Egypt!  The <span>Jasmine Palace Resort</span> 5 * and Makadi Garden Azur 4 * hotels are the newest hotel complexes on the entire Egyptian coast.  They do not belong to any of the hotel brands, but in no way inferior to their eminent neighbors.  The biggest advantage of Hurghada hotels is that they are well suited for the relaxation of all family members: adults and children.  In addition, the resort is located near Luxor - the center of excursion recreation, and from here it is much more convenient to travel to the sights.  The bulk of holidaymakers in Hurghada hotels are couples with children and senior citizens.  Young people will be bored here, however, if you wish, you can always find entertainment to your liking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jasmine palace 5" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/476483.jpg" width="600"></div>

Hurghada has its own international airport, so you do not have to first fly to Cairo or to any other city in the country, and then transfer to the resort.  Fly from Moscow to Khugarda four and a half hours.  From here to the resort area is only 5-7 km.  Those tourists who came to Egypt without the mediation of travel agencies or refused to transfer can go to the desired hotel either by taxi or by minibus.  However, the employees of the Jasmine Palace Hurghada 5 * hotel meet their future guests almost at the ramp and comfortably deliver them to the territory of the hotel complex.  Since it is located 18 km from the airport, the journey takes about half an hour, which is quite a bit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jasmine palace hurghada reviews" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/476477.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Jasmine Palace Hurghada: traveler reviews and ratings </h2><p>  Since this hotel is still very "young", there are very few reviews about it.  Among them are both positive and negative.  Tourists from Russia mainly complain about the service, the inexperience and lack of professionalism of the staff, with the exception of cooks, whose work is estimated at almost 5 points by almost everyone.  However, these problems are completely solvable, because experience comes with time.  Positive reviews relate to ‚Äúcompliments from the hotel,‚Äù which are not found in every hotel.  For example, gifts are given to all those from the hotel, the newlyweds on the first day of their stay find a basket of fruits and sweets in their room, and they will also have dinner in an oriental-style restaurant.  However, the fact of marriage will need to be reported when booking a tour and bring <span>a marriage certificate</span> with you <span>.</span>  A basket with sweets is also provided to regular customers.  Trivia, but nice, isn't it? </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, the Jasmine Palace Hotel has everything to make your vacation in Egypt bright and memorable.  And we forgot to talk about the fact that the hotel can book tours and go to the famous monuments of architecture, which are many thousands of years old.  Then your vacation will be truly complete, which means a success. </p>
