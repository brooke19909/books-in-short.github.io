In the reviews of tourists left on social networks and on thematic sites, it is often said about the beautiful nature that can be found here and about possible entertainments.  In addition, travelers very often note excellent conditions for relaxing in local hotels.  There are also two of the most famous beaches in the world: Karon and Patong, where various tour operators recommend going to rest. </p><p>  What are the features of vacation on the island?  Where is it better to relax and what is worth seeing?  About it further. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Phuket is an island that belongs to the territory of the exotic state of Thailand.  It is here that every year a huge number of travelers come who purchase tickets in advance from tour operators. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourist-destinations.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket reviews" class="if uuid-2281395" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2281395.jpg"></div><p>  Among all the islands that are managed by Thailand, Phuket is the largest and most vibrant.  It has a small connection with the mainland in the form of a bridge, which allows tourists to get to it using only land transport.  This, according to many vacationers, is very convenient, since you do not have to adapt to the flights of passenger ships that run between the islands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This island is washed by the warm and incredibly clean Andaman Sea, which delights vacationers with the blue of its waters.  Many tourists in reviews of Phuket and holidays on this island say that the water in the sea is constantly warm, since the air temperature is especially pleasing at any time of the year - even in winter it reaches 30 degrees here. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The climatic conditions that prevail on the island, of course, delight tourists.  This geographical feature is located in a humid tropical climate, within which a certain amount of precipitation falls during a certain season - this period falls from May to early autumn.  Many reviews about the rest in Phuket say that fans of the bright sun and mild heat should fly here in the winter, when the air temperature does not rise above 30 degrees, and sunny weather can be observed almost daily. </p><h2>  Popular Phuket Cities </h2><p>  The island is quite large, which is why it is divided into several administrative units - small cities.  Which of them are the most beautiful?  Many tourists in their reviews of Phuket speak of the unusualness of Phuket time.  This settlement is a kind of capital, within which a huge amount of entertainment for different categories of tourists is concentrated.  This city has a large population - more than 70,000 people.  In many comments, travelers recommend visiting the local historical center, where you can get acquainted with the culture of the people, as well as enjoy the Sino-Portuguese buildings, as well as oriental temples. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another popular city in Phuket is Patong.  This settlement is very popular due to the beach of the same name, which is located on its territory.  Many travelers prefer to visit it, as they are aware of the clean and warm water that bathes it, as well as the incredible nature surrounding this place.  There is also a large number of places for recreation and hotels, which at the height of the holiday season, as a rule, are fully populated. </p><p>  Among the popular cities of Phuket, Chalong is often mentioned - a settlement located near the capital of the island, as well as at a relatively short distance from the international airport - literally 40 kilometers away.  Tourists in their reviews of Phuket often talk about the favorable location of this city, which makes its resort hotels very popular among vacationers.  In some reviews, travelers notice that the beaches of Chalong are not the best beaches.  However, rest on them is also pleasant. </p><h2>  Patong </h2><p>  Patong is the most famous beach of all those that are available not only in Phuket, but also in Thailand.  Reviews of Phuket by tourists often refer to the beauty of the local nature.  Fans of active nightlife are attracted by noisy parties that take place here every day and last until the morning.  In hotels located not far from this place, mainly groups of friends stay - almost all of them are designed for youth recreation. </p><p>  The total length of this beach is quite large - 3 kilometers, and its width is 30 meters. Along the coastline you can find a large number of restaurants, cafes, bars, nightclubs, as well as magnificent spas in which you can truly relax. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In reviews of Patong (Phuket) it is said about the cleanliness of the coastline, that the beach has all the conditions for recreation for representatives of different categories of tourists, as well as a lot of entertainment.  Also, many of them recommend a large umbrella to rent for a visit to this beach, which will save from the harmful effects of direct sunlight, since there is practically no natural shadow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourist-destinations.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket Travel Reviews" class="if uuid-2281398" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2281398.jpg"></div><p>  On the shore of such a beach there are a considerable number of hotels, the cost of accommodation in which varies from 300 (550 rubles) to 5,000 (9,000 rubles) baht per day. </p><h2>  Karon </h2><p>  Another huge and famous beach in Phuket is Karon.  It captivates tourists not only with its size (the length of the coastline is 5 km), but also with perfectly clean white sand.  Reviews of Karon (Phuket) say that its coast is washed by clear sea water, the state of which is monitored by a special service.  The beach has its own small feature - the sand with which it is covered makes an unusual creaky sound when walking.  This is due to the high level of quartz in its composition.  For this, Karon is often called the "singing beach." </p><p>  On the southern part of the beach there are several points where a favorite entertainment is offered by many - scuba diving.  It is here that the picturesque coral reef is located, which attracts the attention of tourists. </p><h2>  Other beaches of Phuket </h2><p>  In reviews about the rest, one can often find comments of tourists regarding other beaches, which are also available on the outskirts of the island.  Many travelers like visiting coastlines with such names as Nai Harn, Kata Noi, Kamala, Liberty, Yanui, Laem Singh and Panwa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourist-destinations.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket beaches reviews" class="if uuid-2281401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2281401.jpg"></div><p>  In reviews of the beaches of Phuket, Kata, a coastline with white and very soft sand, located near Karon, is often noted by a large number of positive comments.  Its length is relatively small, only 1 km, but impeccably clean water that washes this coast attracts many. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  In reviews of Phuket, it is often said that this place is ideal for relaxation, if only because there is a large amount of entertainment, among which mainly water. </p><p>  Many tourists who stay here do not give up the opportunity to learn the surfing skill, which the instructor teaches here for an additional fee.  At certain times, surfers competitions are held off the coast of the beaches.  The best of them can be seen on the beaches of Patong and Kata, as well as Kalim and Kamala. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fanpop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket Hotel Reviews" class="if uuid-2281412" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2281412.jpg"></div><p>  Since there are coral reefs of incredible beauty along the coastlines of some beaches in Phuket, diving is very developed in Phuket.
