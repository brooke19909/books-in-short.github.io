So you can only spoil the print edition.  Bookmarks for books are best.  Do it yourself with your own hands.  Even children in kindergarten can do this.  There are many different ways to create such a necessary craft. </p><p>  Moreover, for the manufacture of do-it-yourself bookmarks for books using a variety of materials: colored paper and cardboard, knitting yarn and knitting needles, satin ribbons and elastic bands, fabric and felt sheets.  The ability to knit, sew and make applications is useful.  If you are a master of folding paper using the origami method, then in this way you can make bookmarks for books with your own hands.  The main thing is to want to, take the initiative and bring it to life.  Such work will take a minimum of time, you can give such crafts to relatives and children along with books. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider several different ways of making such crafts that will help you make a decision, which one is more interesting and easier for you to perform, which you can advise a child to create. </p><h2>  Bookmark "Doggy" </h2><p>  With your own hands for books, you can make such wonderful dogs with a thick paper application, whose tie will be worn on the page.  It does not stick to a rectangle with a pasted figure.  To make such a bookmark, you need to take thick cardboard for the main rectangle, colored paper for small parts - ears, eyes, nose.  For a tie, it is better to take thick double-sided paper, preferably with a small printer pattern. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.redtedart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Application &quot;Dog&quot;" class="if uuid-2270293" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2270293.jpg"></div><p>  A 15 cm long rectangle is cut out of thick cardboard and its corners are cut with scissors.  Further on in the upper part stick small parts cut out of bright, glossy colored paper.  Eyes are drawn with markers or pencils, as are the nose and mouth of the dog. </p><p>  Lastly, a tie is attached, which is separately made of thick double-sided paper.  First, a thin neck strip is cut to the size of the double width of the bookmark for books with your own hands and immediately the tie itself, whose length is 5 cm. Then the trapezoid - tie knot is cut and pasted.  If the paper is not too thick and the long edge is folded a little, it needs to be compacted by gluing another layer of paper from the back.  This part of the bookmark is fixed only with a neck band. </p><h2>  Origami triangle </h2><p>  A bookmark for books with your own hands made of paper can be made not only by application, but also by folding.  This technique is called origami.  The main thing is to clearly follow the pattern and carefully smooth the paper folded along the line so that the folds are clear and correct.  Such a triangular bookmark is worn immediately on several pages, and its front side indicates the last read. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.fabartdiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Origami corners" class="if uuid-2270207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2270207.jpg"></div><p>  A bookmark for <span>origami books</span> folded according to this scheme with your own hands can be decorated in different ways, creating the face of a beast, a cartoon character, an image of a heart or a butterfly.  You can fantasize in your own way.  Small parts are glued onto a triangular base using PVA glue.  They are cut out of colored paper in bright colors.  If the details go beyond the triangle, it is better to take thick double-sided colored paper. </p><h2>  Felt corners </h2><p>  You can make a beautiful bookmark for a book with your own hands not only from paper, the same triangular corner can be sewn from a bright and soft felt sheet.  This material is often used by craftsmen in crafts, it is perfectly sewn, it can be glued, creating a pattern using the application method. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makezine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Felt corner" class="if uuid-2270235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2270235.jpg"></div><p>  When felt, the edges do not crumble when incised, so the material does not require additional processing.  <span>Bookmarks made of felt</span> can be sewn in one minute by making such a corner-heart.  If you want a more original bookmark, you can arrange such a detail in the shape of a flower or a butterfly by cutting small details from felt sheets of a different color.  They can be sewn with threads, matching them to the color of the fabric, or glued to PVA glue. </p><h2>  Felt Rectangles with Thread </h2><p>  From sheets of bright and soft felt, you can create beautiful rectangular bookmarks for books with your own hands.  To make them denser, a double layer of material is taken for a rectangular base.  In addition, all seams from sewing on details of the picture will remain on the inner surface of the bookmark, and only the front sides will remain on both sides.  A drawing can be made not only on one side, but also on the other rectangle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rectangular Bookmarks" class="if uuid-2270223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2270223.jpg"></div><p>  When stitching the two sides of the craft, mouline thread and a ‚Äúbuttonhole‚Äù seam across the edge of the material are used.  When stitching the top of the bookmark, insert the thread of yarn inside.  When the book with the bookmark is closed, the thread looks out and the location of the page necessary for further reading is determined by it. </p><p>  At the end of the thread, you can attach a brush or a small pompom.  You can make such a bookmark for books with your own hands for children, they will be very happy with such an original subject. </p><h2>  Paper clip bookmark </h2><p>  This is one of the easiest bookmarks to make.  A large, preferably colored, paper clip is taken, and a small volumetric element is attached to its upper part.  It can be simple ribbons with notched corners with tips that are tied in a clip with a knot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.littleloveliesbyallison.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paperclip bow" class="if uuid-2270267" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2270267.jpg"></div><p>  From felt, you can create either such a bow, as in the photo, or the head of any animal, using both threads for stitching, PVA glue or a glue gun.  Around a metal handle on a paper clip, such an applique is sewn onto a thin strip of felt, or the picture is made on double material, and the paper clip is simply sewn with threads inside the base of the bookmark. </p><p>  After reading, such a decorated paperclip is put on several pages of text so that the front side points to the desired page. </p><h2>  Satin Ribbon Bookmark </h2><p>  This type of bookmark for books is the most careful in relation to the print edition.  A thin tape is inserted inside the book and does not deform it at all.  Volumetric decorating details hang from the bottom and top of the book.  You can sew such bookmarks both from satin, felt, and from any other material.  By the way, the tape may well be replaced by yarn threads, tied for density with a pigtail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Double bookmarks with a ribbon" class="if uuid-2270226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2270226.jpg"></div><p>  The length of the tape should be longer than the book so that two volumetric parts hang freely from it.  The upper part of this type of bookmarks is usually made larger and is the main one.  It can be an animal or a cartoon character.  The lower part is smaller.  Usually it is either flowers, or a heart, or a simple geometric figure.  It is desirable that they be interconnected by a single plot.  For example, if the top picture shows a typewriter, then the steering wheel or wheel will be placed below, and if there is a chicken above, you can make an egg or a broken shell from below. </p><h2>  Rubber Bookmark </h2><p>  This craft is very similar to the previous one, only the tape, and even better, a wide elastic band wraps the book in a circle.  The picture can be left on the side of the cover, then it will not deform the publication. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Owl on an elastic band" class="if uuid-2270251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2270251.jpg"></div><p>  In this tab, the picture is one, but larger.  It is most convenient to make such an article from everyone's favorite material - felt sheets.  They can be purchased at any sewing accessories store.  Products made of felt are obtained in saturated colors, and it is very pleasant to work with it, it is soft, elastic and warm to the touch. </p><h2>  Knitted bookmarks </h2><p>  For those craftsmen who own knitting needles or crochet, it costs nothing to tie a thin strip using any familiar pattern.  Novice knitters or children can knit such a bookmark with a simple garter stitch.  On it, from threads of a different color, you can make a flower or embroider any other ornament. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tricksyknitter.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.tricksyknitter.com/knitting-bookmarks/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted bookmarks" class="if uuid-2270280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2270280.jpg"></div><p>  The article shows the most popular types of bookmarks for books.
