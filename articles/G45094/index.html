Previously, due to the unpopularity of mobile communication, this issue was not discussed, but now a cell phone is an integral part in the life of a modern person.  However, once connected to a certain operator, we remain with him even on conditions unfavorable for us, because we do not know how to change the mobile operator.  And all because of the notorious number, on which everything rests, because relatives and friends, and colleagues, and clients know it by heart.  How to be in this situation?  How to change the operator, keeping the number? </p>

    <h2>  Change in Russia </h2><p>  Previously, it was not possible to change the carrier, retaining the phone number.  The changes took effect only in December 2013.  And today, this is the right of every user.  However, each operator sets its own conditions for such a transition.  It does not bother to sort them out and find out what's what. </p><h2>  Let's start with Beeline </h2><p>  So, how to change the operator, keeping the number?  The Beeline company will be happy to meet everyone who has decided to switch to it from another operator.  However, you will have to pay 100 rubles one-time.  These funds will be debited from your account during the first three days of using the network.  And now about how to do this: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Are you going to change the operator?  You can leave the same number as follows: you contact the Beeline office, where you write an application to transfer the number and connect to the new network.  Take your passport with you if the number is issued for you.  Otherwise, you need another notarized power of attorney from its owner. </li><li>  Choose a tariff plan and get a set of documents with a SIM card.  The price of a set depends on the chosen tariff. </li><li>  Next, you need to wait until your number is activated in the Beeline network.  You can determine the date yourself, but usually at least nine days have passed from the day the application was written. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="change operator leave number" class="if" height="230" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13524/348055.jpg?1394025423189" width="290"></div></li><li>  While you will be with the previous operator, you will have two SIM cards, a new work <span>number</span> will be temporarily set on the new one <span>.</span>  You will receive text notifications on this number about how the process of your transition to the new network is going. </li><li>  As soon as a new SIM card is activated, the old one stops working.  This is very convenient for the customer in the first place.  He will not be left without a connection for a single day.  So you can change the operator without changing the number. </li></ol><h2></h2><h2>  Not without conditions </h2><p>  Here, as in any other controversial case, it cannot do without conditions.  For example, did you know that transferring a <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãnumber</span> to another operator still fails.  How to fail and leave the old number, if you used to live in another subject of the Russian Federation.  Here are some more conditions that you need to know about in advance: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to change the mobile operator" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13524/348053.jpg?1394025449955" width="337"></div>

Your data that you left with the previous operator should be relevant.  If you got married and changed your surname, you first need to provide documents about this to your operator so that he makes changes, and then go to a new one. </li><li>  At the time of the transition, you may be blocked outgoing calls for up to half an hour, and text messages and incoming calls may not be available in a time interval of 6 hours. </li></ol><h2></h2><h2>  We contact MTS </h2>

    <p>  Each operator‚Äôs number transfer procedure is identical, and it costs the same everywhere.  However, MTS clarifies that you can use the temporary number from the first minute, as you receive it in your hands.  The SIM card will not yet have the number you desired, but you can already evaluate the work of the new operator.  Exactly one day before connecting to this temporary number, you will receive a text notification that the next day at the specified time you can insert the card into any device and use it for its intended purpose.  You don‚Äôt have to visit the company‚Äôs office twice, because the new number will be registered automatically.  As for the conditions, they are similar to the Beeline.  In addition, at least two months should pass from the moment of the last change of the telecom operator.  If at least one condition is violated, the company has the right to refuse you.  As for tariffs, here MTS has its own laws: </p><ul><li>  Initially, everyone is given a SIM card with the Super MTS tariff.  The same tariff will remain after the number is transferred.  To prevent this from happening, you can indicate in the application the selected tariff already at the time of its submission. </li><li>  If at the time of writing the application in the tariff you have not decided or changed your mind while waiting, then you can easily change it in any way possible.  For example, through a personal account on the operator‚Äôs website. </li><li>  Remember that some rates require an advance payment.  Make sure that a certain amount is on your balance on the day of the transition. </li></ul><h2>  Finally, the Megaphone </h2><p>  Another major operator is ready to receive a new client on similar conditions.  However, there are still some differences: </p><ol><li>  Payment for transferring the number of 100 rubles must be paid on the day of writing the application.  Moreover, if you are denied a transfer, it will not be returned. </li><li>  More than 70 days should have passed since the last transition. </li><li>  Funds that were left in the account of the past operator are not transferable. </li></ol><p>  Otherwise, the conditions are the same: there should be no debts, only the owner writes the application - and so on.  That's the whole answer to the question of how to change the operator, saving the number. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="change operator while saving number" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13524/348050.jpg" width="265"></div></h2><h2>  If you are refused </h2><p>  There are times when the operator is forced to refuse his new customer, although for him it is unprofitable.  This can happen if at least one condition is not met.  For example, if there is an account debt or your data does not match.  In all these cases, the problem is solved simply.  It is only necessary to eliminate the reason why the new operator refuses you.  Pay off the debt, visit the office of the previous operator to unblock your number, submit documents with your new data.  After that, you will need to re-contact the office of the new operator. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Long live the freedom of numbers!  Now you know how to change the operator, having saved the number, and you can always choose the most convenient tariff and the best quality of communication and service. </p>
