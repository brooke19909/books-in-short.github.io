  <section class="page js-page"><h1>An electric kettle with a temperature regulator - a variety of functions and increased safety</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Electric kettles have long found their place in modern kitchens, and their ancestors are gathering dust on the mezzanines.  At first glance, buying a device is very simple, but when it comes to buying, the question often arises: which is the best electric kettle?  And, true, modern devices for heating water have almost all the functions, and are not much different.  Today it is difficult to find a kettle without a liquid level scale, without a water filter.  Many devices emit special signals, notifying their owners about boiling.  But, there are still differences.  The principal parameters are volume and power. </p><p>  The most popular is an electric kettle with a temperature regulator, which can heat water to the required set temperature, other than 100 degrees, with a volume of one and a half liters and above, with good power. </p><p>  Modern devices are placed on a special round stand with free rotation.  To warm up water for tea or coffee, you no longer need to pull the wire out of the socket all the time, since it is not attached to the device itself, but to its stand. </p><p>  Considering that an electric kettle with a thermostat has minimal functional differences, design requirements are in the lead.  The most common materials are inert plastic and metal.  Particularly durable glass products adjoin this company, in which there is no need to use measuring vessels to indicate the water level. </p><p>  To draw the attention of the buyer, they release an electric kettle with a backlight that functions during the heating process.  This is an impressive sight when the inside of the backlight is boiling water, or a fiery halo forms at the base of the kettle.  So that a person does not forget what the device is working for, boiling ends not only by turning off the device by itself, but also by a sound signal. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A modern electric kettle with a temperature regulator has a power range of up to 3 kW.  Minimum indicators have travel kettles, for heating a liter of liquid they will need from 1.5 to 2.5 kW.  For a larger volume of water, a device with a power of about 3 kW is needed.  In general, the more powerful the electric kettle, the less time it will take to boil. </p><p>  According to the type of heating element of the device, there are two types.  In the first, water heating is performed thanks to an open spiral.  The advantages of this type are the absence of noise and low cost.  The disadvantages include the appearance of destructive scale on the heating element, and the difficulty in cleaning the bottom under the spiral. </p><p>  In the second type, a closed disk is used as a heating element.  Despite the fact that such an electric kettle with a temperature controller is more expensive, it is more practical to maintain, it is easier to clean, and you can drink tea faster. </p><p>  For those who burned more than one simple metal kettle, a modern electric will seem like a magical device.  It was the <span>automatic shutdown</span> sensor <span>,</span> light indicator, and thermostat for heating that caused the old devices to be out of work. </p><p>  An electric kettle with a temperature regulator of a higher price range is equipped with electronic control that allows you to adjust the boiling time (it does not immediately turn off).  These devices have additional functions of maintaining a certain set temperature for the desired length of time. </p><p>  The recognized leaders in the market of electric kettles with temperature regulators are the well-known brands Tefal, Philips, Braun, Moulinex, Bork.  These models not only have all the modern functions, but also have increased fire safety.  And for any buyer, this factor plays an important role. </p><p>  The uptime of dummies depends on the accuracy of the owner and the intensity of use.  Typically, products from well-known brands last more than five years. </p>
