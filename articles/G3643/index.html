    <h2>  Negative reviews about the hotel Atrium Beach 4 * (Elenite) </h2><p>  Unfortunately, ideal hotels do not exist.  Even in the best hotel you can always find flaws and shortcomings.  If we talk about the Andalucia Beach Atrium Beach 4 * hotel, then the following negative reviews should be noted: </p><ul><li>  terrible quality of cleaning (we can say that it is practically nonexistent); </li><li>  bed linen is changed very rarely (despite what should happen in a day); </li><li>  only one elevator works, and therefore huge queues always gather near it; </li><li>  from the windows of rooms with sea views you can see only a small stretch of water in the distance; </li><li>  on the beach it is almost impossible to find free sunbeds; </li><li>  in the whole territory and in the halls of the hotel it is very dirty; </li><li>  almost no children's animation;  at the beach bar, the food portions are very small (even children are not enough to satisfy their hunger); </li><li>  Despite the fact that many workers know Russian well, they basically do not speak it and pretend that they do not understand; </li><li>  acute shortage of <span>beach towels</span> ; </li><li>  Check-in is done strictly after 15:00 (only in exceptional cases they can go to a meeting and register at two in the afternoon); </li><li>  reception staff treat guests not just indifferently, but also rudely; </li><li>  the procedure for visiting the dining room is quite complicated and lengthy - first you need to take an empty table early, and then stand a huge queue at the distribution; </li><li>  in spite of the fact that it is forbidden to occupy sunbeds in advance, for a small tip the beach caretaker will be allowed to leave his towel on the sun lounger (as a result, the seats are empty and there is nowhere to lie down); </li><li>  the entrance to the sea is a lot of sharp stones; </li><li>  a very narrow coastline, which is occupied by two rows of sun beds standing close to each other; </li><li>  the carpet in the rooms is very ancient and, moreover, it is never cleaned, and therefore you can walk on it only in slippers or slates; </li><li>  in order to achieve the replacement of towels, as well as replenishment of cosmetics, you need to contact the reception several times; </li><li>  due to the huge number of guests, most of whom rest with children, the territory is very noisy; </li><li>  in the restaurants on the tables, old torn tablecloths are laid; </li><li>  in the dining room there are a lot of dishes with chips; </li><li>  some days the restaurant does not serve fruit at all; </li><li>  very loud and unpleasant music plays on the beach; </li><li>  after riding on a roller coaster in the water park there are abrasions on the back; </li><li>  quite often, guests are accommodated in neighboring hotels, citing the fact that there are no empty seats (but in this case there are a lot of questions about the appropriateness of the booking procedure); </li><li>  the bathroom in the room is very cramped and narrow; </li><li>  the balcony is very small, and therefore it is comfortable to be there only for that person; </li><li>  no extra dishes, cosmetics, or towels are provided for the extra guest; </li><li>  public toilets located on the territory are never cleaned at all, and therefore there is always an extremely unpleasant smell near them; </li><li>  in the dining room, salt shakers and pepper shakers are common on three tables; </li><li>  to take a beach towel, you will have to leave a deposit of 10 euros. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The impression of the Atrium Beach Hotel (Atrium Beach 4 *) is extremely negative.  Of the positive aspects, perhaps a lot of greenery in the territory, as well as beautiful lighting in the evening.  Of course, with the naked eye it is noticeable that they worked hard on the hotel, making a beautiful design and fresh repairs.  But apparently, after the completion of the reconstruction, the hotel is not maintained in good condition (either due to lack of funds, or for some other reasons).  As a result, everything around is dirty, sometimes broken. </p>
