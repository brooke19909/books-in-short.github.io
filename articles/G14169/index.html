How can they differ from simple speakers?  Let's imagine this situation: you have a music lover who invited you to visit to evaluate his new acquisition.  You come to his house, he puts you on a comfortable easy chair and turns off the light and after a few seconds turns on your favorite composition.  You often listen to this melody at home when doing household chores, in the car, when you go to work, but at the moment this melody sounds completely different.  The sound is so clear and capacious that it seems like these musicians are standing right in front of you.  These feelings overwhelm you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="speakers monitors" class="if uuid-2661207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2661207.jpg"></div><p>  What made the sound so high-quality?  Light off?  Easy chair?  Or is the reason all the new studio speakers your friend acquired?  Undoubtedly, such an <span>acoustic system</span> can not only significantly increase the sound quality, but also cause new bewitching sensations from long-known melodies. </p><p>  In this article we will look at how the column differs from the monitor, discuss their varieties, and also find out several popular models, from the sound of which you will get goosebumps. </p><h2>  Variety </h2><p>  Firstly, studio speakers are divided into portable and stationary: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Portable sound audio systems are widely popular among traveling performers (musicians, presenters, etc.).  Their main advantage is convenient and quick movement. </li><li>  Stationary speakers are distinguished by high sound quality and large dimensions.  In addition, such multifunctional speakers are capable of performing tasks of increased complexity. </li></ul><p>  In addition to the view type, studio speakers are divided into wired and wireless (Bluetooth).  Although today the latter type of connection is considered more popular and in demand, nevertheless, in terms of sound quality, it is much inferior to wired counterparts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zzounds.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="active studio speakers" class="if uuid-2661213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2661213.jpg"></div><p>  Also, studio speakers and monitors are both multi-band and broadband.  But, probably, the most common option are speakers with a bass reflex. </p><h2>  Which is better to choose? </h2><p>  Before buying speakers, you need to understand what goals they will serve.  A true music lover will certainly choose a <span>speaker system</span> with a powerful amplifier.  The other will choose active studio speakers, which are very different in cost.  There is also a third kind of people who like to listen to music in the car.  For such purposes, they choose a subwoofer at low frequencies, which delivers a monaural signal (single-band). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you are not such a music lover as your friend, which is mentioned at the beginning of the article, then it is better to choose a speaker system from cheaper options.  It is not necessary to chase powerful modifications and a popular brand. </p><p>  Also, do not forget about the variety of formats for acoustics.  One of the most popular is the system 2.1.  This type is distinguished by the ability to connect both speakers and a subwoofer. </p><h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  Once you have determined the size of the <span>speaker system</span> and its main goal, it is time to choose a manufacturer.  For some this is the most difficult problem, as there are a lot of brands.  Which one to give preference to? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the difference between a speaker and a studio monitor" class="if uuid-2661216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2661216.jpg"></div><p>  Studio speakers YAMAHA, Sven, HECO and Focal-JMLab have quite a lot of positive reviews.  These sound systems delight their listeners with high-quality sound and ease of use.  The JBL and B&amp;W studio speakers have also worked well.  This is one of the most popular brands, so do not think to find a budget option among them. </p><h2>  YAMAHA YST-SW030 </h2><p>  This subwoofer, judging by the responses, is able to satisfy even the highest demands of the music lover.  This device is universal, it can cope with almost any composition in any genre.  YAMAHA speaker system creates a realistic surround sound that contributes to a complete immersion in the rhythm of the composition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="A variety of studio speakers" class="if uuid-2661227" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2661227.jpg"></div><p>  If you are on the road for a long time and like to listen to music in your car, then this speaker system will suit you.  She, according to experts, is capable of delivering high-quality bass thanks to new Advanced technologies. </p><p>  The speaker power is 130 watts.  This is quite enough to enjoy the strong and high-quality sound of low frequencies.  And the stylish case made of wood and MDF guarantees visual compatibility with your home equipment.  In addition, the small dimensions of this speaker system make it easy to install a subwoofer in a car. </p><h2>  BOSE <span>speaker system</span> </h2><p>  What is the most important thing in creating a home theater?  Big plasma panel?  Cushioned furniture?  Probably, many will agree that the most important thing in a home theater is high-quality video, not sound.  But this is far from the case. </p><div class="photo" data-original="digitalstereophony.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="studio speakers yamaha" class="if uuid-2661220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2661220.jpg"></div><p>  Let's go back to our friend, mentioned at the beginning of the article.  Suppose that instead of music, he included a recital of your favorite band on his new plasma.  The picture is very high quality, but it seems to you that something is missing (the sound is very quiet and hissing).  Looking closely, you notice that the sound comes from one small column, which is located 4 meters from you. </p><p>  Even if you buy the largest plasma for a home theater, then you can‚Äôt do without a high-quality speaker that will create the maximum effect. </p><p>  The BOSE speaker system is, according to reviews, the best choice for such cases.  One of the advantages of this system is the small speakers with two speakers in each.  Thanks to them, you can feel the power of high-quality five-channel sound and enjoy your favorite songs. </p><h2>  Active Alto Professional TX215 System </h2><p>  This <span>speaker system</span> differs not only in high-quality detailed sound, but also in modern design.  Thanks to the new improved shape of the horn, we get a wider angle of sound. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thediscdjstore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="price for studio speakers" class="if uuid-2661223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2661223.jpg"></div><p>  The system is equipped with Class D sound amplifiers, which increase power to 600 watts.  On the front panel is a large metal grille that protects the speakers from any damage. </p><p>  Such a studio column was created, according to music lovers, more for live performances.  It has a relatively low weight, special handles designed for quick transportation, and a convenient shape that allows you to install the system as a stage floor monitor.  Its weight is not more than 15 kilograms, and power - up to 600 watts. </p><h2>  Sven MS-307 </h2><p>  Sven has launched <span>an active speaker system</span> designed for a wide audience.  According to consumers, thanks to its high technical characteristics, you can enjoy high-quality voice acting for films, games, music albums, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stereoadvantage.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="home studio" class="if uuid-2661233" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2661233.jpg"></div><p>  The speakers are equipped with special sound cables and a powerful amplifier, thanks to which you can connect to other sources (TV, computer, radio).  This speaker has additional functions, such as FM radio, Bluetooth, as well as an audio player. </p><p>  The model is made in a modern style: a large black subwoofer, two elegant satellites, a silver control panel.  This design fits perfectly into any home interior, while taking up a minimum of space.  Often, a subwoofer is installed on the floor, near the desktop, and small-sized speakers are placed directly on the table or attached to the corners of the walls, thereby creating surround sound. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In this article, we discussed how the speaker differs from the studio monitor, what should be paid attention to when choosing audio equipment.  We learned which manufacturers are leaders in the global market. </p><p>  Basically, the price of a studio speaker directly depends on the technical parameters.  For example, if you want to create a home theater, then you need to stock up on a thick wallet, because in such a situation you should not save on sound quality.  And if you need acoustics in a car, then a large subwoofer with a built-in sound amplifier (mid frequencies) is perfect for this purpose.  To work with sound, you can take a closer look at budget options, such as, for example, JBL studio speakers.  Although their specifications are significantly different from other, more expensive models, but judging by the reviews, low cost and sophisticated look will please many users. </p>
