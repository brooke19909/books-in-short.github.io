  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Developing the analytical mindset, do not forget about the innate features of a person</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A person can live his whole life happily, fruitfully doing his favorite work, and never think about what kind of mindset God has awarded him.  Some people recognize it as purely physical and consider it a waste of time to solve such problems.  But there are people who are extremely dissatisfied with their choice, or are in a state of deciding what kind of activity to devote, if not their whole life, then the next few years. </p><p>  Even if your choice fell on a profession that requires large physical expenses, then the search for its spiritual or intellectual component turns even boring and monotonous work into a meaningful pastime. </p><p>  The analytical <span>mindset</span> competes with the humanitarian.  Vivid "analysts" continuously analyze the surrounding reality, perceiving the processes around them from a point of view close to mathematical.  They are interested in the relationships and relationships between various information elements.  For most employers, a candidate who has developed an analytical mindset is more attractive than a pronounced ‚Äúhumanities‚Äù.  It is believed that for such a person professions are required that require <span>flexibility of mind,</span> attention to details, a systematic approach to work, observation, and high organization.  Experts are unanimous in the opinion that the candidates for the positions of managers, sales specialists, especially in terms of their development, IT specialists, logisticians, economists, marketers, analysts, consultants, must have an analytical mindset. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But indifference to humanitarian abilities and their development can play a cruel joke with representatives of professions of a pronounced technical and mathematical orientation.  The humanitarian component of the mindset is innate for a person.  A person is born with the predominant influence of the <span>right hemisphere, which is</span> responsible for the figurative perception of reality and imagination.  The analytical mindset develops in the process of preschool education, as well as in the initial stage of schooling. </p><p>  What does the analytical mindset mean without sufficiently developed imaginative thinking?  If we use an analogue of building a house for a rough comparison of the educational process, then humanitarian abilities can be compared with a powerful foundation.  The development of an analytical mind without a sufficient humanitarian base can lead to limited characteristics of the entire structure. </p><p>  Mathematicians and programmers, accountants and accountants are simply obliged to devote time to reading fiction, listening to quality music and just walking with admiring the beauties of nature.  The appearance of bad habits and even a passion for soap operas can signal the initial stage of development of occupational deformation. </p><p>  Returning to the original problem, let‚Äôs try to determine what is called, without a hitch, your humanitarian or analytical mind prevails.  The test consists of four simple exercises: </p><p>  - first you need to twist the <span>fingers</span> several times, we notice that the <span>thumb of</span> the same hand will always be on top, emotional natures put the finger of the left hand on top, and the owners of the analytical mind - the right; </p><p>  - for the next test, you need to use a pen or pencil, on an outstretched arm we combine it with any vertical line (door, window), closing the right and left eyes one by one, we determine which one is leading (the visual shift of the pencil is minimal), if the leading eye is left, then you have a soft and pliable character.  Holders of the right leading eye are distinguished by a solid, persistent, even aggressive character; </p><p>  - interlacing the hands on the chest, we determine which hand will be upstairs, for those capable of coquetting from above, the left hand, those prone to simplicity and simple-heartedness, put their right hand on top; </p><p>  - on the test, "applause" clap with the right hand the owners of a decisive nature, and the left nature, often hesitating before making a decision. </p><p>  So you can determine the leading hemisphere, and therefore the prevailing mindset. </p>
