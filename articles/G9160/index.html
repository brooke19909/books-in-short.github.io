In addition to a more or less balanced ratio of characteristics and cost, devices often receive high-quality materials: soft-fil or matte plastic instead of the gloss that Korean brands are so fond of. </p>

    <p>  Moreover, fruitful work on the appearance is in full swing.  And although it is very difficult to argue with venerable companies, the budget segment does not cease to amaze with some new products in terms of design and ergonomics.  Be that as it may, the situation in the market of mobile gadgets, though not so fast, is changing, and inexpensive devices with attractive characteristics are becoming more than a month from a month. </p><p>  The hero of today's review is the <span>Fly IQ4412</span> Quad Coral smartphone.  The characteristics, design, features, as well as the advantages of the gadget along with the shortcomings will be considered by us.  The opinions of experts and reviews of ordinary device owners will be taken into account. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  The contents of the box are not much different from those of similar representatives of this segment.  The only thing that pleased the manufacturer of his client was the presence of a completely sensible headset with a two-color cable, otherwise the standard set. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

This, of course, is not the thinnest device in its segment, but in appearance it looks very attractive and compact.  It is comfortable, easily fits in a small compartment in a purse or back pocket of jeans. </p>

    <p>  Around the screen you can feel a low side, which protects it from scratches, if you put your smartphone "face" down.  The case has a non-separable design: the back and sides are made of rubberized plastic, and the front surface is tightly covered with glass, and the screen has a dark blue tint, which gives a certain share of the Fly IQ4412 Quad Coral charm.  Reviews regarding the design of the gadget are mostly in a positive way.  The owners appreciated the modern and rather ‚Äúfresh‚Äù look of the device along with acceptable dimensions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Assembly and controls </h2><p>  As for the build quality, there are no complaints: nothing backlash, creaks and crunches.  Coral Fly IQ4412 Quad turned out to be surprisingly intelligently assembled and monolithic.  If you do not pay attention to the brand logo and the price of the device, then according to visual sensations it seems that in your hands you have quite a venerable gadget from the business segment. </p>

    <p>  At the top of the smartphone, you can see a small peephole of the front camera, sensors and a speaker.  Under the screen are the familiar touch buttons to control the basic functions of the gadget.  The backlight is quite bright, and some owners in their reviews complain about the lack of the ability to change its intensity.  In the left end part there is a volume rocker, and a little lower - a button to lock the device.  The location is very convenient, and the pressure itself is quite comfortable. </p><p>  At the upper end we will see a standard interface for headphones (3.5 mm), the lower part of the phone is not busy.  On the right side of the device there is a micro-USB port and a secret compartment for micro-SIM cards. </p><p>  The back of the Coral Fly IQ4412 Quad is completely flat without any texture.  There is a peephole of the main camera along with a flash (which is very pleased), and at the very bottom there is a speaker, near which you can see the brand logo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The diagonal size of the screen is almost five inches (4.77 ‚Äù) at a very comfortable resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels.  Spending time on social networks or watching videos is very convenient.  Instead of the IPS matrix already familiar to many gadgets of such a plan, the developer installed a Super AMOLED display on the Fly IQ4412 Quad Coral, which has good viewing angles without any distortion.  The only thing such matrices are ‚Äúsick with‚Äù is synthetic colors, but saturated and very bright. </p>

    <p>  The density of points is also at the proper level - 308 ppi.  If you have excellent vision, and you exert yourself a lot, you can see the pixelation.  In other cases, the points do not catch the eye and do not interfere with comfortable work with the device. </p><p>  Some owners in their reviews note not quite competent auto-adjustment of brightness.  In a normal room where fluorescent lamps work, you can notice how the gradation of the backlight changes from dim to very bright for no apparent reason.  This is a little annoying, but you can always turn off auto-tuning in the settings, so this point can hardly be called critical. </p><p>  The touch screen intelligently determines all five simultaneous touches, and also has good sensitivity.  The surface is pleasant to the touch, and the finger glides easily over it - it is pleasant to work with the sensor.  Managing the Coral Fly IQ4412 Quad on a sunny day is not so easy.  Direct rays are reflected off the screen, so the data is difficult to see.  The usual trouble with matrices of this type, which means we are looking for a shadow or working indoors. </p><h2>  Stuffing and performance </h2><p>  Specifications <span>Fly IQ4412</span> Quad Coral brought to the middle level - nothing supernatural, but you can have fun playing games or your favorite movie without any problems.  Responsible for the speed is the familiar Mediatek MTK6589 series processor marked ‚ÄúTurbo‚Äù.  All this works on four cores at a frequency of 1.5 GHz and paired with one gigabyte of RAM.  Unlike previous series, where the clock frequency did not exceed 1.2 GHz, the processor can be called pretty nimble. </p>

    <p>  The graphics component is the PowerVR SGX 544MP video chip, which more or less copes with demanding applications.  The phone‚Äôs internal memory is not so much - only 16 GB, but the fact that the brand did not provide for working with memory cards is a big minus.  Reviews of owners are full of indignation about this, especially since the previous generation had such an opportunity. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  For shooting in Coral Fly IQ4412 Quad, the main camera is 8 megapixels with LED flash and autofocus, as well as the front camera, with more modest performance (5 megapixels).  The maximum resolution for video recording is 1920 x 1080 pixels.  Photos are obtained of decent quality without any serious complaints. </p><p>  The menu offers many modes, effects and other settings for better shooting.  The flash works as it should: photos do not light up or blur.  In general, users are very happy with the full-time camera, and there were no critical moments in the reviews. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The device provides for work with only one SIM card type micro.  Moreover, it is worth noting that among all Fly products, support for micro SIMs is extremely rare. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the gadget is equipped with sensible modules of wireless protocols: Wi-Fi at 802.11 b / g / n and Bluetooth points of the fourth version, and also supports modem mode and selected access points (MTS, Beeline, Megaphone), allowing you to use a smartphone as an external communication device for a personal computer. </p><p>  The gadget does not have any navigation function due to the lack of GLONASS and a GPS module.  But this is already from the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe business segment, therefore, we will not consider this point as a minus. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The battery of the smartphone is non-replaceable type with a capacity of 2100 mAh.  A fully charged phone works in active mode for almost 3 hours (games, Internet, Full HD video).  Watching movies at medium resolution (480p) will drain the battery in 6-7 hours. </p><p>  If you use a phone for calls, SMS and rarely go online, then for a day the device is quite enough.  There is also an energy-saving mode, which will significantly extend the operating time of the gadget. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  The device as a whole turned out to be very successful: an upgraded processor, practical and pleasant case material, an acceptable screen size and good battery life.  The only thing that upsets is the lack of support for micro SD cards. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the price / quality ratio is somewhat unbalanced.  For a similar cost, and this is almost 10 thousand rubles, you can look at more sensible models: with a better matrix, support for memory cards and long battery life.  In any case, fans of the brand will surely like the smartphone, so it‚Äôs up to you to decide whether to stay with Fly or go over to some Samsung or Xiaomi.  Fortunately, the assortment in distribution networks is huge, and there is always plenty to choose from. </p>
