The symbol of the capital is a bear.  The settlement is obliged by its name to the Duke of Berthold V of the Tsering dynasty.  It was he who, in 1191, according to legend, named the city in honor of the first animal that he met during his unsuccessful hunt.  Then Berthold von Zeringen was so angry and hungry that, without hesitation, he called the city the name of the beast he was trying to catch.  Bears always played an important role in the development and history of Bern.  To this day, these predators live in a special enclosure, which delight tourists and local residents.  And everyone is enthusiastic about the architecture and sights of the Swiss capital. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bern sights" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1264979.jpg" width="600"></div>

This building is called the Bundeshaus.  It not only meets the Swiss parliament, but also from time to time entertaining events are organized that are interesting for guests and the population of Bern. </p><p>  Bern (sights) is not only a cultural, but also a political capital.  The parliament building was built in 1902 according to the drawings developed by architect Hans Auer.  Under the dome between the two meeting halls, in the central lobby there are monuments of historical figures of the state, as well as images of cantonal emblems.  In May 2008, serious restoration work was completed.  Since then, the federal parliament has literally blinded its beauty.  Tourists can get here as part of an organized tour. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Albert Einstein Museum" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1264983.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Museum named after the great scientist </h2><p>  At different times, the city of Bern was home to many figures of history and culture, politicians and famous scientists.  Albert Einstein was one of those outstanding scientists who lived in the capital of Switzerland.  Together with his wife, during the years 1902-1907, he lived in this city. </p><p>  In memory of the life and work of the famous physicist, the local authorities converted the house in which Einstein rented an apartment into the Albert Einstein House-Museum.

The interior in which the Einstein couple lived was recreated on the second floor.  And on the third floor you can get acquainted with the scientific works of a genius and his detailed biography. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bernese Botanical Garden" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1264980.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nature created by human hands </h2><p>  There is still a unique place in Bern - this is the Bernese Botanical Garden, whose history begins in 1789.  Then the first garden of such a plan was laid out.  The modern garden was equipped in 1862.  Its area is approximately two hectares.  In seven sights greenhouses, more than six thousand different types of plants grow. </p><p>  Each greenhouse has its own name, corresponding to the characteristic features and names of the crops growing in it.  For example, in a greenhouse called the Palm House, heat-loving tropical species grow: coffee, banana trees and sugar cane. </p><h2>  Famous fountain </h2><p>  To see Bern, the sights of which cannot but arouse admiration, and not to see its famous fountains, means to miss the most outstanding Swiss objects.  The famous fountain of Moses must visit every tourist.  The object belongs to 11 operating Bern fountains.  It is also one of Bern's oldest fountains. </p><p>  The fountain of Moses was built in the Renaissance.  The object is represented by the pedestal of Moses, who holds a book with his left hand, which describes the ten main commandments.  The right hand of the prophet is directed to the first commandment, which sounds like "Do not recreate your idol."  The radiance of divine light rays frames the head of Moses. </p>
