Modern architects and engineers love to play with forms, creating more and more unusual water art objects.  Some of them seem unrealistic and amaze the audience’s imagination, for example, the “Hanging Crane” fountain.  We will study it in more detail. </p><h2>  The most famous "soaring crane" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.amusingplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fountain crane hanging in the air" class="if uuid-3249355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/3249355.jpg"></div><p>  “Magic Tap Fountain” is an attraction located in the water park in the Spanish city of Cadiz.  It is believed that this is the first fountain in the world, "The crane hanging in the air", or "Magic" - literally translated into Russian.  The author of this entertaining artificial source, Philip Till, wanted to surprise and amuse the guests of the aqua club.  And he did it, with an original fountain today all visitors to the water park are photographed.  Some of them guess his secret right away, while others look at the structure for a long time and try to understand where the water comes from in a soaring tap.  Almost immediately after the opening of Magic Tap Fountain, similar art objects began to appear in other cities of the world. </p><h2>  Where does the water come from? </h2><p>  The faucet "Crane hanging in the air" surprises with its daring form and as if violates all known laws of physics.  From it, like from a home analogue, a strong pressure of water beats.  But we are used to the fact that water enters a plumbing tap through water pipes.  And the base of the stylized fountain is “deaf” and hung in the air.  Where does the water come from?  To solve this riddle it is enough to see the faucet “Hanging crane in the air” in the off state. </p><p>  A transparent pipe hides under the streams of water.  It is along it that the liquid rises up in order to descend with noise in streams downward.  Due to the fact that the pipe is transparent, it is very difficult to notice it under the streams of water.  The fountain system is designed in such a way that a certain volume of liquid constantly circulates in it. </p><h2>  All similar sights </h2><div class="photo" data-original="propelsteps.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fountain soaring crane" class="if uuid-3249357" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/3249357.jpg"></div><p>  The most famous fountain "Hanging crane in the air" is located in Spain, in Cadiz.  Tourists quickly fell in love with this attraction and very soon similar objects began to appear in other places of the globe.  You can see similar fountains today in Spain: in Olivenza Park and on the island of Menorca.  There are their "Magic Cranes" in Belgium, Switzerland, Canada and the USA.  Residents of Russia do not have to go so far in order to see an unusual sight.  The fountain "Crane hanging in the air" is in Lazarevsky.  And in Ukraine there are two of them: in Kiev and Donetsk. </p>
