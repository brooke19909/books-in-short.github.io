Recently, such requests have become more and more, because this is an ancient settlement, which is included in the Golden Ring of Russia.  Now this direction is becoming popular not only for tourism, but also for country life and permanent residence.  More and more young people and representatives of the middle generation come here from the Far East, the North, even from the capital cities and from abroad.  In this article we will tell you what this city attracts them with, what are its features and attractions. </p><h2>  Reasons for moving </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In Pereslavl-Zalessky for permanent residence" class="if uuid-3204505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3204505.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews of Pereslavl-Zalessky, you can make a list of the main reasons why people move here.  In some ways they are similar, in something they differ. </p><p>  Someone is looking for a quiet and peaceful place with classical Russian nature, which is famous for its natural beauty here.  Some seek to develop their own business.  The most attractive destinations, in addition to tourism, are the IT industry and industry. </p><p>  Others want to get a permanent job at local enterprises or construction companies.  We are talking not only about migrant workers, but also about active residents of other regions of Russia who are striving to change something in life when the current state of things does not suit them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city has an attractive geographical position - only 140 kilometers from Moscow.  Therefore, many open their own business, focused on residents of the capital. </p><h2>  Construction </h2><p>  The proximity to the capital has identified another popular destination among those who often visit this city.  This is the construction of cottages within Pereslavl-Zalessky, close proximity to it or in the Pereslavl region. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the city itself is very small.  On an ongoing basis, about 40 thousand people live in it.  Moreover, by the beginning of the 2000s, approximately the same amount existed in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsummer cottages.  Of course, their owners were mainly residents of Moscow and the Moscow region, where the level of earnings is much higher than in the Yaroslavl region. </p><h2>  Per stream </h2><p>  Since then, at least a few hundred temporary country and capital buildings are added annually.  In reviews of the city of Pereslavl-Zalessky, many note that the construction industry of cottages is put on stream here.  So the buildings grow like mushrooms after the rain. </p><p>  Currently, in the city and the region there are several dozen organizations that are engaged in the construction of private houses.  These are not only summer residences, but also capital buildings in which you can live all year round.  Among them are large companies, very small firms, as well as brigades of builders, mainly from the former republics of the Soviet Union. </p><h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  According to the reviews of those who moved to permanent residence in Pereslavl-Zalessky, you can get a full impression of what options for resettlement exist here today.  As a rule, these are apartments in high-rise buildings, wooden houses, cottages and summer residences.  Townhouses are found in the Pereslavl region, but so far very rarely.  This type of real estate has not yet managed to gain popularity in the Yaroslavl region. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the difference between a country house and a cottage for year-round use is often purely symbolic or conditional.  In this case, it will be more relevant to talk about the materials that were used in construction, all kinds of designs, methods of insulation. </p><p>  When a family moves from another region, it is not ready to invest in the construction of a high-rise building at the foundation stage or to develop a house project.  They need finished housing.  This eliminates many household and household problems.  Consider each option individually. </p><h2>  Apartment </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mirkvartir.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New building in Pereslavl-Zalessky" class="if uuid-3204506" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3204506.jpg"></div><p>  In the reviews of those who moved to permanent residence in Pereslavl-Zalessky, many admit that they initially set themselves the goal of buying an apartment.  This is one of the most common options.  In this case, the family has a personal space with all the amenities, but you need to understand that it is necessary to make an adjustment for local characteristics. </p><p>  In Pereslavl-Zalessky, most houses with central heating, cold and hot water supply.  Moreover, all networks are old, and, according to reviews, they often fail.  So it is not surprising that residents have to stay for several days without heat even in the winter months.  In summer, hot water is completely turned off for maintenance work for at least a few weeks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Apartments with individual heating are sold in new buildings.  Moreover, the quality of such housing is much higher than in Soviet-built houses.  This is especially true for infrastructure and insulation. </p><h2>  Private houses </h2><div class="photo" data-original="yaroslav-region.afy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cottage in Pereslavl-Zalessky" class="if uuid-3204508" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3204508.jpg"></div><p>  In reviews of Pereslavl-Zalessky, many write that they would like to purchase a house in the historical part of the city.  This is really an enviable and attractive property in many ways.  The city still has many small streets with unique historical views.  But at the same time, the cost of housing in such areas is quite high; in this, apartments in new buildings are even inferior to it. </p><p>  In the center of Pereslavl-Zalessky, the houses are mostly wooden.  You need to understand that such housing can not meet modern quality standards in terms of layout, insulation and comfort. </p><p>  Moreover, in the city there are already quite a lot of relatively new and modern cottages that have appeared in the past few decades.  These houses are built thoroughly and thoroughly, so their cost is quite high. </p><p>  Many advise themselves to build a house in Pereslavl-Zalessky.  According to reviews, for a relatively small amount of money, such a project can be implemented in the city or in a nearby village, at a distance of 10-15 minutes. </p><p>  Around the city there are a lot of villages and villages, from which it will not be difficult to get to Pereslavl-Zalessky.  For example, the village of Yam is almost adjacent to urban development.  At the same time, it has mainly asphalt roads, and from the southern part of the city you can go directly to the district. </p><h2>  Cottages </h2><div class="photo" data-original="yaroslavl.move.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cottage in Pereslavl-Zalessky" class="if uuid-3204511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3204511.jpg"></div><p>  Having your own cottage in the Pereslavl region has long been a sign of good taste.  Most of those who moved to Pereslavl-Zalessky seek to build a small house for a country residence.  In the reviews, they note that such housing should be chosen carefully and carefully. </p><p>  Recently, companies have been stepping up their development of entire villages and house lines in a clean field or in a forest, where it is not so easy to lay the communications necessary for a comfortable stay. </p><p>  Therefore, many prefer to choose from those options that are part of all kinds of country societies and partnerships. </p><p>  Cottages intended for partial or permanent residence, an excellent opportunity to spend a weekend outdoors in a comfortable living environment.  Most of these holiday villages have all the necessary infrastructure, which includes electricity, gas, even in some cases, water supply.  Of course, the roads in such settlements leave much to be desired only if local residents do not follow them and do not constantly repair them. </p><h2>  The quality of life </h2><div class="photo" data-original="otdyhaemvrossii.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about Pereslavl-Zalessky" class="if uuid-3204515" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3204515.jpg"></div><p>  Those who moved to permanent residence in Pereslavl-Zalessky, in their reviews, note that life here is not as attractive and problem-free as it might seem to a tourist who came for a couple of days to get acquainted with the sights.  The city has many problems that are solved with great difficulty. </p><p>  For example, they include a crisis that has long been outlined in the housing and communal services, an overcrowded solid waste landfill, problems with street cleaning, lack of places in schools and kindergartens. </p><p>  Moreover, if you are looking for a peaceful place, which is also located almost within walking distance from the capital, then this is the best option.  This is in the reviews of Pereslavl-Zalessky noted by many who moved here. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Azimuth" class="if uuid-3204507" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3204507.jpg"></div><p>  Pereslavl-Zalesky is a famous ancient city that annually attracts a large number of tourists.  The first mentions in the annals of him date back to 1152.  Due to the fact that the settlement is included in the Golden Ring of Russia, about 300 thousand tourists visit it annually. </p><p>  Tourists who stay for at least a couple of days are sure to stay in hotels.  By the way, this is the best option for those who are going to move here for permanent residence, but will not make a final decision.  For a few days spent in the city, you can try to feel like a local resident, understand whether you really like it here, learn more about the local problems. </p><p>  In reviews of hotels in Pereslavl-Zalessky, visitors often admit that they prefer the Azimut hotel.  This is a large international hotel chain that has its own representative offices in 28 cities of Russia, Germany and Austria.  Works in a mid-price room fund.  It is considered one of the fastest growing brands in this business area. </p><p>  Today it is a large hotel operator, which initially appeared in Russia, but has long gone beyond its borders.  The hotels have a single booking system, common standards of service and a common corporate culture. </p><h2>  Room rates </h2><p>  This hotel offers standard rooms.  True, settling in them is not easy.  Due to their low cost, they are booked in advance. </p><p>  Therefore, at the service of a slow traveler is a superior with a balcony for 2500 rubles for two per day.  Junior suite with a balcony will cost 500 rubles more, 3500 rubles will cost a two-room junior suite. </p><p>  There is a very fashionable option.  This is a spa cottage for 7000 rubles per day for two guests.  At your disposal will be your own house with one bedroom, a kitchen area, a spacious living room and a sauna. </p><p>  The room has all the necessary amenities, including everything you need to visit the Finnish sauna. </p><p>  The hotel positions itself as a 4-star.  In reviews of the "Azimuth" in Pereslavl-Zalessky, tourists note that in general they are satisfied with the service provided here.  The hotel is new, located in a vast and well-groomed area.  Helpful staff is trying to help resolve any issue. </p><h2>  Tourist interest </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.za7verst.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the Red Square" class="if uuid-3204516" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3204516.jpg"></div><p>  Most often you can find positive reviews from tourists about Pereslavl-Zalessky.  Visitors celebrate a large number of amazing sights, the opportunity to learn more about the ancient history of the country, to learn about the once great city, which, founded by Yuri Dolgoruky, was to become the capital of North-Eastern Russia. </p><p>  Tourists must come to the local Red Square in the very center of the city, not far from the city rampart.  It has existed since the 12th century, while it was here that the veche regularly gathered. </p><p>  In Soviet times, wooden structures located around the perimeter were demolished.  Under the new project, the main axis was directed from Sovetskaya Street towards the Transfiguration Cathedral, pedestrian paths appeared. </p><h2>  Pereslavl Kremlin </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of the sights in Pereslavl-Zalessky, the main one is the Kremlin of the old Russian city. </p><p>  He appeared in the XII century.  At that time, double wooden walls with towers were located throughout the crest of the shaft.  Later, the Kremlin was rebuilt several times.  He was often captured and robbed, including during the invasion of the Tatar-Mongols. </p><p>  In the middle of the XVIII century, wooden walls were dismantled due to their uselessness and dilapidation.  Today you can see earthen ramparts, the Transfiguration Cathedral of the XII century, the church of Peter the Metropolitan of the XVI century, part of the surviving buildings of the Bogoroditsky-Sretensky monastery, built in the XIII century. </p>
