    <h2>  Instruction for use </h2><p>  To connect the device, you must use a power cord.  Also, a pipe for supplying and draining water is connected to the washing machine.  After loading the laundry, you must immediately select the desired mode.  Most models have a rotary control.  The user is also able to select the washing temperature.  The spin function is set separately.  When washing is completed, an audible warning sounds. </p><h2>  Common faults and repairs </h2><p>  In Ariston washing machines, malfunctions are most often associated with a motor breakdown.  Certain belt transmission problems may also occur.  Repair of Ariston washing machines, if necessary, can be done independently.  If the problem is a motor breakdown, then remove the back cover. </p><p>  Next, you will have to twist the protective plate.  The motor, as a rule, is located next to the capacitor.  To remove the motor, do not touch the belt drive.  Inspect the device in the first place for defects.  In some cases, the model may become dusty.  In this case, the motor should be cleaned immediately.  If the device burns out, it must be replaced. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
