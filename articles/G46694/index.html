There are many elements.  Let's try to understand this variety.  In today's article, we will look at the main types of batteries. </p><h2>  Types of elements and their classification </h2><p>  They are distinguished by the materials from which the active components are made. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of batteries" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1817453.jpg" width="600"></div>  Any battery consists of:

    <ul><li>  anode; </li><li>  cathode; </li><li>  electrolyte. </li></ul><p>  Now the industry produces more than five types of batteries: </p><ul><li>  Saline. </li><li>  Alkaline </li><li>  Mercury. </li><li>  Lithium </li><li>  Silver. </li></ul><p>  You can also select batteries in the form of batteries. </p><h2>  The device and features of salt products </h2><p>  This battery has replaced a manganese-zinc battery.  In size, this autonomous power source has not changed, but the production technology has changed seriously.  In a salt battery, solutions based on ammonium chlorides are used as the electrolyte.  In this solution are the <span>anode and cathode of the</span> battery.  These functional elements are made from materials such as zinc, as well as manganese oxide.  The electrolyte is connected by a salt bridge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of batteries by size" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1817450.jpg" width="400"></div>  The main advantage that these types of batteries have is low prices.  These are the most affordable sources of energy among all the others that can be purchased.  Serious disadvantages include a large loss in electrical capacitance during discharge.  Also, the disadvantages of the product include short shelf life.  You can use an element without losing its characteristics for no more than two years.  By the end of this period, the battery capacity is reduced to 40%.  At low temperatures, the battery may lose its full capacity.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Alkaline elements </h2><p>  These types of batteries were developed in the 64th year.  They are also called alkaline.  What is their difference?  A simple user can understand this by operating time.  According to reviews, it is alkaline products that last much longer than others.  And the cost is only 20-30 percent more.  Electrodes for these elements are zinc.  Manganese dioxide is also used in production.  The electrolyte is a solution of potassium hydroxide. </p><p>  These elements are widespread.  They are perfect for most electronic devices.  Among the advantages is a high electrical capacitance when compared with a salt analogue, and as a result, a rather long shelf life.  The alkaline battery is able to work without loss of properties and characteristics even at low temperatures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet battery types" class="if" height="462" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1817449.jpg" width="600"></div>  These models have improved tightness, which reduces the risk of electrolyte leakage.  As for the operating life, such a battery can be stored up to 5 years.  The battery discharges at a much lower rate than the salt counterpart.  These types of AAA batteries are preferred for use in electronic technology.

    <p>  The minuses include a decrease in the voltage level over time at times when the battery is actively discharging.  With similar salt products, the dimensions, weight and cost of this element are higher. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mercury </h2><p>  For the manufacture of this battery, zinc is used as the material for the anode, and the cathodes are made from mercury oxides.  Inside the element, two electrodes are separated by a special diaphragm and a separator.  The diaphragm is impregnated with special solutions of potassium hydroxides.  Due to this design and composition, mercury batteries can be operated as a battery.  But in the process of cyclic use, the element will undergo degradation - the electric capacitance will significantly decrease. </p><p>  The main advantages include stable voltage, capacity, independence from temperature conditions, long shelf life. </p><p>  The disadvantages include high cost, risks of depressurization and leakage of hazardous mercury.  You must also dispose of these batteries correctly. </p><h2>  Silver elements </h2><p>  Zinc is used for the anode; cathodes are made of silver oxides.  The electrolyte is sodium or potassium hydroxides.  This class includes watch batteries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kinds of finger batteries" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1817448.jpg" width="600"></div>  Among the advantages, stable output voltages and a high energy capacity indicator can be distinguished.  The battery is immune to temperature changes, and also has a long shelf life.  The only negative is the high price.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Lithium battery </h2><p>  The product has a cathode made of lithium inside.  It is separated from the anode by a diaphragm and a separator.  The diaphragm is impregnated with special organic electrolyte solutions.  The advantages include constant voltage, the value of which does not depend on the load currents.  The battery has a small mass, long shelf life, as well as immunity to temperature extremes.  Only low prices are cons. </p><h2>  Batteries </h2><p>  Along with non-rechargeable batteries, batteries are also produced.  They have a serious advantage - they can be recharged many times.  Types of batteries are also different - there are lead, iron-nickel, nickel-cadmium products and lithium. </p><h2>  Battery Sizes </h2><p>  All autonomous batteries can be distinguished from each other in size.  One popular classification method is the American system.  This system is very convenient, and it is widely used in most countries.  Let's look at the types of batteries in size. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rechargeable batteries" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1817451.jpg" width="500"></div>  According to the American system, a battery with the name "D" has the following dimensions - the height is 61.5 mm, the diameter is 34.2 mm.  Voltage - 1.5 V. Element of type "C" - 50.0 mm in height, 26.2 mm in diameter, voltage is 1.5 V. Battery "AA" produces a voltage of 1.5 V, has 14.5 mm in diameter, and its height is 50.5 mm.  One of the most popular "AAA" or in the common people is "little finger" - 44.5 mm in height, 10.5 mm in diameter, 1.5 V. "PP3" - 48.5 mm in height, 26.5 in diameter, voltage 9 V.

    <p>  In everyday life, people do not use classification, and batteries are called differently.  For example, the AA model in size can be compared with a person’s finger.  For this, the people call it finger-type.  There are other types of finger batteries - AAA.  The sizes are comparable to the sizes of the little finger.  A battery of type "C" is popularly called an "inch".  PP3 is nothing but a crown. </p><h2>  Tablet battery </h2><p>  It is a silver anode, a zinc cathode, an electrolyte in the form of a mixture of salts in a paste consistency. </p><p>  Various battery manufacturers often label these products, and the designations are far from standard.  Consider what tablet batteries are.  Their types can be distinguished by standard sizes.  Dimensions start at 5.8 mm and end at 11.6 mm.  Height ranges from 2.1 mm to 5.4. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of batteries" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1817452.jpg" width="600"></div>  These small silver-colored batteries are used to power electronic or quartz watches.  When you need to change the battery, people often wonder which battery to buy.  If the manufacturer installed the 399 element in the watch, then instead of it you can choose alternative options:

    <ul><li>  LR57. </li><li>  LR57SW. </li><li>  LR927. </li></ul><p>  All these types of batteries are exactly the same in size.  The number indicates that this battery is 2.6 mm high and 9.5 mm in diameter. </p><h2>  Marking </h2><p>  The IEC International Electrotechnical Commission has developed a notation system with which modern manufacturers are required to label batteries. </p><p>  So, for example, there is an element with the designation 15 A LR6 AA 1.5 V. So, these types of batteries have a charge of 15 A * h.  The class (in this case, “AA”) indicates that the battery is finger-type, capable of delivering a voltage of 1.5 V. And LR6 reports that this element is alkaline. </p><p>  Salt elements are indicated by the symbol "R".  Alkaline - "LR", silver - "SR", lithium - "CR".  In addition, the classes of batteries are sometimes indicated with numbers.  20 is a D-class, C - 14, AA - 6, AAA - 03, PP3 - 6/22.  They have their own designations and tablet batteries.  Species are identified by number. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of batteries aaa" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1817454.jpg" width="600"></div>  Next, we decode all the characters from the example.  The letters indicate that the element is alkaline.  The digit reports that the element of their class is AA.

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, knowing the dimensions of modern batteries, their designations and decoding, it is easy to choose the appropriate autonomous power source for any portable device.  But often the average layman does not need to know such detailed information.  It is enough to consider the sizes when choosing.  90 percent of all batteries are AA or AAA.  It is rather difficult to make a mistake here. </p>
