However, this is not surprising.  Indeed, in every hand-made product a person puts his soul and heart.  That is why they are obtained not only beautiful and unique, but also somehow alive, as if exuding special heat, energy. </p><p>  Some people find it extremely difficult to do some DIY work.  Although this is a big mistake.  Indeed, in order to create something interesting and unusual on your own, you need to cut a little time out of your busy schedule and turn on your imagination.  Well, then it‚Äôs small!  Finding an instruction and performing an original thing on it is very simple.  For example, if the reader wants to knit the scarf with his own hands, he should pay attention to this article. </p><h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  The first and most important question that precedes any case is formed in the title of the current paragraph.  And then we will answer it.  So, to start knitting a beautiful scarf, you should determine which product in the end you want to get.  After all, a scarf can be: </p><ul><li>  warm or light; </li><li>  male or female; </li><li>  motley or monophonic; </li><li>  openwork, knitted with a smooth cloth or consisting of one elastic band. </li></ul><p>  And this is not a complete list of the features of this product that directly affect its appearance.  Therefore, before going to the needlework store, you need to decide: </p><ol><li>  Who is knitting a scarf for knitting? </li><li>  What season is it suitable for? </li><li>  What will it look like? </li></ol><p>  After answering these questions, you can begin to study the patterns. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful scarf knitting" class="if uuid-2348662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2348662.jpg"></div><h2>  The simplest pattern </h2><p>  In this section, we explore how to knit the simplest, but at the same time very original pattern.  The name he has is quite memorable - ‚Äúgum‚Äù.  And the options look very beautiful: </p><ul><li>  1x1 - one front and one wrong side; </li><li>  2x2; </li><li>  3x3. </li></ul><p>  More loops are used to knit braids and harnesses.  But more on that later.  In the meantime, find out the technology for knitting a scarf with knitting needles with a gum pattern.  First we need to dial a certain number of loops.  Their number should be a multiple of the number of loops in the elastic band to make the pattern look complete.  And plus two more edge loops.  The number of readers should be determined independently.  However, it is important to mention that the width depends on how many loops the scarf consists of. </p><p>  Now proceed directly to the knitting of the first row, forming a pattern: </p><ol><li>  We remove the first loop. </li><li>  Then we knit one, two or three face, and then the same number of purl. </li><li>  The last loop of the row is the wrong one. </li><li>  Next, we knit the second row.  We also remove the first loop. </li><li>  We knit the rest according to the drawing.  Where in the previous row there were front loops, now you should knit the wrong ones.  And vice versa. </li><li>  So we move for a certain number of rows.  It depends on how long the scarf with knitting needles we want to knit. </li></ol><p>  This pattern is suitable for a warm scarf, and for spring or summer.  The main thing in this case is to select the appropriate threads.  The product should be warmer, the thicker the thread should be chosen, perhaps even need a woolen.  It is also important to note that the gum pattern is suitable for male and female knitwear. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Snake" pattern </h2><p>  The items look quite original, especially if it is a snood scarf (knitting which is also very simple and relatively quick), connected using the technology described below.  It is also based on ordinary gum.  Therefore, having understood the rules of its execution, repeating this pattern will not be the slightest difficulty. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.inquisitr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting scarf" class="if uuid-2348627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2348627.jpg"></div><p>  How does the ‚Äúsnake‚Äù pattern fit: </p><ol><li>  So, the first thing to do is to put on the knitting needles of the required number of loops.  If you plan to knit a scarf with knitting needles, then about 80 pieces will be quite enough.  If normal, then 60 is enough. </li><li>  In addition, it should be remembered that the total number should consist of a multiple of the sum of the loops in the elastic and two hem. </li><li>  When this process is finished, you can proceed directly to the knitting pattern.  In technology, which is actually nothing complicated.  It is only necessary to knit the first row, as described in the previous paragraph, with an elastic band.  Better 2x2 or 3x3. </li><li>  In the next row, it is important not to get confused, because the pattern will begin to shift.  As a result, it turns out that we remove the first loop, as usual. </li><li>  Then we focus on the drawing.  For example, in a 2x2 elastic band, two loops after the hem are purl, first we knit as a face, and then one purl in the pattern, and the next front as purl. </li><li>  Next, we knit, moving the pattern to the left.  Two purl and two facial. </li><li>  Now go to the third row.  It turns out that the "snakes" stretch to the right, so the pattern also needs to be led in this direction. </li><li>  There is nothing complicated in this technology.  It is only necessary to carefully follow the pattern so that the "snakes" on the wrong side move in one direction, and on the front - in the other. </li></ol><p>  Thus, you can knit a beautiful scarf with knitting needles.  However, the ‚Äúsnake‚Äù pattern looks best on warm winter items. </p><h2>  Rice Pattern </h2><p>  The next option is also quite simple in execution, and the result is an unusual "convex" pattern.  On scarves, he looks especially interesting. </p><p>  Technology: </p><ol><li>  We pick up the desired number of loops on the knitting needles.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter at all whether there will be an even number of them or not.  In this figure, this factor does not play a role.  The main thing when knitting is not to lose the edge loops at the beginning and at the end of each row. </li><li>  We knit the first row with a pattern similar to a 1x1 elastic band.  That is, we remove the first edge, then we knit one front, and then one wrong side.  So we move to the end.  The very last loop will be seamy.  Regardless of the picture. </li><li>  We knit the second row according to the drawing.  Facial as facial, wrong as wrong. </li><li>  Well, in the third row the fun begins.  Although everything fits very easily.  And, most importantly, it will not be possible to get confused in the pattern.  After all, in it from each front loop we knit the wrong one.  And vice versa.  Not forgetting the edge loops. </li><li>  We knit the fourth row again according to the drawing. </li><li>  And in the fifth, we change them again. </li><li>  So we continue until the length of the knitted scarf suits. <div class="photo" data-original="www.knittingmatters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="men's scarf" class="if uuid-2348648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2348648.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  This pattern is suitable for both warm and light spring products. </p><h2>  Pattern "Speckles" </h2><p>  The finished drawing, as well as its knitting technology, is similar to that which we presented to the reader in the previous paragraph.  However, there is still a significant difference.  Otherwise, the drawings would be identical.  And then you can verify this: </p><ol><li>  We pick up an even or odd number of loops on the knitting needles.  This pattern is also based on knitting a scarf with knitting needles.  But since in this case our pattern is based on a 1x1 elastic band, then the total number of loops can be dialed absolutely any.  Depending on your own preferences and wishes. </li><li>  Having decided on the width of the scarf, we proceed to the formation of the pattern.  To do this, as usual, remove the first loop.  Recall, it is called edge.  It is quite possible that the reader does not understand why to do this at all.  Therefore, we will explain.  Due to this feature of knitting, the edges of the finished product are more accurate and complete.  In the end, it seems as if the scarf was knitted by a professional craftsman, not a novice. </li><li>  We knit the second and subsequent loops of a row as an ordinary gum 2x2. </li><li>  At the end there is an edge.  Recall: it is knitted as the wrong one. </li><li>  In the second row, we also remove the first loop. </li><li>  Then we knit the facial ones over the wrong ones, and the wrong ones over the facial ones. </li><li>  In the end, again, regardless of the pattern (it may well turn out that the last two loops of the row turn out to be wrong), we knit the edge loop. </li></ol><p>  So, the essence of this technology is to alternate front and back loops in each row.  Forming an interesting volumetric pattern "speckles". </p><p>  The scarf associated with this pattern is suitable for both the warm season and the cold.  It all depends on what thread the canvas will consist of. </p><div class="photo" data-original="crochetascarf.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="original scarf" class="if uuid-2348643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2348643.jpg"></div><h2>  Chess Pattern </h2><p>  The following figure, which we will study in this article, is also based on the principle of gum.  Rather, it‚Äôs more correct to say that it combines the two technologies already described earlier: a simple rubber band and ‚Äúpictures‚Äù.  So, you should knit it this way: </p><ol><li>  Having gathered the number of loops necessary for a suitable width of the finished scarf on the knitting needles.  We proceed to the formation of the picture.  However, it is important to note that the most interesting and advantageous are women's scarves tied with knitting needles, as well as men's ones, however, which are based on a pattern consisting of an alternation of two or three wrong and front loops.  Based on this, the total quantity should be calculated using mathematical calculations, which the story has been told about more than once. </li><li>  Next, we knit the first row.  The first edge, as usual, is removed.  We knit two or three loops following it as purl, and two or three after them - facial. </li><li>  In the second row, we simply repeat the drawing.  From the front we knit the front, from the inside - the wrong. </li><li>  In the third row, we change them, like the way we did it in the technology described for the pattern.  As a result, it turns out that the wrong side became facial.  And vice versa. </li><li>  We knit the fourth row again according to the drawing. </li><li>  In the fifth we change. </li><li>  We continue to ‚Äúconfuse‚Äù the front and back loops in each odd row.  So we move until the desired scarf length is reached. </li></ol><p>  Thus, <span>knitting a scarf with</span> knitting needles according to the technology described above is quite simple.  And the finished product is suitable for spring, winter or autumn.  The main thing is to choose the right thread. </p><h2>  Simple openwork pattern number 1 </h2><p>  Another interesting pattern that looks great on various products (including scarves) fits incredibly simply.  But then it looks very interesting and elegant.  However, it is important to note that the scarf knitted in the manner described below will best decorate the representative of the beautiful half of humanity, rather than a strong one.  And, having connected a small fragment that will help to form an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe pattern, this can be easily verified.  But first, you need to study the technology of knitting a scarf with a knitting needle presented below: </p><ol><li>  The first thing we do is loop.  Their total number should consist of an even number (divisible by two) and two edge. </li><li>  Next, we proceed to the pattern, in which only the front loops are used, not counting the last. </li><li>  So, remove the first loop. </li><li>  Then we make a crochet. </li><li>  And then we knit together the next two loops. </li><li>  Then alternate the yarn and the connected loops. </li><li>  In the second row we‚Äôre not wise, we only knit the wrong side </li><li>  In the third row, repeat steps 3-6. </li></ol><p>  The length of the product is determined independently, as well as what season the scarf is for. </p><div class="photo" data-original="run-belay.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork scarf" class="if uuid-2348639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2348639.jpg"></div><h2>  Simple openwork pattern number 2 </h2><p>  The technology for making this pattern for a scarf with knitting needles is practically no different from the previous one.  The only difference is that in the first case, openwork "holes" stretch in one line, and in this they will be staggered.  How to do this, explain further: </p><ol><li>  We repeat the beginning of the previous instruction.  In particular, steps 1-7. </li><li>  Then we perform a few other actions.  In the third row, the first loop is also removed. </li><li>  Then we knit the next two together. </li><li>  And we make a crochet. </li><li>  Well, then just alternate the third and fourth steps. </li></ol><p>  The length of the finished product is determined independently.  However, it should be noted that the current drawings and those described in paragraph above are not suitable for a scarf.  They look much better on monophonic stoles worn in autumn or spring. </p><h2>  Harness pattern </h2><p>  For many beginners who are just beginning to learn the basics of knitting, it seems as if it is very difficult to connect beautiful and looking quite expensive products with braids and plaits.  Therefore, they do not undertake them.  And make a serious mistake.  After all, these patterns are also very simple to perform.  The main thing is to understand the technologies that we offer next. </p><p>  So, how to knit an original scarf with knitting needles for beginners: </p><ol><li>  First of all, we determine how many loops our harness will consist of.  Options look better 4x4, 6x6, 9x9 and for a wide scarf snud 12h12. </li><li>  Next, we collect loops, focusing on this indicator.  Not forgetting the two edge loops. </li><li>  Next, we knit a picture.  As usual, remove the first loop. </li><li>  Then we knit all the rest with the front ones, and the last one with the wrong one. </li><li>  We knit the second row with the wrong ones. </li><li>  Repeat steps 3-5 four times.  Less possible, depending on the number of loops in the harness.  It is also important to decide whether it should be elongated or rounded. </li><li>  After that, remove the first loop on the existing knitting needle, and the next, for example, four, on the additional. </li><li>  Then we knit the next four loops in a common fabric and then removed to an additional knitting needle. </li><li>  Then we repeat the two previous steps to the end of the row, ending it with the wrong loop. </li><li>  Then again we repeat the sixth step. </li><li>  The length of the product is determined independently. </li></ol><p>  The finished female or male scarf (knitting), knitted from warm woolen threads, looks best.  Therefore, it is more reasonable to wear it in cold winter weather. </p><div class="photo" data-original="patronesparatejer.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting scarf" class="if uuid-2348625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2348625.jpg"></div><h2>  Braid pattern </h2><p>  Another original drawing, which is a little more difficult for a beginner to complete.  But after understanding the technology and learning how to knit it, it will be possible to come up with various patterns for yourself.  And we will help our dear reader a little in this. </p><p>  Knitting braid with knitting needles - a scarf with a description: </p><ol><li>  First of all, we decide how many loops are planned in one part of the braid.  Two or three are best.  Then in general there will be six or nine in the tourniquet. </li><li>  Having gathered loops, guided by this parameter, it is necessary to knit the front side with facial loops, and the wrong side with the wrong ones. </li><li>  Only six rows. </li><li>  Then we remember braiding braids on hair or ribbons.  Mentally divide the harness into three equal parts.  For example, two loops. </li><li>  Remove the first four on an extra spoke.  It is more convenient to use the one that is suitable for knitting on both sides. </li><li>  And the remaining two are knit as facial. </li><li>  Then we remove the two middle loops from the extra knitting needle and knit two front loops out of them. </li><li>  Then we knit the last two. </li><li>  Items 4-8 report the pattern.  Repeat it until the end of the row. </li><li>  Then, again, we knit the wrong side and front surface according to the drawing.  For six rows. </li><li>  Then repeat the braid. <div class="photo" data-original="www.wishboxshops.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="braid scarf" class="if uuid-2348645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2348645.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  Thus, it is not difficult to combine an original and unique product.  After all, it is enough just to turn on your imagination and play a little with the described technologies.  After all, they can even be combined.  And then the reader can knit the scarf with his own hands.  Photos of the most original ones, which we also added to the article, will serve as a hint. </p>
