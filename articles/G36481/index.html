The impeccable comfort and genuine hospitality that await you at this hotel will only emphasize the charm of a paradise, which is the resort village of Sarigerme.  The Mediterranean climate, many ancient and Byzantine attractions, the surrounding landscape resembles the Greek islands.  And most importantly - the sea!  Warm, affectionate ... And plus the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpositive received from sincere Turkish hospitality and European service.  Knowing that under the concept of "good rest" many people understand different things, we immediately point out: this hotel is for romantic lovers and couples without children.  It's a good <span>honeymoon here.</span>  Russian tourists who want to take a break from the company of their compatriots will certainly like it here.  Most of the guests at the hotel are Europeans, so the level of service here is appropriate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alinn sarigerme boutique" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/467815.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Location and Specialization </h2><p>  Hotel Alinn Sarigerme Boutique is located near the center of the resort village of Sarigerme.  This is a small village in the south-west of Turkey, on the shores of the Mediterranean, but still a little bit of the Aegean.  We can say that it is located at the confluence of both water areas.  If we talk about administrative division, then Sarigerme belongs to the Ortaka district of Mugla province.  But it is also customary to attribute this resort to the zone of influence of the city of Fethiye.  Some even believe that this is the Marmaris area - at least, such information can sometimes be found on tourist sites.  There are family-friendly hotels in Sarigerme, but Alinn Sarigerme Boutique has a completely different specialization.  Guests who are under the age of eighteen are not accommodated in this boutique.  So if you do not like children's screeching and splashing around the pool, here you are.  You also need to consider the fact that the animation is the most minimal.  Muffled music plays in the bars, everything is aimed at a quiet and relaxing holiday.  Fans of noisy parties should look for another resort, closer to Izmir. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Where to walk </h2><p>  Sarigerme is a fairly small village surrounded by mountains with coniferous forests and olive groves.  The former fishing village has a post office, a local market and, of course, the main shopping street.  Shopaholics will be somewhat disappointed, but in vain.  Here you can also get some basic necessities and beach accessories - bathing suits, towels, textiles.  Hotel Alinn Sarigerme Boutique is located close to the center of the village, on a high sea shore.  On the way to the beach, you'll walk past chain hotels like Iberotel, Magic Life, and Robinson.  As everywhere in Turkey, there is no shortage of souvenir shops, but no one will pester you on the beach - local residents do not wander along the coast, praising their goods.  On the boardwalk, you can drink authentically prepared coffee and enjoy ice cream.  But in the village they counted on a calm, relaxing vacation.  No discos, karaoke and other noisy amusements.  Almost all hotels in Sarigerme are five-star boutiques. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel yourself </h2><p>  From the airport of Dalaman, the village of Sarigerme is only sixteen kilometers away.  So you can arrive at the hotel (provided that a transfer is included in your ticket) in twenty minutes.  Most tourists, when they write reviews about the hardships of the road, mention anything, but not a long transfer from the airport.  Independent travelers should first get by bus to the bus station of the city of Dalaman (Doloman Otogari).  From there to Sarigerme there are regular ‚Äúhawashs‚Äù every fifty minutes.  This word in Turkey refers to intercity buses.  From the city of Ortaj twenty kilometers to Alinn Sarigerme Boutique 5. Fethiye is the largest city in the district, it is located a little further, more than fifty kilometers.  But from there, regular buses also run to Sarigerme every four hours.  Travel time is about two hours.  It should also be said that recently low-cost flights have been flying from Istanbul to Dalaman Airport. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  When to go to Sarigerme </h2><p>  Those who have been on the Anatolian coast of Turkey are probably familiar with the hot and humid summers of the Mediterranean.  However, these climatic conditions do not apply to the province of Ephesus, Fethiye and the surrounding area.  Near Sarigerme two seas merge - the Aegean and the Mediterranean.  And although strictly geographically the resort lies on the shore of the second water area, the climate there is the same as in western Turkey.  A cool breeze from the <span>Aegean Sea</span> blows all summer <span>,</span> softening the tropical heat.  However, the waves sometimes raise serious waves.  If you are not a good swimmer, September is the best time to come to Alinn Sarigerme Boutique.  This month is clear weather, the sea warmed up to a comfortable plus twenty-four degrees.  The air temperature is still summer - 28 heat.  And the abundance of many seasonal fruits - the fruits of a generous fall - will be for you a pleasant additional bonus. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  This hotel was built in two thousand and four.  Alinn Sarigerme Boutique Hotel 5 is a large five-story building surrounded by spacious green lawns and a park.  The total area is impressive - as much as thirty thousand square meters!  This is surprising for a hotel located in the center of the village, and even with the word "Boutique" in the title.  This type of hotel is usually small.  And the last repair gave the building a distant resemblance to a medieval castle.  But unlike a feudal fortress, an elevator will deliver you to the upper floors.  Judging by the reviews, the appearance of the hotel did not disappoint the guests.  Everything looks exactly like in the photographs.  The hotel is located on a hill, so the windows offer stunning views of the mountains or the sea.  The park resembles paradise Eden - there are so many greens and flowers.  It is buried in a tropical garden, which allows guests to relax in the shade during the dizzying summer heat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Services </h2><p>  The Alinn Sarigerme Boutique 5 administration takes care of the comfort of its guests.  You can change the currency to Turkish lira without even leaving the hotel.  You can also order a taxi at the reception.  There is a small shop and a car rental desk in the lobby.  The car can be parked in a guarded parking lot.  I wish you didn‚Äôt need this service, but there is a doctor‚Äôs office on site.  A cozy living room with a plasma TV and a library will allow you to pass the time if you do not want to go anywhere.  Regularly held - by the forces of a few animators - show evenings, live music plays.  On the beach, to which, due to the distance of 800 meters, a free bus runs, there are motorized entertainments - ‚Äúbananas‚Äù, ‚Äúpills‚Äù, and even more extreme forms of water recreation. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Alinn Boutique Hotel Sarigerme has an all-inclusive system.  In addition to the main restaurant, where the service is buffet style, there are two more a la carte options.  In one of them, fish, you can eat for free three times a week by appointment.  In five bars you can get free soft and hot drinks, as well as locally produced alcohol.  And for imported wines and distillates, as well as for freshly squeezed juices, a fee is charged, but this is standard practice in hotels of this type.  Breakfast is ordinary, but very tasty and hearty.  There is tea and coffee, a lot of pastries, yoghurts, granola, pancakes.  Tourists who have visited the hotel write real odes about lunches and dinners.  Grilled dishes are especially delicious.  Everyone thanks the chef of the main restaurant - he cooks very well.  Reviews are advised to give credit to desserts.  They are simply breathtaking there. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Alinn Boutique Hotel Sarigerme is located on the second line from the sea.  Nevertheless, it has its own beach with beige sand.  The infrastructure there is quite developed - there are umbrellas, deck chairs with mattresses.  Only <span>beach towels</span> are issued for a fee, so it is better to grab your own from the room.  The Aegean Sea, in principle, is restless, the waves become small only in September.  The hotel is located on a high bank, and so as not to be difficult to climb, a spa bus carries a free bus every quarter hour.  In low season, the interval between these shuttles may increase.  And on the territory of the hotel itself there are three spacious freshwater pools.  One of them is located indoors, which is very convenient if the weather leaves much to be desired. </p><h2>  Entertainment and SPA </h2><p>  If you want to keep yourself in good shape, then at your service is a gym with the latest fitness equipment.  Here you can pamper yourself for free and absolutely free of charge with a steam bath - a hamam, which Turkey is famous for.  Alinn Sarigerme Boutique offers its guests other spa treatments: Finnish sauna, Russian steam bath, jacuzzi and massage room.  Ladies will certainly appreciate the efforts of a cosmetologist.  Daily <span>water aerobics</span> classes are held in the pool <span>.</span>  There is also a tennis court on site.  In the evenings, discos with show programs are arranged.  Various board games are available, including billiards, tennis. </p>

    <h2>  What to see near Sarigerme </h2><p>  The hotel, of course, specializes in a relaxing holiday, but this does not mean that you need to sit on the beach.  Excursions can be ordered from a representative of your agency who is on duty in the Alinn Sarigerme Boutique 5 lobby. Reviews say that for long excursions - to Ephesus or Pamukkale, for example - the prices at the hotel are not much different from those offered by the agencies on the street.  But small half-day trips at the hotel do not recommend tourists to take reviews - too expensive.  Everyone praises an unforgettable walk along the enchanting Dalyan River, with the entrance to Iztuzu Spit, where the unique Turtle Beach is located.  Those who were there are advised to take a full tour - for the whole day with lunch.  The program also includes catching blue crabs, and watching giant carriage-carriage turtles, swimming in the lake, and wrapping healing mud.  Many tourists also liked the excursion to the Lycian tombs - these evidence of bygone eras, hollowed out in the rocks.  There is a mud clinic in Dalaman.  As for long excursions, experienced tourists recommend a trip to Fethiye - the ancient Telmessos. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The cost of the tour depends on many factors, including the sending party - your operator.  An important role is played by the check-in season at Alinn Sarigerme Boutique 5. So, the prices in September are already lower than in August, and the beginning of autumn is the best time to relax in Turkey.  A week in this boutique hotel, in a standard room, with all-inclusive meals, flights and transfers will cost two tourists a half thousand dollars.  This is in September.  And in August, similar services will cost already 1670-1750 US dollars.  The season does not affect the prices of excursions.  A trip to a mud source - not to a hospital near Dalaman Airport, but to a natural pond - costs ten arbitrary units.  And a blue crab jeep safari is twenty US dollars.  An excursion along the Dalyan River with a stop on Turtle Beach and lunch will cost sixty dollars. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The vast majority of holidaymakers enjoyed their stay at Alinn Sarigerme Boutique.  Reviews say that the rooms are clean, comfortable, all the equipment is working properly.  Linen is changed twice a week.  Vacationers were very pleased with the complete absence of children.  Yes, and Russian tourists in Sarigerme are traditionally few.  They have not yet discovered the joy of complete and, most importantly, quiet, relaxation.  Ninety percent of the hotel is filled with Germans and French.  Although one of the female employees at the reception speaks Russian, so there will be no language barrier.  The only inconvenience that is felt at the Alinn Sarigerme Boutique Hotel, the reviews called the fact that you have to go down to the beach.  Many walked to the sea on foot ‚Äî the road there is very beautiful ‚Äî cacti grow, turtles crawl, and lizards run.  And they came back already by bus.  But swim before breakfast because of this does not work.  But the overview of the surrounding landscapes from the room is simply enchanting.  In the hotels below, on the first line, you will not see this. </p>
