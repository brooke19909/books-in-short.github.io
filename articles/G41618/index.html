  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Edge loop - knitting</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Starting to knitting, beginning needlewomen sometimes encounter a problem - how to finish the row so that the edge of the canvas looks even.  For this purpose, an edge loop is used, the knitting rules of which the article is devoted to. </p><p>  <strong>Sewing an edge loop</strong> </p><p>  Edge is called a loop that opens and closes a row.  This is necessary so that the knitted fabric looks neat, its edges are not deformed and can easily be connected to other parts of the product.  The edge of the fabric is called the vertical edge of knitting.  Depending on how it is framed, a different result is obtained.  For example, if you knit the extreme loops at the beginning and at the end of a row, you get a canvas with a stretching edge.  If the edge is removed at the beginning of the row, and the last knit, then the knitted fabric will not stretch.  The edge loop is either front or back.  The difference is that when knitting the front, the working thread is at work, and the wrong one is before work.  When the loop is removed without knitting, at the beginning of the row, and the last one is tied out from the wrong side, you should always pay attention to the position of the working thread.  She must be behind the knitting needle. </p><p>  <strong>Types of edge loops</strong> </p><p>  They can be varied, their design largely depends on the basic drawing of the product.  The choice of one or another kind of them will depend on whether you want to hide the edge loops with a connecting seam, or will weave them in a tie or plank. </p><p>  For the seam, the next version of the edge loops is suitable - ‚Äúnodular‚Äù.  The first row is knitted with facial loops.  The second row - the edge is removed, the rest are tied with purl, the last loop of the row - the front.  Thus, a nodular edge is obtained when in the wrong rows the side loops are knitted with facial ones.  It turns out that in two rows - only one edge loop.  The ‚Äúnodular‚Äù edge is suitable for a seam called ‚Äúover the edge‚Äù. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To lift the loops in each row, the first loop is removed without knitting.  Next, knit according to rapport.  It turns out that the removed loop will be stretched into 2 rows.  Therefore, the chain is obtained from the loops, which is very clearly visible during their lifting. </p><p>  Edge loops are perfectly suited for processing the open edge: vertical holes for buttons, vests, straps of jackets.  For example, the bar is knitted with a single elastic band, in which button loops are provided.  The edge loop is designed as follows.  In the first row of the front side, remove the first loop, then alternate 1 front and 1 wrong side to the end.  Knit the second row with an elastic band, knit the last one with the front one.  Alternate these two rows until the required height is reached. </p><p>  Sometimes for strips use a pattern called "Confusion", also called reverse gum.  The number of loops must be even.  The first row to knit in the sequence: one wrong side, one front.  Continue to the end of the row.  The second row to start with two <span>wrong loops,</span> then knit alternately the front and the wrong, so knit to the end.  Such an edge is used in the performance of some parts of the product that require double-edging.  Please note that if there is no explanation in the description of the product, then the front loops in the pattern must be removed as front ones, the wrong ones are removed as the wrong ones.  At the beginning of each row, the edge loop with knitting needles is removed as usual, the next one after it is knitted with the front for the front wall.  The penultimate one in the next row is removed untied, and the working thread must always be in front of the loop. </p><p>  For practice, you can make a series of a small number of loops, knit them facial.  The right edge of your knitting is best marked with colored thread.  Now on the right side knit with facial loops, using a double hem.  The usual edge loop fits to the left side. </p>
