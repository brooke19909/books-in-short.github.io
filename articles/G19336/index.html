    <h2>  Where does the desire to get easy money come from? </h2><p>  Perhaps there would be nothing to talk about here, if our nation did not have universal confidence that everyone could win or get wealth.  Recall our children's tales.  Entire generations grow up in stories about goldfish fulfilling all wishes, about godmothers and incredibly lucky Ivan the Fool. </p><p>  A little later, as we grow up, we encounter tougher realities of life, which sound like this: if you don‚Äôt work, you won‚Äôt earn.  But all the same, faith in miracles does not pass, and a person until his death firmly believes that one day a huge pile of money can fall onto him for no reason. </p><p>  This is actively used by fraudsters, creating more and more new and improved mechanisms of deception, based on the person‚Äôs desire to get rich, while doing nothing.  However, there are completely legal ways (even at the state level) to increase your finances.  This is such a popular Forex game today, selling and buying securities, betting on various events.  The question of whether it is realistic to make money on sports betting is very popular today. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The essence of any financial rate </h2><p>  Those who studied at the Physics and Mathematics Department probably remember classes on probability theory.  As you know, any event has two options for future development - it will either happen or not.  Are you interested in how to make money on bets?  The answer here is very simple - you will receive money if you correctly predict the outcome of a certain event.  Lottery, roulette in the casino, all kinds of gambling, as well as games that require great intellectual abilities, such as earning money from selling currencies, are all a game ‚Äúwith the dice in the universe,‚Äù as a famous scientist and physicist told the world about probability theory. </p><h2>  <span>How to make money</span> on sports betting? </h2><p>  Meanwhile, it should be noted that gambling is different.  If, when playing the lottery, you guess numbers purely intuitively, then by betting on the occurrence of a certain event, you connect your brain.  This is called "fundamental analysis." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make money on football betting" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19789/431920.jpg" width="500"></div>

You know that there are two most likely applicants: A and B. Of course, you can bet blindly on one of them (which makes sixty percent of people who put on this event), or you can think about it before <span>making a bet</span> .  For example, one of the candidates, say, A, before the election had the opportunity to raise his pension, and did so.  There are a lot of pensioners in your country, and most of them will support A. Also, this potential president, before the elections, developed the youth sports industry, therefore, a lot of young men will also support him.  Thus, you conducted an analysis and conclude that A is more likely to win the presidential race.  Do you think you have a chance to guess?  Of course, yes, besides, you reinforced your assumption with such reasoning.  But, you see, it may turn out that A was not so long ago seen with a mistress, undermining his authority, and most of the country will support B. You missed an important point in assessing the facts and therefore did not guess. </p><p>  This is precisely the answer to the question: "How to make money on bets?"  Having certain knowledge, you make an assumption about how the event resolves, and either win in the outcome or not. </p>

    <h2>  Is it realistic to win by making sports bets? </h2><p>  It should be noted that for the most part bookmakers do not play political events, but sports.  After all, football, hockey matches, basketball and tennis tournaments, horse races take place daily ... There is no less exciting activity than watching your favorite team compete with an opposing team - you worry, worry and, of course, with some degree of probability you can guess who will win.  Since the advent of the first tournaments, enterprising people immediately realized that you can get a lot of money from gambling fans, promising them a monetary reward in case of a correctly guessed event.  And it‚Äôs completely logical to ask: ‚ÄúHow to make money on sports betting?‚Äù </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The algorithm is the same: you select an event (or several), for example, a football match between England and France.  You know that recently the British have expertly beat all rivals, and the French, by contrast, are not lucky.  And you bet on the victory of England.  You can choose any outcome of such a victory: that England will win, that France will concede a certain number of goals, or you can even take a chance and guess the score of the game.  If you guess correctly, then you will return your money with a percentage. </p>

    <h2>  What is the probability of correctly guessing the outcome of the game? </h2><p>  If you are interested in how to make money on football bets, then it will not be superfluous to watch the movie ‚ÄúMoney for Two‚Äù.  This film just tells the audience about the work of the bookmaker, whose owner is Al Pacino, and McConaughey is a former athlete who is very knowledgeable in sports.  After watching the film to the end, you make two conclusions.  First, the office always wins, and this is the essence of its work.  The second verdict is this: the probability of correctly guessing the outcome is great if you are well versed in the subject of events, but even virtuosos can guess only nine out of ten.  That is why truly entrepreneurial people earn not on bets, but on those who make them - gambling customers. </p><h2>  Who should make sports predictions? </h2><p>  Of course, the greatest probability of guessing the correct outcome of a given match is for people who are passionately watching games.  If you know who is the favorite and who has been losing and losing points recently, if you follow the transfers of players, new contracts, appointments of coaches, then you can qualitatively conduct a fundamental analysis.  There is no likelihood that you will guess ten out of ten events, but it is likely that those same nine are yours. </p><p>  Is it worth it to bet on sports for those who are not interested in sports life at all and do not even know the name of the teams?  We will be honest, you have less chance of winning than people who are passionate.  But you can use the odds that bookmakers give for the victory of a particular team as guidelines, and also very successfully predict the onset of events. </p>

    <h2>  How to make money on football betting </h2><p>  Each bookmaker provides gambling players with a sports line, which indicates the upcoming games for all sports and odds.  As for the latter, this is a figure showing the ratio of the bookmaker office to the probability of the outcome of events.  For example, football team A has a coefficient of 1.2, that is, very small, and teams B have 6. What does this mean and who should it be put on?  These figures are deciphered as follows: the bookmaker believes that team A has a rather high chance of winning.  This is calculated from fundamental analysis, news, forecasts and general expectations.  To find out how much you will win, multiply the bet by the odds. </p><p>  By betting $ 10, in case of a win you will be able to pick up $ 12, a pure fat - $ 2.  The bookmaker is very doubtful that team B will win, so he promises you to multiply your bet by 6 if you win. Such a high coefficient means that the bookmaker is almost sure of the defeat of team B, otherwise why would he promise you $ 60 if set 10?  But everything happens in life, and you can bet on team B if you have any information that gives a chance of winning. </p>

    <h2>  Sports event guessing winning algorithm </h2><p>  To make sure from your own experience how to make money on sports betting, try different methods and options of the game.  Most experienced players recommend this action plan to succeed: </p><ol><li>  Choose a good match.  This in no case should be the game of your favorite team, because in this case you will be biased and will not be able to soberly assess the chances of winning. </li><li>  Bet on the team for which the office gives the lowest coefficient (on average, this value should not exceed 1.5).  The lower the odds, the higher the chances of winning.  The bookmaker should give a very high coefficient to the second command, for example, its value should be in the region of 3, but the more, the better for you. </li><li>  Do not bet if rule number two is not followed, as you are more at risk of losing. </li></ol><p>  This is very easy to explain logically.  For example, there will be a game of a clear favorite and a team in the victory of which few people believe.  The bookmaker offers you to predict the outcome of the match.  But, since she is confident enough in the victory of the favorite, she does not offer you big money in case of a win.  She will present a high coefficient for her opponent. </p><h2>  How much can you win by betting on sports? </h2><p>  The answer to this question depends on two components: how well you play and how much you are willing to take risks. </p><p>  If you win often, but are afraid to bet large amounts and make relatively low bets, it is unlikely that the money received will be so serious as to speak of them as serious earnings. </p><p>  But, making high stakes even on teams with small odds, you can get enough profit.  For example, you have 5 thousand dollars in circulation.  By betting this amount on winning a team with a coefficient of 1.5, you will receive $ 7.5 thousand, with a net profit of $ 2.5 thousand.
