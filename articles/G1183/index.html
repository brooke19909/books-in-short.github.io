Therefore, it is so important to choose the right vacation spot. </p><p>  We will help you decide when it is better to relax in the Dominican Republic, at what time, where exactly and what you should see when visiting the island. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prestige-limousine-service.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic beach" class="if uuid-2570564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2570564.jpg"></div><h2>  Description and weather features of the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  <span>The Dominican Republic</span> occupies 2/3 of the eastern part of the <span>island of Haiti.</span>  The capital is the city of Santo Domingo.  The country is washed by the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.  The island has a tropical climate. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="18.960797101516487" data-lng="-70.472470859375" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="7"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/7/8/1/4781.png"></div><p>  The vast majority of the population speaks Spanish.  In connection with the active development of tourism, the population and service personnel of the country are fluent in English. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Hot weather allows tourists to relax in the Dominican Republic at any time of the year.  The coldest month is January: during this period the temperature drops to + 24 ¬∞ C.  Summer lasts from May to October.  The temperature rises to + 31 ¬∞ C.  During this period, the island is abundant tropical downpours, storms raging.  In this regard, there is a decrease in the number of vacationers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prestige-limousine-service.com" data-author=": Dmitriy Moiseenko, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic" class="if uuid-2572715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14550/2572715.jpg"></div><p>  Daredevils, deciding to go on vacation in the summer season, expects a pleasant bonus.  The price of air tickets is much lower than in winter and spring.  March and April are considered the most favorable months for a vacation in the Dominican Republic. </p><h2>  Good time to relax </h2><p>  When is the best time to go to rest in the Dominican Republic?  The most unfortunate season for traveling to the Dominican Republic is summer.  During this period, it is not recommended to go to rest for people with cardiovascular and other serious diseases.  The climate is very hot, heavy torrential rains and storms raging constantly.  But if you still decide to go on vacation in the summer, then choose the south coast.  In this area, bad weather throughout the season may not bother you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.elheraldo.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hurricane in the Dominican Republic" class="if uuid-2570624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2570624.jpg"></div><p>  The best season when it is better to go to rest in the Dominican Republic is winter and spring.  In winter, the island is warm, but the sun does not bake as much as in summer, and there is practically no rain.  However, if you still prefer a hotter climate, you should go on vacation in the spring.  Air temperature begins to rise, but does not reach a critical point. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.minube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach in the Dominican Republic" class="if uuid-2570616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2570616.jpg"></div><p>  February attracts tourists not only for its pleasant climate, but also for its rich events.  At the beginning of the month, a carnival begins in the capital.  The holiday is very cheerful, noisy, colorful.  It lasts about a week.  Almost all tourists are going to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pond5.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Carnival in the Dominican Republic" class="if uuid-2570649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2570649.jpg"></div><p>  And at the end of the month, February 27, Dominicans celebrate Independence Day.  It is held in the same way as Victory Day.  Ships and air force equipment take part in the show. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.huffingtonpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Independence Day Holiday" class="if uuid-2570650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2570650.jpg"></div><p>  In any case, protect yourself from unpleasant surprises - check the weather forecast in the country before departure and, depending on the results, choose the period when it is better to go on vacation to the Dominican Republic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Another important and unusual event that attracts crowds of tourists is the humpback whale season.  From January to March, these mammals have a mating period.  In this regard, they are very close to the coast.  For tourists organize special safe excursions, during which you can see huge beautiful whales at arm's length.  Vacationers will be interested to see the mating dances of mammals and their singing.  In January, you can watch pair shows, but in February there are whole families of whales. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wildernesstravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Humpback whale season" class="if uuid-2570679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2570679.jpg"></div><h2>  Where better to go to rest in the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  For tourists going on vacation, it is very important to choose the right place to stay, whether it is a <span>hotel, hotel</span> or resort.  To do this, you need to decide what exactly you will do on vacation.  If you plan most of the time to bask in the sun and swim in the ocean, choose a boarding house on the first line.  Then you do not have to go far, all the pleasures will be at hand.  If the vacation is supposed to be active, you should settle where they offer a large abundance of excursions and various trips. </p><div class="photo" data-original="flights.united.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bungalow in Punta Cana" class="if uuid-2570685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2570685.jpg"></div><p>  Do not worry if you do not know where to go to rest in the Dominican Republic.  The country is relatively small, so during the holidays you can go around many interesting places. </p><p>  In order to enjoy the country's architectural heritage, monuments and museums, choose the cities of Santo Domingo, Boca Chica, Santiago, Puerto Plata and La Vega.  Here all year round everyone is offered a variety of interesting excursions.  And bright events, such as holidays and carnivals, you definitely will not miss if you stay in the city.  You can visit shopping centers, relax and have fun in nightclubs, casinos, restaurants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="darkroom.baltimoresun.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Carnival in the Dominican Republic" class="if uuid-2570706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2570706.jpg"></div><p>  The most elite and expensive resort is Cap Cana.  The coastline stretched for 8 km.  You will find most of the five-star hotels in this resort area.  The complex has yacht clubs and golf courses, spas and fitness centers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trailfinders.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cap Cana Resort" class="if uuid-2570717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2570717.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach holidays in the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  If you cannot decide when and where to go for a beach holiday in the Dominican Republic, consider the east coast of the island.  This is the perfect place to bask in the sun and enjoy the ocean breeze.  The best resorts are located here.  The coast is characterized by clean white sand, and the rich, diverse underwater world will captivate you with its beauty.  One of the most popular resorts are: Punta Cana, La Romana. </p><p>  Diving enthusiasts will appreciate the island‚Äôs south coast.  Here, in addition to the natural beauties of the underwater world, there are artificially flooded ships, which by their mystery attract the attention of many divers.  Among the most famous resorts located on the south coast are Boca Chica and Juan Dolio. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.passionparadise.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Diving in the Dominican Republic" class="if uuid-2570733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2570733.jpg"></div><h2>  Punta Cana Resort </h2><p>  It is impossible to say exactly when it is better to go on vacation to Punta Cana.  The part of the island on which the resort is located is protected from hurricanes and is the most peaceful.  Therefore, the recreation area receives visitors all year round. </p><p>  Punta Cana is one of the most famous resorts in the Dominican Republic.  The coastline is 100 km long.  Everyone here loves to relax: youth, couples with children, the elderly and the newlyweds.  Resorts are located along the coast.  The beaches are clean, the sand is white and very delicate, chic coconut palms create a magnificent view. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lecardinal-resort.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Punta Cana Resort" class="if uuid-2570765" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2570765.jpg"></div><p>  The Punta Cana Recreation Area stretches along the entire east coast.  Most of the boarding houses operate on an all-inclusive basis, which very often bribes holidaymakers.  The presence of thermal springs, spa centers, massage rooms will additionally help you to relax and get incredible pleasure from your vacation. </p><p>  Passive beach vacations will help diversify interesting <span>excursions, hiking,</span> horseback riding. </p><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  If you have a small child that you want to take with you on vacation, you need to know a few important nuances.  Not all hotels in the Dominican Republic accept visitors with children.  For us it‚Äôs wildness, for them - in the order of things.  The attendants are trying to create an atmosphere of peace and tranquility for vacationers, to protect them from noise, screaming and crying.  Some hotels do things differently: tourists with children are accommodated in a separate block.  Therefore, specify in advance what conditions in your hotel are for those living with kids. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travellady.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacation with children" class="if uuid-2570782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2570782.jpg"></div><p>  Many parents wonder: "When is the best time to go on holiday to the Dominican Republic with a child?"  The most successful period for this is the winter season, when the climate is dry and not very hot.  <span>Nevertheless, do</span> not forget about the risk of getting a sunstroke.  Be sure to take a panama hat for children and a cream that protects from sunlight. </p><p>  Children can be entertained by going on an excursion or on a hike, introducing dolphins, whales and real pink flamingos. </p><h2>  When is the best time to travel to Dominican Republic: traveler reviews </h2><p>  Thanks to the reviews that travelers and tourists leave on the Internet, we know a lot about the country: what it is, what resorts and attractions it has.  And also where and when it is better to go to rest in the Dominican Republic.  Most remain positive impressions.  Tourists appreciate the weather, natural beauty and warm gentle ocean.  We can conclude that every person at least once in his life should be in this heavenly place. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="ZaVzcOt_onU" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaVzcOt_onU" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/4/7/8/0/4780.jpg"></div><p>  Negative reviews are mostly related to the weather.  They are left by the few who spent their holidays on the island during tropical showers and hurricanes.  Another, less significant minus is the service maintenance.  Russian tourists spoiled by Turkish hospitality do not meet the same zeal in the Dominican Republic on the part of attendants.  People here are rather slow.  However, if you come to the resort to relax and take your time, this should not cause you any discomfort.  The hot sun and sandy beach compensate for all the inconvenience. </p><h2>  Sights and excursions </h2><p>  Contrary to popular belief that in the Dominican Republic tourists rest exclusively on the beaches, many spend their holidays here very actively.  For vacationers organize excursions to cities, nature reserves, beautiful lagoons, parks and neighboring islands.  You can get acquainted with the architecture and history of cities, visit museums and ancient temples.  Tourists respond positively to jeep safari tours around the island. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.outbackadventuresdr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Island Safari" class="if uuid-2570750" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2570750.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most interesting sights of the country is the city of Altos de Chavon (otherwise called the city of artists and artisans). </p><p>  You must also visit the cave called Fun Fun.  It will take a long time to get to it, and the path is quite complicated.  Most of the way will have to ride on horses.  However, all these difficulties are worth it to be in this cave.  An unusual creation of nature itself excites the blood. </p><p>  Mountaineering enthusiasts will appreciate Mount Duarte Peak.  This is the highest point on the island.  A strong impression on tourists makes the Museum of the Columbus Lighthouse, located in Santo Domingo.  By cable car you can reach the observation deck on Mount Monte Isabel de Toros.  It offers a beautiful view of the area.  The cost of excursions is different: from 90 to 200 dollars (5600-12500 rubles). </p><p>  Feel free to pack your suitcase and hit the road.  <span>Dominican beaches</span> are waiting for you! </p>
