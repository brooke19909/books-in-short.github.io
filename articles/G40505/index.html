As for food, many say that by this criterion the hotel Bodrum Beach Resort 4 * <span>(Turkey, Bodrum)</span> reaches a five-star level.  Guests are fed several types of meat dishes, salads, vegetables and fruits, sweets, delicious cakes and ice cream.  Real professionals work here. </p><p>  Russian-speaking tourists are settled in a separate part of the hotel.  It is worth considering that the administration practically does not speak Russian, so you should learn a few phrases in English in advance to explain your needs. </p><p>  Reception staff will be grateful if you describe your wishes regarding the room and the view from it.  Otherwise, you may be offered a room with a view of the road or worse on the wall of a neighboring hotel. </p><p>  Hotel Bodrum Beach Resort 4 * (Bodrum) - a haven for Germans, French, Spaniards and Italians.

    <p>  Near the pool, training is held, to which everyone can join.  Such classes are extremely necessary, because after hearty dinners, excess calories quickly accumulate. </p><h2>  Tourist note </h2><p>  The Bodrum Beach Resort 4 * hotel, undoubtedly, deserves attention, but there are some points that should be considered when planning a vacation in Turkey. </p><p>  If a trip to the resort is carried out with the help of a tour operator, then you need to prepare for the fact that you will be accommodated in the "Russian" building.  It has the cheapest rooms.  There may be mold on the walls, and cobwebs, and an unpleasant smell.  And the view from the window leaves much to be desired.  But this is all the flaws of a budget holiday.  Either you have to pay, or endure and enjoy at least such conditions.  This is not the fault of the Bodrum Beach Resort.  The testimonies of the victims suggest that most often this is simply negligent work of tour operators.  They seduce tourists with good prices, but forget to tell about the conditions.  You can fix the error on the spot, but you will have to pay a little extra.  The hotel staff will gladly relocate you to the best room with a chic view.  There are enough of them.  There are even apartments with a living room and kitchen.  Most tourists do not complain, because superior rooms have a completely different service.  They are worth the money. </p><p>  What is famous for the hotel Bodrum Beach Resort 4 * (Bodrum, Gumbet), so it's food.  This indicator can bring the complex to the level of five stars.  Such a variety of dishes is rarely seen even in the most elite hotels.  For example, the five- <span>star Green Beach Resort</span> (Bodrum) cannot boast such a chic service.  It is especially pleasing that you can enjoy delicious ice cream here twice a day.  You don‚Äôt have to spend money on food. </p><p>  As mentioned above, it is better to bypass the zone for the Russians.  Everything here is not as we would like.  And even there is a theft from the staff.  Guests repeatedly complained that they lost money that they did not manage to hide.  Moreover, this can occur directly in front of vacationers.  Turks are still those masters.  But in the part of the hotel intended for Europeans, such cases were not observed.  This is another proof that it is better not to save on living.  Here every day they carefully clean it, but sometimes the staff needs to be reminded of some things, for example, that they need to bring a blanket.  But they are not intentionally forgotten, just the Turks are a little confused by nature, but very friendly. </p><p>  Excursions are best booked on site.  In this case, they will cost several times cheaper than the services of a guide offered by a tour operator. </p><p>  The hotel does not have its own beach, but this is not a problem.  Within walking distance there are many public beaches, you can choose any. </p><p>  Entertainment at the hotel is also available, but compared to the entertainment events that take place in Bodrum itself, they are primitive.  Therefore, in the evening it is better to go to one of the entertainment facilities of the city.  Even in Gumbet itself you can have fun.  No wonder it is called a party place.  Some tour operators may advertise Gumbet as a place for a quiet family vacation for grandmothers and grandchildren, but this is far from the case.  Of the minuses, it can be noted that none of the service staff knows and understands the Russian language.  Also, the hotel itself is too expensive internet.  But on all beaches and in local cafes it is free. </p>

    <p>  Summarizing all the reviews, we can conclude that this hotel is ideal for youth recreation.  There are many clubs, bars and cafes in the area.  The food is excellent.  The only thing is not to save on accommodation.  A terrible room can spoil the whole impression of a vacation.  Grandmothers and grandchildren need to choose other hotels where it‚Äôs calm and quiet.  The tour operator also does not always need to listen, otherwise you can be completely disappointed in the rest, if you do not take everything into your own hands.  Since the hotel does not have Russian speakers, it is imperative to learn several standard phrases in English before the trip, so that you can easily state your needs.  Yes, and at the hotel you can acquire valuable acquaintances, especially if you live in a zone for Europeans. </p>
