  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Phuket waterfalls: photos, reviews, how to get</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are many truly heavenly corners on our planet.  One of them is the island of Phuket in Thailand.  It is famous for its snow-white sandy beaches, exotic cuisine, amazing fruits, polite friendly residents.  Being on an island and not visiting Phuket‚Äôs freshwater falls is simply a crime against yourself.  Moreover, there are several of them, and they do not scare like huge mountains from the waters in America and Africa.  This is not a magnificent sight, but the sweet pleasures that locals and tourists love. </p><h2>  Little information about the island </h2><p>  Phuket is located west of Thailand and is washed by the Andaman Sea.  It is connected to the country by a bridge.  Mostly Buddhists live here, although there are also Muslims and representatives of the Chinese community.  Residents receive income by serving tourists.  However, prices are quite acceptable by Russian standards. </p><p>  In a cafe on the street, lunch or dinner will cost about four hundred rubles.  In networked international cafes - twice as much. </p><p>  The cheapest vehicle is tuk-tuk (tricycle or motorcycle).  Several quarters on it will cost 15 rubles.  Air-conditioned taxis are about 16-17 times more expensive. </p><p>  The island can be reached directly by charter flights or with a stop in Bangkok.  From the capital, you can fly to Phuket by plane, take the bus, which has 4 comfort classes, or take a taxi.  It will be a very scenic route along an interesting road, and it will take nine hours.  With children or the elderly, such a trip is very convenient. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What time of the year is better to visit Phuket </h2><p>  The climate on the island is monsoon.  During our winter and spring (December - May) they are hot and there is no rain.  Prices have been raised at this time.  Heavy rains fall in summer and autumn, and the cost of the trip falls.  Many Russians use this and go to Phuket precisely in the rainy season.  They win not only in monetary terms.  At this time, it is best to visit Phuket's waterfalls, which feed on fresh rainwater.  And our people carry the rains calmly.  One of the tourists spoke about them like this: "Ten to twenty minutes of rain, and then the sun."  Locals experience the hottest time of the year not on the beaches, but on the shady waterfalls of Phuket.  It‚Äôs so nice to swim in them! </p><h2>  How many waterfalls on the island </h2><p>  All waterfalls are in forests.  They are very pleased to merge with the world of exotic nature and separate from the noise of resort places.  There are five of them: Ton Sai, Bang Pe, Ton Pray, Kathu, Ao Yon.  But mostly three or four are popular.  The last of the Russian tourists mentioned for some reason is not often visited, although foreigners visit it and take photos of Phuket's waterfalls.  There he is, Ao Yon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.phuket101.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ao Yon Waterfall" class="if uuid-2259741" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/2259741.jpg"></div><p>  It is located near Cape Panwa near the beach, from which a small path leads to it.  The path is not very simple and runs through dense thickets, fallen tree trunks, large roots and stones, but it does have several pools in which it is pleasant to splash around.  The picturesque area and silence have a rest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bang pe </h2><p>  It is to him that Thais and all travelers most often come, although it is located outside the tourist zone in the national park. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftnhome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bang Pae Waterfall" class="if uuid-2259751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/2259751.jpg"></div><p>  There are many snakes that often attack people.  Be careful!  From a sheer cliff, whose height is approximately equal to a 4-storey building, water falls in a stormy stream.  Below, she formed a pool in which everyone bathes.  How to get to Phuket Bang Pae and Ton Sai Waterfalls? </p><p>  The first road leads to the airport. </p><p>  Then you need to make a right turn at the Heroin Monument and drive another 9 km.  Then you need to follow the signs, and they will lead directly to Bang Pae.  Entrance to it is paid, and the ticket must be saved.  On it, at no extra charge, you can visit the Ton Sai Waterfall, which is located in the Khao Phra Teo National Reserve, for the same day.  Between them there is a road leading through the jungle, about 8 km long, but it is not recommended to use it.  The primates that live there are very unfriendly. </p><h2>  Ton Sai </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.phuket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ton Sai Waterfall" class="if uuid-2259769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/2259769.jpg"></div><p>  Having passed along the road to the airport and the ring with the monument, you must continue straight ahead to the police station.  Turn right near it and a direct road leads to a waterfall.  At this Phuket waterfall, water does not spill widely, but flows in a narrow, picturesque stream.  Below is an artificial pond that you want to plunge into after a hot road.  Sai Tone is best visited during the rainy season when it is full.  In the dry season, a small stream remains from it.  Around are arranged walk paths, around which ancient trees grow, and exotic birds sing their songs.  On the territory there is a small restaurant where you can eat, a small playground for children, an information center.  It orders excursions around the waterfall. </p><h2>  Tone Pry </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.phuket101.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ton Pray Waterfall" class="if uuid-2259782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/2259782.jpg"></div><p>  In the Thai Muang nature reserve on the outskirts of the island, there is another very small Phuket waterfall.  Its height is 25 meters.  Water flows from a gentle slope with a wide "river", which during a drought turns into a narrow stream.  This place is worth visiting, because the tourist will meet real jungle with bamboo, mangoes, palm trees and other unknown plants, as well as many elegant birds and reptiles.  A guide here is required. </p><p>  To get to Ton Pray follows from the bridge that connects the mainland and the island, you should go to the city of Tai Muang, then cross it and go to Ranong.  After 6 km, a sign will appear with a left turn, which will lead after 3-4 km to the Ton Pray waterfall. </p><h2>  Very popular place </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.knowphuket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kathu Waterfall" class="if uuid-2259797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/2259797.jpg"></div><p>  Kathu waterfall in Phuket is loved by so many.  It is small and low (130 m), but conveniently located on the road from Phuket to Patong.  Admission is free.  Kathu is very beautiful, has three amazing cascades.  The most picturesque is the second.  A convenient stone staircase with arbors and benches is laid through the jungle to it.  Huge tropical butterflies flutter around.  The waterfall is located in the village of Kathu near the school, and there are always many children on it. </p><h2>  Phuket Waterfalls: Traveler Reviews </h2><p>  First, one point should be noted.  Not every Russian tourist visited all the waterfalls of Phuket.  Most chose one or the other and were limited to this.  Since it is easiest to get to Katu, various reviews were left about him.  Someone was interested, someone was upset that the waterfall did not make a vivid impression, just a trickle, and the water in the bowls was cloudy.  Bang Bae Waterfall also left a different impression.  Someone writes that this is sheer delight, and swimming is a pleasure.  For some, the water seemed too cold, someone dismissively called it a small swamp.  In general, we can conclude that, how many people, then so many opinions.  And you can make your own only by going to Phuket and seeing the waterfalls. </p>
