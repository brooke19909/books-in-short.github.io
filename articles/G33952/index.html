Very often, tourists who want to visit Moscow stop here.  However, Reutov himself is considered no less interesting and beautiful.  The sights of the city attract many people. </p><h2>  Reutov's story </h2><p>  Initially, on the site of the modern city was the village of Reutovo.  The first mention of it is associated with the scribe book of the 16th century.  The origin of the name is shrouded in various legends.  According to one of them, the name Reutov is due to the fact that many years ago the Vladimirsky tract passed through the city, along which exiles were sent to Siberia.  It was here that their mourners supposedly stopped and mourned for their loved ones.  The second version is based on the fact that Moldovan merchants who came from the Reut River once lived here.  Some historians claim that the name is associated with a large number of howler bears that lived in these places.  And finally, the most plausible version says that once there passed the signal line of defense of Moscow with bells, which were called reuts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reutov - attractions" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43989/1446647.jpg" width="500"></div>

However, she did not have a special room, and services were held in the apartment of a residential building.  The mayor of the city undertook the construction of the temple, and within three years, with the participation of the entire population, the Temple of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God was erected.  The main altar is dedicated to the icon, and the relics of the holy martyrs <span>Alexander Smirnov</span> and Fedor Remizov are stored in the walls of the temple. </p><h2>  Church of the Holy Trinity </h2><p>  July 20, 2008 city residents celebrated the patronal feast of the <span>Temple of the Kazan Icon of the</span> Mother of <span>God</span> .  From here, the flock in procession went to the place of construction of the future Church of the Holy Trinity, where the first stone was laid and a cross was installed.  The construction lasted four years, and in 2012 it was consecrated. </p><h2>  Monument to the bell "Reut" </h2><p>  In 2005, during the celebration of the city‚Äôs birthday in Reutov, a monument to the bell ‚ÄúReut‚Äù was unveiled, which symbolizes the emblem of the city.  Historians believe that the name of the place is associated with such bells that were installed many centuries ago on the signal line of defense and notified local residents about the approach of the enemy. </p><h2>  Chapel of St. George </h2><p>  In the center of the city is a memorial complex called "Reutovites who died for the Fatherland."  On the territory of the complex is the Chapel of St. George, built in memory of those who died here in the name of the Motherland. </p><h2>  Start Stadium </h2><p>  The city stadium is deservedly the pride of the locals.  Well-equipped football, volleyball and basketball fields, tennis courts, bicycle and jogging tracks, an excellent gym.  Competitions of international level are often held at the stadium, and Reutov players can engage in their favorite sport under the guidance of experienced tutors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of the city of Reutov, Moscow region" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43989/1446644.jpg" width="333"></div>
