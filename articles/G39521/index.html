And preference is given to overseas territories ... In vain, since native beauty may turn out to be no less exotic and unusual than hot foreign countries. </p><p>  At the same time, you do not need to take painful vaccinations, be afraid to eat fruits and vegetables of an incomprehensible form, and avoid bites of dangerous insects.  For example, the recreation center on Seliger "Seliger swimming" is unlikely to leave indifferent the most satiated with exotic travelers. </p><h2>  Seliger Lake </h2><p>  In the European part of Russia, on the Valdai Upland, a whole system of lakes, known under the general name Seliger, stretches for many kilometers.  This lake "captures" immediately 2 areas - Tver and Novgorod.  There are more than 160 islands of various sizes and shapes on it, some of them contain small ponds.  In general, Lake Seliger has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 260 km <sup>2</sup> , and the shore stretches for more than 500 km. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="seliger swimming" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/1032093.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The coastline of Seliger is known for its ruggedness: there are capes and beautiful bays, surrounded by forests, which are dominated by pines and ate mixed with willows and birches.  The forests around Seliger are more like the world of Russian folk tales.  Most often, pine forests prevail in these places, but you can find oaks, maples, linden, elms and ash. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In accordance with the trees, the local villages take their names: Dubovo, Lipovtsy and others.  Near one of the villages called Zaplavye there is a cozy recreation center "Seligerskoye Zaplavie", reviews of which are so good that these places are not empty either in winter or in summer. </p><p>  The depth of the lake varies from 5 to 24 meters, and 110 water flows ‚Äúfeed‚Äù it, while only one flows out - the Selizharovka river.  The lake, as well as the edge where it is located, has its own story. </p><h2>  History of Lake Seliger </h2><p>  For the first time, the lake is mentioned in chronicles of the 12th century, of which it is known that it was used by Novgorod merchants to access the Volga, which originates on the Valdai Upland.  In those days, he was called Sereger, which in translation from ancient Finnish meant "rugged" or "clean" lake. </p><p>  Long from the time when people settled in these places, the lake was already over 20,000 years old.  Scientists call the cause of its occurrence a glacier.  After the end of the ice age, when the snow melted, the <span>Valdai Upland was formed.</span>  Meltwater filled the indentations between the hills, forming Seliger. </p><p>  The calm waters of the lake, full of fish, and the forests surrounding it, which were full of game, attracted people who began to build settlements in these parts. </p><h2>  "Seliger swimming" </h2><p>  The simple, but nevertheless, attractive beauty of Lake Seliger attracts more and more tourists to these parts every year.  One of the oldest settlements that still ‚Äústores‚Äù Lake Seligerskoye is Zaplavye.  According to the census of 1859, there were 38 yards in it and about 280 people lived.  Its founders are fishermen supplying fish to Ostashkov, from where it was sent to both the capitals of tsarist Russia and its other cities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The inhabitants of the zoo are: </p><ul><li>  Deer that are not found in these forests, but feel great at the base. </li><li>  Guanaco is another representative of the fauna that is not found in these places.  This llama is well adapted to local conditions and is an exotic decoration of the menagerie. </li><li>  The largest representative of mammals in the zoo is maral. </li><li>  The raccoon living here can also be found in local forests.  They are big fans of ‚Äúhunting‚Äù in <span>tourist backpacks</span> and tents. </li><li>  Among the birds, the ostrich occupies the first place, as it certainly does not "live" on the shores of Lake Seliger. </li><li>  Peacocks and pheasants are also not representatives of the local bird kingdom, so the interest in their graceful beauty and beautiful tails is the same as in the ostrich. </li></ul><p>  Together, they create a cute corner of wildlife that guests can visit the camp site. </p><h2>  Holiday home infrastructure </h2><p>  In addition to the restaurant and bar, guests can use the services of the spa and sauna, which received the highest rating from customers, as evidenced by their reviews.

It was founded by <span>Neil Stolobensky,</span> who for a long time lived as a hermit in a cell near the Seremkhi River.  The fame of his holiness began to lead people to him for a blessing, which greatly burdened him, as he sought solitude with God. </p>
