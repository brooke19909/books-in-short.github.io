This is because the market is littered with various models at bargain prices.  However, almost all of them have dubious Chinese quality and obviously will not be able to provide high-quality sound.  High-quality headphones in-channel type should provide impressive sound.  These are the JBL T100.  We will certainly analyze reviews about this product.  But a little later.  In the meantime, let's say a few words about the manufacturer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hipwallpaper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jbl t100 reviews" class="if uuid-3002756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3002756.jpg"></div><h2>  About JBL </h2><p>  This company was founded in 1946 by Mr. Lansing.  He was an outstanding acoustic engineer.  The very first speaker system released under the JBL brand has become very popular.  Since then, companies have been successful.  And all would be fine, but Mr. Lansing was a bad businessman.  He drove a prosperous company into debt and then hanged himself.  The case was inherited by the vice president.  And already with him, the company turned to full.  She released several speakers that have become truly popular.  Then the company was sold to the famous concern "Harman".  But this did not affect the quality of the products.  The JBL brand still exists and pleases users with high-quality speaker systems.  Headphones deserve special mention.  The manufacturer's assets include both professional overhead models and in-ear headphones for everyday use.  A striking representative of the last class is the JBL T100 headphones.  We will review reviews about them later.  In the meantime, let's talk about the scope of delivery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="market.yandex.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jbl t100 headphones reviews" class="if uuid-3002759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3002759.jpg"></div><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  So, consider the scope of delivery.  These headphones are sold in cardboard, opaque packaging.  On the front is the image of the headphones themselves and the company logo.  On the back are some product features.  Inside are the in-ear headphones of the closed type JBL T100, reviews of which we will consider a little later, and a set of interchangeable ear pads.  There is nothing more in the box.  Even the instructions.  It is understandable.  Why instructions for regular headphones?  The delivery set is, of course, Spartan.  But do not forget about the price of the product.  These are budget headphones.  With all the ensuing consequences.  However, we continue to consider the JBL T100 Black.  Feedback on them will be in the following chapters.  In the meantime, turn to the design. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.svyaznoy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jbl t100 black reviews" class="if uuid-3002760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3002760.jpg"></div><h2>  Design and build quality </h2><p>  Headphones are made of high quality plastic and meet their class.  There are several colors: white, black and red.  The wires are pretty tough.  But that is a plus.  In the cold they won‚Äôt get sick.  The plug is gold-plated, which positively affects the sound quality.  In general, the form of these in-ear headphones is very thought out.  They sit perfectly in the ears.  And this can be written in the pros.  Build quality is also at the highest level.  There are no gaps anywhere, the headphones do not crack, even when compressed, they behave appropriately.  In general, designers and designers have worked hard.  Now let's move on to the technical specifications of the JBL T100 Black headphones.  Reviews about them will be considered a little later. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.e-katalog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="headphones jbl t100 black reviews" class="if uuid-3002763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3002763.jpg"></div><h2>  Key Specifications </h2><p>  These in <span>-ear headphones</span> are equipped with a dynamic type emitter with a diameter of 8 millimeters.  Expect something more from the product for such ridiculous money is not worth it.  However, this emitter provides a fairly high sound quality.  The lower bar of the frequency range starts at 20 hertz.  The maximum sampling rate is 22,000 hertz.  This is a great indicator for very budget headphones.  The sensitivity of these in-ear headphones is at a level of 100 dB.  This is a great result.  Their resistance is such that almost any smartphone can swing them, not to mention specialized players.  The length of the wire is 1.2 meters.  The type of plug is 3.5 millimeters.  The connector itself is gold-plated and straight-shaped, which makes its use with a smartphone even more convenient.  Now let's talk about the sound quality in the JBL T100.  Specifications have already been disassembled.  It's time to check them for compliance with real parameters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="5element.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jbl t100 headphones specifications" class="if uuid-3002766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3002766.jpg"></div><h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  So, what can these in-ear headphones offer the average user?  The sound they have is quite peculiar.  The company's engineers clearly focused on low and high frequencies.  As a result, the middle turned out to be a little greased.  In this case, the equalizer will help out well.  Just unscrew the middle a little and remove the tall ones.  And the bass can not be touched at all.  Then the headphones will play.  However, due to the characteristics of the sound, they play reliably only in certain genres.  Electronic music, pop and other simple styles work well.  Fans of instrumental rock, metal, punk, doom and other things will have to fiddle with the equalizer for a long time.  But it's worth it.  If you find the optimal settings, then these headphones will sound no worse than the Sennheiser, which are quite expensive.  Headphones JBL T100 (black and white - no other options are provided) play much better than expected "plugs" of this class.  Now let's move on to user reviews. </p><div class="photo" data-original="technopoint.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jbl t100 headphones black" class="if uuid-3002769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3002769.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive feedback on headphones </h2><p>  Any technique can behave in real conditions not at all as the manufacturer intended.  Actual specifications may vary significantly from those stated.  For this, it is worth studying product reviews.  Only they can give a real picture of how a particular device behaves in real conditions.  What do users say about the white or black JBL T100 headphones?  Reviews are mostly positive, but there are also negative ones.  But we will start with comments with a plus sign.  Almost all owners of these in-ear headphones praise build quality.  And indeed it is.  Assembled "plugs" soundly.  A lot of positive reviews about the sound quality.  Many liked the balance of frequencies.  But these are those who are not picky about the sound.  Also, owners of these in-ear headphones appreciate their reliability.  There are even comments that such "plugs" easily serve 5 years or more.  And that is the perfect truth.  Also, many liked the high-quality wire, which does not dub in the cold, and a gold-plated 3.5 connector.  This is a sign of a quality product, users say.  And they are absolutely right.  However, not everyone shares this enthusiasm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.olx.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jbl t100 headphones black reviews" class="if uuid-3002770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3002770.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative headphone reviews </h2><p>  There were those who criticized the JBL T100.  Reviews of a negative nature are surprisingly constructive.  The headset has problems.  And users mark it.  For example, true connoisseurs of sound say that the headphones sound fundamentally wrong: the middle is failed, low and high are twisted to the maximum.  And indeed it is.  Only a quality equalizer can save the situation.  Also, the owners note that although the wire is of high quality, but at the slightest touch it makes noise in the headphones themselves.  And this is not good.  Another complaint is the direct 3.5 mm connector.  Most users would be happy if it were in the shape of the letter "G".  It is more comfortable.  Another complaint is the lack of a special clip for the wire.  It seems to be a trifle, but more pleasant when the wires do not hang out anywhere.  Negative comments were also awarded to the headphones themselves (more precisely, their design).  The location of the membranes is not round, but oval.  This causes some discomfort when pressing products into the auricle.  The owners also say that with active sports activities, these in-ear headphones fall out of your ears.  However, we will not take this for a drawback, since this problem is characteristic of all the ‚Äúplugs‚Äù. </p><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  So is it worth buying a JBL T100?  User reviews make it clear what it's worth.  These in-ear headphones are made soundly, of the highest quality materials.  They have a relatively good design and excellent sound for devices from their segment.  Also, these "plugs" can completely replace the more expensive models.  For all its shortcomings, the headset is able to please users who are accustomed to mediocre sound.  She is able to open new horizons.  And it‚Äôs worth considering that for the money you can‚Äôt find better headphones. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we disassembled the budget in-ear headphones JBL T100.  User reviews about them suggest that this model has its advantages and disadvantages.  However, the latter are much smaller.  And if we take into account the relatively low price, then there are no drawbacks at all.  For poking around in the teeth of an almost gifted horse is a bad manners.  These in-ear headphones are shown for purchase to those who want to purchase a quality product with good sound at a reasonable price.  In some ways, these headphones will be preferable to more expensive models with steeper features.  JBL engineers clearly knew what they were doing. </p>
