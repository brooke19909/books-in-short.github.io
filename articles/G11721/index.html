Accessories serve to complete the style.  These can be scarves, handbags or hats.  However, jewelry is the most popular in this business.  Today, as in the twentieth century, during the hippies, and in the 90s, chokers are returning to fashion.  These are unobtrusive and elegant jewelry that fit tightly to the neck.  In specialized stores there is a huge selection, but you can also weave a choker on your neck yourself.  Let's see what kind of decoration it is and how to make it with your own hands. </p>

    <h2>  Where did the chokers come from? </h2><p>  Many celebrities today complement their look with chokers.  Because of this, their popularity is growing even more.  But the history of jewelry has been going on for centuries.  The first to wear them were the inhabitants of North America.  Men put on strips of leather around their neck, decorating them with bones, stones, feathers, shells and more.  At first, necklaces played the role of protection against evil spirits.  They were also perceived as amulets and talismans.  Men made them with their own hands. </p><p>  In the <span>Victorian era,</span> jewelry began to be worn at the English court of the lady.  Necklaces were made of jewelry.  Therefore, not all ladies could afford them.  And often they were passed down from generation to generation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The popularity of the chokers rose again in the days of Coco Chanel.  Hippie girls looked at them in a new light.  Then tattoos became fashionable, but not everyone was ready to make them for themselves for life.  So they came up with a stylish accessory that fits tightly to the neck and resembles a tattoo.  Each girl then knew how to weave a choker.  It is not difficult at all, but it looks beautiful and elegant. </p><h2>  What are chokers? </h2><p>  Currently, such jewelry is made from a variety of materials.  These are ribbons, leather, lace, fishing line, wire, plastic and so on.  Not only women picked up this fashion.  Men also loved chokers.  They tie a leather cord around the neck or decorate it with wooden beads, metal parts and so on.  And we will consider how to weave a choker out of fishing line for girls. </p>

    <h2>  Training </h2><p>  Previously, jewelry was made only from dark fishing line.  But today they often use ordinary, as well as bright colors.  However, the most spectacular still looks black thin fishing line.  Before weaving a choker, you need to prepare the following materials: </p><ul><li>  fishing line; </li><li>  office clothespin; </li><li>  hardcover book; </li><li>  pendant, beads or other decorative elements (although you can do without them); </li><li>  lighter. </li></ul><h2>  How to weave a choker: instruction </h2><p>  First measure the girth of the neck.  This will help you orient yourself if you are going to string a pendant in the middle.  But in order not to miscalculate, measure out three meters of fishing line and bend it in half.  If there is a desire to make an ornament of different shades, take two threads. </p><p>  The place of the fold is fixed with a book and a clothespin.  Then put one half of the fishing line on the other, and put the end of the upper one to the side, passing the other end of the fishing line under it.  Tighten the resulting loop, but not tightly, remembering that the pattern should look airy and light. </p><p>  Do the same thing by changing the threads.  And so the choker is done alternately with one or the other end of the fishing line, until it ends or until weave the desired length. </p><p>  In the supposed middle, do not forget to string additional decor, if any. </p><p>  At the end, cut the line if necessary, and then fix it.  This can be done with a special clasp or just snap the ends.  They can also be attached to each other and burn with a lighter.  Then you get a decoration, as in the 90s. </p><p>  Look for clarity in the photo below. </p>
