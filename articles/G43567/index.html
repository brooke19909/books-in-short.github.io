This power is famous for its beautiful nature, magnificent castles and unsurpassed architectural objects.  It is best to explore the <span>sights of Belarus</span> by car, because the only way to enjoy their splendor in full.  All excursions in the state begin with its capital - Minsk.

    <h2>  Dabro request or welcome </h2><p>  Inspection of Minsk begins with its airport or railway station.  It all depends on how exactly you got here.  If you are going to go round the sights of Belarus by car, then start from here anyway. </p><p>  Minsk 2 National Airport is 42 kilometers from the city.  On its territory there is an open-air museum, which presents aircraft of the Soviet Union.  Here are models of such aircraft as Tu-134A, Yak-40 and An-2. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main cultural and architectural object of Minsk is considered to be the railway station and the “Minsk Gate” located on the Railway Station Square.

    <h2>  Conquer Belarus </h2><p>  Let's go further to explore the sights of Belarus by car.  The Khatyn memorial complex, located in the village of the same name, causes both sadness and delight.  The village itself was burned to the ground together with all its inhabitants in March 1943.  Only three people from the village survived - an elderly man and two boys. </p><p>  The authorities of the Soviet Union considered it their duty to perpetuate the memory of the victims of that terrible event and the similar horrors of the war period.  Therefore, in 1969 they opened the Khatyn memorial complex.  It includes a sculpture of a rescued old man from a village who carries a dying child in his arms.  Sculpture conveys tremendous emotional power.  The prototype of the artifact was Joseph Kaminsky, a blacksmith who sought out his dying offspring under a pile of corpses.  Every half minute in “Khatyn” the sound of bells rings, enhancing the effect of what he saw. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Belarus photo" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/610844.jpg" width="600"></div>

Each of them is awarded a separate praise and description.  For example, <span>Golshany Castle</span> is a monument of defensive architecture of the XVI-XVII centuries.  It is located in the village of Golshany and was built by order of Paul Stephen Sapieha in 1610.  Once it was a stately rectangular building with an area of ​​89 meters * 69 meters.  And today it has turned into ruins, which are overgrown with bushes.  The dungeons, where in the old days the history of the country was going on, are covered with earth and are not of special interest.  The east wing and a pair of towers boasts a slightly better condition. </p><p>  Sights of Belarus, especially castles, are of great interest to tourists.  Another fortress can be proud of the state.  This is Borisov Castle.  It was built for a rather long time: from the end of the XII century until the beginning of the XIV century.  The object played a significant strategic role, because under its control was a shipping route that ran from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea.  Little has survived to the present, but Belarus can truly admire such a “hero”. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Belarus castles" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/610848.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lida </h2><p>  This is the name of the city in Belarus.  It is located 160 kilometers from the capital.  Here you can also see some of the sights of Belarus.  It’s best to get around by car.  The village was located on the Lydia River and was founded in 1323.  At one time, it was the largest center in the country.  True, it was a long time ago, but still ... In the XIV century, the great Lithuanian prince Gediminas laid a castle near Lydia.  Around it, a settlement began to form, which soon became a large and powerful city.  The owners of Lida have repeatedly changed, which left an imprint on her culture, architecture and history. </p><h2>  What to see here </h2><p>  Lida (Belarus), whose sights are a monument to Adam Mickiewicz, the Immortality Barrow and other objects, is an ancient city, and therefore there are a lot of interesting things here.  For example, the Gediminas Lida Castle, which is built of gravel and sand on a piece island.  Or the Church of the Immaculate Conception, created at the turn of the past and present centuries.  And here you can visit the monument to <span>Francis Skorina,</span> sundials and other delightful objects. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belarus map with landmarks" class="if" height="206" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/610845.jpg" width="244"></div>

    <h2>  And finally </h2><p>  After admiring the beauties of the country and already leaving it, pay a little more attention to the museum of ancient folk crafts "Dudutki", the path to which the map of Belarus with sights will show.  It used to be a farm type farm.  And now it has turned into a huge tourist complex, on the territory of which there is a forge, a bakery, a menagerie and a mill. </p>
