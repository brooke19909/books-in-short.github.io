    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  So, SunShine Patong (ex. Sunshine Resort Phuket 3 *) is in a very good place.  The second coastline is quite close to the sea, which in itself is a plus.  After all, most tourists come here just to devote all their time to swimming and sunbathing. </p><p>  The next thing to note is transport accessibility.  The airport is also nearby - at a distance of 20-40 kilometers.  This is also a positive point, since many hotels are located very far from the airport - sometimes even more than 100-150 km.  And so it can be reached in about forty minutes. </p><p>  And the hotel complex SunShine Patong (ex. Sunshine Resort Phuket 3 *) is located in a picturesque place called Patong Beach.  Here - an amazing atmosphere, bright, colorful landscapes, lush greenery and very friendly people.  Many tourists who have been here have repeatedly confirmed this fact. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Now a few words need to be said about the cost.  It should be noted right away that the price may vary - depending on the season, on the presence or absence of any special offers and on the tour operator.  But overall there is no significant difference. </p><p>  So, an improved double room with breakfast can cost about 40-50 thousand rubles.  This is the price for 7 nights.  If you book a "deluxe", it will be more expensive - approximately 50-60 tons  and also with breakfast.  “Executive” class apartments also cost about 55-70 thousand rubles. </p><p>  But in fact, it is more profitable to take vouchers right away.  Firstly, many programs work with this hotel.  And a burning tour will be much cheaper than a one-time reservation.  So, for example, a ticket for 10 nights (without breakfast), with a visa, fees, transfer, guide, insurance and airfare included in the price will cost you only 50 thousand rubles.  In general, it is advisable to wait for super offers.  During these periods, you can wait for a very good discount. </p>

The hotel is very pleasant and noble, in addition, it is in an excellent location - there are various cafes, shops, a market and massage parlors nearby.
