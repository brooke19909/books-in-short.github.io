Tulips and roses made of sweets</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What to give a woman on a part of some holiday?  Flowers and chocolates are always considered ideal.  But what if you combine these two gifts into one?  Each girl will be pleasantly surprised by such a surprise when in each bud she finds her favorite sweets.  In addition, making flowers from sweets with your own hands is not difficult.  Let's understand the intricacies of this process. </p><h2>  What sweets to choose </h2><p>  A bouquet of <span>flowers from sweets</span> begins precisely from the latter.  These should be exactly the sweets that the girl prefers.  If you do not know the tastes of the hero of the occasion, choose something expensive and sophisticated.  Sweets such as toffee in such a gift would be inappropriate. </p><p>  It is most convenient to work with sweets in a wrapper with a tail.  It will serve as an excellent place for attaching the cuttings of the future flower.  If there is no tail, you can cheat a little: wrap the candy with a transparent packaging film and form the desired element from it. </p><p>  When working with sweets, remember that these are food products.  For this reason, violating the integrity of the packaging is strongly discouraged.  This will protect the candy from infection by bacteria and parasites, which can cause human disease. </p><p>  Now that we all know about sweets, let's figure out how to make flowers from sweets. </p><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself candy flowers are made from crepe paper.  Therefore, it is important to stock up on it in several shades in the nearest handicraft store.  It is better to choose an expensive and dense material with a tensile coefficient of 110%.  It‚Äôs easier to work with it, and the flowers will turn out to be more refined, and the bouquet itself will turn out to be more durable, which is not so unimportant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also make sure that you have: </p><ul><li>  narrow tape; </li><li>  sewing threads in tone paper; </li><li>  <span>floristic wire</span> ; </li><li>  green or brown tape tape; </li><li>  glue or glue gun; </li><li>  ruler; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  Depending on the shape of the bouquet of flowers from sweets, you may also need: polystyrene foam or a floral oasis, wrapping paper, a basket or other dishes in which you will form your gift.  We will talk about how to make bouquets at the very end of the article, but now we need to figure out how the flowers are made, because without them an effective gift will not work. </p><h2>  We start with the simplest </h2><p>  The simplest flowers from sweets can be made with a minimum amount of cost.  For example, buy lollipops, stick them in polystyrene foam and decorate everything with beautiful wrapping paper.  This option will be a great gift for a teenager, or you can present it as a joke to the main present. </p><p>  You can also take sweets with multi-colored wrappers and form flowers on the wire from them.  Of these, leaves will also turn out.  Insert them into a mug and give the girl such an unusual bouquet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dragee bouquet" class="if uuid-2387696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2387696.jpg"></div><p>  Another option is flowers from dragees or <span>Montpensier lollipops.</span>  Take the wrapping paper and make from it "bags" in which you need to fill our sweets.  We think that it is not necessary to remind that during this work you should have sterile cleanliness on the surface. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Attach these bags with pins down to the wire.  From several of these buds you can form an unusual bouquet that will definitely give a smile to the person to whom it is intended. </p><h2>  Making the core of the buds </h2><p>  This is the basis on which the flower itself will be created later, and it does not matter what it will be: a tulip, a rose, a chamomile or a snowdrop.  Most of them are done in this way.  So how do you start creating flowers from sweets with your own hands?  For beginners, it will be easiest to follow this instruction: </p><ul><li>  Take a candy wrapper with a ponytail and wire. </li><li>  Use adhesive tape to tighten the sweetness to the future handle. </li><li>  Make sure that the wrapper is not damaged, and the candy is firmly seated on its support. </li></ul><p>  Of course, there is a way in which the finished bud is attached to the wire.  But this is a little harder to do.  Therefore, until you gain a certain level of skill, it is better to reel candy before starting work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Make a tulip" class="if uuid-2387700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2387700.jpg"></div><p>  In fairness, it is necessary to mention that there are ways in which the candy is not fixed at all in the flower so that it can be easily removed.  But for this, the bud itself must be sufficiently dense, which also applies to the increased level of complexity of the work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Making crocuses </h2><p>  These are simple crafts that easily turn into flowers from sweets.  On March 8, such bouquets will be a great gift.  And they are created as shown in the photo above and below. </p><p>  First you need to cut a strip of crepe about 15 cm wide across the folds.  Adjust its length depending on the size of the candy itself.  Make 2 cuts on it along the folds of about 10 cm. These will be the basis for creating the petals. </p><p>  Having retreated about 5 cm from the edge of the strip, twist it once and bend it at the torsion point down.  In the place where the knot turned out, gently stretch both layers of the crepe slightly to form a semicircular concave petal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Candy crocus" class="if uuid-2387702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2387702.jpg"></div><p>  We can begin to assemble the flower.  Wrap the candy on the wire with a workpiece, trying to make the petals slightly overlap and almost completely hide the candy on top.  To do this, the paper can be slightly collected at the base. </p><p>  After that, tightly wrap the bud with thread so that it hangs securely on the stalk wire.  Next, make small leaves of green paper and wrap the bottom of the bud with them.  At the last stage, you need to hide the wire with a tape tape.  In this way, make several flowers to make a full bouquet of them.  In the same way, you can create tulips from sweets.  Only the petals should be five.  To do this, divide the desired section of the crepe not into 3 parts, but into 5, and make them a little narrower so that they fit nicely around the candy in one layer. </p><h2>  Another tulip option </h2><p>  Making <span>flowers from sweets</span> is an exciting experience.  There are several different working techniques in it, so that the artificial buds are obtained as real ones.  To make tulips from sweets, you do not need a high level of skill.  A little perseverance is enough. </p><p>  So, for work, we need candy on wire, crepe, scissors and fixing materials. </p><p>  Cut the paper along the fibers into thin strips.  Their width will correspond to the size of the tulip petals.  Cut it into rectangles and round off at one end, giving it the shape of a real petal. </p><p>  In the lower part we stretch the crepe in such a way as to make a round dent.  The edges are not particularly touched.  From such a manipulation, the top of the petal will bend a little inward, and he will find the desired shape. </p><p>  Now we take the candy and one at a time we wind up our blanks.  It is important to remember that the petals should be slightly facing each other.  A dent is where the candy should be.  When the flower is collected, mask the lower ends of the bud with a tape tape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leaf wrapping" class="if uuid-2387688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2387688.jpg"></div><p>  Remember, the tulip has no leaves near the flower.  Therefore, his copy should not have them.  But on the stem, long leaves can be attached.  To do this, cut them in the form of a wedge from green paper, wind them with a thread and mask this place with the same floral ribbon. </p><h2>  Queen of Flowers - Rose </h2><p>  Tulips or crocuses are great gifts, but not every girl likes them, which cannot be said about roses.  From sweets, they also turn out amazing.  It takes only a little effort.  There are several ways to create these flowers.  We will analyze some of them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Simple rose" class="if uuid-2387707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2387707.jpg"></div><p>  Cut a long and wide strip of crepe across the folds of stretching, fold it with an accordion and cut a semicircle on one side to make each part look like a petal.  Thin cuts can be made on two-thirds of the width of the workpiece itself.  So the petals will become more independent. </p><p>  Spread the workpiece and stretch it just above the lower edge to make the petals convex, like a real flower.  Take the candy on the wire and begin to wrap it tightly around the prepared petals, for this you need to pick up the lower edge a little accordion.  Make sure they overlap a bit.  When all the petals are laid, wrap them with thread so that they do not slip down the handle. </p><p>  Now it is time to form the bud itself.  The inner petals need to be pressed a little so that they cover the core.  External ones should be revealed as much as possible.  To form a beautiful curled edge, take a thin knitting needle, a toothpick or a ballpoint pen shaft.  With this tool you need to slightly twist the edges of the petals, like a real rose.  Here is our bud and ready.  It remains only to attach green leaves to it and hide everything with a floral tape. </p><h2>  Tighter bud </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Candy rose" class="if uuid-2387992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2387992.jpg"></div><p>  The rose described above looks beautiful, but its petals create a slightly loose bud due to the fact that putting them on top of each other is still problematic.  Therefore, there is another option that allows you to make roses from sweets. </p><p>  To do this, crepe must be cut into rectangles, each of which will then become a petal.  We round off one of the edges with scissors, and we stretch the workpiece itself, leaving the edges intact. </p><p>  Now we take a candy with a wire and a thread and begin to form a bud.  Each petal is attached individually.  The advantage of this method is that you can choose the most optimal place for each element so that they look as natural as possible. </p><p>  When the flower is fully assembled, the edges of the outer petals can be slightly stretched and twisted.  So he will gain a more natural look.  Dressing the cuttings is the same as in the previous methods: stick leafs under the bud and wrap the stems with floral tape. </p><h2>  Unopened roses </h2><p>  Such buds are also very popular with women because of their lightness and grace.  Therefore, it makes sense to make such <span>flowers from sweets with your own hands.</span>  They can become either part of a bouquet with lush buds, or an independent composition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Unopened bud" class="if uuid-2387999" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2387999.jpg"></div><p>  There are only two petals in such a rose, but they look simply amazing.  Make blanks for them, as in the previous method: crop and stretch individual rectangles. </p><p>  Differences begin only at the stage of flower assembly.  Lay the two blanks on top of each other and wrap the candy in them.  You can make a small shift of the petals, so the bud will turn out more textured. </p><p>  Thread the petals with thread on the handle.  Now the outer edges need to be stretched a little to make the bud half open.  This is a fairly simple way <span>to make flowers from sweets,</span> but the effect of such crafts sometimes surpasses the more complicated options.  They look especially advantageous in huge bouquets, where dozens of flowers count. </p><h2>  The formation of a bouquet </h2><p>  We already have many flowers, but we will not give them a casual armful.  It is necessary to make bright and festive bouquets of them, which girls do not immediately distinguish from real ones.  Here you can already apply your knowledge of floristry and ikebana.  But you can just turn on the fantasy. </p><p>  How to simply pack flowers from <span>sweets with your own hands is</span> shown in the video below. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="1Sr40OgHn6M" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Sr40OgHn6M" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/2/1/6/1/2161.jpg"></div><p>  This option is perfect for not bulky buds like tulips.  You can create such an envelope from any wrapping paper that is at hand or which is sold in flower shops. </p><p>  It is not entirely advisable to give roses in this way, since their lush buds may crumple.  But here they are ideal in order to surprise a girl with a basket of flowers from sweets.  You can buy it at a flower shop or a floristic salon. </p><p>  At the bottom of the basket you need to place a thick foam or oasis.  To do this, they cut it in the shape of the bottom so that it fits tightly and does not flutter under the weight of the future bouquet.  If you use polystyrene, then before its final installation, wrap with green paper so that it does not appear between the colors. </p><p>  Now we take roses and begin to form a bouquet of them.  So that the lower part does not seem empty, you can make a little trick: cut squares of green paper in different shades, fold two pieces together obliquely twice and attach to a toothpick.  This technique will help hide the ugly bottom and add volume to our bouquet. </p><h2>  Invisible gift </h2><p>  It is not necessary to give a vase, a mug or other utensils just like that.  Present them with a bouquet of sweets.  To do this, take the foam and insert it into the dishes.  It will become the basis for the creation of our composition. </p><p>  The lower part can be hidden in the same way as in the previous case, or you can wrap it in a gift box by making a skirt from it at the base of the bouquet.  So the main gift will go unnoticed for a long time, which will be another surprise for its holder. </p><h2>  Additional decor </h2><p>  To make the bouquet look more elegant and rich, in addition to paper flowers, industrial artificial can be used in it.  They perfectly complement the composition.  This is especially true for small flowers, which you can‚Äôt create from a rather rough crepe. </p><p>  You can buy butterflies or birds in flower shops.  They also look quite advantageous against the background of flowers, adding a bouquet of picturesqueness.  Suitable for creating compositions and dried flowers, and rattan spirals, and other elements that florists use in their work. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  In the article, we have provided more than one master class on sweet buds.  Making flowers from sweets with your own hands is not difficult at all.  And you are convinced of this.  For what reason can I give them?  For anyone, but without reason, just to please a friend, sister, mom, girl. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="0IwZxpmxgC8" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IwZxpmxgC8" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/2/1/6/3/2163.jpg"></div><p>  Such bouquets have become so popular that even brides sometimes order them for their weddings.  Their advantages are obvious: they will not fade, do not fly around, the buds can be made of any color to match the outfits and the whole wedding decision. </p><p>  Do not be afraid to try and create.  This will provide you with a lot of pleasure and an abundance of gifts for family and friends for different holidays. </p>
