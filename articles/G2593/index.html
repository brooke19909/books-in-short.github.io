    <p>  In banking practice, payment documents that belong to the third or sixth order are most often found.  In the third place, various payments to <span>extra-budgetary funds</span> and the budget, as well as salaries are paid, and settlements with suppliers are referred to the sixth.  If there is a payment order in the file cabinet, the form of which contains the same priority as several others, they are paid in a calendar sequence. </p><p>  Thus, it is important to correctly issue a payment order, its form must comply with standards.  This will help to avoid problems when making payments. </p>
