    <p>  The dissatisfied part of the customers claims the bank for a high interest rate on the loan.  It begins to accrue at the end of the grace period.  In addition, many customers are unhappy that some basic services, such as a mobile bank and changing a PIN code, are not free.  Not every customer can easily figure out how to use the grace period on the card.  This also leads to negative reviews. </p><p>  The reviews about the Element 120 card from Pochta Bank are too different, so it‚Äôs difficult to give a definite assessment. </p><h2>  How to replenish? </h2><p>  Let's consider how to make basic financial transactions using this credit card.  You can replenish the card, as well as make a minimum payment or pay off debt without a commission, at any of the Bank's ATMs or directly through the cashier at the branches.  In addition, this can be done via the Internet card of any third-party bank.  However, in this case, the commission may be withheld by the bank from whose card the transfer was made. </p><p>  On the Internet you can find a lot of good reviews about ‚ÄúElement 120‚Äù from ‚ÄúPost Bank‚Äù.  How to pay with it for various services and purchases, some respondents also write in detail. </p><h2>  How to cancel a card? </h2><p>  Closing a credit card does not cause difficulties even for those who are using this service for the first time.  To do this, you must submit a written application to any of the bank's branches.  It is also very important to pay off all existing loan debt in full.  The exact amount of the debt will help to calculate the employees of a financial organization. </p>
