    <h2>  New Athos - nature </h2><p>  This wonderful Abkhaz resort is located twenty kilometers from Sukhum.  Those who fly to the city by plane can see the spurs of the Caucasus Range.  They are called the New Athos Mountains, and they look like protrusions, in Abkhazian - anacopes.  Hence the name of this medieval capital. </p><p>  However, the pride of the resort is not only the mountains, but also its nature in general.  The beauty of the landscapes surrounding New Athos is complemented by rich subtropical vegetation.  Quite green hills, on which the resort is located, are lemon, orange, tangerine and even olive groves.  Thick <span>cypress alleys</span> can be found throughout New Athos, and palm trees and laurels, magnolias and oleanders, eucalyptus and even bananas flaunt in its coastal zone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And among all this splendor, a few minutes walk from the seashore, hotels and pensions are located.  <span>New Athos, Abkhazia</span> have changed a lot since Soviet times, today they simply cannot be recognized. </p>

    <p>  The climatic conditions of this very small resort are extremely favorable.  From the north, the town is protected by part of the Caucasus Range.  The average annual temperature of the region varies within fifteen degrees, while the heat is not felt at all due to the presence of constant sea breezes. </p><h2>  New Athos Hotels </h2><p>  Abkhazia is famous for its many hotels.  But there are no very large hotels.  These are mainly compact mini-hotels or guest houses.  Which is not surprising if we recall the political and economic situation in which Abkhazia found itself in connection with the latest events.  New Athos, the price of accommodation in which is not lower than on the Sochi coast, is no exception in this regard.  Nevertheless, it is quite in demand among our tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="New Athos Hotels Abkhazia" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/477267.jpg" width="550"></div>

Judging by the reviews, everyone who stayed in it was satisfied not only with the proposed service, but also with the location and food. </p><p>  Other hotels, for example, Anacopia Club, Kumarit, Griffon, etc., offer a fairly high level of service, a lot of entertainment and great beaches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caucasian hospitality" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/477266.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sanatoriums and pensions </h2><p>  Abkhazia is famous for its sanatoriums and rest homes.  There are a lot of them.  Hotels of New Athos and private mini-hotels are mostly located on the first line.  Some have their own beaches.  Mostly they are pebble, with breakwaters.  The arrangement of the beaches is quite modern.  There is a rental of various equipment, umbrellas, sunbeds, deck chairs.  Most of the beaches are closed, therefore they are always kept in an exceptionally clean state. </p><p>  Sanatoria in New Athos, as well as inexpensive private mini-hotels, are distinguished by a quite acceptable level of service, combined with true Caucasian hospitality.  In this resort area there are five large boarding houses: ‚ÄúAt the monastery‚Äù, ‚ÄúNew Athos‚Äù, ‚ÄúAbkhazia‚Äù, ‚ÄúWaterfall‚Äù, etc. All of them offer a variety of water and land entertainments that pleasantly complement the already magnificent vacation, which is famous for New Athos (Abkhazia).  The private sector, where you can cheaply rent a room, is also represented in the resort in a wide variety. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mini Hotel" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/477268.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Private sector </h2><p>  There are no multi-storey buildings in the historic city center.  There are only low private houses.  They are only in the trading part of the resort, separated from the historical district by a long avenue planted with palm trees, cypress trees and an oleander.  This is the main place in the city for the promenade.  There are also many small seaside cafes and restaurants. </p>

    <p>  It is known that in the "high" season in many resort cities it is difficult to find free places in hotels or pensions.  New Athos is no exception.  Abkhazia, whose private sector is very diverse, belongs to the middle price segment.  Many homeowners, whose houses are located by the sea, offer for living both separate or <span>adjacent rooms,</span> as well as entire cottages.  As a rule, they all have a private household, a bath, and air conditioning. </p><h2>  Inexpensive and convenient </h2><p>  Many tourists with average incomes, those who prefer to relax in such a wonderful place as New Athos (Abkhazia), are most satisfied with the private sector.  Some homeowners offer <span>full board</span> accommodation <span>.</span>  In terms of price, it compares favorably with the hotel concept ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhazia New Athos prices" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/477271.jpg" width="524"></div>  For example, renting a room in a house located five minutes from the beach with three full meals, including alcoholic drinks - homemade wine and chacha, will cost about three hundred and fifty rubles a day for each.  At the same time, preschool children are usually not charged for accommodation.  Many private owners in their ads offer inexpensive transfer services.
