  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to use a compass</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Perhaps the most successful <span>invention of the Chinese</span> is a compass, which has been used for many centuries to determine the right path.  How to use the compass, without exception, all sailors, travelers, pilots and even tourists know. </p><p>  Thanks to this device they are <span>guided on the ground.</span>  It should be noted that emit electronic, magnetic and gyrocompasses.  Of course, in the modern world they today have somewhat lost their relevance, since the newest means of orientation are being invented not only on the ground, but also in space. </p><p>  Unfortunately, GPS-navigators help to determine their own location directly in a large metropolis, but in the forest, these devices are completely useless.  Therefore, if you plan to walk in a small front garden, then these funds can be used. </p><p>  And if you plan to hike for a few days in a dense impassable forest, you should still know how to use the compass.  Indeed, unlike similar modern scientific achievements, it was the compasses that have already rendered invaluable service to millions of tourists. </p><p>  On sale today there is an abundance of various models of compasses.  Mostly, they are delivered to us from China, where the craftsmen learned to make such devices that combine high-quality technical specifications with an attractive appearance. </p><p>  But before deciding on a choice, one should not only know how the compass works, but also be able to establish the correctness of its functioning.  So, the principle of its operation is that the <span>permanent magnets of the</span> compass interact with the horizontal line of the <span>magnetic field of</span> our planet. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A freely rotating magnetic arrow around the axis rotates and sets along the lines of force of such a magnetic field.  To check the health of the compass, it is necessary to place it on a fixed horizontal level surface.  After stopping the arrows - record the readings of the device. </p><p>  Then the arrow is required to be taken out of a state of rest.  To do this, just bring a magnet to the compass for just a few seconds.  After this, you should wait until the arrow is again at rest, and, having measured the result, compare it with the previous one. </p><p>  The arrow, when the device is in good working order, will take its initial position.  A similar procedure is required 4-5 times.  In this case, the magnet must be brought to the compass every time from different sides. </p><p>  So, the main thing is to figure out how to use the compass directly on the ground, for example, in the forest.  Initially, before entering the thicket, you should choose a landmark, which you later need to return to.  This object must be necessarily ‚Äúlinear‚Äù. </p><p>  This means that the landmark should have a sufficient length.  So, the road or the river, <span>the power line</span> or a clear cut, and a number of other similar objects will perfectly cope with this role.  In any direction from the reference point, you must move at a right angle. </p><p>  Moving a little in the right direction, you should turn to the landmark with your face so that approximately the return path is perpendicular to the landmark.  Turning the compass, holding it in front of you, is necessary until the arrow clearly coincides with the north-south line. </p><p>  It is important to know how to use the compass so that its readings are as clear as possible.  To do this, keep it as horizontal as possible.  Then the arrow will be able to rotate freely, and at the same time will not touch the base of the device or its glass. </p><p>  An imaginary line must be drawn through the center of the compass in the direction of the return path.  The numbers (degrees) on the edge of the bulb, counted from zero clockwise, indicate the direction to the north.  The figure through which the imaginary line passes will be the azimuth of the reverse movement.  The number on the other side is the direction into the depths of the forest. </p><p>  But those who do not know how to use ordinary compasses, today are increasingly interested in how to use the 3D compass.  It shows the location on the map via the Internet.  This is a fairly functional device that requires minimal settings, and at the same time it will not let you get lost either in a strange city or in the forest. </p>
