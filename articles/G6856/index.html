  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Federal taxes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Taxpayers are usually unhappy with the collection of taxes and are constantly trying to get the government to reduce them.  Therefore, a part of federal taxes, taking into account social psychology and being indirect taxes, is not levied on the property or income of the taxpayer, but is a surcharge on the price of goods or tariffs on services that the manufacturer provides to consumers, for example, <span>value added tax.</span>  By paying federal taxes to the country‚Äôs budget, the seller of goods and services transfers part of their sales revenue.  But in reality, the consumer is the real tax payer, having paid for the product or service the price with indirect tax included. </p><p>  I will list the main composition of federal taxes that are paid in the current year: </p><ul><li>  Value added tax </li><li>  Corporate income tax </li><li>  Individual income tax </li><li>  Capital Gains Tax </li><li>  National tax </li><li>  Customs duty </li><li>  Excise taxes on a number of goods </li></ul><p>  Fees: subsoil use tax, forest, water, environmental tax, federal license <span>fee, fee</span> for the right to use water or animal resources, and others. </p><p>  I will tell you what constitutes a brief description of federal taxes, which are most often charged to the budget.  Value added tax is the difference between the realized value of the goods and the cost of costs allocated to production costs and is paid at the same rate by all enterprises for food and children‚Äôs goods and separately for other goods and services. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Federal taxes such as excise taxes on certain goods have been used for a long time and perform several functions.  Firstly, they replenish the country's budget, and secondly, they limit the consumption of goods that are not good for human health, or are not essential goods.  Such products include alcoholic beverages, beer, cigarettes, delicacies of valuable fish and seafood, fur products, except for children's goods, jewelry, carpets, genuine leather clothes, trucks and cars, items made of high-quality crystal.  Excise taxes on car sales are paid to the federal road fund.  The remaining excise taxes are levied to the state budget on a quarterly basis, except for excise taxes on alcoholic beverages, which are paid within three days after the sale. </p><p>  <span>Corporate income tax</span> does not create social tension, as it is calculated as the difference between the <span>gross income of the</span> enterprise and its material costs, including wages.  Profit tax from casinos is taken up to 90%, from video salons and slot machines -70%, from exchanges and brokerage houses up to 45%, from other enterprises -32%. </p><p>  Foreign trade duties are paid by enterprises that export products.  Russia has established export duties on raw materials, energy, metal, agricultural raw materials and food.  Import duties are levied on imported cars, video equipment and are not paid for books, medical equipment, children's goods and clothing, a number of products and medicines.  Customs duties are paid by both enterprises and citizens of the country. </p><p>  <span>Individual income tax,</span> like other federal taxes, is paid to the state budget.  Individuals fill out a declaration and indicate all their income for the year, including those for the main job, indicate sources of income, accrued and paid income tax.  The declaration is submitted at the place of residence to the tax authorities.  Accrued tax on a progressive scale.  If the total income is not higher than 10 million.  rubles per year, then the rate is taken 12%, and for incomes of more than 50 million rubles per year, the rate increases to 30%. </p><p>  The remaining federal taxes and fees are paid to <span>extrabudgetary funds</span> and are used strictly for their intended purpose.  Fees for the use of minerals, water, forest fees are levied in special funds, which then go on development in these areas. </p>
