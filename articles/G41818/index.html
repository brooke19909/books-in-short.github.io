    <p>  The offer of hotels is formed according to the following principle.  A few days before the start of the tour, those rooms that have not been booked are offered at <span>bargain prices.</span>  They populate those who bought Fortuna.  The benefit is that with regular sales of rooms, the prices for them differ, and according to the Fortune system, the cost for these hotels will be the same.  Consequently, the client always wins, as the price of a tour according to the Fortuna system is lower than the cost of the most economical option for regular accommodation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to the Fortuna Sharm El Sheikh 4 * system, photos and reviews of which we will present to the reader, those tourists who can quickly get out of place and who do not care about the hotel as much as having a budget vacation go on a trip. </p><h2>  Amenities in four-star hotel rooms </h2><p>  Among the mandatory services provided in all four-star hotels are: </p><ul><li>  linen change; </li><li>  housekeeping every day; </li><li>  a room equipped with beds, bedside tables, a table, chairs; </li><li>  air conditioning; </li><li>  TV; </li><li>  telephone. </li></ul><h2>  Prices for tours on the "Fortune" system </h2><p>  The cost of a tour according to the Fortuna system with accommodation in four-star hotels for 7 nights for two adults in the summer of 2015 starts from 34,000 rubles.  According to the Fortuna Sharm El Sheikh <span>4 * system, the hotel rating is</span> based on guest reviews.  We offer reviews and reviews of the most common hotels - Sharm Inn Amarein 4 * and Gardenia Plaza Hotels &amp; Resorts 4 *. </p><h2>  Reviews about the hotel Sharm Inn Amarein 4 * </h2><p>  Despite the same category of hotels provided for check-in according to Fortuna Sharm El Sheikh 4 *, the reviews about the rest are very different.  Someone was lucky with the placement.  For example, the hotel Sharm Inn Amarein 4 * were satisfied with tourists who lived there alone.  Guests were noted silence, friendliness of staff and comfort reigning in the hotel.  The director of the hotel is a very friendly person, helps personally, is interested in whether the guests are satisfied.  A free bus runs from the hotel every day to one of the two beaches, which were marked as clean and well-groomed, in the evenings the bus leaves for the Naama Bay area, where you can go shopping for souvenirs. </p><p>  Tourists noted that the hotel does not reach the European four-star hotel, but in Egypt the level of quality of <span>service of hotel</span> complexes is slightly lower than generally accepted.  Guests staying at Sharm Inn Amarein 4 * noted that the food is served in a very decent quality, every day there are different dishes, several types of fruits at each meal.  Fans of cocktails rejoiced at the delicious drinks served in the hotel bar by the welcoming bartenders. </p><p>  Using taxi services, for 70 rubles (in terms of local currency) you can drive to attractions such as the Old Town, ‚ÄúOne Thousand and One Nights,‚Äù etc. </p><p>  As part of the Fortuna Sharm El Sheikh 4 * system, there are also unflattering reviews about the Amarein hotel.  Someone noticed the presence of cockroaches in hotel rooms, dishonesty of cleaning and shabby furniture.  The water supply did not always work properly, and some tourists were unlucky with hot water - in order to take a shower, they had to wait for the incoming water to heat. </p><p>  In the hotel you can use the Internet connection via Wi-Fi, the signal at the reception is especially good.  There is a bar near the hotel where you can use the free Wi-Fi connection if the hotel has lost a signal.  Of the advantages, tourists noted the picturesque view from the windows of the hotel rooms and the proximity to the airport (the transfer did not bother anyone). </p><h2>  Hotel reviews Gardenia Plaza Hotels &amp; Resorts 4 * </h2>

    <p>  For those who are going to go through the Fortuna Sharm El Sheikh <span>4 * system (Egypt), reviews about the</span> Gardenia Plaza hotel will help to take into account all the pros and cons when checking in.  By and large, tourists noted the hotel's compliance with the declared quality.  Suitcases are taken by mini-cars.  The service staff is friendly and not spoiled.  For those guests who do not like the room in which they are accommodated, the staff offers alternative options.  The interior of the rooms is not new.  There was a lack of soap dishes in the bathroom, a weak drain of water.  Someone was missing cups and glasses in the rooms.  Not a single theft was recorded.  The airport is two kilometers from the hotel, so the noise from airplanes can be some hindrance to sleep. </p><p>  The territory of the hotel complex is large and beautiful, it has a lot of plants, flowers and birds.  Most pools are equipped with <span>water slides.</span>  Very good reviews were left by tourists about nutrition, noting the variety of dishes and their excellent taste, especially Italian pasta, stuffed duck, stew and rice with vegetables.  They do not advise taking sausage - it is soy and tasteless.  Internet is available at the hotel for a fee.  On the beach in the diving center, the first scuba lesson for children is provided for free, after which each lesson costs $ 30. </p><h2>  Are you lucky? </h2><p>  The Fortuna Sharm El Sheikh 4 * system, of course, is not suitable for everyone, it is a ‚Äúroulette‚Äù, and it‚Äôs difficult for everyone, but many tourists say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù and are happy to visit this sunny, hospitable <span>African country</span> many times over. </p>
