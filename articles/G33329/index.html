    <h2>  Main stages </h2><p>  <span>The procedure for authorizing expenses is</span> regulated by budget legislation and other industry regulations.  Validation is carried out as follows: </p><ol><li>  A consolidated budget list is compiled and approved. </li><li>  Budget allocations are approved and communicated to fund managers and recipients.  For them, approved income estimates. </li><li>  The limits of obligations accepted by the recipients of funds are agreed and communicated. </li><li>  Confirmation and reconciliation of fulfillment of obligations is carried out. </li></ol><h2>  Summary painting </h2><p>  Financing of recipients and managers of funds is allowed strictly in accordance with the designations.  They are provided for in the annual budget list with mandatory quarterly distribution. </p><p>  As indicated in article 217 of the BC, the list is the body responsible for the formation of the draft budget (at the appropriate level).  She is approved by the head of the financial structure (for the federal budget - the head of the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, for the regional - the minister of finance of the subject) and sent to the treasury. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The basis for the compilation is the murals formed by the <span>main managers of the funds</span> in accordance with the codes of the economic and functional classification of budget expenditure items with a quarterly breakdown. </p><h2>  Income estimates </h2><p>  The budget institution receives the right to use the funds only after the approval of the document determining their volume, quarterly distribution, and target direction. </p><p>  Income and budget estimates are formed on the basis of notification of appropriations.  It is communicated to the institution by a higher manager. </p><h2>  Changes to the summary list </h2><p>  According to the provisions of the BC, adjustments can be made if: </p><ol><li>  A mode of budget spending reduction has been introduced. </li><li>  Income items are executed in excess of the amounts provided for in the legislation or the decision on the corresponding budget. </li><li>  The principal manager has moved appropriations between recipients. </li></ol><h2>  Limits </h2><p>  The implementation of the treasury system for the implementation of budget items has led to the emergence of new procedures.  In the banking scheme, many of them are absent.  New procedures in the framework of authorization of expenditures are the establishment of limits, the adoption and confirmation of obligations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="budget authorization" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1895836.jpg" width="597"></div>

    <p>  Limits are the basis for financing costs.  They reflect the maximum amount of rights of the recipient to accept financial obligations.  Limits are set based on indicators present in the consolidated list.  At the same time, the forecast of revenues and sources of funds to cover the budget deficit is taken into account. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Treasury through its bodies brings limits to the main managers.  They, in turn, bring them to the recipients. </p><p>  One of the key steps in authorizing costs is control.  Approved limits must be submitted to the relevant treasury body.  He, in turn, provides control over spending. </p><h2>  Acceptance and confirmation of obligations </h2><p>  Acceptance of obligations should be understood as the conclusion by the recipient of funds of agreements with organizations providing him services (performing work for him), within the limits. </p><p>  Confirmation is the verification of compliance of payment documents with limits and approved expenditure estimates.  It is conducted by a body authorized by the Treasury.  The check precedes the debit of the account <span>.</span> </p><p>  <span>Validation of expenses,</span> thus, eliminates the possibility of accepting for financing payments and costs not provided for by the budget or not provided with income and sources of financing the budget deficit. </p><h2>  Accounting </h2><p>  The rules for its maintenance are determined in Sec.  5 hours III of Instruction No. 148 (approved by order of the Ministry of Finance of 30.12.2008).  <span>Accounting for authorization of expenses</span> includes accounting for operations: </p><ul><li>  with limits of obligations; </li><li>  with estimated appointments for profitable activities and commitments made. </li></ul><p>  Accounting is based on the primary documentation established by the financial structure of the corresponding budget.  Accounting is carried out with the reflection of correspondence under the articles of authorization of expenses.  This rule is enshrined in paragraph 239 of the Instructions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cost authorization procedure" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/1897216.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  CWR </h2><p>  In 2015, significant changes occurred in the procedures for authorizing expenses.  This was primarily expressed in the fact that budget execution from this year began to be carried out without the use of KOSGU codes for CWR <span>(expense type codes) of the</span> budget.  These codes are given in Guidelines No. 65n.  They are divided into the following groups: </p><ul><li>  100 - expenses for employee benefits; </li><li>  200 - purchase of services, goods, works for municipal / state needs; </li><li>  300 - social security and other payments to the population; </li><li>  400 - capital investments in immovable objects of municipal / state property; </li><li>  500 - inter-budget transfer operations; </li><li>  700 - municipal / state debt service; </li><li>  800 - other appropriations. </li></ul><h2>  State institutions </h2><p>  The transition to the execution of budget items on the CWR means that the founders of such organizations do not have details of the allocated limits on obligations under the COSGU. </p><p>  In 2016, the provisions of Instruction No. 162n were amended.  The changes primarily affected expense authorization accounts. </p><p>  In accordance with the current version of the Instruction, for most of the 500 accounts, accounting is carried out in the context of the relevant analytical articles.  The latter, in turn, must be approved as part of the financial policy of the institution. </p><h2>  Operation Reflection </h2><p>  When <span>authorizing the expenses of a public institution, the</span> following shall be indicated <span>in transactions</span> on 500 accounts: </p><ul><li>  Accepted obligations.  These include obligations established by legislative (other legal document) to provide funds from the corresponding budget in a financial year.  The amounts are determined on the basis of procurement notices using competitive methods for determining the supplier, placed in the UIS (unified information system), in the amount of the maximum (initial) cost of the contract. </li></ul>

    <p>  In paragraph 312 of Instruction No. 157n, a paragraph is included according to which indicators of obligations of the current period should be re-registered in the year following the reporting year.  An exception is provided for duties performed. </p><h2>  Analytics changes </h2><p>  According to the amendments of paragraph 313 of the above Instructions, the record of obligations posted on authorization accounts is kept in the context of: </p><ul><li>  creditors (their groups), contractors, contractors, sellers / suppliers and other counterparties in respect of whom obligations have been assumed; </li><li>  contracts / contracts; </li><li>  other analytics required by accounting policies. </li></ul><p>  Registration of operations is carried out in the Journal in accordance with the primary documentation approved by the institution. </p><h2>  Application cf.  050200000 </h2><p>  General rules are provided for in Instruction No. 157n, in paragraph 318.
