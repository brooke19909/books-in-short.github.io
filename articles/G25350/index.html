It was invented in China at the beginning of our era, but for a long time it was used only as a filler for fireworks and other entertainment shows.  And only in the Middle Ages did it become an integral part of almost all wars. </p><p>  But at the beginning of the 20th century, it was replaced by other <span>explosives,</span> much stronger, safer and more effective.  And one of them, which is still used today, is trinitrotoluene or TNT.  It is such a widely used and universal substance that the TNT equivalent has become a measure for high-energy events, for example, explosions of other explosives, the effects of meteorites and, of course, nuclear bombs.  This is done for the convenience of calculations, a kind of universal measuring unit has appeared.  But first things first. </p><h2>  Era of the atom </h2>

    <p>  In the early 50s of the last century, the world received a new and monstrous weapon in its strength, based on the decay energy of uranium atoms, and later plutonium. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In simple terms, the first <span>atomic bombs</span> acted according to a rather simple ‚Äúcannon‚Äù principle.  It was then that the need arose for such a method of measuring their explosions as the TNT equivalent.  Two pieces of highly enriched uranium were placed in a hollow ‚Äútube‚Äù opposite each other, and at the right moment the detonation of a chemical explosive pushed them with great force, as a result of which a chain reaction of decay of uranium atoms was launched, accompanied by a huge explosion in power.  For example, the TNT equivalent of nuclear munitions dropped on Hiroshima ranged from 13 to 18 kilotons.  But how is it designated? </p><h2>  Value </h2>

    <p>  On August 6, 1945, the first and, fortunately, the last real use of atomic weapons in military operations took place.  <span>The nuclear explosion</span> in Hiroshima was a terrible tragedy for its inhabitants, because, like any other weapon of mass destruction, it does not distinguish between civilian and military populations.  The explosion almost completely destroyed the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Although from a technical point of view, the design of that bomb was far from perfect.  As a result, of the entire mass of working uranium, only 1% succumbed to fission.  Perhaps it was this factor that made it possible to avoid even greater sacrifices. </p><p>  Many decades later, a nuclear explosion in Hiroshima has been the subject of debate about its necessity and justification in general, since a terrifying number of civilians died, and even more were crippled for life as a result of a powerful flash of light that set fire to buildings and incinerated people . </p><p>  And three days later, a similar fate befell the inhabitants of Nagasaki. </p><p>  There is a misconception that it was precisely these bombings that laid the horses of World War II by US forces.  But this is not so.  They only brought near the imminent end of the exhausted imperial army of Japan, which fought on two fronts against the United States in the Pacific Ocean and the USSR in the Far East. </p><p>  The explosion in TNT equivalent of a bomb inherited by Hiroshima ranged from 13 to 18 thousand tons of TNT (kilotons), and Nagasaki - 21 kilotons. </p><h2>  Peaceful atom </h2>

    <p>  In addition to nuclear weapons, the "curbing" of radioactive substances gave people an almost inexhaustible source of energy in the form of reactors of various designs, ranging from huge steam turbine, supplying electricity to entire cities, ending with compact radioisotope, the so-called RTGs that were widely produced and served for power lighthouses, research and arctic stations.  It is noteworthy that they were engaged in recycling only in our years and were not particularly guarded.  It got to the point that enterprising local residents tried to turn in the RTG for scrap. </p><p>  Fortunately, the atomic war, which was so feared during the confrontation between the USSR and the USA, did not happen.  And nuclear arsenals are, rather, a <span>preventive measure,</span> which restrains countries from mutual destruction or the outbreak of a new world war. </p><h2>  Other substances </h2><p>  TNT equivalent power is also used, not only to indicate a killer next nuclear charge.  It measures the effects of meteorites, explosions of volcanoes and explosions of other chemical explosives.  This measure shows how much a particular substance is stronger or weaker than trinitrotoluene.  For example, the power of gunpowder is 0.55-0.66, ammonal - 0.99, RDX - 1.3-1.6 in TNT equivalent. </p>
