Hormone of love, pleasure and affection</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A man from the point of view of science is a huge ‚Äúfactory‚Äù.  A lot of chemical reactions, millions of <span>electromagnetic waves,</span> voltage of electric fields, a <span>hydraulic pump</span> running smoothly in the chest ... But still, the most important thing for every person‚Äôs life is the ‚Äúworkshop‚Äù, in which the chemical broth of love boils ... </p><p>  Physiologists argue that the ability to love depends directly only on the good and quality work of the <span>human</span> hormonal system <span>.</span>  <span>The physiology of</span> love is this: as soon as a person of the opposite sex approaches us, the hormonal system begins to activate and work in a crazy rhythm.  That is why our body can easily be imagined as a large chemical factory.  So, after all, what hormones are responsible for love? </p><p>  Love Hormone - Phenylethylamine </p><p>  This hormone is produced in the pituitary gland.  It is he who gives an unforgettable feeling of love, activity, emotional satisfaction, accelerating processes throughout the body and reducing the desire to eat and drink.  By the way, this substance also enters the body after eating strawberries and chocolate, this fact was known as far back as the Middle Ages and many seducers used it with pleasure, treating their ladies with these goodies.  Strawberries and strawberries at all times indicated the presence of piquancy in various situations. </p><p>  The hormone of love and pleasure - serotonin </p><p>  This hormone is responsible for the feeling of pleasure in the body.  If during a period of violent love, people experience suffering for one reason or another, then serotonin is not produced enough in the body.  One of the glands in the cerebral cortex is responsible for its production.  One has only to see his beloved or hear his voice, as the cerebral cortex activates the production of serotonin and - the soul will immediately become warmer, and the mood will instantly rise. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Love Hormone - Norepinephrine </p><p>  Perhaps everyone has heard of adrenaline: <span>palms sweat</span> when it is <span>developed,</span> breathing quickens, and the pulse increases.  So, this substance works on the same principle.  In addition, it is this hormone, like a narcotic substance, that can stupefy a lover's head. </p><p>  Hormone of love and obsession - dopamine </p><p>  Dopamine is a hormone of obsession and intense desire.  It is this hormone that increases the tone of the muscles of the body and increases the activity of blood vessels, heart and musculoskeletal system.  Researchers have found that dopamine plays a major role in a person‚Äôs enjoyment and satisfaction.  Moreover, dopamine is involved in the process of cognition and is produced by the brain in moments of pleasure and novelty.  In other words, this hormone provides a person with a desire to receive what he needs according to basic natural laws, brings pleasure, a feeling of bliss and happiness to a person‚Äôs life. </p><p>  Hormone of love and satisfaction - endorphin </p><p>  Endorphin is a hormone of satisfaction and peace.  It is released upon close contact with the object of love, brings a pair of feelings of security and well-being.  It is believed that the greater the amount of this hormone in the human body is produced, the happier their owner.  I would also like to note that a sufficient amount of the produced hormone makes a person also strong, purposeful and energetic.  Therefore, if there is a apathetic, gloomy person in the circle of your friends, you should not judge him strictly.  Just in his body there are few endorphins that could help him feel all the joys and delights of life. </p><p>  The production of this hormone increases during intensive sports and sex.  A huge amount of endorphins is also reproduced during pregnancy, and the closer the term of labor, the more the ‚Äúhormone of happiness‚Äù appears in the body of a future mother. </p>
