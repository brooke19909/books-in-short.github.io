    <h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  In Goa you can get a real relaxation, because here life is truly serene, no one is in a hurry and enjoys life.  Of course, here you can enjoy the gentle sea, lie on the luxurious white sand beaches and get a wonderful golden tan.

In addition, you can relax here throughout the year, although the worst months to visit the resort are still June, July and August.

The maximum air temperature is 33 degrees, and the minimum is 20-24.  By the way, many hotels, such as The Golden Crown Colva Goa, are great for spending a honeymoon.

    <h2>  North South </h2><p>  As already noted, the southern part <span>of Goa is</span> intended for a respectable vacation.  And this means that tourists of medium and higher income come here.  These are mainly couples with children, businessmen who are on a well-deserved vacation, etc. They are usually accommodated in hotels of category 4 and 5 stars.  Russians most often choose the Quartet, for example, all the same Golden Crown 4 * Colva.  But in the northern part, youth companies prefer to stop.  Therefore, it is considered "party".  Popular hotels here are “kopecks” and “treshki”. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Legend has it that the first European to set foot on the island of Goa was the Portuguese navigator Afonso Albuquerque.  He was amazed at the landscape that opened before him and almost choked.  Following him, the colonialists who arrived on the island decided that Goa should become the capital of Portuguese India.  According to eyewitnesses, buildings of incredible beauty were discovered on the island - the best of those that have been seen during the development of the Indian Ocean.  After that, for about 400 years, Goa was under the oppression of Europeans, which affected its culture, including architecture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  The Golden Crown Colva E was founded in 2004.  The buildings are built in the traditional style of the island.  The last time the hotel was reincarnated in the spring of 2010.  By the way, until 2015 it was called The Golden Palms Hotel and SPA Colva.  The hotel complex consists of five buildings: the main large building, where public areas are located, as well as 4 two-story Anex buildings.  The hotel has a total of 50 comfortable rooms of various categories.  The hotel is intended for those tourists who came to Goa in search of peace and silence, as well as for vivid unforgettable experiences. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  <span>Goa Airport,</span> called Dabolim, is only 20 kilometers from The Golden Crown Colva, and 6 km from the train station.  It is located near the capital of the island, the city of Paranja, in the resort village of Colva.  The most beautiful beaches - Miramar Beach and Caranzal - are just 10 minutes away by car.  The nearest beach is at a distance of 150 meters, if you go through a fishing village, and if to “Boomerang”, then about 500 meters.  If you want to relax in a hotel located on the first beach line, then you better not take a tour in Golden Crown 4 * (India).  Colva Beach is a wonderful resort, but here on the first line there are mainly five-star hotels. </p>

    <h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  In general, the ratings of tourists who visited this hotel are good.  However, there are a few drawbacks.  For example, the view from some rooms is not very pleasant.  The Goa residents, who are calm and non-punctual in many respects, do not want to even put tourists in their reserved rooms even half an hour earlier than they should. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  For guests of the hotel, excursion tours are organized from time to time, and then you and your guide will go to explore the expanses of this amazing country.  Nevertheless, you can also explore the surrounding areas on your own, go shopping and buy gifts for relatives and friends.  The most popular goods that tourists take with them are various spices, the famous Indian tea, and port.  Some shops in the country abound in souvenirs. </p>
