This is the administrative center in the Gornomariysky district (Republic of <span>Mari El).</span>  It is worth noting that Kozmodemyansk, whose attractions are described in this article, is an important cultural center of the region.  Be sure to go there to look at merchant houses with carved wooden elements, museums and much more.  Kozmodemyansk is an old, provincial and leisurely city, but this is where its special atmosphere lies. </p><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  You can get to it by motor ships, which, as a rule, make a stop here.  Also, they first get to Kozmodemyansk by train or plane to Cheboksary, and then continue on the bus. </p><h2>  History of Kozmodemyansk </h2><p>  According to legends, the city bears the name given by Ivan the Terrible himself.  Returning from the campaign, the king wanted to stay on one of the high river banks.  It seemed to him that the site was quite profitable, from the point of view of military strategy.  As a result, it became the location of the fortress, laid before the day of the saints, whose names were Kosma and Damian.  Hence the name of the city.  Later, residents of neighboring provinces settled in the area near the fortress that protected the neighborhood.  The official date when the city was founded is 1583.  During the reign of Peter the Great, timber was brought from Kozmodemyansk for the manufacture of ships.  And already in the 19th century the city had the status of the second largest center of forest trade in the country (while the first occupied Arkhangelsk). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Since the 17th century Kozmodemyansk was a transit site on the Volga.  So, by the beginning of the 20th century, many wealthy merchants lived here, and the city itself flourished, especially when compared with the nearest large settlements.  The situation changed in revolutionary times.  The status of the capital in the Mari autonomous region passed to Tsarevokokshaysk.  Kozmodemyansk got the fate of an ordinary district center. </p><h2>  Kozmodemyanskiy museum complex </h2><p>  Arriving in the city, you should definitely visit the museum of merchant life, where you can look at the interior items of bygone times, feel the unique atmosphere of the old city.  Guidebooks recommend to go look at the exposition of the Museum of Art and History.  On the ground floor there is a local history department.  There are archaeological exhibits, as well as exhibitions dedicated to the history of the region.  For example, you need to pay attention to the workshop, which will tell you about the first school in the country that produces plucked musical instruments, which opened in the early 20th century in this city.  The museum also offers to see how the objects of the kitchen and, in general, everyday life looked, as well as old weapons and armor.  The second floor will surprise you with beautiful paintings by famous Russian artists (Bryullov, Aivazovsky, Levitan and others). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, Kozmodemyansk is also known for other museums.  Landmarks of the region also include the Ostap Bender Museum.  In addition to him, throughout the city there are references to Ilf and Petrov in the names of shops and stores. </p><p>  Kozmodemyansk is a city on the territory of the Republic of Mari El, which is inhabited by mountain and meadow Mari (representatives of the Finno-Ugric nationality, living mainly in the interfluve of Vetluga and Volga).  Therefore, you can visit the exposition of the most famous museum - Ethnographic.  This is a village with recreated household items and people‚Äôs housing.
