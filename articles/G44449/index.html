It exists in the current coastal shape since 1937 and was formed as a result of the construction of the Pirogovsky hydroelectric complex on <span>the Klyazma river.</span>  This is part of the general hydraulic system of the Moscow Canal, stretching across the territory of Mytishchi and Khimki districts.  The Klyazma reservoir was intended to provide a sustainable water supply for Moscow, as well as to maintain an acceptable water level for navigation in the Moscow River.  In addition, the reservoir has a certain hydropower potential, the water reserve in it ensures the functioning of the Skhodnensky hydroelectric power station and several hydroelectric power plants of local importance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Klyazma reservoir" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/289387.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <p>  Klyazma reservoir.  Recreation and tourism </p><p>  But for many Muscovites and guests of the capital, this reservoir was and remains a popular place for a Sunday holiday in the countryside.  And this is not surprising.  The coast of the Klyazmen reservoir extends over sixteen kilometers, and there is where to stop.  At the time of the creation of this reservoir, in the thirties of the last century, its purpose was purely functional.  But today the Klyazma reservoir has a highly developed infrastructure for tourism and recreation, located along the entire coast.  Some of its objects were formed quite a long time ago and have a rich history.  Of the most famous recreation areas, it should be noted such as Gorki and Khlebnikovo, as well as <span>the Troitskoye recreation center.</span> <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Klyazma reservoir how to get there" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/289386.jpg" width="492"></div>  In the summer, many coastal cafes, restaurants, hotels and other entertainment facilities for adults and children are successfully operating.  There is even a small zoo.  Many yacht clubs and base stations for water sports activities.  In recent years, a number of negative processes associated with the coastal development of cottage villages have been developing more and more actively.  But the running water of an <span>artificial reservoir</span> provides for several decades a good fishing trip on its shores.  Among the many amateur fishermen both from Moscow and from neighboring regions of the near Moscow region, it is Klyazminskoe reservoir that is considered one of the most popular fishing spots.  The pond map allows fishermen to put a lot of ‚Äúfishing spots‚Äù on it, the location of which they prefer not to tell anyone.  Best of all, roach, perch, ruff and bream are caught here.  Equally successful is the use of traditional winter ice fishing in the water area. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Klyazma reservoir map" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/289977.jpg" width="470"></div>

    <p>  Klyazma reservoir.  How to get to it </p><p>  A pond is only five kilometers away from the Moscow Ring Road along the Dmitrov highway.  It is on the MKAD that it is easiest to get here from different areas of Moscow.  The coastline has many convenient access to it along its entire length.  You can turn to the reservoir in many places both from Dmitrovsky and from Ostashkovsky highway.  But you can also take an electric train from the <span>Savyolovsky station</span> to the Khlebnikovo or Vodniki platforms. </p>
