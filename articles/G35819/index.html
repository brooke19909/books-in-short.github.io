    <h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  Before telling you about the Club Med Palmiye 5 * hotel, it should be noted that it has a namesake.  True, similarity is observed only in the name, and the concept, location and number of stars in the complexes are completely different.  It happens that careless tour operators, instead of sending a traveler to a five-star hotel that interests him, arrange tours to Club Med Bodrum Palmiye, which has only three stars.  Therefore, be very careful when purchasing a ticket to agencies.  And be sure to check the travel voucher before setting off on a trip. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  This hotel complex is difficult to describe in two or three words.

After all, after a long break in work, the hotel complex has not yet fully entered the usual schedule. </p><p>  The hotel is classified as new.  He received his first guests in the zero years, and reconstruction was carried out in it about eleven years ago.  Until now, guests highly appreciate the condition of the number of rooms and the design of the hotel.  They write in the comments that the hotel is not luxurious, but has some special restrained style, which is very similar to European traditions.  Therefore, many say that relaxing in Club Med Palmiye 5 * is an opportunity to visit European Turkey. </p><p>  The territory of the hotel complex vacationers do not get tired to admire.

    <h2>  Hotel Feature </h2><p>  In their reviews of Club Med Palmiye Kemer 5 *, guests often note that every day it resembles an enchanting holiday.  In the morning the theme is announced, which will be devoted to the whole day.  The territory is decorated in a certain style, animators dress up in the corresponding images, supporting the festive mood of the hotel guests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the restaurant, cooks also try to cook in accordance with the announced theme.  Sushi is served on the Japanese day, pizza and pasta are served on the Italian day, and a country party will be waiting for you on the American day. </p><p>  Such an attitude towards guests reflects the concept of the hotel, because you should not forget that it is a club.  However, when planning to buy a tour to a hotel complex, keep in mind that almost no one speaks Russian here.  The animation is mainly in French, some shows are in English.  Therefore, the main contingent of guests is Europeans and Turks.  Russian guests make up no more than fifteen percent of the total number of vacationers. </p>

    <h2>  Children's clubs </h2><p>  The small Club Med Palmiye guests (Turkey / Kemer) are very important to the hotel.  Therefore, in order to make their leisure time interesting, several children's clubs are organized on the territory.  We could not devote this section of the article to this topic.  According to the latest data, four mini-clubs are available for guests: </p><ul><li>  From four months to two years.  Do you think that it is impossible to have a good rest with the baby?  We assure you that you are mistaken.  If you want to take off the load a bit and relax, then leave the baby in the kids club.  Here all conditions are created for him.  The baby will be fed, breathe fresh air, and they will definitely play educational games with it.  The club is open from nine in the morning until half past five in the evening six days a week. </li><li>  From two to three years.  Believe me, your child will ask you to stay in the club for another hour.  And this is not surprising, because every day he is waiting for master classes, interesting shows, dance programs, and all this is interspersed with meals and a mandatory afternoon nap.  The club opens its doors at nine in the morning and awaits guests until half past five in the evening.  After a short break, he continues to work again - from seven thirty to nine in the evening.  Sunday is a day off. </li><li>  From four to ten years.  Kids will be able to participate in circus programs and culinary master classes.  The schedule is identical to the previous club. </li><li>  The club for children from eleven to seventeen years old works mainly for French children.  Great importance is given to sports and creative activities. </li></ul><p>  Please note that the club must be booked at the reception in advance. </p><h2>  Service for children </h2><p>  Club Med Palmiye (Kemer) has babysitting services.  You will have to pay extra for this service, but parents can be calm for their baby.  With him will remain professionals who are able to entertain, feed and put the child to bed. </p><p>  The hotel has a special room for feeding the baby.  Here you can take advantage of all the cooking appliances for the baby, and guests can also take fruits, juices, mineral water intended for small guests. </p><p>  The restaurant has a special area where there are dishes for children.  If desired, parents can combine some of them and mash using a blender. </p><p>  The hotel has several playgrounds where children can spend time only accompanied by their parents.  Usually the sites are located in the shade of trees, so even in the heat of the day it is very comfortable. </p>

    <h2>  Brief review analysis </h2><p>  First of all, I want to note the disadvantages of the hotel complex, of which there are not so many.  Hotel guests write that tours to the hotel are quite expensive.  On average, a night stay at Club Med Palmiye costs tourists seven thousand rubles.  Not all vacationers can pay this amount, however, our compatriots believe that a hotel stay is worth the money. </p><p>  Also, the minuses include the lack of knowledge by the staff of the Russian language.  This significantly complicates communication with the hotel complex employees and limits the opportunities for recreation. </p><p>  The hotel has a lot of advantages, and vacationers often mention them in their comments.  These include luxurious grounds, excellent cuisine, which allows the hotel to be called a "gourmet paradise", a wide selection of entertainment and helpful staff.  Of course, this list is far from complete, so we suggest you evaluate the hospitality of Club Med Palmiye yourself, having come here on vacation in the next holiday season. </p>
