  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coins of Thailand. History, design features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The uniqueness of Thai coins is hard to overestimate.  Many thousands of collectors around the globe agree to pay a lot of money to get some rare copy from this country.  Coins of Thailand are special in that they are the bearers of the history of their state and eyewitnesses of historical events in the formation of local society and civilization. </p><h2>  The origin of the term "coin" </h2><p>  It should be noted that there are different versions of the origin of the term "coin."  There are several legends in the world, according to which this name was introduced into use in a particular state and under different circumstances.  So, according to one of them, the word "coin" appeared on behalf of Juno Coins, which was worn by one of the wives of the god Jupiter.  The temple, erected in her honor in the Roman Empire, was surrounded by several buildings in which minted means of payment.  Many historians believe that since then metal money has come to be called coins. </p><h2>  Thai coins features </h2><p>  During the historical process, Thai coins were made from various metals and various shapes.  For example, quadrangular and ring-shaped coins were minted.  In addition, other irregular geometric shapes were used.  So, the Thai coin of 1937 was a flattened ring.  To date, Thailand uses coins of five denominations.  These are 25 and 50 satangs, as well as 1, 5 and 10 baht.  This monetary system was legalized by King Chulalongkorn in 1897.  One baht consists of one hundred satangs. </p><h2>  Unique coins of Thailand </h2><p>  Coins of Thailand can tell a lot of interesting things about the history of this amazing country.  On any of them on the obverse is an image of the current King Bhumibol Adulyadejta (Rama IX).  It will be opportune to say that this monarch has been seated on his throne since the distant 1946.  That is, for about 70 years.  This unique ruler is fluent in several foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãand enjoys jazz.  The whole life of the king was subordinated to the rule of his state.  He sacrificed all personal attachments and needs.  As a sign of deep respect and reverence, the Thai people called their king "magical omnipotence."  Of course, not every leader of the state is honored with such an honor, and even during his lifetime.  Coins of Thailand, photos of which can be seen below, are truly unique copies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  On the back of Thai coins may be different images.  So, a portrait of Garuda is applied to the reverse of a number of denominations.  This mythical creature looks very much like a winged chimera.  In addition, she has an eagle's beak and legs and a human body and arms.  According to legend, this bird was the protector of the common people and opposed the snake Nagi.  According to mythological tales, Garuda served the god Vishnu.  Since ancient times, this bird is a symbol of the monarchical family of Thailand and the national emblem of the state. </p>

    <p>  The reverse of some other coins shows the royal boat Supannahong.  This word is translated from <span>Thai</span> as the Golden Swan.  This swimming facility was built for the king to participate in celebrations and ceremonies.  It will be useful to say that in addition to this boat, another 52 rooks took part in the first such event.  Each of them emphasized some important historical event of the past for Thailand.  In addition, on the reverse side of the <span>loose change of</span> Thailand contains an image of various temples. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loose change thailand" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42940/1438714.jpg" width="493"></div>
