One of them, which is obligatory for visiting, will undoubtedly be Belovsky waterfall in Iskitim district.  This place captivates travelers not only with its beauty, but also with its unusualness.  It is amazing that the waterfall is located in a flat area - this is very rare in nature.  On the way to it, tourists can enjoy the magnificent nature of the Novosibirsk region.  On both sides of the road are fields where wheat, rye and even sunflowers grow.  Not everyone will be able to pass by and not arrange a small photo shoot in the middle of such a magnificent view.  Surrounded by a birch forest, Belovsky Falls is a place that is loved by body and soul.  This place is very popular among locals.  It does not leave indifferent travelers who visited it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belovsky waterfall" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1131937.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Waterfall Creation </h2><p>  The waterfall was created in the mid-80s, thanks to the workers of the quarry.  People at that time worked here, mining coal.  And when the groundwater of the local river began to destroy the quarry, the workers decided to leave it and left behind a pile of stones, which was supposed to hold the river.  But after a while the stream broke through the dam, and a clean Belovsky waterfall was formed with a height of about 5 meters.  Thanks to this work, now not only a beautiful and clean ledge appeared, but also a lake that remained on the site of the quarry.  Due to the fact that the latter is fed by several small streams, the liquid level is always high.  The waterfall consists of two branches, the second works harder during floods or after rain.  Although the current is strong enough, the water is still warm, so people can swim.  This beautiful place not only pleases the eye with the beauty of nature, but also allows you to relax from the bustle of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belovsky waterfall in Iskitim district" class="if" height="456" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1131939.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tourists </h2><p>  Visitors often use the waterfall as a natural hydromassage to relax their entire body, and after that you can soak in the water of a small rivulet emerging from it.  This will help to tone up on a hot day.  You can come to the waterfall not only for swimming - there is the opportunity to have a picnic or camp in a birch forest.  Belovsky Falls (Novosibirsk) is a popular place for fishing lovers.  If you move to shallow water, you will notice perches and chebakov.  There will also be a great area for young children who like to play in the water.  It‚Äôs dangerous for kids to be near the raging stream of the waterfall.  The only nuisance for swimming will be small sharp pebbles.  So in order to avoid problems, tourists should be careful, it is recommended to purchase rubber shoes in advance. </p><h2>  Way </h2><p>  A frequent problem of tourists, which constantly arises when traveling to such a beautiful place as Belovsky Falls, is how to get there.  Unfortunately, navigators are not always able to accurately indicate the direction.  So, on the M-52 highway you need to go south.  Having reached the sign to the village of Evsino, you should turn left.  Then drive over the bridge over the railway, and then follow the signs for the road to the village of Belovo.  You can reach the waterfall after the village itself, turning left and driving through a birch forest. </p><p>  If a tourist focuses on maps to get to the waterfall, then it should be noted that the local lake has the official name - Vydriha.  On the way to the mountain, speed should be calculated, since behind the mountain there is a deep unexpected hole.  You can easily get stuck in it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belovsky waterfall how to get there" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1131938.jpg" width="600"></div>

Although huge images indicate that visitors take all the waste with them, many throw it in the forest.  Every year, quite a large number of people are located near the reservoir: those who came with a tent, who with an awning.  There is a backwater in which you can swim.  Taking pictures on the background of the water body will not work right away - there are too many who wish, and many who go on excursions to the area. </p><p>  For fishing enthusiasts (this is especially suitable for those who like to catch rare fish for sporting interest), it should be said that Belovsky Falls is inhabited by such a representative - Siberian grayling.  It can be caught, photographed and released. </p><p>  A few meters from the waterfall on the shore there are many elegant places where you can arrange a small picnic. </p><h2>  Recommendations, pros and cons </h2><p>  In the event that the trip does not last more than 1 day, then it is worth stopping directly near the waterfall in the direction of the birch forest.  Those who stay with the tent for a long time should be parked near the lake.  In this area it is calm and not noisy, there are fewer people.  Broken glass can be on the shores due to uncultured tourists. </p><p>  Belovsky waterfall in the Iskitim region has sharp stones, so when swimming, you should carefully move along the bottom.  If you need firewood, you can use the resources of the forest, but they are not rubber.  It‚Äôs best to buy everything in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belovsky waterfall Novosibirsk" class="if" height="462" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1131940.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Among the pluses, one can note clean air, the waterfall itself can provide a pleasant service - to make a hydromassage.  In the event that there is a boat, then on it you can ride on the lake. </p><p>  The disadvantages of the waterfall are insignificant: noisy, crowded.  The most important minus is the garbage that tourists leave behind. </p>
