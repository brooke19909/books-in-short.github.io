"Corn" (credit card) - conditions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A credit card is an analogue of a bank loan, one of the ways to attract borrowed funds.  It has a lot of advantages: it takes out in a matter of minutes, it lasts 2-3 years.  The client gets access to a revolving credit line, provided that he will repay the debt in a timely manner.  Five years ago, such a means of payment could be issued only at a bank.  Today it is actively offered by large companies and networks.  In this article, you will find out what a "Corn" credit card is. </p><h2>  Essence </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, credit cards are an analogue of a bank loan.  But they are issued for a different purpose.  The main purpose of the cards is to pay for small purchases in the Internet or the store.  If the holder manages to return the funds to the card during the grace period, he will not have to pay interest for the service.  The cost will include only the cost of release and annual use.  Most cards are issued by international payment systems.  You can use them not only in the country of the issuer, but also abroad. </p>

    <p>  Another advantage of credit cards is the <span>grace period</span> .  Most often it is 50-60 days.  This means that if a client withdraws money and manages to return it within the agreed period.  That rate for the use of funds is 0%.  Each bank has its own conditions.  In most cases, the discount applies only to non-cash payments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cards from large companies </h2><p>  Initially, this means of payment was offered only by banks.  But in recent years, large companies have also begun to produce them.  In particular, in Russia, Svyaznoy and the Euroset began to actively offer to issue a Kukuruza credit card.  The release and maintenance of the first is carried out in cooperation with Renaissance Credit.  Issuing cards for the Euroset is a non-bank credit organization.  Customers can choose from several service packages with different limits, service rates and grace periods.  In this case, an application can be made at a bank, company office, or via the Internet. </p>

    <h2>  Corn Credit Card: Svyaznoy Terms </h2><p>  Even if customers have problems with confirming the level of wages, they can still issue a payment instrument.  To compile an application, only a passport is required.  The card is issued by a client aged 24 to 57 years, provided that they have a positive credit history.  An application can also be submitted via the Internet on the Svyaznoy website.  In that case, the card is sent to the client by mail within 1-2 days.  The maximum allowable loan amount is 300 thousand rubles.  In case of repayment of the debt within 55 days, the client will not have to pay a service commission in the amount of 24.9%. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Euroset offer </h2><p>  Customers who make purchases in mobile phone stores can apply for a Corn card.

    <p>  Example: a client paid for goods in a foreign online store on May 1 in the amount of 100 USD.  On that day, the exchange rate was set at 30 rubles for $ 1. The couple will be reserved: 100 * 30 + 2% = 3060 rubles.  Payment confirmation came on May 5th.  On this day, the rate was 30.1 rubles.  So, the account will be debited: 100 * 30.1 = 3010 rubles.  The difference of 3060-3010 = 50 rubles will be unlocked. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  A lot of problems arise with the holders due to the fact that an insignificant “Corn” credit card is issued.  Customer reviews confirm this.  Abroad, not all sellers accept such cards for settlements.  So there may be problems with paying for goods in the store.  But it will be possible to withdraw money from an ATM.  The second drawback is the need to replenish the account only through the communication salon or from other MasterCard cards.  "Corn" from the Euroset can be replenished through QiWi.  Commission for the operation - 2% + 20 rubles. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Credit card "Corn" - a universal payment tool.  With it, you can withdraw cash, pay for goods and at the same time accumulate points.  The card is issued in the stores of Svyaznoy, Euroset, and pharmacies Doctor Stoletov.  The client can independently choose one of several service rates.  Without a commission, funds are credited only through mobile stores or a MasterCard linked through your personal account.  In other cases, the client will have to pay 2-3% of the transfer amount to the intermediary. </p>
