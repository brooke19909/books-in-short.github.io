Sokolnicheskaya line: stations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sokolniki metro line crosses almost all other branches, and therefore is one of the most important city arteries.  It is at its stations that almost all the significant objects of Moscow are located - the main university, Red Square, Gorky Park, etc. What does it mean today, and what will happen to it next? </p><h2>  Construction history </h2><p>  It was the Sokolnicheskaya line that became the so-called breakdown of the pen, when in 1931 it was decided that a new mode of transport should appear in Moscow - the metro.  Soon, a mine was laid on Rusakovskaya Street, and the first train traveled along the site to the Park Kultury station in 1935 - construction was progressing at an accelerated pace.  The length of the path at that time was 11.6 kilometers, and the name until 1990 was the "Kirov-Frunzenskaya Line". </p><p>  In the second half of the 1950s, construction was continued, in 1959 the <span>Leninsky Gory</span> station was opened <span>,</span> located on the Luzhnetsk bridge across the Moscow River.  By 1963, a site was built up to the station, most recently the former terminal - "South-West".  At the same time, <span>"Transfiguration Square"</span> was opened <span>,</span> covering the eastern regions of Moscow. </p>

    <p>  Later, in the 1980s, Cherkizovskaya and Podbelsky Street were built, a new depot was put into operation, which significantly unloaded the entire branch.  In this form, the Sokolnicheskaya line existed almost until today - at the end of 2014 the Troparevo station was opened, which became the new terminal on the southwestern chord. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Current state </h2><p>  Currently, Sokolnicheskaya metro line has 20 stations.  Its total length is more than 28 kilometers.  Two more stations are under construction, their opening is planned for 2016.  In mid-2014, <span>"Podbelsky Street"</span> was renamed to "Rokossovsky Boulevard", which at the end of 2015 is not used to everything, but because the old name is also mentioned on the maps. </p><p>  The average travel time for the entire branch is 40 minutes, daily it receives about a million passengers.  With Sokolnicheskaya, you can directly transfer to 8 other lines, so it is extremely convenient for many Muscovites.  In the future, it is also planned to make an intersection with the Kalinin branch in the Kropotkinskaya area. </p>

    <h2>  "Komsomolskaya" </h2><p>  In general, it is obvious that the first branch was originally built as a transport artery.  Sokolnicheskaya metro line stations are not distinguished by the beauty and grace of the Moscow subway, famous throughout the world.  Only Komsomolskaya can be called curious for tourists, and even then, the station adjacent to it, located on the Koltsevaya branch, is much more attractive in appearance. </p><p>  Nevertheless, it is Komsomolskaya that is a very important transportation hub, because above it there are 3 stations immediately, which host residents of the Moscow Region every morning. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  "Sparrow Hills" </h2><p>  This unique station was opened at the beginning of 1959, but already in 1983 it needed reconstruction due to the fact that during the construction of the Luzhnetsk bridge on which it is located, a number of errors were made.  In the 1960s, the construction began to gradually collapse due to dynamic loads and the desire to reduce the cost of construction.  For almost 20 years, the station has been empty.  The movement was carried out on temporary bridges.  The active phase of reconstruction took place already in the 2000s, and at the end of 2002 the Vorobyovy Gory station reopened its doors for passengers, being actually rebuilt. </p><p>  The station is beautiful in its own way - the designers decided to take advantage of the unique location and made the walls transparent, so that directly from the cars a view of the Moscow River, the Luzhniki Stadium and the park opens.  In addition, along the tracks, outside the line itself, there are pedestrian crossings, and you can observe the movement of trains standing on the bridge. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Sokolnicheskaya line overcomes many kilometers underground.  The stations that lie on it are built under many important metropolitan facilities.  For example, over the Cherkizovskaya, which is rather inconvenient, stands the Lokomotiv stadium, next to Sokolniki, the park of the same name.  As already mentioned, Komsomolskaya with an area of ​​three stations forms an important transport hub, above the Lubyanka there are the Detsky Mir central store and a number of important state institutions.  Okhotny Ryad is located in close proximity to the Kremlin and Red Square - the heart of the capital.  <span>The Lenin Library</span> is located above this station. </p><p>  Near the "Kropotkinskaya" stands the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and nearby stands the Pushkin Museum, and the "golden mile" - Ostozhenka stretches towards the next station.  Near the "Culture Park" is one of the most popular recreational areas in Moscow.  Finally, near the "University" is the country's main university - Moscow State University.  Of course, there are still a lot of interesting and important objects near the stations of the Sokolnicheskaya line, but it is not possible to list them all. </p>

    <h2>  Station closure </h2><p>  From time to time, subway management restricts or completely stops traffic in some areas.  Thus, the partial closure of the Sokolnicheskaya line on the section from Komsomolskaya to Kultury Park took place on Saturday, October 10, 2015, and lasted about a day.  At this time, workers checked and repaired various systems to ensure the rest of the time uninterrupted operation of the subway.  All other stations were operating normally. </p><p>  In addition, according to a special schedule, one of the halls of the Yugo-Zapadnaya station will be closed for repairs from 14 to 15 and from 28 to 29 November.  It is expected that during 2016, a short-term closure of the Sokolnicheskaya Line metro can be made in connection with the commissioning of new stations. </p>

    <h2>  Development prospects </h2><p>  Already in 2016, the Sokolniki branch is expected to be extended by 2 new stations located in the south-west of the capital.  In terms of the <span>development of the metro</span> until 2020, there is a further extension of the section for another 2 hauls.  Basically, the further development of the branch is connected with the construction of the third interchange circuit, which should be involved in the active use of the Cherkizovskaya and Prospect Vernadsky stations. </p><p>  After 2020, it is possible that development will go towards the connection with the Arbat-Pokrovskaya line, so that the backlog left during the construction of the stage from Preobrazhenskaya Square can come in handy to build a full-fledged tunnel to the Shchelkovskaya and further towards Golyanovo and Vostochny village.  This will allow a few to unload the terminal station of the “blue” branch, where many people go in the morning, creating traffic jams at the exits from the district.  Thus, the Sokolnicheskaya line has enough prospects and still remains one of the main transport arteries of the capital. </p>
