How to invest in gold?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Gold has been considered a <span>precious metal for</span> centuries <span>.</span>  It is used not only to create unique jewelry, but also to increase capital.  In many ancient countries, gold coins were used as money.  And the rulers of the most economically developed countries even today prefer to invest in gold.  A simple citizen who has little knowledge of the economy will be able to create his reliable investment portfolio. </p><h2>  Historical facts </h2><p>  The history of the relationship between humanity and gold began many millennia ago.  The exact date of discovery of the precious metal can not be called.  Historians still argue on this topic.  Gold has long been valued for its unique properties.  It is not oxidized and can be stored for a long time.  Some of the gold jewelry that is kept in museums today is more than 2000 years old.  Gold in nature is extremely small, and in order to mine it, considerable financial costs are required. </p>

But the real investment boom began after 2000.  People remembered that precious metal is actually a reliable asset.  Gold never drops in value.  This means that by investing in a precious metal, you can not only save your finances, but also increase them.  Attentive investors who purchased gold in 2000 can sell it at a much higher price today.  Over 10 years, a <span>troy ounce has</span> risen in price by 560%.

    <p>  A huge increase in gold prices was observed in 2011.  Most experts believe that such a leap was created artificially.  Panic and excitement did their job.  Small investors began to buy up precious metal in huge quantities.  By 2014, the global stock of precious metal broke all records.  Today, this figure exceeds 180 thousand tons.  Almost half of all these stocks are jewelry.  Investment savings account for only 23%. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many investors today are in a hurry to invest in gold.  Reviews show that in this way you can really earn.  But it is a long-term financial instrument.  Do not wait for profits in the first few months of investing. </p><h2>  How to invest in gold? </h2><p>  There are several ways to invest in precious metal.  It is possible to purchase gold bullion and coins at the bank, buy original jewelry or antiques, open an anonymized metal account in a financial institution, and start trading on the exchange using the services of a broker. </p>

Investor reviews show that physical contact with a precious metal (when you can see it, hold it in your hands) gives you more confidence in tomorrow.  Although this method of investing cannot be called the most profitable.

    <h2>  Gold bars and coins </h2><p>  For those who do not know how to invest in gold, Sberbank offers to purchase gold bars or coins.  The financial institution has an appropriate license to conduct operations related to precious metals.  Each gold bar has a mark that means specific gravity.  The bank offers gold bullion weighing from 1 gram to 1 kilogram.

It stipulates the cost of the ingot, its weight, as well as the sample.  The precious metal offered by financial institutions is 99% gold.

    <p>  It is also profitable to invest in gold using coins.  They are of two types - investment and collection.  The second type is of historical value and can be used to preserve capital.  <span>Collectible coins</span> are quite expensive.  Evaluation can only be done by a true professional.  It is much easier and faster to purchase investment gold coins. </p><h2>  Jewelry investment </h2><p>  Even those investors who are poorly versed in economics and financial transactions know how to invest in gold.  One has only to buy an original piece of jewelry.  This is the easiest and most affordable way to invest.  It is enough to choose a jewelry and pay it at the cash desk of the store.  There is no need to conclude an agreement, fill out declarations, etc. </p><p>  Investing in jewelry also has a number of disadvantages.  After the product leaves the store counter, it falls in price by 25-35%.  It will be impossible to realize it at primary cost.  In addition, for the manufacture of jewelry almost never use pure gold.  On most products that are presented in domestic jewelry stores, there is the <span>585th test.</span>  This means that the metal contains only 58.5% of gold.  Before you invest in gold of this quality, it is worth considering several times.  Perhaps it makes sense to contact the bank? </p><h2>  <span>Anonymous</span> Bank <span>Accounts</span> </h2><p>  This is a regular account that can be opened at a financial institution.  The only difference is that it stores grams or kilograms of gold, not money.  Many do not know how to invest in gold in a bank and not overpay at the same time.  The fact is that the physical purchase of a precious metal at the time of conclusion of the contract does not occur.  This means that the transaction is not taxed.  Money is simply deposited to a specific account.  At the same time, currency is converted at the selling rate for a certain day. </p>

In this case, the yield will be even higher.  The investor will be able to earn through rising gold prices in the domestic market, as well as receive interest on his contribution.

    <p>  Opening a depersonalized metal bank account has some nuances.  The conclusion of the contract does not require any financial costs.  But if the investor wants to get the <span>deposit</span> amount <span>in gold,</span> some expenses will appear.  First of all, it will be necessary to pay 18% VAT of the deposit amount.  In addition, you will need to double-check the dimension of the ingot.  And this procedure is also not free. </p><h2>  Which investment method is more profitable? </h2><p>  Every novice investor sooner or later asks the question of how to invest money in gold is most profitable.  It all depends on the expected result.  If you just need to save your capital, then the physical purchase of gold is quite suitable.  But here, it is better to give preference to bank bullion and coins.  In this way, money can be saved much longer. </p>

The main risks associated with the storage and maintenance of the precious metal remain with the financial institution.  The investor will receive a guaranteed profit.  It will be much more if you conclude an agreement with the bank for a long time.

    <h2>  Which bank to trust capital? </h2><p>  For those who do not know how to invest in gold, VTB 24, Sberbank, as well as Alfa Bank offer the most favorable conditions.  These financial institutions occupy leading positions in the domestic market.  Sberbank, for example, has been working with depersonalized metal accounts since 2002.  During this time, many investors managed to use the services of a financial institution.  Some even managed to double their capital.  The bank works both with accounts and with physical gold. </p>

These financial institutions have far fewer branches in the country than Sberbank.  But problems, as a rule, do not arise.  Even for small investors, information is provided on how to invest in gold.  Alfa-Bank offers a physical purchase of a precious metal or opening an account from 1 gram.

There is a huge risk of completely losing your capital. </p><h2>  Is it worth investing in gold? </h2><p>  About 50% of all transactions related to gold are made when an economic crisis begins in the state.
