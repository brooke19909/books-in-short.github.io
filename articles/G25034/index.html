When viewed from a narrower point of view, ultraviolet radiation and the visible range of light, which in some cases can be ionizing, do not belong to it.  Microwave and radio-frequency radiation are not ionizing, because their energy is not enough to ionize molecules and atoms. </p><p>  In the modern world, ionizing radiation is widespread.  This is, in fact, radiant energy, which when interacting with the medium forms electric charges with different signs.  It is used for peaceful purposes, for example, for a variety of <span>x-ray machines,</span> accelerator installations.  It is also used in agriculture. </p><p>  In accidents at nuclear power plants, nuclear explosions, and various nuclear transformations, ionizing radiation, which is not perceptible and not visible to human <span>organs of touch,</span> occurs and acts.  Nuclear radiation may be electromagnetic in nature or may represent a rapidly moving stream of elementary particles - protons, alpha and beta particles, neutrons.  When interacting with different materials, they ionize molecules and atoms.  The larger the dose of penetrating radiation will be in power, the stronger the ionization of the medium will be, as well as the duration of exposure and radioactivity of the radiation. </p><p>  On humans and animals, ionizing radiation acts in such a way that it destroys the living cells of the body.  This can lead to various degrees of disease, and in some cases (at high doses) to death.  To understand and study its influence, it is necessary to take into account its main characteristics: ionizing and penetrating ability. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we examine in detail each ionizing radiation separately (alpha, beta, gamma, neutrons), then we can conclude that Alpha has a high ionizing and weak penetrating power.  In this case, clothes can perfectly protect a person.  The most dangerous thing is getting it with water, food and air into a living organism.  Beta has less ionization, but more penetration.  Clothing is not enough here, more serious shelter is needed.  Neutron or <span>Gamma radiation</span> has a very high penetrating ability, the protection should be in the form of <span>radiation</span> protection <span>shelter, a</span> reliable cellar or basement. </p><p>  Consider ionizing <span>radiation,</span> its <span>types</span> and properties.  The most diverse are radioactive, they are formed in connection with the unauthorized <span>radioactive decay of</span> elements of atomic nuclei, with a change in their chemical and physical properties.  Such elements are radioactive.  They can be either natural (for example, radium, thorium, uranium, etc.), or obtained by artificial means. </p><p>  <strong>Ionizing radiation.</strong>  <strong>Kinds</strong> </p><p>  Different species differ from each other in mass, energy and charges.  Each species has its own differences - this is a smaller or greater ionizing and penetrating ability, as well as other features.  The intensity of this radiation is inversely proportional to the square of the distance directly from the energy source.  As the distance increases by several times, its intensity decreases accordingly.  For example, if the distance was doubled, the exposure decreased by four. </p><p>  The presence of radioactive elements can be in liquids and solids, as well as in gases.  Therefore, in addition to its specific properties, ionizing radiation has the same properties as these three physical states.  That is, it can form vapors and aerosols, spread rapidly in the air, pollute the atmosphere, surrounding surfaces, equipment, the skin of workers and their clothing, penetrate <span>the respiratory system,</span> digestive tract, etc. </p>
