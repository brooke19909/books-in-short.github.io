This question cannot be answered in monosyllables.  Indeed, in a small republic several mountain systems rise immediately.  And one of them even gave the name to the peninsula - the Balkans.  Mountain systems in Bulgaria of different tectonic ages.  For example, Stara Planina is older, it is a continuation of the Carpathians.  And the Rhodopes belong to the Alpine-Himalayan belt.  In total, there are thirty-seven mountain ranges in Bulgaria.  But they are distributed unevenly throughout the republic.  Thirty-six ranges lie in southern Bulgaria.  Many tourists regard this Balkan republic exclusively as a <span>beach holiday destination.</span>  But in vain.  Mountain tourism here is very developed and is in great demand.  In this article we will tell not only about the Bulgarian mountains, but also about what interesting places await travelers in their gorges and which cities in the interior of the mainland are worth visiting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountains in Bulgaria" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/822691.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Stara Planina </h2><p>  These are the longest and largest mountains in area in Bulgaria.  The name Stara Planina is used in this republic, as well as in neighboring Serbia, where this ridge enters.  And the second name of the mountains is the Balkans (Bulgarian).  The name also extended to the entire peninsula.  Stara Planina divides Bulgaria exactly by half.  The ethnographic region of Moesia lies to the north of the ridge, and Thrace and Macedonia begin from the southern spurs.  Stara Planina extends from west to east for five hundred and fifty-five kilometers, resting in the Black Sea at Cape Emine.  The highest peak of this mountain system is Botev - 2376 meters above sea level.  The Danube River cuts off the Balkans from the Southern Carpathians.  These mountains are parallel ridges with flattened peaks.  At considerable height they are treeless.  These are the so-called meadows - alpine meadows.  The northern slopes of Stara Planina are gentle, and the southern slopes are steep. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountains in Bulgaria photo" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/822701.jpg" width="600"></div>

To the south of the Balkan and parallel to it extend yet another mountains in Bulgaria.  They are called the Central Massif, but locals call them Sredna Gora.  The highest point of this ridge is Mount Bogdan.  It rises to a mark of one thousand six hundred and four meters above sea level.  The slopes of the ridge are evenly gentle.  The border between the Old Planina and the Sredna Gora massif is the Tundzha River.  This water artery flows from west to east, flowing into the Black Sea.  The Tundzha River Valley is famous all over the world, because its second name is Pink.  It is here that plantations of fragrant bushes are located.  And the main city of the Kazanlak Valley is the capital of <span>rose oil.</span>  The southern slopes of the Sredna Gora, or the Central Massif, smoothly descend into the Thracian Plain.  These two ridges are famous not only for their natural beauty and unique climate.  They are the cradle of the Bulgarian nation and have always been associated with the heroic history of the people. </p><h2>  Strandja and Vitosha </h2><p>  These two mountains in Bulgaria have the same tectonic age and similar geographical characteristics as the Central Massif.  In this regard, the Vitosha ridge is considered to be its natural continuation.  The highest point of this system is Mount Cerny Verkh (2,290 meters above sea level).  The ridge in the northeast reaches the capital of the country, the city of Sofia.  Naturally, the spurs of the ridge are declared a national nature conservation park.  Vitosha is a kind of light capital.  Here the inhabitants of Sofia like to relax.  In the gorges of Vitosha, the Struma and Sparks begin.  Another ridge, Strandja, extends from the valley of the Tunci River to Istanbul itself.  Its peaks are rounded and not very high due to their venerable, old tectonic age.  Most of the ridge is in modern Turkey. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Bulgaria mountains" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/822702.jpg" width="509"></div>

Not because they are the highest or rocky.  They are almost completely covered by mixed or <span>pine forests.</span>  But the Rhodopes are famous for the fact that typical patriarchal Bulgarian villages have been preserved in their gorges.  Here, folk crafts, still sheep breeding, artisanal cheese production, and wood carving are still flourishing.  <span>Throat singing</span> is another attraction of these places.  The Rhodopes are located in the southwest of the country.  From the north and east they are outlined by the Maritsa River.  The western border is the Mesta Valley.  In the south, the Rhodope Mountains enter Greece and change their name to Rodin.  The highest point of the ridge is Golyam Pernik (2191 m).  Not far from this mountain is the ski resort Pamporovo.  The Rhodopes are considered the birthplace of the hero of myths Orpheus.  According to legend, he was born in the village of Gela. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What are the mountains in Bulgaria" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/822706.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Rila </h2><p>  This is the highest ridge of the country.  The Rila-Rhodope massif is very impressive and extensive.  In addition to these two systems, the Pirin, Styrgach and Slavyanka ranges enter there.  But Rila is the ‚Äúcrown‚Äù of the Bulgarian mountains.  Average heights here range from 2000 to two thousand six hundred meters.  And although it‚Äôs small in the Rila territory (the ridge extends from east to west for only sixty kilometers), it looks impressive.  Rocky peaks, steep abysses, <span>alpine meadows,</span> lakes located in ancient circuses ... The highest mountain in Bulgaria, Musala (2925 m), is also located in the Rila massif.  Its entire upper part is proclaimed a reserve.  Entrance to it is free, but you can only move along paths, and set up tents and burn bonfires in strictly defined places.  But in the reserve there are enough mountain shelters and chalet hotels.  The most popular excursions are a trip to the Seven Rila Lakes and a visit to a local monastery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cities in the mountains of Bulgaria" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/822708.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pirin mountains in Bulgaria </h2><p>  They are located in the very south of the country.  The name of the mountains is often associated with Perun, the god of thunder.  Indeed, in Pirin, strong winds and storms are quite frequent.  This ridge extends from the northwest to the southeast for seventy-five kilometers.  The highest point is Mount Vihren.  It is only ten meters below Musala, the ‚Äúroof‚Äù of Bulgaria.  The height of Vikhren is 2914 m above sea level.  The Pirin Mountains in Bulgaria have best preserved their virgin nature.  Deep pine and spruce forests cover the slopes, and edelweiss blooms on the cliffs.  In the northern part of the ridge is a biosphere reserve, under the auspices of UNESCO.  And in the south, near the extinct crater Kozhuh, in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãRupite, the blind soothsayer Vanga lived and received visitors.  Most tourists choose the western slopes of Pirin for relaxation.  The climate there is warmer and sunny.  It is there that the sweetest grape in the country grows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The highest mountain in Bulgaria" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/822710.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Winter holidays in Bulgaria </h2><p>  The mountains in this southern state are not very high.  However, they are characterized by a stable snow cover in winter.  Each ridge has its own ski resorts.  In Pirin, for example, it is the town of Bansko, on the northern slopes, and Bezbog.  In the Rila massif, such resorts as Borovets (competitions for the European Cup are regularly held there), Panichishte, Malyovitsa, Yundola, Yakoruda-Trechtenik and Semkovo are very popular.  These are the highest mountains in Bulgaria.  Photos of local ski resorts are easily confused with Alpine or Pyrenean ones.  But ride in the lower mountains.  In the Rhodope Mountains, in addition to the mentioned Pamporovo, there are trails and lifts in Martsiganitsa, Yundola, Persenk, Biala Cherkva and Zdravets.  In Stara Planina, Chumerna, Uzana, Pleven, Beklemeto, Strazhata and Kom are known.  And even on the slopes of Vitosha there is Aleko resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Devil's Bridge in the Rhodope Mountains Bulgaria" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/822718.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Balneological rest and treatment </h2><p>  Here, pure mineral water springs and thermal springs beat.  The unique climate and coniferous air created all the conditions for cities in the mountains of Bulgaria to turn into therapeutic spa resorts.  The most popular, world-famous, is Velingrad.  It is located at the junction of the Rhodopes with Rila.  There are seventy mineral springs with a temperature of 22-90 degrees, as well as therapeutic mud.  Beden mineral baths are no less popular.  Complex treatment will be offered at the balneological resort of Bratsigovo. </p><h2>  Sights of the Bulgarian mountains </h2><p>  Perhaps the most famous is the <span>Rila Monastery.</span>  It is based at an altitude of 1150 meters back in the X century, and is now included in the UNESCO List.  In the Rhodopes it is worth seeing the huge miraculous stone arches of the Wonderful Bridges, as well as visiting the Devil's Throat and Yagodinsky caves.  There are many karst cavities in Stara Planina.  Prehistoric cave paintings were found in the Rabish cave.  The Devil's Bridge in the Rhodope Mountains (Bulgaria) is a visiting card of the south of the country.  It was built in 1518 on the site of an ancient Roman bridge.  There are gloomy legends about this architectural monument.  Allegedly, its construction was not without the help of the devil.  Like it or not, the bridge has been without repair for more than five hundred years and is still in excellent condition.  This attraction can be reached from the town of Ardino. </p>
