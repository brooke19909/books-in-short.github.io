    <h2>  PGT Silver Ponds </h2><p>  <span>An urban-type settlement</span> or a worker in the <span>Moscow region</span> with a population of just over 9 thousand.  It is believed that at the end of the first millennium, the area under modern Silver Ponds was inhabited by Vyatichi, archaeological excavations confirm this opinion.  While there was fragmentation in Russia, the lands passed from Chernigov to the Ryazan principality.  Due to frequent raids, the village was always small. </p><p>  But at the beginning of the last century there were 3 schools in the village, and in 1912 even a higher primary school was opened.  By 1941, there were about 30 thousand inhabitants in the village.  In 1961, the settlement received the status of a working village.  And in 2015, Silver Ponds began to obey the regional authorities, the city district was formed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The village is located 160 km from the capital of the Russian Federation (along Kashirsky highway).  Here lies the railway line Necklace-Pavelets. </p><p>  Today in the village is under construction LCD "Orchid".  This is a monolithic 5-story building with 3 sections.

    <h2>  Where else can I live? </h2><p>  In addition to apartment buildings in the Moscow region, there are many houses in urban-type settlements (in the so-called cottage villages). </p><p>  By the way, in November of this year there is a certain drop in the cost of private homes.  The price also depends on the distance from the Moscow Ring Road.  If the cottage village is located 20 km from the capital, then the cost for 1 m <sup>2</sup> starts from 90-96 thousand rubles, if the house costs 60 km and further, then housing can be found at a price of about 40-46 thousand for 1 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  So, for example, in the village of Sholokhovo (Mytishchi urban district), the Ecodolie project (15 km from MKAD) is being implemented.  Here you can buy a cottage at a price of 8.9 million.  This is a house with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã110 m <sup>2</sup> in two floors.  On the territory of the village under construction, townhouses and apartments are for sale. </p><p>  And in the Sergeyev-Posad district, the village of "Alexandria courtyards" is being built.  The distance to the Moscow Ring Road is 85 km, and the price of houses already starts at 1.8 million rubles.  The village is already populated by 50%, all communications are connected. </p>
