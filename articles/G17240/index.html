October Field" (Moscow): description, layout, developer and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Shchukino in Moscow is one of the central and most prestigious areas with a glorious history, a dynamically developing present and a tempting future.  Here in what attractive place the LCD "Hometown" is being built.  The October field was once occupied by industrial zones.  Now, in terms of urban development, their reconstruction and transformation into parks, retail space, and entertainment centers is provided for.  In a year or two, the homeowners of the Hometown will be surrounded by excellent infrastructure.  And what does the complex under construction look like now?  What are its features?  What are the advantages and disadvantages?  First things first. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  We will make a reservation that the complexes under one pleasant name ‚ÄúHometown‚Äù are being built in different areas of the capital.  Our story is only about what is being built on the October field.  It is located right on the border of the Shchukino district, along Berzarin street, plot No. 28. On its opposite side begins the district of the capital Khoroshevo - Mnevniki. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Hometown October Field" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1607379.jpg" width="502"></div>  As you can see, surrounded by urban development will be located LCD "Hometown".  <span>The October field</span> is considered a good place with developed infrastructure and many green corners, and the Moscow River is only 1,500 meters from here.  Soon it will become even more comfortable, since according to the assurances of the builder in terms of the construction of the capital there are demolition points for industrial zones 30 and 32 with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã10 hectares, just those in the immediate vicinity of the complex.  What will be built in their place is not yet clear, but the fact that new enterprises will not appear there is recorded in a resolution of the Moscow City Hall.

The October field is the territory where about a dozen roads are laid.  The closest to the complex is Berzarina Street, along which you can drive to the People‚Äôs Militia Street in two minutes, and then to a major junction at the intersection of Zhukov Avenue.  You can also quickly get to <span>Volokolamsk highway.</span>  The only problem for motorists is traffic jams, but they exist all over Moscow. </p><p>  For those who prefer public transport, the location of the complex is no less attractive.  Literally a couple of steps away from it, along Berzarina street and along Raspletina street, there are bus and bus stops No. 26, 253, 39 and 39K, and at a distance of 1200 meters from the complex there is the Oktyabrskoe pole metro station. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Hometown October field reviews" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1607383.jpg" width="484"></div>

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  This is the most vague question for the LCD "Hometown".  The October field is known for the fact that the Tokamak Research Institute is located here, where they are engaged in nuclear energy development.  Before him from building number 1 is only 150 meters.  Branches of SNIIP work close to the complex, to the nearest of which 55 meters.  These SNIIPs specialize in instrument engineering, and again with the participation of a peaceful atom for the time being.  Articles are regularly published in the press about the existence of a nuclear repository in the construction area.  The <span>radiation backgrounds</span> around the complex, measured by volunteers, record numbers from 0.36 to 0.55 ŒºSv / h, which exceeds the norm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the other hand, the TsIIS laboratory measured radiation at the facility and recorded the background radiation values ‚Äã‚Äãof only 0.11 ŒºSv / h. </p><p>  Each shareholder has the right to decide which of the two dimensions is correct. </p><p>  Besides the controversial issue regarding invisible doses, there are other, more obvious disadvantages.  This is a reinforced concrete, to which no more than 100 meters, a thermal power plant, a woodworking and other enterprises.  They promise to demolish them, but so far they are working. </p><p>  With regard to natural corners, the location of the complex has good grades.  Around it there are only a few green spaces, but only 7 minutes to the nearest park.  And in a radius of 1500 meters there are several wonderful parks and alleys at once. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Hometown October field prices" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1607398.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <h2>  Developer </h2><p>  A young company called RG Development is building the LCD Hometown (October Field).  Reviews about the developer are quite favorable.  At the moment, he is implementing three business class housing projects - one on the October Field, the second on Kakhovskaya and the third near <span>Vorontsov Park.</span>  The company is headed by T. Tikhonova, who received an order from the Moscow government for her excellent work in the capital.  RG Development was established less than 4 years ago, but already has a rating of 4 out of 5. It carries out absolutely all work on the implementation of housing projects, from their concept to the implementation of finished areas.  By the way, the abbreviation "RG" means "Hometown."  The goals of the company‚Äôs employees are to build beautiful, modern and comfortable housing for people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Infrastructure and Design </h2><p>  Regarding the future infrastructure in the residential complex "Hometown" (October Field), the reviews of residents differ.  On the territory of the complex, 4 absolutely identical buildings are being built with 24 floors each.  They will be located at a slight angle to each other to eventually form a semicircle.  The case design is simple and is a mix of strict classics and elegant neoclassicism.  As to whether the yard will be fenced, there are still no exact answers.  On the one hand, a resolution was issued prohibiting surrounding the complexes with fences, on the other, residents of business class houses have the right to rely on some security for themselves and their relatives, and on the third floor, it is planned to open offices and trade offices on the first floors of all buildings of the Hometown points, objects of commercial activity and consumer services, which should be accessible to all potential customers. </p><p>  On the territory of the "Hometown" is already under construction a kindergarten in two floors, designed for 90 kids.  In the future, it is also planned to create several playgrounds for children and natural places for their parents to relax. </p><p>  Many are interested in what will be the parking in the complex.  They plan to make it underground (according to various sources, it will be able to accept from 100 to 300 cars).  The price of a parking place has not yet been finalized. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Hometown October field residents reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1607372.jpg" width="506"></div>

    <p>  Also in the territory it is planned to allocate a place for free ground parking. </p><p>  Within a radius of 2000 meters from the complex there are several lyceums, schools, a hospital, dozens of pharmacies, supermarkets, shops, gas stations. </p><h2>  LCD "Hometown" (October Field): planning and design of apartments </h2><p>  The buildings of this LCD are designed so that 8 apartments will be placed on the floors.  Among them: </p><p>  - one-room with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã34 m <sup>2</sup> to 46 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - two-room apartments - from 61 m <sup>2</sup> to 75 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - three-room apartments - from 84.5 m <sup>2</sup> to 97 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - four-room apartments - from 115 m <sup>2</sup> to 120 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  <span>Layouts of apartments are available,</span> presented in several options.  In the ‚Äúodnushki‚Äù the bathroom and the bath are mainly combined, the kitchens are very spacious, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã10 m2, large or small loggias, hallways with walk-in closets, but there are options without them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD hometown October field layout" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1608043.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, in the building that is being built near the kindergarten, on the second floor there will be: a ‚Äúkopeck piece‚Äù with windows only in the kitchen and a ‚Äútreshka‚Äù with windows in the kitchen and in one of the rooms.  During the construction process, changes to this layout are possible. </p><p>  All apartments in the "Hometown" are planned to be finished without decoration, but with glazed loggias. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hometown October field LCD apartment" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1607401.jpg" width="503"></div>

    <h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  The developer promises at the beginning of 2018 - until March - to hand over all the lines of the residential complex "Hometown" (October Field).

At the moment, the construction of buildings number 4, 3 and 2 has already been completed, here the internal work has begun.  In building number 1 completion of the upper floors ends.  The buildings of the complex are built using monolithic technology, which ensures maximum reliability and good thermal protection.  Additionally, a layer of insulation is laid in the outer walls so that there is no heat loss.  In the territory where the "Hometown" is being built, according to the plan, new communications will be laid with equipping them with high-tech equipment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Hometown October field layout" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1607376.jpg" width="509"></div>
