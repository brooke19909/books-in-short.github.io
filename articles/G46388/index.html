    <h2>  Resort Location </h2><p>  After crossing 48 kilometers from <span>Larnaca</span> International <span>Airport,</span> you will find yourself in the resort <span>hotel (Cyprus)</span> Nelia Beach.  The address of this institution is Ayia Napa, October 1, 27. This is the central part of the city, and therefore you will have access to a huge number of restaurants, shops and entertainment centers.  The popular Limanaki beach is only 100 meters away, while the coast of Fig Three Bay will have to overcome as much as 10 kilometers.  A little further is the famous resort of Protaras. </p><h2>  Guest apartments </h2><p>  The gentle sea and vivid entertainment are dreamed by travelers who go to Cyprus.  "Nelia Beach" will provide you with comfortable living conditions so that you can have a good rest after a busy resort day.  You can choose one of the following accommodation options for yourself at this hotel: </p><ul><li>  The standard room is designed to accommodate two guests in large or single beds.  This is a relatively small room, which adjoins the bathroom and balcony, from which you can admire the sea views.  If you choose apartments with city views, then this option will cost you a little cheaper. </li><li>  Junior suites are designed as a studio.  Here, the whole space, thanks to a successful design solution, is divided into a bedroom and a living room.  There is a large double bed, as well as folding furniture for guests.  The bathroom is equipped with a bath, and a beautiful seascape opens from the balcony. </li><li>  Executive Suite is ideal for a romantic getaway.  It is represented by a bedroom with a large bed, opposite which are huge windows with sea views.  There is also a fairly large living room, in which there is a couch and a coffee table.  One of the most enjoyable moments can be considered the presence of a hot tub. </li><li>  Family apartments are two large bedrooms, as well as a compact entrance area.  Each room has its own bathroom.  One of the bedrooms has a balcony, which can overlook both the city and the sea.  Taking into account additional places, up to 6 guests can stay here. </li></ul><p>  It is impossible not to say about the design decision of the apartments of the Nelia Beach Hotel (Cyprus).  The photos of the rooms, made by tourists, demonstrate a bright and at the same time restrained interior, made in a modern style. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Not only positive, but also negative comments were awarded to the Nelia Beach Hotel (Cyprus).  The reviews contain the following negative opinions: </p><ul><li>  the rooms have rather poor sound insulation, and therefore you will hear everything that happens in the yard and in the neighboring rooms; </li><li>  taking into account all the shortcomings of this hotel, then the prices can be considered inflated (they remain so even in the off-season); </li><li>  the hotel is trying to take money from the guests for every little thing (even for the use of the refrigerator an additional fee is charged, which can be found quite rarely); </li><li>  even if you check into an expensive room of a high category, you will not be immune from the fact that construction will be under your windows; </li><li>  as for a hotel of such a high level, wireless Internet could be free (especially since you can use it exclusively in public areas, as an option: go to a nearby cafe, order something to drink and use the Internet absolutely free); </li><li>  due to the fact that gray shades prevail in the interior of the rooms, this does not affect the mood of the guests in the best way; </li><li>  very rarely change bed linen (and even personal requests do not help); </li><li>  in the summer, blankets are removed from the rooms, and therefore, if you freeze, there will be nothing to hide; </li><li>  in order to get towels replaced, you had to persuade the maid for a long time; </li><li>  in order to use the remote control from the TV and air conditioning, you need to leave a cash deposit at the reception; </li><li>  Do not be surprised if, during check-in, they will give you the keys to the room in which someone has been living for a long time; </li><li>  neither a special door, nor at least a curtain is provided in the shower, and therefore, after bathing, water is everywhere; </li><li>  despite the fact that daily evening animation shows are announced, in fact this happens extremely rarely; </li><li>  despite the fact that the hotel is located very close to the sea, due to the irrational layout of the territory you have to make a very big hook. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  A lot of vivid impressions of tourists leaves Cyprus, Ayia Napa.  "Nelia Beach" is a fairly popular hotel for travelers.  Holidays in Cyprus are quite an expensive pleasure, and this hotel falls into the middle price category.  But this only applies to the price of accommodation.  Literally for every little thing they will demand money from you.  This applies to the Internet, and a safe, and even a refrigerator.  Needless to say, even for the remote control from the TV, a security deposit will be required from you.  Nevertheless, this accommodation option remains one of the most profitable on the island. </p><p>  The Nelia Beach Hotel (Cyprus) has recently begun renovations, but most of the rooms have already been completely renovated.  The design is modern and interesting enough with original decorative elements.  It is also encouraging that the hotel has a fairly developed infrastructure.  There is a swimming pool, a gym, a sauna, bicycle rental, and shops.  And much more that a modern tourist may need.  But perhaps the most important advantage of the hotel is that it is located in close proximity to the beach, because most of the time guests spend swimming in the sea. </p>
