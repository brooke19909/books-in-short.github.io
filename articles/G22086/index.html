The advantages of such complexes are, of course, a good profit for investors and developers, as more apartments are for sale.  And buyers can choose an apartment with any layout, number of storeys.  Many people choose the second or third floor as the best option.  These complexes of apartment buildings include the residential complex "Swedish settlement".  It belongs to economy class housing, which means that buyers can purchase it with average incomes. </p><h2>  Characteristics of houses </h2><p>  "Swedish settlement" is a <span>residential complex</span> in Samara, it includes ten four-story houses.  They are connected to all communications.  There is water supply, drainage, gas supply, electricity.  The first two houses have three sections offset, which provides a beautiful and unusual architectural design.  In the houses of the "Swedish settlement" in Samara, the layout of the apartments is different: there are one-room and two-room apartments with different meters.  In one-room apartments, it varies from 31 to 41 m <sup>2</sup> , in two-room apartments - from 54 to 60 m <sup>2</sup> .  The remaining seven houses were built in a traditional style.  They have one-room, two-room and three-room apartments.  In three-room apartments, the area is from 73 to 74 m <sup>2</sup> .  The material used for the walls of houses is silicate brick.  In addition, they are sheathed with Rockwool stove insulation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Swedish settlement apartment layout" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68246/2177076.jpg"></div>  This insulation helped to achieve not only thermal insulation, but also sound insulation, which is considered a big plus in the construction of the Swedish Sloboda complex in Samara.  The roof was designed with a gable roof, which reduces leakage and snow accumulation.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  These houses have a fine finish: painted walls and laid linoleum.  The plus of the fine finish is that you can immediately populate and live.  Plumbing is also available, as well as individual heating.  This allows you to adjust the temperature of the room itself, hot water supply.  There are also meters for water supply, gas supply and electricity. </p><h2>  Property Location </h2><p>  <span>The residential complex</span> "Swedish Sloboda" is located in an ecologically clean area in the city of Samara, not far from the Moscow highway (only 24 km along the street Red Plowman).  The territory belongs to the Krasnoglinsky district, a large shopping and entertainment center "Mega" was built nearby. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Apartments swedish settlement samara" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68246/2169934.jpg"></div></h2><p>  There are also playgrounds, equipped driveways and parking.  Some windows overlook the forest. </p><p>  Construction took place in turns.  The 1st stage was built and commissioned in 2014, and the Swedish settlement in Samara (2nd stage) - in the second half of 2016. </p><h2>  Object lending </h2><p>  The price per 1 square meter is 37,500 rubles.  Mortgage lending is provided by Sberbank and Pervobank.  You can also purchase an apartment in installments. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  A little bit about the company developer Megastroy LLC. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Swedish settlement Samara" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68246/2169933.jpg"></div></h2><p>  They carry out their work on the construction of houses since the beginning of 2002.  The very first house that the company built was commissioned in Samara at the intersection of Artsybushevskaya and Vilonovskaya streets.  In order to free up the site for the construction of their own skyscraper, they resettled the tenants of five dilapidated buildings, giving them seventeen apartments in the property. </p><p>  The house consists of 4 sections with different number of storeys (from 9 to 14 floors).  Architects of this building are the best in Russia - these are Morgun Alexey Grigoryevich and Morgun Dmitry Alekseevich.  This building has entered the top ten best buildings in the metropolis of Samara.  The construction of the next building, namely an apartment building, the Megastroy company began in 2004.  This house was also built on the site of dilapidated buildings, and three families found apartments in a new high-rise building.  The house was built with a variable number of storeys. </p><p>  At the moment, the company Profit LLC, which is part of the Megastroy Corporation, is constructing the Swedish Sloboda residential complex in Samara. </p><h2>  Construction plans </h2><p>  Initially, the project assumed a house with three floors, but after some modifications it was changed. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Swedish settlement Samara 2nd turn" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68246/2170049.jpg"></div></h2><p>  The company also plans to build two transformer substations, this is a great advantage in construction.  The first phase of construction consists of six houses, the ‚ÄúSwedish settlement‚Äù (2nd stage) in Samara will be replenished with five more apartment buildings. </p><p>  The facade of new buildings is very similar to the Koshelev project under construction.  The difference between the houses of the "Swedish Settlement" from the Koshelev project is that the houses of the first complex are one floor higher, have a sloping roof, not a flat one, and are painted in different colors. </p><p>  The largest part of the apartments in the "Swedish Sloboda" of Samara is one-room and two-room apartments with a small standard area.  This was expected, since the project was conceived exclusively as an economy class.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe houses of the first stage is a little more than 27,000 square meters.  437 apartments were put up for sale. </p><h2>  Management Company </h2><p>  The complex also has a management company for the provision of utility services - LLC UK Asset Management.  She is actively introducing the latest energy saving technologies and is clearly planning her activities.  The director is Alexey Ivanov.  This company also has a website where you can familiarize yourself with all the information in detail.  On it you can find useful phone numbers and addresses, top news and events.  This company is new, but has already shown great success in the maintenance of housing.  The company's employees are very effective, responsibly approach their work, showing the high viability of the company. </p>
