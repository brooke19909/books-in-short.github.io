  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Einstein's theory of relativity and new research in this matter</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The discovery of the theory of relativity at the beginning of the last century was a significant breakthrough in the study of <span>physical phenomena</span> related to the study of the speed of light and space-time events.  At present, it is reliably known that Einstein's <span>theory of relativity is</span> not a direct achievement of this brilliant physicist only, but rather combines a number of discoveries in this regard by several physicists, from which Lawrence and Poincare can be distinguished.  The famous Austrian physicist was only able to collect together disparate elements, formulating the greatest postulate, which served as the beginning of a completely new approach to the study of spatial worlds. </p><p>  So, Einstein's theory of relativity sounds rather complicated, and in simpler terms, it is a physical theory that considers the spatio-temporal properties of processes occurring both on earth and in space.  Since these processes directly depend on such factors as the gravitational field and the speed of the physical object, this allows us to call it relativity.  Depending on the point of the report, we see completely different time structures that can go from one report system to another when the speed of light is reached.  Einstein‚Äôs theory is based on two main points: the constancy of the <span>speed of light in a vacuum,</span> as well as the equality of all inertial reporting systems.  These two axioms underlie the formulas for the transition from one inertial system to another - the so-called <span>Lorentz transformation</span> curve <span>,</span> on which Einstein's theory of relativity is based. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Recently, however, modern scientists have made more and more discoveries that ruin the famous theory, gradually collecting evidence of its fallacy.  A few years ago, a group of Australian scientists led by J. Wobb, studying the origin of the light farthest from our solar system of galaxies, came to the conclusion that the alpha number is not a constant constant, as is still believed in modern science.  It turns out that its value can vary depending on the point in space from which it is calculated.  So far, this has not been proved at the scientific level, but if this theory is confirmed, Einstein's theory of relativity will be practically crossed out.  In addition, as a result of recent discoveries, versions are put forward that the <span>speed of light</span> can also be different, which in general will jeopardize the basic tenets of modern physics. </p><p>  Today, scientists come close to the evidence for the existence of parallel worlds, where the string theory of the universe begins to collect more and more evidence in their favor.  And this is a completely transcendental field of study, where there are still many puzzles that need to be solved by modern humanity.  After all, everything flows, and everything changes.  One discovery is being replaced by others, more accurate and correct.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, a revolutionary breakthrough in the physics of that time was made by Einstein's <span>special theory of relativity</span> , which received the Nobel Prize and worldwide recognition for it.  However, at the moment, in the light of recent discoveries in the field of astrophysics, new devices have appeared that can more accurately determine certain phenomena occurring in space, as a result of which the old theories are replaced by newer ones. </p><p>  Thus, Einstein's <span>general theory of relativity</span> is still globally recognized, but many scientists in the study of parallel worlds already try not to always rely on its postulates.  Who knows, maybe we will witness the birth of a more interesting and correct theory of the interaction of space and time through the prism of the speed of light and the point of report. </p>
