  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Does the world need a methodology of scientific knowledge?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If someone mistakenly believes that the methodology of scientific knowledge is needed only by scientists and is not useful in everyday life, it means that he just did not understand that it can be used to quickly and effectively navigate a wide variety of issues.  Of course, studying the methodology is not easy enough, but as soon as you master it, you immediately begin to look at the world with completely different eyes.  It is worth noting that this method has long been intuitively used by animals and children, and quite effectively.  But as soon as we begin to connect the methods to this consciousness, and begin to question everything, the whole experiment goes on at random. </p><p>  Then why do we need a methodology of <span>scientific knowledge?</span>  Mystics say that only intuition is enough to know life, but this is far from the case.  Intuition can lure us into such a jungle that a person can easily think of himself as the great Messiah and believe that God himself is talking to him.  It is quite possible to pass on from generation to generation the meaning of a rite that has long lost its relevance, but faith in it is still alive.  Blind faith is very often completely absurd, because our life flows and changes, which means that human truths that were previously considered unyielding change with it. </p><p>  Taking the first steps in life, a person begins to understand that the world is far from being as simple as it seems at first glance.  The methodology of scientific knowledge with the help of basic principles allows you to sort out the whole amazing world, but it is quite different from pseudoscience in its basic principles and methods.  The true method serves as a kind of compass for the person who is just embarking on the path, avoiding many serious errors.  F. Bacon called this method a lamp showing the way to the traveler in the dark, however, he believed that one cannot count on great success by going the wrong way.  Descartes, in turn, ranked the methods as exact and simple rules, the observance of which allows us to distinguish true doctrine from false. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The methodology of scientific knowledge has much in common with German classical and materialistic philosophy, which developed the <span>dialectical method</span> on a materialistic and idealistic basis.  The problems of methodology and method occupy an important place in Western philosophy of today, especially in those areas such as philosophy of science, positivism, structuralism, <span>analytical philosophy.</span>  Each of the methods is, of course, a necessary and important thing, however, one should not go to extremes and exaggerate or downplay its value.  After all, it is completely clear that it is impossible to turn the method into a kind of universal master key with which you can make various scientific discoveries. </p><p>  Any method can be useless if you use it not as a guiding thread, but as a ready-made template for changing facts.  The logic and methodology of scientific knowledge cannot be limited only by scientific and philosophical frameworks, they can only be considered in a wide sociocultural context.  This means that it is necessary to take into account at this stage of development the powerful connection of science with production.  In any case, one thing is clear that only the conscious application of the methods allows us to make the result more rational and effective.  Since the sixteenth century, methodology has been used not only in philosophy, but also in physics, chemistry, and even in history. </p><p>  The effectiveness of this or that method much depends on the methods of its application, moreover, in this case, its content, depth and fundamental nature of the theory are of great importance.  In order for the result to exceed all expectations, you need to be sure that the subject of scientific knowledge is not just a separate subject, it is also part of the overall picture of the world, which is constantly changing and improving. </p>
