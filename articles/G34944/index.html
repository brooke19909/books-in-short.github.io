However, the times when the cooking process took a long time, and everything was done manually passed.  To help people come electrical assistants.  One of them is an electric meat grinder.  The modern market is replete with a huge number of models of units used in the household. <noindex>  <span>Buy a meat grinder professional</span> </noindex>  every woman dreams, but how not to make a mistake when choosing them?  What is worth paying attention to?  Let's try to figure it out. <br><br>  It would seem that an important element in choosing an electric meat grinder is its equipment.  However, first of all, it is necessary to pay attention to several useful functions that should be present in a modern electric meat grinder.  First of all, this is the motor lock function.  Its meaning is to prevent the meat grinder motor from overheating and protect it from excessive loads.  To do this, use a special plastic sleeve designed to stop the motor in the event of such situations.  This mechanism also works when something solid gets into the meat grinder. <br><br>  Its analogue is the function of automatic circuit interruption.  The principle of operation is somewhat different, but the meaning remains the same.  Instead of a plastic sleeve, two metal plates are used as a fuse, which close in the case of normal operation of the unit, and when a threat occurs, the motor opens and stops it. <br><br>  Another feature worth paying attention to is auto reverse.  Most often, the owners of meat grinders when using it are faced with the problem of winding the wires on the auger.  Previously, to eliminate it, an infinite number of times had to be disassembled, cleaned and assembled.  The auto reverse function completely solves this problem.  By pressing just one button, the process of reverse rotation of the auger starts and everything that is wound on it can be easily and quickly removed without disassembling the meat grinder. <br><br>  After studying the functions, you should begin to familiarize yourself with the complete set of an electric meat grinder.  The standard set of accessories includes a screw, knife and nozzles. <br><br>  The auger is a spiral, most often made of metal.  It is he who is responsible for ensuring that the meat moves quickly to the knife. <br><br>  When inspecting a knife, make sure that it is made of quality steel.  Until recently, it was believed that all knives should be sharpened several times a year.  However, today on the market are sickle-shaped knives that do not need sharpening.  They can be easily found in the online store. <br><br>  When choosing nozzles, it is necessary to decide for what purpose an electric meat grinder is purchased.  After all, its cost directly depends on the amount included in the set of nozzles.  It can include grills for minced meat with different openings, a variety of graters, nozzles for making sausages and meatballs, devices for cutting vegetables. </p></div></article>
