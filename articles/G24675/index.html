Medal "For the Liberation of Warsaw"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, many events took place that were truly crucial for the entire history of this period.  Some of them are known to everyone, such as the blockade of Stalingrad, and some live in the memory of participants and researchers of this historical period.  One way or another, the importance of this time is undeniable.  As a result of World War II, the world was liberated from the Nazi threat.  Along with the exploits of the soldiers in the early stages of the war, events of the last stage of the conflict played an important role.  The situation, formed in 1944-1945, showed the irreversibility of losing the German army.  However, during her retreat, the military leaders of Germany were snapping rather strongly and roughly.  At this moment, it was necessary to measure forces so that the retreat did not turn into a monstrous counterattack.  Thus, after the events on the <span>Kursk Bulge,</span> Soviet military leaders begin to gradually push the enemy troops deeper into Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the liberation of Warsaw" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/681669.jpg" width="600"></div>  At the very approaches to the source of Nazism, Germany, there were extremely important historical skirmishes between the Soviet Army and the German.  Below we will talk about clashes near the Polish capital - Warsaw.

It should be remembered that these events took place at completely different times, which many do not even know about.  The Warsaw <span>operation of 1944</span> was carried out not in the city itself, but in close proximity to it.  It should also be noted that the operation took place with the aim of further attack on the city itself.  In other words, the battle of Warsaw in 1944 was carried out in order to provide the necessary conditions for the further advance and repression of the enemy.  The liberation of Warsaw during this operation was not foreseen. </p>

    <h2>  The essence of the operation of 1944 </h2><p>  Soviet military leaders set themselves the task of destroying the enemy‚Äôs fortifications on the outskirts of <span>the Polish capital.</span>  The operation itself took place from July 25 to August 5, 1944.  There were heavy tank battles near <span>the Vistula River</span> , which are often compared with the Battle of Prokhorov.  Soviet troops received support from the formed militia units of the Home Army.  Despite the numerical superiority of the Soviet Army, the goals were never achieved.  Today, there are several reasons for the defeat of the USSR troops in that battle: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Lack of understanding between the Polish and Soviet command, as well as Stalin‚Äôs ambitions regarding influence in Poland. </li><li>  The relative "fatigue" of the Soviet Army after a series of exhausting operations before the events of 1944. </li></ul><p>  Although the goals were not achieved, the USSR army was firmly entrenched on the approaches to Warsaw, which carried a great risk for the Wehrmacht troops.  Already in January 1945, the Soviet Army renewed its forces and launched a new full-scale offensive. </p>

    <h2>  Events Prior to the Liberation of Warsaw </h2><p>  The liberation of Warsaw was one of the goals that needed to be achieved during the Warsaw-Poznan operation.  They tried to postpone it in every possible way, since German forces from the East were transferred here.  Moreover, it was the final stage of the war.  The liberation of Warsaw would open a direct road to Berlin.  Thus, the actions of the command should have been accurate and thoughtful.  The date of the operation was January 20, but the defeat of the <span>American army</span> in the Ardennes played against Soviet strategists.  The Prime Minister of Great Britain, Winston Churchill, on January 6, 1945 asked Stalin in every possible way to approximate the moment of the offensive in the Wisla-Oder direction.  Therefore, already on January 12, a large-scale offensive began to prepare, one of the goals of which was the liberation of Warsaw.  How did events develop further? </p><h2>  The liberation of Warsaw (1945).  First day </h2><p>  How it all began?  The liberation of Warsaw from the Nazis began on January 14, 1945.  The first day was marked by the forcing of the Vistula and moving deep into the strengthening of the enemy.  It was already indicated earlier that the Germans' positions were very well fortified on the approaches to Warsaw.  Therefore, the actions of the Soviet Army were as cautious as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="year of liberation of Warsaw" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/681662.jpg" width="550"></div>  During the offensive, on the first day of the operation, the 8th Guards Army and the 5th Shock Army advanced 12 kilometers into the German fortifications.  Wisla was forced by the 61st Army.  The offensive was swift and tough, which led to the retreat of the Germans deep into their positions, closer to the city.

    <h2>  Second day of the liberation of Warsaw </h2><p>  The 47th Army threw the enemy over the Vistula River on January 15.  At the same time, the 2nd Guards Tank Army cut off the approach to Warsaw in the vicinity of the village of Sochaczew.  Thus, German troops were surrounded.  It cannot be said that the Soviet Army came close to Warsaw, but a considerable territory was isolated.  The Germans did not know how to get out of the environment, so they resorted to tricks.  They drove about 300 civilians to a church and threatened to kill everyone if the enemy continued the offensive.  In order not to risk the lives of civilians, an operation was organized on the night of January 15-16, during which the hostages were released. </p>

    <h2>  The final stage of the operation </h2><p>  On the morning of January 16, the offensive begins in all directions to Warsaw.  In just one day, such villages as Hoofs, Pyaski, Opach, etc. were liberated. For the 9th German army, it was just a dumbfound day.  Almost all of the Germans' fortified positions around the city were defeated, and communication with the outside world ceased.  Nothing prevented Soviet forces from taking over the capital of a country like Poland.  Warsaw was a few kilometers away.  At dawn on January 17, Soviet troops occupied highways leading to the city.  By noon, fierce battles began in the city, which took place on Tamka and Marshalavskaya streets.  At 2 p.m. on January 17, 1945, the provisional government in Lublin received a telegram saying that the city was taken.  This event meant that under the control of Soviet troops all of Poland.  Warsaw became the starting point for further advancement to Berlin.  On the day of liberation, rallies were held throughout Warsaw in honor of the great liberators - Soviet soldiers. </p>

    <h2>  Medal </h2><p>  This feat could not be simply forgotten, so the Soviet government decided to perpetuate and reward all participants in the liberation of Warsaw.  For this purpose, the <span>medal "For the Liberation of Warsaw"</span> was established <span>.</span>  The draft medal was developed by the artist Kuritsyna.  The award received all who distinguished themselves during the operation to liberate the city.  The medal is worn on the left side of the chest after the sign ‚ÄúFor the Liberation of Belgrade‚Äù.  The reward pours out of brass.  Its diameter is 32 millimeters.  The inscription is engraved on the front of the coin.  On the reverse side, you can find the engraving of the date and year.  The liberation of Warsaw, therefore, ended favorably for the USSR, and many received the described medal. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We examined one of the most striking and important events of the final stage of the Great Patriotic War.  The liberation of Warsaw (1945) gave the Soviet Army the opportunity to move further to the West in order to destroy the source of Nazism in the world that was in Berlin. </p>
