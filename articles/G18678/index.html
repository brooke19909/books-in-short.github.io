In addition, Alanya is one of the largest resort <span>cities in Turkey.</span>  One of the advantages of this town is its long swimming season.  And hotels in Turkey Alanya are relatively not expensive here.  Their prestige, of course, leaves much to be desired.  But here you will find a huge variety of recreational activities on offer: all kinds of night discos, restaurants and water parks.  There are many tourists here: young people looking for nightly adventures and mothers with young children.  In a word, this is a universal resort for various social groups.  Alanya hotels simply shine with the range of services offered.  But, like everywhere else in Alanya, there are the best hotels and not so, those that can not please tourists with their service. </p><p>  The best hotels include Kosdere.  Its location is actually perfect, both from the center and to the nearest airport.  The rooms are excellent in their comfort and coziness.  A wide range of services offered.  All other hotels in Alanya simply fade against its background.  Everyone for himself there will be able to find something interesting.  But the prices here are impressive.  What is there to do?  For the comfort and good attitude of the staff you have to pay.  As for nutrition, it is also perfect here. </p><p>  Other Alanya hotels such as the Delphin Deluxe Resort and Alara Park are very widely known among Russian tourists.  These two hotels are basically no different from each other.  The beach is also nearby.  The food here is diverse, where everyone can choose everything to their taste.  And leisure can be spent here in various fascinating ways.  The only drawback of the Delphin Deluxe Resort is that the beach is not sandy, which is extremely inconvenient with small children.  But even this drawback does not affect the status of the hotel, which is considered one of the best.  The great advantage of Alanya Alara Park Hotel is its huge green <span>area adjacent</span> to it, where you can enjoy long walks in the shade of trees. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The worst hotels in Alanya are called the worst because they have a relatively low level of service and the range of services offered.  But the price for living here will be small compared to the same Delphin Deluxe Resort. </p><p>  One of the not so good hotels in Alanya is Green Fugla Beach.  Firstly, one of its significant shortcomings is the distant location from the city center of Antalya.  Its entire complex is a small three-story bungalow.  The beach is small and not comfortable enough.  As for food, it is very scarce.  But the prices for this hotel are not high. </p><p>  Another Alanya Grand Capital Beach hotel, in principle, is not much different from Green Fugla Beach.  Anyone who goes to Turkey and wants to spend his holidays superbly with all five stars, this hotel will not suit him.  Since it does not shine with either a variety in nutrition, or the range of services offered, nor the quality of service and the range of services offered.  The staff here are by no means as helpful as in other hotels.  But, nevertheless, who wants the accommodation not to be expensive, and from the services offered he will not need a big quiet beach, he chooses this particular hotel.  But sometimes the staff here is rude.  No one has a concrete opinion on this hotel.  Some are satisfied, and those who expected luxury and wealth of furnishings in the room are disappointed.  Since this is not the type of hotel from which you will have the best experience.  And this is, if you do not take the rudeness of the staff.  If you do not want to spend your holidays in constant scandals, choose any other hotel.  Also not one of the best hotels is the Hotel Alanya Club Seraphan.  The hotel rooms are still quite primitive, as in ordinary Russian cheap motels.  The beach is terrible, small and not comfortable.  And complaints about the staff come constantly with enviable frequency.  Therefore, if you do not want to spoil your vacation in Alanya, then choose those hotels that, albeit not very cheap, but have a good reputation. </p>
