Despite the long flight, you can relax in this country at a relatively low price, because a lot of budget hotels have been built at its resorts.  For example, on Samui, the second largest island of the state, the inexpensive Samui Laguna Resort complex is popular.  More information about its infrastructure and housing is described in this article, as well as reviews of former guests. </p><h2>  Location and address </h2><p>  According to tourists, the Samui Laguna Resort 3 * complex (Thailand, Lamai) has a very favorable location for a budget hotel.  The fact is that it was built directly on the sandy beach, so guests can walk to the sea in just a couple of minutes.  On the other side of the hotel is a fairly large river.  The complex is located in a secluded place, so it is suitable primarily for a relaxing holiday.  At the same time, the central part of the resort is only 400 meters away.  Therefore, restaurants, shopping centers and nightclubs can be reached on foot in 5-10 minutes if desired.  And in the immediate vicinity of the hotel itself there is an amusement theme park and a yoga studio. </p><p>  The exact address of this hotel: 124/103 Moo 3, Tambon Marret, Amphoe Koh Samui, Surat Thani, 84310 Lamai Beach, Thailand. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="9.468238999999999" data-lng="100.047774" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/8/1/2/4812.png"></div><p>  At 17 km from the hotel there is an international airport, which accepts flights from Russia.  Tourists can pay for the transfer or get to the place of rest by public transport, a rented car or taxi.  The journey to the hotel usually takes about 1 hour. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Basic hotel information </h2><p>  Hotel Samui Laguna Resort 3 * in Samui offers its guests an inexpensive beach holiday right on the beach.  The complex was built in 1990 and during this time it was repaired several times.  So, the last renovation of rooms and public spaces was held here in 2010. </p><p>  This hotel cannot be called great.  It occupies a relatively small area of ‚Äã‚Äãonly 5600 square meters.  m. On it is the main residential building and a complex of individual bungalows.  There are 64 rooms in the hotel, which means that usually around 150 tourists live on its territory.

Tourists can rent apartments both in the main building and in a separate bungalow.  As a rule, the second option will cost a little more.  Also in the complex there are no amenities for people with disabilities.  Interconnected apartments are not provided here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="samui-laguna-resort.hotelsofkohsamui.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Room Interior" class="if uuid-2572867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2572867.jpg"></div><p>  In the main building of the Samui Laguna Resort 3 * hotel in Thailand, the rooms of the Building Room category are located.

A tour desk and ATMs are on site. </p><div class="photo" data-original="it.eureka-reservation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Internet corner in the hotel" class="if uuid-2572872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2572872.jpg"></div><p>  Wi-Fi is free in public areas.

Laundry and dry cleaning services are also available at a charge. </p><h2>  Catering </h2><p>  The Samui Laguna Resort does not have the all-inclusive concept, which is popular with tourists from Russia, as many guests prefer to have lunch and dinner at inexpensive restaurants and cafes specializing in local cuisine.  Therefore, when making a voucher, guests can pay one of the following systems: </p><ul><li>  BB - breakfast is included in the price; </li><li>  HB - tourists pay breakfast and lunch / dinner; </li><li>  FB - full board, the price of which includes three meals a day and some drinks. </li></ul><p>  The main Sunshine Restaurant is located on site and serves breakfast.

The hotel owns a separate section on the city coast, which is not allowed traders and local residents.  The beach here is completely sandy, there is no road between it and the hotel, which is appreciated by tourists with young children.  Its length is approximately 150 meters.  Sun loungers with mattresses and sun umbrellas are installed in the sand.  Tourists can borrow them for free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebookers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach view" class="if uuid-2572878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2572878.jpg"></div><p>  The complex also has a small outdoor pool with a depth of 2.8 meters.  It is filled with fresh water.  Its area is only 84 square meters.  m. Next to it is also a sun terrace, equipped with sunbeds with mattresses. </p><p>  In their free time from swimming and sunbathing, tourists can play table tennis or visit the massage room.  True, all services are provided for a fee.  The beach has a volleyball court.  There is also a water entertainment center.  For a fee, tourists can go windsurfing, water skiing, parachuting or canoeing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vtours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Open pool" class="if uuid-2572874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2572874.jpg"></div><h2>  Conditions for accommodating children </h2><p>  Samui Laguna Resort is a beachfront hotel in a peaceful location, making it suitable for an inexpensive family vacation.  Tourists with children of all ages are welcome here, but guests under 12 years old receive discounts on accommodation.  Guests can also count on an extra baby cradle if staying with babies under 2 years old.  For a fee, guests can hire a nanny, but she will not speak Russian.  The children's restaurant has high chairs for feeding. </p><p>  But there is no large selection of entertainment for children at the hotel.  There is also no separate pool for kids.  At the same time, there is no shallow compartment in the main pool either.  But the territory has a playground. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about Samui Laguna Resort </h2><p>  This hotel receives mixed reviews from tourists, but most of the guests enjoyed their stay in this place.  They believe that not the best quality of service is justified by the low cost of living.  In reviews, hotel guests describe many of its advantages, we list the most basic of them: </p><ul><li>  clean hotel beach with convenient gradual access to the sea; </li><li>  good location - next to the complex there is a cafe and a market; </li><li>  Cozy and well-groomed area surrounded by a tropical garden; </li><li>  Friendly staff, all employees, without exception, always greet guests; </li><li>  the prices in the restaurant and massage room are not very high, but the service at the hotel is better than in similar infrastructure facilities in the resort center. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="samui-laguna-resort.hotelsofkohsamui.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Outdoor terrace and bar" class="if uuid-2572869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2572869.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel criticism </h2><p>  Like other budget hotels, this complex receives a lot of negative feedback from tourists in whom they criticize the local service.  According to the guests, the hotel staff and guests should pay attention to the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  regular but poor housekeeping - dust remains on the furniture, and dirty spots can be seen on the floor; </li><li>  tourists saw large mice in the bungalow; </li><li>  the hotel has many cats that beg for food and make noise in the evenings; </li><li>  rooms need repair and replacement of furniture; </li><li>  in the evenings, a huge number of mosquitoes and midges appear on the street, so it‚Äôs better to immediately buy means to protect against them. </li></ul><p>  After reviewing reviews of Samui Laguna Resort 3 *, we can conclude that this hotel is suitable for budget accommodation.  But if you like to relax in comfort, then you should choose another hotel. </p>
