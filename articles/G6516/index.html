People come here to feel the spirit of America, and, as tourists say, the colorful Houston is in no way inferior to New York or Los Angeles. </p><h2>  Some facts about Houston </h2><p>  Tourists going on a long journey are interested in where Houston is located in the United States.  It is located on the Prime Mexican Lowland, 50 kilometers from the Gulf of Mexico, with which it is connected by an artificial channel suitable for shipping.  Due to its favorable geographical position, it is an important transportation center of America. </p>

    <p>  Ranking fourth in terms of population, the city, where life flows steadily, without any fuss, is named after General S. Houston, who has done a lot for the state.  In 1836, the Mexican army was defeated, and Texas proclaimed its independence.  The capital of an independent republic was Houston, which quickly turned from a small settlement into a developing and prosperous metropolis. </p><p>  The city of Houston in the USA is a multinational community, whose inhabitants come from different countries: Africa, Latin America, Mexico.  Along with the American one can often hear Spanish speech. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The southwestern part of the city is occupied by the NASA space center, which belongs to the federal government of the state.  It is interesting that the analogue of the Russian corporation Roscosmos conducts daily excursions for everyone. </p><p>  In the leading center of the oil, gas and energy industry, foreign companies open their representative offices, who invest whole fortunes, trying to occupy a niche in the market. </p><h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  The climate in Houston (USA) is subtropical.  The combination of strong summer heat, from which only the use of air conditioners saves, and very high humidity makes the weather intolerable for many vacationers. </p><p>  Winter is quite warm, and the average temperature is 10-12 ¬∞ C. Precipitation occurs both in the form of rain and in the form of snow, although this is a very rare occurrence for the city.  The most favorable period for visiting the tourist center is the months from October to April.  At this time, there is an influx of guests filling the streets.  Autumn and spring are ideal for exploring the city and beach holidays. </p><h2>  Museum district </h2><p>  Of great interest to tourists are the sights of Houston (USA), which are the main reasons for exploring it.  City guests go to the Museum District, where the bulk of cultural complexes, various galleries and exhibitions are located.  Some institutions do not charge money for admission, while others set hours for free visits.  It is curious that in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãmuseums, for the convenience of visitors, a miniature electric train runs that will take you to the right place. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  One of the most interesting institutions is the Museum of Fine Arts, where, along with permanent exhibitions, temporary ones are held, the Butterfly Center immersing the atmosphere of the jungle, the Museum of the History of the Burial, whose ancient artifacts demonstrate the burial culture. </p><h2>  City holidays </h2><p>  But the most popular attraction is rightfully considered a local rodeo, starting in late February and lasting 20 days.  Every year about two million people come to take part in the show and watch it.  Relliant Park is a place where sports are held, as well as fairs and various concerts.  This is the largest cultural event in <span>southern America,</span> and in terms of the scope and degree of coverage of the celebration, it can only be compared with the Olympic Games. </p>

    <p>  In early March, Houston (USA), whose photo attracts travelers from different countries, celebrates Texas Independence Day.  Each guest is immersed in the special atmosphere of the 19th century: live music sounds, cannons shoot, and the city turns into a reconstructed soldier‚Äôs camp. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hermann Park </h2><p>  Not far from the Museum Quarter is the largest park, where locals relax and tourists enjoy communicating with nature.  Hermann Park is a well-groomed <span>green area, whose</span> dense thickets will help to hide from the sweltering heat.  Its territory is bordered by a zoo, and strolling guests watch funny animals. </p>

    <h2>  NASA Center </h2><p>  No wonder the city is called the American gate to the sky.  The space center, considered the hallmark of Houston (Texas, USA), is an ideal place where you can spend the whole day with your family.  During the tour, visitors will get acquainted with the old <span>Mission Control Center,</span> see training complexes for <span>astronauts, spacesuits,</span> full-size apparatuses. </p><h2>  Beaches on the coast </h2><p>  Houston <span>(Texas,</span> USA) does not have its own beaches.  To get to the Gulf of Mexico, you have to overcome a considerable distance. </p><p>  Stewart Beach is a clean, paid beach where lifeguards work.  The recreation area, characterized by increased comfort, is incredibly popular.  This is a crowded place, so lovers of privacy will be uncomfortable here.  For a fee, you can rent an umbrella protecting from the sun and two chairs, play volleyball, tennis and have a picnic.  Drinking alcohol is prohibited and is punishable by a large fine. </p><p>  East Beach is another popular beach where you can drink strong drinks, so young people are always having fun and hanging out here.  In the summer, music festivals, volleyball tournaments, various competitions are held. </p><p>  Galveston Island State Park is chosen by couples with young children.  This is a wonderful place for lovers who want to be alone.  There is a small campsite on site, where you can relax while watching the picturesque landscapes. </p>

    <p>  Sand Castle Beach will appeal to those who are tired of noise and long for loneliness.  Located at a remote distance from Houston, it is not very well equipped like the rest of the beaches.  There are umbrellas with sunbeds, showers and toilets. </p><h2>  Recent tragedy </h2><p>  In Houston (USA), various disasters repeatedly occurred that did not result in human casualties, but caused material damage.  However, after the recent hurricane that hit Texas and the incessant tropical rainfall, the multimillion-dollar city almost went under water.  Large motorways have turned into rivers.  People who climbed onto the roofs of houses were evacuated by helicopters; many climbed out on rafts or canoes. </p>

    <p>  As the mayor recently said, Houston needs about $ 100 million to clean up the rubble.  Thousands of volunteers came here to help residents pull out sunken cars, prepare food, and save flood victims.  Unfortunately, the lives of the dead cannot be returned for any money, and 70 people are missing. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  As tourists who have visited Houston before the tragedy admit, this is not the city you fall in love with at first sight.  However, time passes, and he bewitches and captivates with the amazing charm of a modern metropolis.  Many were seized by children's delight at the sight of magnificent skyscrapers.  This is a special world where high technology complemented each other, creating the image of a well-groomed and clean village. </p><p>  However, this is a very green city, and the authorities of Houston (USA) <strong> </strong>  they took care of maintaining pacifying oases created for relaxation and stress relief.  Foreign guests who arrived here tired and exhausted returned full of energy, with a good mood and a huge charge of creative energy. </p><p>  Now the ruined city needs help, but residents do not give up, establishing their life after a hurricane.  People help each other without leaving anyone in trouble. </p>
