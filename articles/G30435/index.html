  <section class="page js-page"><h1>World History: Fascism in Italy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Fascism in Italy arose at the end of the nineteenth century, as a form of government and authoritarian nationalist ideology, the hallmarks of which were a strong <span>personality cult</span> and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãconstant wars.  Here, the state was recognized as the creator of law and gave individual freedoms a legal form.  Thus, it was not only a territorial and commercial institution, but also a spiritual and moral institution.  According to Mussolini, the country and the new ideology should elevate the people from primitive existence to the height of human power, the so-called empire.  Therefore, in his opinion, only fascism in Italy could solve the contradictions of capitalism.  Mussolini united the concepts of ‚Äúnation‚Äù and ‚Äústate‚Äù into one whole ‚Äî an individual or a group, which is a will, power, and domination having the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpower. </p><p>  Fascism in Italy arose earlier than in other countries.  Contributed to this political, economic and <span>social problems</span> caused by the outcome of the First World War.  The country was dominated by unemployment and poverty. </p><p>  After the war in Italy, which was able to obtain some land, the city of Risk was declared free, which caused public outrage.  The government did not intervene in the occupation of the city by the troops of Gabriele D'Annunzio.  They ruled there for sixteen months, thereby introducing elements of fascism into the country. </p><p>  Later, the Combat Units organization, led by Mussolini, took D'Annunzio's political style as an example.  Mussolini unites the organization into a fascist party (NFP) and organizes a mass movement. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The ideology of the new movement attracted participants in the war, as well as young people who saw in it a political force, from which they expected solutions to national and personal problems.  Fascism in Italy actually continued the world <span>war with a</span> civil <span>war</span> .  At the same time, the police and the government, without interfering in the activities of the movement, encouraged its actions.  Thus, fascism received strong support from the CPSU and landlord unions.  In addition, Mussolini was appointed prime minister of the country. </p><p>  Already in 1921, Mussolini became the head of the Italian government, and by 1924 his party was gaining a majority of votes, which allowed it to dominate the parliament.  Thus, over time, fascist corporations began to be created, which helped the head of government completely suppress the parliament and create the Chamber of fascist organizations.  As a result, new laws began to be promulgated, which allowed Mussolini to expand power at the expense of parliament, contributed to the dissolution of the city‚Äôs meetings of deputies, as well as the abolition of freedom of association and the press.  Over time, the tendency of a sole dictatorship appeared.  The fascist party becomes part of the state apparatus of a country such as Italy.  Fascism was characterized by mass terror.  Often in the country there were suppressions of mass protests and bloody reprisals against dissidents.  The property of Mussolini's dictatorship was external expansion, he outlined the course for the revival of the Roman Empire.  Through this program, many countries were captured.  And in 1940, Italy, together with Germany and Japan, declared war on England and France, and, after some time, Greece.  At this time, the Italian press was full of promises about the imminent revival of the European Roman Empire, but the final was not at all as expected. </p><p>  Thus, considering the history of those years, it should be said that fascism in Italy and Germany began its development as a result of the economic, social and <span>political crisis</span> in the post-war years.  And if Mussolini came to power three years after the founding of the party and strengthened it six years later, Hitler seized power only thirteen years later, but within six months he eliminated all the forces that competed with him.  An important role of individuals in the establishment of a <span>totalitarian regime</span> in countries.  They imposed their ideas, concentrated military production, and developed the economy using mass terror. </p>
