Today it is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe.  Lovers of beach holidays are especially in demand for tours to Larnaca.  This resort will tell you about the attractions of the resort and its hotels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sigmalive.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Larnaca Hotels" class="if uuid-2324834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2324834.jpg"></div><h2>  Larnaca (Cyprus): history </h2><p>  It is believed that the city arose on the site of the ancient Kition, which existed before 12 BC.  e.  According to legend, it was founded by the grandson of Noah and was surrounded by cyclopean ramparts.  He was later captured by the Phoenicians, and in the 4th century BC.  e.  the city was born the famous ancient Greek philosopher Zeno. </p><p>  In the first century on the territory of modern Larnaca, the resurrected by Christ Lazarus settled, nicknamed the Four-Day.  He lived there until the end of his life, and was buried in the crypt, which has survived to this day.  It is with his grave that the name Larnaca, which translates as a tomb, is also associated. </p><p>  In ancient times, for many centuries, the local Phoenician port was one of the most important points of copper trade in the region, and today it operates the largest international airport of the island of Cyprus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cyprusalive.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fortress of larnaca" class="if uuid-2324353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2324353.jpg"></div><h2>  Natural attractions of Larnaca </h2><p>  The resort is a real find for those who like to combine a beach holiday with visits to monuments of architecture, history and nature.  In Larnaca, tourists can see a unique salt lake with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã2.2 square meters.  km  In winter, it becomes a haven for tens of thousands of migratory birds.  Among them, pink flamingos are of particular interest.  They fly to the resort to enjoy a rare species of shrimp that live in the waters of the Larnaca Salt Lake.  In addition to flamingos, on its banks more than 85 species of waterfowl are saved from the cold. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical Monuments of Larnaca </h2><p>  At the entrance to the city from the side of Limassol, the attention of tourists will most likely be attracted by the 18th century aqueduct, consisting of 75 arches, built during the Ottoman rule at the expense of the Ottoman ruler of the island.  In ancient times, it was used to provide the city with water from a spring located 9 km from Larnaca.  The aqueduct operated until 1939, after which a modern water supply system was built. </p><p>  Other interesting sights of Larnaca and Cyprus include the Hala Sultan mosque complex, located on the opposite side of the salt lake.  According to legend, the aunt of the prophet Muhammad, Umm Haram, is buried there.  The woman was married to one of the famous Arab commanders and came with him to Cyprus during one of the raids, where she died.  Ten centuries later, a mausoleum was built over her resting place, and at the beginning of the 19th century a mosque appeared next to it.  At the moment, the Hala Sultan is considered one of the important Muslim shrines. </p><p>  Long before the Turkish conquerors appeared in Cyprus, the locals believed in the Savior.  To this day, Christian traditions are strong on the island.  This is evidenced by many Orthodox churches that have survived to this day.  for example, 6 km from the city is the Church of Panagia Angeloktistos.  The temple was built in the 11th century on the ruins of an early Christian basilica.  Inside the church, a mosaic image of the Blessed Virgin Mary with the baby Christ in her arms, surrounded by the archangels Michael and Gabriel, which dates from the 5th century, has been preserved. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="bnr.bg" data-author=": " data-source="https://bnr.bg/blagoevgrad/post/100287865/hiladni-preletni-ptici-zimuvat-v-ezerata-i-vlajnite-zoni-na-kipar"><img itemprop="image" alt="Salt Lake" class="if uuid-2324831" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2324831.jpg"></div><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  Larnaca in Cyprus is one of the few cities where fans will not be bored to inspect museum exhibits. </p><p>  First of all, tourists should visit the art galleries of the city.  They are rather modest, but there you can see interesting works of Cypriot and foreign artists.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, a special gallery deserves special attention, where the works of Theo Michael are exhibited.  Travelers can buy their favorite paintings there and chat with their author. </p><p>  It will be interesting for fans of wonders to visit the <span>museum of medicine,</span> where old instruments are exhibited, with the help of which many centuries ago doctors performed surgical operations and performed anesthesia.  The only negative - the institution is open only on Wednesdays and Saturdays. </p><p>  As elsewhere, where the breath of Ancient Greece is felt, in the city of Larnaca, Cyprus has an archaeological museum.  It is located near the Finikoudes alley.  There, tourists will see the remains of columns, huge antique amphora and statues.  Several halls of the museum are lined with crockery, and a large antique press for the production of olive oil is exhibited in the courtyard. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sigmalive.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="monastery in Larnaca" class="if uuid-2324357" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2324357.jpg"></div><h2>  Larnaca Fortress </h2><p>  The medieval castle is one of the main attractions of the city.  Its construction began in the 14th century and was completed only after 3 centuries in 1625.  Before the capture of the island by the British, Fort Larnaca performed its defensive functions, but was then turned into a prison for dangerous criminals, where prisoners were often executed. </p><p>  Today, tourists can walk around the fortress for free, and those who buy tickets will be offered to get acquainted with the exposition of a small museum, which displays ancient weapons and other exhibits related to the history of the castle. </p><h2>  Promenade </h2><p>  Among the attractions of Larnaca (Cyprus), photos of which are most often seen in tourist avenues, this corner of the resort has a special place.  It is difficult to find a tourist who would not spend evenings on the promenade of Finikoudes during a vacation on the southeastern coast of the island, along which slender rows of date palms rise.  Among other things, there are many bars, traditional taverns and restaurants with excellent cuisine.  The Monte Carlo establishment is especially popular with vacationers, which serve the freshest seafood, and lovers of delicious wines enjoy visiting the conceptual retro bar Istante. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Larnaca streets" class="if uuid-2324830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2324830.jpg"></div><h2>  Resort beaches </h2><p>  If you are planning a vacation to Larnaca in Cyprus, reviews from tourists will help you decide on a beach.  In particular, most of those who have already rested on the island recommend giving preference to the Pila and Finikoudes beaches if you are going on a trip with your children.  Mackenzie is more suitable for young people, where after sunset you can have plenty of fun in night clubs, and lovers of a relaxing holiday should go to Castella near the coastal village of Psarolimano or Faros in the village of Pervolia. </p><p>  In Larnaca, snorkelling enthusiasts who should visit the small eco-beach Yanates will not be bored either. </p><p>  Generally speaking, all the beaches of the resort are marked with white flags, which indicates their cleanliness.  The only thing that can upset vacationers is not the most attractive gray color of sand.  However, this is fully compensated by the fact that almost all Larnaca beaches are free and you can come there with your own umbrella or sit down with a towel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Larnaca Embankment" class="if uuid-2324829" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2324829.jpg"></div><h2>  Larnaca Hotels in Cyprus </h2><p>  The resort is not among the super prestigious, so it is easy to find inexpensive apartments and cheap hotels located in the tourist area there.  Moreover, if you search well, you can check into a room in a guest house or hotel in a couple of minutes walk from the beach. </p><p>  Even in high season you can find a budget option costing 37-45 euros (2585-3140 rubles) per night, and for 50 euros / 3500 rubles.  You can rent apartments that are not inferior in comfort to a three-star hotel with good reviews.  At the same time, in Larnaca you can count on your fingers luxury hotels.  The best rooms with half board in such institutions will cost 430-540 euros (30-37.7 thousand rubles). </p><p>  For families who choose Larnaca in Cyprus for their holidays, reviews are recommended to give preference to apartments that are spacious and comfortable.  In addition, choosing this option of accommodation, you can cook your own food, which is especially important if you come on vacation with children. </p><h2>  How to get to Larnaca by air </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the city has the main international airport of Cyprus.  For Russians, the easiest way to get to the resort is by air, especially since there are regular and charter flights from many cities of our country. </p><p>  The most budget option is from Victory, which has a flight from Vnukovo to Larnaca costs about 70 euros / 4,890 rubles.  However, you will have to pay extra for baggage.  The flight on S7, Ural Airlines and Yamal airlines will cost a little more. </p><p>  The cost of tickets in this case will be 105-140 euros (7300-9700 rubles). </p><p>  From St. Petersburg, regular direct flights to Larnaca are carried out by Russia and Ural Airlines.  Economy class tickets in both cases will cost 146 EUR / 10,200 rubles. </p><h2>  Trip to the resort "by land" </h2><p>  Tourists with a Schengen multivisa can make a ‚Äúmultimodal‚Äù trip to Larnaca by bus and ferry on the route Moscow - Tbilisi - Batumi - Mersin - Republic of Northern Cyprus - Larnaca.  However, given the complicated relations between Cyprus and Turkey, such a trip, costing about 150 euros (10,400 rubles), may not go very smoothly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="keywordsuggest.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Strinnaya street in Larnaca" class="if uuid-2324833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2324833.jpg"></div><p>  Now you know which <span>Larnaca beaches</span> in Cyprus are suitable for families with children or water sports.
