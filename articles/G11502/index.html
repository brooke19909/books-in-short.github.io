    <p>  The underground parking is spacious, it is convenient to call into it from the territory of the complex.  In the cold season, it is heated, due to which it will be an excellent alternative to the garage.  The tenants are also pleased with the rapid development of the infrastructure of the complex: in the near future a fitness center with a swimming pool will be open, where you can always spend time after a hard working day. </p><p>  For families with small children, the complex has kindergartens, schools, as well as modern playgrounds and sports grounds for active outdoor games and the physical development of children of different ages.  Judging by the reviews of residents, the project fully justifies the status of business-class housing and the hopes that potential buyers have on it. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Given the information about the complex, the reviews of residents, we can safely recommend it to all those who have long dreamed of their own housing.  LCD Marshal (October Field) is a business class project located in one of the most prestigious areas of the capital.
