That is why the lessons of grandmothers on knitting, mothers on embroidery, grandfathers on woodcarving and dads on burning are so often remembered.  All this creativity, which helps not only to escape from everyday difficulties.  For some, this is a real way to make money.  The uniqueness of handmade crafts brings them special value.  Today we will consider one of the techniques that will allow you to create real masterpieces. </p><h2>  The uniqueness of the patterns created by the thread </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fantastic flowers" class="if uuid-2723320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98521/2723320.jpg"></div><p>  Nitkografiya - drawing with threads, this is an unconventional technique.  With its help, you can create unique crafts that will not compete, since everything will depend only on the imagination of the author.  True, for each artist who will use this technique, the paintings will be very diverse.  After all, the images that he will create on paper by drawing with a thread of paint will be absolutely unique not only in terms of his style, but also in what the artist could see in this image. </p><h2>  Nitkografiya for children </h2><p>  Most often, this technique is used in classes in kindergartens.  Threading helps children not only develop imaginative thinking, have a creative approach to some non-traditional situations.  Such art requires perseverance and helps young artists learn how to control their fingers.  And besides this, every masterpiece created by a child becomes absolutely unique and inimitable, because a children's, not yet sophisticated fantasy is included in the work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Core tools </h2><p>  So, the threading technique itself is quite simple, requires a little skill and a lot of imagination.  What do you need for work?  A sheet of thick white paper, you can from the album.  Someone prefers smooth ones, because the pattern is smoother on them, someone seeks to expand the scope for the possibilities of their imagination and uses rough paper.  Next, you need a thread.  You can take several <span>types of threads,</span> try on a separate sheet how the paint left by them is laid, and then choose what you like.  And, of course, the paint itself.  For starters, it can be the cheapest watercolor or gouache.  When the technique of drawing with a thread is sufficiently mastered, it will be possible to purchase more expensive materials to create real masterpieces.  Still need dishes, in which the thread itself will be dyed. </p><p>  For a more even dyeing of threads, it is better not to take disposable dishes.  An uneven surface of the bottom can disrupt the structure of the thread, making the pattern become sloppy.  A brush is also useful, with the help of which a wonderful thread will absorb paints.  And in order not to make a mess on the table, a box for used strings.  It‚Äôs worth laying them without mixing colors.  Throw them away is not recommended, then it will be clear why. </p><h2>  We begin to create a unique picture </h2><p>  To work, cut the thread into small, 30-40 centimeters, segments.  For starters, this is the perfect size.  Place the thread in the dye bowl.  The ends of the threads must be brought out so that they remain clean.  Choose your favorite color.  You can create your own shade by mixing colors.  Apply paint to the thread with a brush, trying to soak it as best as possible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next sheet folded grinding.  For the dry ends, pull the thread out of the container with the paint and, as your fantasy suggests, lay it on one side of a sheet of paper.  You can do two at once, but this requires a good skill, because when the sheet is bent, the thread can move out and ruin the pattern.  You can lay out circles, loops, zigzags - how the imagination works.  Dry tips bring down the sheet.  Cover with the other side of the sheet the part on which the thread with paint is laid out.  Press the sheet firmly, for example, with a book, gently pull the thread outwards by the dry ends. </p><p>  Depending on how the thread is stretched, you get a different pattern.  You can pull both ends at once, you can only pull one, pull it gently or sharply in turn.  Lay out the sheet and carefully look at what happened.  And it turns out a mirror image of fantastic lines. </p><h2>  Drawing an image </h2><p>  Children immediately begin to see in them the most incredible images.  They can only finish the missing details.  To do this, you can use the same paints, pencils, crayons and felt-tip pens.  Looking at how children widely use their internal capabilities, we can recall that once upon a time everyone had a similar potential.  That is why it is recommended that adults not only teach children the technique of drawing with floss and paint, but also join them in order to revive their asleep imagination again.  In addition, over time, adults get used to the main form of their work mechanically, which interferes with the development of not only creative potential, but also motor skills.  When using this technique, the brain will have to use those parts that have long ceased to respond to the outside world - the parts responsible for the joy of creativity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Bringing variety with different threads </h2><p>  You can diversify the technique of drawing with a thread using yarn of various textures.  For example, a thin and even thread such as iris or floss will give the picture a delicate and elegant line.  Yarn made of wool or acrylic will add volume and brightness.  Just use them at the same time will not work due to different thicknesses.  You will have to do the drawing in several stages, always waiting for the previous layer to dry.  <span>Woolen</span> drawing is more convenient for young children or the elderly, whose fingers are not very sensitive.  However, do not neglect the finer work.  It is always worth improving in drawing with the help of threads and paints. </p><h2>  Colorful selection </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.schoolpaints.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Experiments with flowers" class="if uuid-2723491" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98521/2723491.jpg"></div><p>  With paints, you can also conduct some experiments.  It is very interesting to watch children who know absolutely nothing about color harmony, but confidently dye the threads in one color or another, achieving unrealistic results.  You are simply amazed at what various illustrations are obtained as a result.  When creating a creation for an adult, a person will have to think about a combination of colors in order to teach a child, by example, not only to stain paper with different colors, but to make images that are pleasing to the eye. </p><h2>  Fantastic flowers </h2><p>  Threading flowers is very popular.  To do this, it‚Äôs worth keeping in your head an approximate version of the picture, which should be the result.  The thread drawing technique provides for various drawing options.  You can dye the thread in one color, you can in two or more, you only need to consider that when drawing a certain picture it already makes sense to choose the colors according to the desired result.  Flowers are drawn by laying out the stitches with loops.  Depending on the expected result, the threads are pulled down, to the sides or stretched, and then pulled out on one side.  This technique of drawing with a thread helps to realize your fantasies in an unusual way.  Here it is possible to experiment not only with form, but also with color.  Superimposed on each other, the colors take on absolutely incredible shades that are sometimes simply impossible to predict. </p><p>  Thus, you can draw the whole picture, and then draw it, as the fantasy suggests.  And you can cut out individual petals and make an application out of them.  Such work is often used in classes in the lower grades of high school.  They help not only develop imagination, but also accuracy. </p><h2>  Decoration pattern </h2><div class="photo" data-original="windwoodstone.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Winter landscape of threads" class="if uuid-2723422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98521/2723422.jpg"></div><p>  When the drawing is completely ready, it can be decorated using an unconventional threading technique.  For this technique, you will need an additional transparent glue, a thin stick (you can use a toothpick or the back of the brush), scissors, dyed and dried strings, with which a picture was drawn.  You can just take the threads of different colors. </p><p>  Sort the threads by color.  Cut them into small pieces, literally a few millimeters.  Put in different containers.  Next, you should carefully look at the drawing and decide which part should be decorated with such drawing with the help of threads cut into small pieces.  Spread these places with a brush with glue and pour on them segments of those shades that are suitable for this fragment of the picture.  To adjust a thread with a toothpick or the other side of the brush, which are unevenly laid or go beyond the border of the picture.  For stronger fixation, fragments with cut threads can be coated with glue additionally on top.  This will give gloss applications.  But if you want the picture to look more voluminous, then you should leave it as it is. </p><h2>  Multi-colored thread paintings </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thriftyfun.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thread picture" class="if uuid-2723313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98521/2723313.jpg"></div><p>  Threading can be more than just paint.  Extraordinary paintings can be created using the remains of thread after knitting or embroidery.  Nitkography includes several more techniques.  For one of them it is necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãcardboard or a piece of fiberboard, pencil, transparent glue, brushes, scissors, threads, stick.  A drawing is drawn on the cardboard.  Next, a contour is drawn on it with glue, a thread is laid out on it, which will highlight the picture.  And again, it all depends on the imagination - the thickness of the threads, and color, and pattern, and ornament.  We apply glue with a brush, spread the thread on it with a stick, trying not to leave gaps, tightly and evenly.  The result is a unique masterpiece that remains ironed and inserted into the frame. </p><h2>  Isonity Technique </h2><p>  Non-traditional threading is also possible using the isonity technique.  This technique is more complicated not only in equipment, but also in execution.  She will need not only cardboard and glue, but also an awl, polystyrene foam, a special board with holes or nails, a needle with a wide eye, a bag or file for the substrate, an awl, as well as diagrams with numbers by which crafts will be created. </p><h2>  Embroidery </h2><div class="photo" data-original="shredtattoos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Owl. The technique of sinking" class="if uuid-2723460" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98521/2723460.jpg"></div><p>  The first way to work with isonia is very similar to embroidery.  The cardboard is applied with a pencil or felt-tip pen.  Then, holes are pierced with an awl, according to the selected pattern.  Holes must be numbered to get a specific pattern.  For clarity, you can draw it with a simple pencil on the back.  Then it will be clearly visible what should be the result. </p><p>  When the basic preparation is completed, you need to choose a needle with a wide eye, the threads that will be used for this craft, and get to work.  From the inside we make loops, from the face we embroider a pattern.  Mastery is always comprehended from simple to complex.  This technique is no exception.  Do not rush to go to complex processes.  Do not pull the thread or leave it hanging loose.  The force of pulling the thread greatly affects the aesthetic appearance of the craft.  From various elements embroidered in this way, you can create unique paintings. </p><h2>  Voluminous crafts </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ixotype.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sinking picture" class="if uuid-2723297" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98521/2723297.jpg"></div><p>  Another technique for working with isothony involves pulling it between numbered cloves inserted into the holes of a special board in the form of a figure.  To begin with, the thread is lowered into the glue and soaked in it.  A file or a plastic bag is placed on the board.  Nails or special construction rivets according to a certain pattern are inserted into holes specially made in the board.  Construction rivets are safer and more convenient to use.  A thread impregnated with glue is wound on them. </p><p>  The product can be made voluminous if you do not press it firmly against the board.  You can not pull the thread too much to create an impression of some chaotic fullness inside the figure.  The finished figure must be left on the cloves until completely dry.  When it dries, it can be removed from the carnations and used as a separate toy, or as an element of a certain picture. </p><h2>  The final chord in the work on the masterpiece </h2><div class="photo" data-original="threadpaintedart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thread picture" class="if uuid-2723413" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98521/2723413.jpg"></div><p>  Crafts must be inserted into the framework.  Without them, any masterpiece looks like a piece of paper with threads.  Recently, homemade baguette frames have been very popular.  Selected in color for the interior and the picture and neatly made, they can well compete with real rich frames, and weigh much less, which makes them much more convenient to use and transport. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="HQIZMdfSokc" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=HQIZMdfSokc" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/7/4/9/7/7497.jpg"></div><p>  All the techniques listed here have the opportunity for a separate existence.  They can be worked out and developed each separately, brought to perfection, created masterpieces that will be a great decoration for your home or an unforgettable gift for friends.  You can combine techniques with each other.  Then these crafts will become even more original and unique. </p><p>  If there are children in the house, for them it will be a wonderful training for fine motor skills, and for the development of imagination, and for aesthetic and labor education.  And most importantly, children will feel part of something meaningful, creating decoration for their room with their parents. </p>
