  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitting Mittens Knitting Themselves!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In winter, you can‚Äôt do without mittens.  Of course, mittens can simply be bought at a store or from some granny.  But if you want to be original and fashionable even in small things, then it is best <span>to knit mittens with</span> knitting needles yourself.  Moreover, this option involves a more suitable choice of <span>colors</span> and a kind of pattern. </p><p>  In general, there are many ways to make mittens.  You can knit a mittens on two knitting needles with a cloth, then fold the finished part in half and stitch it.  By the way, you can sew with a thick contrasting seam ‚Äúover the edge‚Äù - this will be a model in the ‚Äúcountry‚Äù style.  Usually, on two knitting needles, the product is performed by beginning needlewomen who have not yet mastered circular knitting, and their non-working needles constantly drop out. </p><p>  But more often, <span>mittens are knitted</span> with needles on five needles.  This method is the most common and convenient for more or less experienced craftswomen.  Typically, 12 or 13 loops are typed on each of the four knitting needles.  Their number depends on the density of knitting, the thickness of the knitting needles and yarn, so it can vary. </p><p>  First, you should perform an elastic band if it is supposed to make mittens with knitting needles with an entrance adjacent to the arm.  But today, fashionistas often prefer a wide rubberless entrance at the gloves, sometimes trimmed with tassels.  Knitting mittens is also an art.  And often the craftswomen invent such original models that their products become exclusive masterpieces. </p><p>  You can diversify the product with a convex original pattern without resorting to a yarn of a different color.  for example, knit on the back of the spit mittens or "braid".  And you can try and perform a convex bunch of grapes or a cute owl - a symbol of wisdom and longevity. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But mittens with a multi-colored pattern on the back of the mitten are very fashionable today.  It can be a flower or a geometric ornament, a funny face of an animal or a beautiful fruit.  It all depends on the imagination of the future owner of the product and the skill of the needlewoman. </p><p>  Mittens can be decorated with embroidery, beads and sequins.  Some people prefer to sew artificial branches of currants or acorns on them, flowers or small bouquets made of plastic, wood, made of beads or knitted from yarn.  And you can sew separately connected ears to the tied muzzle of the animal - let them sway slightly while moving, cheering their master! </p><p>  Kids are very fond of moving eyes.  So it is quite easy to translate into reality.  You can sew ordinary buttons on a funny animal face, or you can buy for these purposes in specialized stores that sell everything for needlework, transparent plastic eyes with "pupils" rolling inside.  Here the baby will have joy when he receives mittens ‚Äì a toy as a gift! </p><p>  So, with decorations for mittens, knitting needles, we figured out.  Now we should move on to the most difficult stage - knitting the thumb.  Usually, knitters in the place where it is supposed to knit a ‚Äúhouse‚Äù for him, transfer 7-9 stitches to a <span>safety pin</span> or piece of thread and continue knitting in a circle until they get to the loops removed.  Here it is necessary to dial the removed number of loops on the working needle and continue knitting.  Thus, the craftswoman gets a hole in the place where the thumb will subsequently be tied. </p><p>  When the main knitting stage is completed, the needlewoman transfers the removed loops to the working knitting needle, gets additional loops from the top of the hole onto the other two knitting needles and evenly distributes the loops on three needles.  The finger is usually knitted on four knitting needles with the same basic tone. </p><p>  When the knit closes to half the nail of the thumb, you should begin to reduce the number of loops, the so-called "closing of the finger."  Reduction should be done evenly and gradually, 3 loops per row (one on each spoke).  When there are two loops left on them, you can break the thread and stretch it through the remaining loops, then tighten and fasten it with a knot.  The free end, as well as the tip of the thread after closing the entire mitten, is tucked into the mittens with a hook.  Unless, of course, the craftswoman did not think of using these tips to hang original brushes or bombs on them. </p>
