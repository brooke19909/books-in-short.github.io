It was a litmus test, showing the whole world that the Red Army at that time was the most powerful and combat-ready.  The liberation of Poland and a large part of Czechoslovakia, and then access to the Oder, 70 km from Berlin, is not the whole list of goals achieved.  But first things first. </p>

    <h2>  General situation at the fronts </h2><p>  The German war machine no longer represented the same strength and threat as at the beginning of the war.  A series of crushing defeats on the Eastern Front forced the Germans to go on the defensive.  And now the Red Army, which has qualitatively changed for the better over the years, has imposed its initiative.  The seriousness of the threat posed by the Soviet troops is indicated by mean figures.  Out of 314 divisions and 8 brigades of German troops, at least 198 divisions and 6 brigades were allocated to withstand the armed forces of the Soviet Union.  The Germans fiercely resisted, but gradually fears and doubts forced them to hate the F√ºhrer for drawing Germany into a meat grinder.  The Allied landings in Normandy also did not add optimism.  Operation The Watch on the Rhine, undertaken by Wehrmacht troops, was only an attempt to stabilize the Western Front and give time to further strengthen the Siegfried Line, and then concentrate maximum efforts to repel the Soviet threat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The myth of the salvation of the allies under the Ardennes </h2><p>  Furious propaganda, which has long fallen upon a simple layman, on both sides, leads away from the truth.  On the one hand, they demonize Stalin and reduce the heroic role of the Red Army, slyly forgetting to talk about the far-reaching plans of the United States to use the atomic bomb, including against the Soviet Union.  In such a situation, the most decisive measures were necessary to save the already suffering people from an even greater nightmare.  And on the other hand, ‚Äúcheers-patriots‚Äù tell the story of the worthlessness of the allies and their prayers and requests for salvation under the Ardennes.  This version is much more interesting, because it makes the cheeks even more important to swell from their own exclusivity and invincibility.  Facts point to a third version.  Understanding this key historical event brings us closer to the answer to the question: ‚ÄúWhy did the Wisla-Oder strategic offensive operation begin ahead of schedule?‚Äù </p>

    <h2>  ‚ÄúWatch on the Rhine‚Äù </h2><p>  From the very beginning, this operation undertaken by the Wehrmacht troops was adventurous.  Her main task was to inflict a local defeat on the Allied forces in order to give Germany a respite, which she needed as air.  The strengthening of the Soviet Army was alarming, and it was not possible for the German command to fight on two fronts.  For these purposes, 5.6 and 7 tank armies were allocated.  It was they who, according to the Germans' idea, had to break into the defense of 4 infantry and 1 <span>tank division,</span> go to the river Meuse, and then strike in 3 main directions: Liege, Brussels and Antwerp.  But in solving these problems there were too many unknowns where one had to rely on chance.  The success of the operation could be ensured by several conditions: capture of captured fuel, weather and fast movement.  The underestimation of the American soldiers ultimately led to the collapse.  As for requests for help, which, according to some historians, have taken place, such allegations are untenable.  You can easily verify this yourself by reading the correspondence between Churchill and Stalin, since these letters are in the public domain.  The Vistula-Oder offensive operation solved other tasks.  The enemy remained strong and yet undefeated, continuing to oppress other nations.  And to end this war was possible only in Berlin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The number of Soviet troops </h2><p>  The First Belorussian and First Ukrainian Fronts represented enormous <span>military force.</span>  They included 16 combined arms, 4 tank and 2 air armies.  Over five thousand aircraft, seven thousand tanks and 37 thousand guns and mortars.  About one and a half million people of manpower.  The Red Army received new equipment.  Soviet pilots almost completely controlled German airspace.  The level of skill and tactical art has also increased significantly.  In Poland, during the Vistula-Oder offensive operation, the Red Army demonstrated a brilliant example of a blitzkrieg.  I. S. Konev and G. K. Zhukov were appointed to command the fronts.  Assistance was provided by K.K. Rokossovsky, I.E. Petrov, as well as Pole General S.G. Poplavsky (commander of the Polish armed forces). </p>

    <h2>  The number of troops from the German side </h2><p>  <span>German troops</span> had three armies, which included 28 divisions and 2 brigades - a little more than 400 thousand people, about 5 thousand guns and mortars, more than a thousand tanks and assault guns and about 600 aircraft.  <span>The German army</span> was pretty battered.  At the end of the war, the entire male population aged 16 to 60 was subject to general mobilization.  The Germans switched to defensive actions and in the strategic plan were clearly losing, since the attacking side almost always imposes its initiative. </p><h2>  The first miscalculations of the Germans </h2><p>  1944 year.  Wis≈Ço-Oder strategic operation.  The reasons for the postponement of the offensive date in Soviet historiography are called the Allies' request for support and bad weather conditions.  The statement of Soviet historians (for propaganda purposes) that allegedly the Soviet troops launched the offensive without waiting for the completion of preparations can be challenged.  There is two evidence for this: the preserved correspondence between Winston Churchill and Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, as well as the plan for the concentration of the 1st Belorussian Front, approved by Zhukov.  The approval date is December 29, 1944.  By the beginning of the Vistula-Oder offensive operation, the Red Army disposed of the Sandomierz, Magnushevsky and Pulovsky bridgeheads, concentrating their troops on them.  The Soviet command proceeded from considerations that the Germans would know the direction of the main attack.  However, it was already so obvious.  <span>Sandomierz Bridgehead was</span> best suited for this role.  Therefore, breaking into the German defenses was logical on a wide front.  The bet was on the strength and surprise of the first strike.  Difficulties were added by weather conditions: it was impossible to fully use artillery and aircraft.  The Germans, following Hitler's instructions, tightened reserves, and this was their main mistake.  The work of Soviet artillery exceeded all expectations: both the first echelon of defense and sufficiently large reserve forces found their death. </p>

    <h2>  Soviet blitzkrieg </h2><p>  The history of the Vistula-Oder operation totals 23 days.  Starting the offensive with a front width of about 500 kilometers, at the end of the operation, Soviet troops expanded the front to 1,000 kilometers.  The pace of the offensive was about 25 kilometers, and this was the first time for the Red Army.  At the maximum of its forces, aviation worked, providing cover, transporting goods and conducting bombardment of the enemy.  At the end of the supply operation, they were slightly out of tune, but this did not prevent the Red Army soldiers from performing assigned combat missions.  During the Vistula-Oder offensive operation, interactions between the various arms were perfectly demonstrated.  Pupils surpassed their teachers.  If we compare the offensive operations of the German troops in 1939 and the Soviet in 1945, the differences are striking.  The Germans were opposed by a much weaker Polish army.  Soviet troops fought with the enemy, which until recently was considered the best in the world.  The success of the Soviet troops was due to the initiative of the advanced units.  The pursuit of the enemy was carried out almost around the clock, the Nazis were not given the opportunity to regroup and provide serious resistance.  The tactics of using tanks has changed.  Previously, their use was massive, but now they were crushed to a company to support infantry battalions. </p><h2>  Losses on both sides </h2><p>  During the Vistula-Oder offensive operation, Soviet troops lost about two percent of their personnel.  If these figures are disclosed in more detail, then people who heroically give their lives, health, and lose friends and relatives pop up behind them.  The irreparable losses of the 1st Belorussian Front amounted to 17,032 people.  Sanitary losses - 60 310 people.  The 1st Ukrainian Front permanently lost 26,319 people, 89,564 people were hospitalized.  The 1st <span>Army of the Polish Army,</span> consisting of 90,900 soldiers, lost 225 people killed and 841 wounded. The losses of the Germans alone as prisoners amounted to over 150,000 people.  Thirty-five divisions were completely defeated, and from 25 to 50% of the personnel were missed. </p>

    <h2>  On the outskirts of Berlin </h2><p>  The results of the Vistula-Oder strategic offensive operation were of great importance in the defeat of fascist Germany.  Ahead loomed Berlin.  Behind are liberated territories and saved lives.  Hitler's final defeat was not far off.  This operation greatly helped the armed forces of Great Britain and the United States.  The liberated territories slowly but surely began to restore pre-war life and statehood.  The Wisla-Oder offensive operation made Western partners think for themselves, cherishing the hope of starting a war with the Soviet Union after the defeat of Germany.  Churchill‚Äôs famous speech, which, in fact, marked the beginning of the Cold War, was just ahead. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The causes and consequences of the Vistula-Oder offensive operation to this day cause a lot of controversy due to interference in the study of this historical period of ideology.  But in history, the most important facts and evidence.  One thing is not in doubt: the heroism and courage of the Soviet soldiers allowed to extinguish the plague of hatred and obscurantism in the face of the Nazi regime in Germany.  Any political speculation on this subject is inappropriate.  Unfortunately, so far only Russia has a clear position, saying that it will not allow trampling the peace and memory of the great Soviet soldiers. </p>
