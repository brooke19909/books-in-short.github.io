We have to find the answer to this question further.  In general, sometimes such information may come in handy.  For example, if a person found someone else's plastic.  Returning it under similar circumstances is not difficult.  But even without the name and surname of the card holder, you can return it to its owner.  We will talk about this later.  In fact, everything is not as difficult as it seems. </p>

    <h2>  Chances of success </h2><p>  Can I find out the cardholder by card number?  Or is it worth abandoning this venture? </p><p>  It is impossible to unequivocally answer a similar question.  The thing is that the chances of success directly depend on the specific situation.  In some cases, obtaining information about the owner of the plastic is a simple task.  And it happens that you can return the card without the data of a citizen. </p><h2>  Failed translations </h2><p>  Consider several different situations in which the above information is required.  Is it possible to recognize the owner of the plastic by the card number, to which the funds were transferred unsuccessfully (by mistake)? </p><p>  Yes, but not fully.  For example, Sberbank can display only the name and patronymic of a citizen, as well as the first letter of a surname.  That is, to understand 100% to whom the funds were transferred, will not work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To get at least such information, you have to: </p><ol><li>  Log in to Sberbank Online.  If you use a card of another bank, you must select the appropriate banking. </li><li>  Start the operation to repeat the transfer of funds. </li><li>  Look at the column "Recipient". </li></ol><p>  There is no need to complete the transaction.  Thus, a person will be able to indirectly recognize the middle name and name of the recipient of funds by the card number. </p>

    <h2>  Banks and personal data </h2><p>  Is it possible to recognize the owner of plastic by the card number by contacting the bank directly?  After all, it is in financial organizations that customer information is stored. </p><p>  Under current law, last names, first names, patronymics and other data on citizens cooperating with banks are not disclosed.  This is confidential information.  And if you ask an employee of a financial institution to name the data of the plastic holder, the applicant will be denied legally. </p><p>  The exception is law enforcement.  They are provided with information about citizens by card numbers exclusively during certain investigations.  Just like that, this information was not disclosed. </p><h2>  Card Types and Data </h2><p>  How to find out the owner by Sberbank card number?  We have already met one rather interesting trick.  But it is not exhaustive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that the answer to the question under study directly depends on the type of card with which the client works.  There is a nominal plastic and instant.  In the first case, it is easier to understand who owns the card than in the second.  After all, instant plastic reflects only technical information. </p><h2>  What can be found on the map </h2><p>  How to find out the full name of the owner of a plastic card?  In fact, you cannot completely deal with this problem.  It is impossible and illegal.  There are some tricks, but about them later. </p>

    <p>  First, consider the information that can still be found by the number of bank plastic.  She is not a secret.  However, some information is encrypted in the card number itself. </p><p>  So, by plastic you can find out: </p><ul><li>  payment system - the first digit (4 - "Visa", 5 - "MasterCard" and so on); </li><li>  BIN of a financial institution - figures for the 6th inclusive; </li><li>  Bank program, which issued plastic - 7 and 8 digits; </li><li>  owner identifier - 9-15 digits (full name does not contain); </li><li>  the check digit for checking the card is the last digit of the number. </li></ul><p>  That's all.  As you can see, the plastic number can show detailed information about the issuing bank.  But the data of the owner of the plastic is problematic to find out. </p><h2>  For name cards </h2><p>  If a citizen has found a name card, you can partially cope with the task.  What is it about? </p><p>  Can I find out the owner through the card number?  Name cards allow you to see only the name and surname of a citizen.  That is, full information about the plastic is still not disclosed.  And the card number has nothing to do with it. </p><p>  The surname and name of the plastic holder are written in Latin on the front of the plastic card.  Just look at the map and read what is written on it.  This is the only way to somehow get a tip on whoever lost the plastic. </p>

    <p>  Instant cards, as we have said, instead of the name and surname contain only technical information.  And therefore, the described technique will not help.  On such products, there is simply no first name, last name, or middle name of the owner. </p><h2>  Secret tricks </h2><p>  How to find out the full name of the owner by card number?  We have already said that there are no legal ways to cope with the task.  Therefore, you have to look for a way out of the situation and agree with very risky tricks. </p><p>  In the network you can find many sites that offer a search for information about citizens by their bank card numbers.  Usually such services are paid.  Some of them really work.  You just have to take into account that the bulk of the proposals is simply a money divorce.  Extremely unreliable way, bringing only losses. </p>

    <p>  In addition, in black markets and hackers you can purchase databases of bank customers.  Such magazines store the most complete information about the population.  And it‚Äôs from the database that you can find out who owns this or that plastic.  Such documentation is not cheap, it is illegal.  Therefore, it is better to return the card to the owner without receiving citizen data.  But how to do that? </p><h2>  Ways to return plastic </h2><p>  It is not necessary to know the data in order to recover the lost plastic. </p><p>  To return a bank card, a citizen must: </p><ol><li>  Contact the issuing bank.  Usually, the financial institution serving the card is written on plastic.  Bank employees will definitely return the plastic to the owner. </li><li>  Send the product by mail.  It is enough to carefully read the data on the back of the card.  An address will be written there, where you can send your questions and the plastic found.  This is a rather long operation, but it takes place in practice. </li><li>  Contact the cardholder with a financial institution.  On the back of the plastic there is a number for contacting the bank.  You can call him, block someone else‚Äôs plastic, while leaving a message to the card holder.  To unblock the product, a citizen will have to go to the bank and get information about who found the card. </li><li>  Insert plastic into any ATM and "forget" it.  It is advisable to use ATM machines of the issuing financial institution.  Then the card will be returned much faster. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Now it‚Äôs clear whether it is possible to find out the owner by the card number.  And how to return the plastic is also clear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the name of the plastic card holder" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2185110.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The surname, name and patronymic of a citizen is information that will not be divulged by employees of financial organizations just like that.  Therefore, to fully understand who owns this or that plastic is problematic. </p><p>  However, sometimes a person can find out either the surname with the name of the citizen, or the name, patronymic and the first letter of the surname.  And in order to return the plastic to the citizen, you can do without his personal data. </p>
