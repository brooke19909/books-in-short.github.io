    <h2>  Deluxe Suite </h2><p>  This is another category in the DoubleTree By Hilton Ras Al Khaimah 4 *.  Tours to this hotel are sold out quickly, especially if you stay in a deluxe suite.  Although it is the most expensive here. </p><p>  Its area is 75 square meters.  There is a large living room, a spacious bathroom and a luxurious bedroom with a huge king-size 2-bed.  And, of course, the main ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù is the availability of a separate kitchen.  It is equipped with everything that is necessary for proper cooking.  Sink, stove, oven, microwave, kettle, range hood and, of course, refrigerator.  However, the kitchen can be seen in the picture above. </p><p>  A week of accommodation with breakfast will cost 160,000 rubles for two people.  Three guests will have to pay 20,000 more.  And for four - 200,000 rubles per week.  However, this is the most profitable option (both in terms and price).  Per person - 50,000 rubles per week.  For the UAE, this is very modest.  You can even not order breakfast, then it will come out at all for 36 thousand rubles.  per person.  There is a kitchen, you can cook it yourself, since there are a lot of supermarkets and shops nearby with a huge selection of different products. </p><h2>  What do the guests say? </h2><p>  After reading the description presented about <span>the DoubleTree By Hilton</span> Ras Al Khaimah 4 * hotel, you can understand that this hotel is good and not cheap.  And reviews written by people who have visited this place confirm this fact.  If we exclude high prices (everyone here knows, to put it mildly, ‚Äúsolid‚Äù, and this should not surprise), then everything is very good. </p><p>  Tourists note that the staff is excellent.  The apartments are cleaned daily, replenishing stocks of shampoos, gels and other accessories.  The bed with towels is also replaced with new ones creaking from cleanliness. </p><p>  There is a bus from the hotel to the local Ras Al Khaimah Museum, as well as to the Manar Mall and the beach Hilton.  Transportation also goes to such a famous city as Dubai.  But you need to register in the queue in advance, especially if it is just the middle of the season (summer). </p><p>  There are Russian girls working at the reception, but they work for two hotels, so sometimes they may not be.  However, if they manage to find them, they will never be denied advice and help.  Anyway, in the UAE, everyone is very friendly and attentive. </p><p>  By the way, in the UAE there is another hotel with the same name, but only a 5-star.  DoubleTree By Hilton Ras Al Khaimah 5 * belongs to the same network.  Located in Ras al-Khaimah, on the artificial island of Al Marjan.  Hilton <span>Hotel Ras Al Khaimah</span> 5 * and 4 * - the hotels are different, so do not confuse them. </p>

Guests should receive a confirmation reply on the provision of these berths. </p><p>  The hotel also recommends that you familiarize yourself with the visa application procedure in advance.  And it is worth remembering that in the hotel food for children under the age of 6 years is provided for free.  Those over six but under 12 are given 50 percent discounts in restaurants. </p><p>  This is useful information to remember.  In general, booking a room is long before the trip.  Firstly, there is a chance to get a good discount.  And secondly - prudence will not hurt.  After all, the hotel is popular, and there may simply not be any free apartments by the scheduled dates. </p><p>  Well, this hotel leaves a good impression according to guest stories and description.  If you want to verify this yourself, you should go here on vacation. </p>
