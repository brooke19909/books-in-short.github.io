    <h2>  What advantages does the sanatorium ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù (Crimea, Yalta) have? </h2><p>  This resort is surrounded by a beautiful park, which was founded over a century ago.  Over the years, its trees have grown, and today it is no longer a park, but a real forest.  It is protected by the municipality of Yalta as a monument of landscape gardening art.  More than 300 species of exotic and coniferous trees grow here, which fill the air in these parts with a pleasant aroma.  This is already enough to turn the rest into a fairy tale.  And from the territory of the ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù you can see the most beautiful castle, a symbol of Yalta, and of the whole Crimea - the Swallow's Nest.  Today, in this magnificent building, which was built over a century ago, in 1911, according to the project of the famous architect Sherwood, the restaurant is located.  Nevertheless, it continues to evoke admiration and interest among holidaymakers with its original look.  In a word, for a relatively low price you can spend your holidays on the coast, surrounded by a beautiful natural landscape and an entrancing fragrance, as well as heal.  Surely after reading you will rush to a travel agency to book a tour to the Zhemchuzhina sanatorium (South Coast).  Crimea, as at all times, attracts tourists with its natural beauty, as well as the benevolence of the local population.  Therefore, there is no shortage of visitors here and cannot be. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="health resort pearl crimea reviews" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/832150.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description and location </h2><p>  The full name of this institution is a wellness rehabilitation center, sanatorium "Pearl".  Crimea, by the way, has at once several <span>hotels, pensions,</span> rest houses, which bear the same name.  Nevertheless, this sanatorium, which was founded in 1930, is one of the very first and most famous since Soviet times.  He is able to simultaneously accept more than 500 vacationers.  The sanatorium has one of the best medical and diagnostic facilities on the entire south coast, and the healing air of the magnificent park (about 18 hectares) is perfect for aromatherapy even in the winter months.  The location of the sanatorium "Pearl" is quite convenient.  It is located on Cape Ai-Todor.  As already noted, it is only 11 kilometers from here to Yalta.  It will seem to many that it is located at a fairly large distance from the railway station (90 km) and the airport (100 km), but these are the conditions of the peninsula.  After all, he has only one airport, which is located in the administrative center of Crimea - in the city of Simferopol.  But the most important thing is that you can reach your own pebble beach from the sanatorium in just 7-10 minutes with a walking step.  The convenient location is the decisive factor for people who choose the sanatorium "Pearl" (Crimea).  The reviews and comments left on the travel blogs testify to this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sanatorium pearl yalta crimea reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/832163.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Sanatorium ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù has several buildings and villas for visitors to relax.  In several five-story buildings are double rooms with all amenities and balconies.  In the two-story buildings, by the way, they are closer to the beach than the others; there are also one-room rooms designed for 1-2 vacationers.  A fridge and TV are included.  However, there are no balconies, and this is the biggest drawback.  But the two- <span>room suites</span> have living rooms and bedrooms, also have balconies.  Three-story buildings are the farthest from the beach (300 m).  They include junior suites and suites.  As you noticed, in all of the above options there are no air conditioners.  Those who can not stand the heat can book a room in building 12, as well as in cottages such as ‚Äúvilla‚Äù.  Here, air conditioners are installed in two-room suites, and the conditions are better than in other buildings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea sanatorium pearl prices" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/832149.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cottage "White Swallow" </h2><p>  Sanatorium "Pearl" <span>(Crimea, Gaspra)</span> also has a two-story building number 13, which is called the "White Swallow".  It has a closed territory and is intended for the rest of 4 (+2) persons.  It offers a beautiful view of the Swallow's Nest Palace.  On the ground floor there is a living room with comfortable upholstered furniture, a fully equipped kitchen, a sauna, and on the second floor there are two bedrooms: a parent (with a double bed) and a children's room with two separate beds.  There are bathrooms on both floors.  The guests of the dacha can eat in the dining room of the Pearl sanatorium for an additional fee, the same applies to medical procedures.  This is what tourists who visited the Zhemchuzhina sanatorium (Crimea) write in their comments.  Their reviews, unfortunately, are not always positive.  The lack of air conditioning, even in some suites, especially puts pressure on tourists.  Many cannot sleep at night because of stuffiness, and because of this, rest spoils.  But the lucky ones who happened to visit the "White Swallow", of course, leave only enthusiastic comments. </p><h2>  The territory of the sanatorium "Pearl" </h2><p>  As you already understood, ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù is not just a sanatorium, but a whole town.  Let's try to describe the plan of the Pearl sanatorium (Crimea, Gaspra), and try to see it with your mind‚Äôs eye, and the photos in this article will help you in this.  So, the sanatorium consists of 48 structures, of which 14 are dormitory buildings and cottages.  The remaining structures are intended for administrative, public and technical needs.  Among them are a medical building and a fitness room;  catering facilities: cafe, dining room, bar;  a hairdresser, a new and very original building with an indoor pool, cosmetology and massage rooms;  library, souvenir, grocery and hardware stores;  Cinema, conference room.  Paid parking is available on site.  As already noted, the sanatorium is located in a magnificent forest, protected by the state.  The hulls are arranged in the form of a terrace and gradually descend to the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="health resort pearl crimea yalta" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/832162.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Type of food </h2><p>  In the sanatorium "Pearl" vacationers are provided with three <span>meals a</span> day, <span>balanced meals</span> according to the ordered menu or according to the "buffet" system.  This, of course, has its advantages.  That is, guests themselves choose from the menu those dishes that they prefer. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the resort has its own beach.  It is 100-300 meters away.  It depends on where the building or cottage is located.  On the beach there is a first-aid post, a bathroom, a bar, viewing platforms with a view of the Swallow's Nest.  For lovers of water sports, there is a rental of jet skis - scooters, catamarans, as well as pleasure boats. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in crimea sanatoriums and pensions pearl" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/832147.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What do tourist portals write about this resort?  How to evaluate the sanatorium "Pearl" (Yalta, Crimea)?  Reviews, unfortunately, are not always positive.  Tourists who are accustomed to high service, of course, complain about room service, as well as the dilapidated and worn-out furniture, sanitary ware, etc. Here are more than positive reviews regarding the restaurant and the kitchen.  Glory to the skilled chefs!  Nevertheless, unpretentious tourists who come here rather to be treated and enjoy the beauty of nature, really like it here.  And the rest can always find another place.  You can go to another coast of the peninsula, if you are still attracted to rest in the Crimea.  Sanatoriums and pensions ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù are scattered along the coast.  For example, there is a rather comfortable mini-hotel ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù, a boarding house of the same name, and a sanatorium.  Of course, they are not located near the beautiful Yalta, like the Pearl sanatorium in Gaspra, but they have their own advantages, for example, a modern interior. </p>
