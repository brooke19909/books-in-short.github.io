    <h2>  Hotel Green Nature Diamond <span>5 * (Turkey, Marmaris):</span> negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, in addition to the positive and bright moments, any hotel has its drawbacks.  If we talk about this institution, then you should pay attention to the following negative reviews: </p><ul><li>  very weak wireless Internet (the only place where he more or less catches is the lobby area); </li><li>  small territory without any frills; </li><li>  almost complete lack of animation; </li><li>  the beach area, as well as the space around the pool, are almost never cleaned; </li><li>  the carpet in the rooms is very dirty (either it is better to take care of it, or to remove it completely); </li><li>  the hotel corridors are very hot due to lack of air conditioning; </li><li>  housekeeping is very superficial (and you have to ask for individual bed linen and towels individually); </li><li>  there are no shampoos in the bathroom, so you have to buy it yourself; </li><li>  for a five-star hotel the range of dishes in the dining room is very scarce; </li><li>  dishes in the restaurant are not washed very carefully (plates and cutlery are greasy to the touch, and cups with traces of tea). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Upon arrival at this hotel, tourists are immediately struck by the original architecture.  The hotel building is made in some kind of space style.  The interior of the hall also makes a good impression.  The rooms are freshly renovated.  In addition, the courtesy, friendliness and courtesy of the staff literally disarm.  But the longer travelers live in a hotel, the more clear is the belief that he does not reach his five-star status.  Many small flaws merge into a negative picture, which can spoil your vacation. </p><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to is the quality of cleaning.  The maximum you can count on is the absence of dust on visible surfaces.  About mopping and regular replacement of bed linen is not even a question.  The second negative point is the entertainment.  Despite the fact that the hotel has an animation team, it practically does not work.  Guests have to entertain themselves.  Well, food is not full of variety.  Thus, to the five stars that flaunt the name of the hotel, a lot of questions arise. </p>
