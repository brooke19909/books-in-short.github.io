    <h2>  Big Utrish Attractions <strong> </strong>  the village.  Pearl Waterfall </h2><p>  Zhemchuzhny Waterfall is located 2.5 km from the Big Utrish.  It is one of the most famous in the Krasnodar Territory.  The waterfall has its own peculiarity - its waters falling on a rocky beach create a small stream flowing into the Black Sea.  The height of the fall of the jets is from 5 to 6 meters. </p><p>  Pearl is not only one of the few fresh sources.  At the same time, it also serves as a natural "shower."  Near the Zhemchuzhny waterfall you can stop the savages for rest.  And for lovers of sunbathing naked, there is a nudist beach nearby. </p><p>  At 200 meters from the waterfall, the Jewel clan camp is open every year.  It practices the adoption of childbirth in sea water.  Pearl is one of the points in the ecotropic routes, the length of which is 6 km.  Since there are no settlements near the Vodopadny stream, where the Pearl Waterfall originates from, it is famous for its crystal clear water. </p><h2>  Other attractions </h2><p>  Utrish is rich in other attractions.  Snake Lake is a good example.  It is located near the village of Big Utrish, just 800 meters.  The name of the lake was due to the large number of snakes that lived in the pond.  Previously, the water in the reservoir was fresh, as it did not connect with the Black Sea.  They were separated by an isthmus, which was then blown up.  A quiet bay was formed, called the "Snake".  Reptiles, which were very numerous in the freshwater lake, were used to living in slightly salted water over time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Utrish Anapa Attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1399836.jpg" width="600"></div>

And right behind the lake is a pebble beach. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  In Utrish you can book excursions.  The choice is small, but each of them leaves an unforgettable experience.  For example, boat trips, an excursion to Anapa.  There is also a separate nature tour.  Moreover, it is carried out on horseback, which in itself is already attractive. </p><h2>  Maly Utrish: Attractions and Entertainment </h2><p>  Small Utrish is located eight kilometers from the Big.
