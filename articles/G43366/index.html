The question is quite common, and today we‚Äôll talk about this particular medicine. </p><h2>  Pharmacological properties </h2><p>  Chlorhexidine (reviews confirm this) is an excellent antiseptic that is active against many bacteria, in particular Treponema pallidum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma spp and some others, as well as protozoa (Trichomonas vaginalis) and herpes virus. </p><p>  Due to its antiseptic properties, the drug is used in many fields of medicine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chlorhexidine what is it" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17460/713248.jpg" width="470"></div>

    <h2>  The mechanism of action of antiseptics </h2><p>  The basis of the drug is the ability of the active substance to influence the properties of the cell membrane of a microorganism.  It contributes to the destruction of the cytoplasmic membrane of the bacteria, disrupting the osmotic balance.  And as a result - the death of bacteria. </p><p>  Local <span>application of "Chlorhexidine bigluconate"</span> does not allow it to penetrate into the general bloodstream and have a systemic effect.  But after processing the skin, a certain amount of the drug remains on its surface, providing a long-lasting antibacterial effect. </p><h2>  Indications for use </h2><p>  The solution of "Chlorhexidine bigluconate" is used in the treatment and prevention of various diseases caused by microorganisms sensitive to chlorhexidine. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The drug is used in many areas.  So, it is Chlorhexidine alcohol that is used to treat the skin during various surgical operations.  The drug is widely used in urology, as well as gynecology and obstetric practice. </p><p>  The solution of "Chlorhexidine bigluconate" is used in the treatment <span>of skin diseases</span> caused by fungus or bacteria.  The drug has also proven itself in the treatment of purulent wounds, various lesions of the mucous membrane, provoked by microorganisms sensitive to chlorhexidine. </p><p>  In addition, the tool can be used as a prevention of STDs in case of unprotected intercourse. </p><p>  And now a little more about all the features of an antiseptic. </p>

    <h2>  STD Prevention </h2><p>  For prophylactic purposes, it is necessary to use a 0.05% solution of the drug no later than 2 hours after sexual contact without using a condom. </p><p>  Men need to carefully inject 3 ml of ‚ÄúChlorhexidine‚Äù into the urinary canal.  In women, in addition to introducing the drug also into the urinary canal (2 ml of solution), it is necessary to treat the vagina (10 ml of the drug).  In addition, it is necessary to conduct additional treatment of the skin of the penis, the outer surface of the thighs and pubis. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the treatment and the introduction of the drug into the urethra, it is recommended to refrain from going to the sanitary room for at least 2 hours. </p><h2>  Dentistry and ENT practice </h2><p>  The tool is used by dentists in the process of disinfecting the <span>oral cavity,</span> and is also prescribed as a treatment for gingivitis, stomatitis or periodontitis.  In this case, solutions with a concentration of 0.1% or 0.05% can be used.  Rinse is carried out three times a day. </p><p>  Chlorhexidine is also used when there is a need to flush the periodontal canal, an opened abscess, and fistulas.  The drug is also used to treat the surface of the gums after a patchwork on the periodontium. </p><p>  ENT specialists can prescribe a rinse, as a prophylaxis of postoperative complications, for example, after removal of the tonsils or adenoids.  In this case, irrigation or rinsing is prescribed with 0.1% or 0.05% chlorhexidine bigluconate solutions. </p>

    <h2>  Treatment of wounds and skin with Chlorhexidine </h2><p>  To process any damage to the skin, 0.05%, 0.02 or 0.5% solution of the drug is used.  Both irrigation and applications can be used. </p><p>  When disinfecting the surgical field, diluted 20% Chlorhexidine is used.  In this case, the alcohol solution is used for double treatment. </p><h2>  Application in urology </h2><p>  Here, the drug is used to <span>rinse the bladder</span> before performing some diagnostic procedures, in particular cystoscopy. </p><h2>  Use during pregnancy </h2><p>  "Chlorhexidine" - what is it and can it be used by future mothers fearlessly?  First of all, it is an excellent <span>antibacterial agent,</span> as already mentioned a little earlier.  That is why the tool copes with all manifestations of thrush, and also destroys the causative agents of syphilis, gonorrhea and urealamosis. </p><p>  Women are very worried, is it possible to use ‚ÄúChlorhexidine‚Äù during pregnancy and will it harm the baby?  The drug is present in most of the drugs that are used in the treatment of many female diseases.  During the bearing of the baby, the female immune system is significantly weakened, so vaginal candidiasis, better known as thrush, is a problem for many expectant mothers.  And one of the drugs that does not affect the development of the fetus, and therefore its use is possible from the very first days, is Chlorhexidine.  Reviews of women as one are unanimous: the tool significantly alleviates the condition.  Thrush is much faster. </p>

    <h2>  Gargling with the drug </h2><p>  Chlorhexidine - what it is, now you know.  And as they managed to make sure, the possibilities of the drug are quite extensive.  The drug is often prescribed in the treatment of throat infections and tonsillitis.  But since the drug can be used exclusively externally, the use of Chlorhexidine for rinsing the mouth requires caution. </p><p>  For rinsing, only 0.05% solution can be used, since a higher concentration can cause too much burning of the mucous membrane.  Alcohol solution of a gargle is prohibited. </p><p>  The use of the product is allowed no earlier than 1 hour after you brush your teeth.  It must be remembered that "Chlorhexidine" is incompatible with some components of toothpaste.  Before treatment <span>with an antiseptic solution</span> , rinse your mouth with plain clean water to remove food debris. </p>

    <h2>  How to rinse "Chlorhexidine"? </h2><p>  Everything is pretty simple.  Take a little prepared solution in your mouth (about a couple of tablespoons) and gargle for at least a minute.  The procedure is carried out 3 times a day or in accordance with the instructions of the attending physician, but not longer than 3 weeks. </p><p>  If the drug was prescribed by the dentist after the operation to remove the tooth, then active rinsing during the first day is not recommended.  Otherwise, the protective clot that always forms in the well can be damaged.  And this can cause infection of the wound.  Just put the diluted solution of the drug in your mouth and hold it on the sore side of your mouth for about a couple of minutes.  This is enough to disinfect the wound. </p><p>  To enhance the effect of rinsing, after the procedure, refuse food and drink for at least an hour. </p><p>  Remember that you can not swallow the product.  If, nevertheless, the drug was swallowed, then it is necessary to drink several glasses of water and cause vomiting.  After this, you need to take activated carbon. </p>

    <h2>  We breed the drug correctly </h2><p>  If it is necessary to treat a wound on the skin, then a solution with a concentration of 0.05% does not need to be diluted.  To strengthen the effect of the medicine, if purulent wounds or postoperative sutures need to be disinfected, you can dilute ‚ÄúChlorhexidine‚Äù with alcohol in a 1: 1 ratio.  In the process, unpleasant sensations may occur, such as burning, redness, pain, but gradually they will disappear. </p><p>  When douching, the product should have a concentration of not more than 0.02%.  Dilute an antiseptic using boiled water.  Douching is carried out no more than 2 times a day and can be prescribed for inflammatory processes, the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, etc.  The drug is used only as prescribed by your doctor. </p><p>  How to dilute "Chlorhexidine" if gargling is required?  In this case, a tablespoon of the drug is diluted in 200 ml of boiled water.  You can rinse several times a day.  This is especially true with purulent tonsillitis. </p><p>  But do not forget that you can use the product only after prior consultation with your doctor. </p><p>  Chlorhexidine: what it is, in which cases a solution can be used, the rules for diluting the drug - now you are all familiar with this.  We hope that the information you receive will certainly come in handy.  Be healthy! </p>
