Mortgage "VTB 24": conditions, down payment</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Standards of living standards for Russians today include the possession of their own housing - an apartment or a house.  Indeed, buying an apartment these days without using mortgage programs is not easy.  Not only because the amounts are large, but also due to the fact that apartment prices are rising - if you don‚Äôt steal, you‚Äôll get tired of saving.  And because housing lending is one of the most dynamic segments of the banking market, and individual financial institutions are pretty tough competing among themselves for the client.  What can one of the largest banks in the country offer the sophisticated borrower?  Where is the place where a citizen prefers to find out what is ‚ÄúVTB 24 Mortgage‚Äù, the conditions of which sometimes differ significantly from the average market, or some other lending institution? </p><h2>  General terms </h2><p>  The Russian bank VTB 24 minimizes borrower costs for <span>mortgages.</span>  In particular, in some programs of this credit institution there is an option for free real estate valuation.  As in most other banks, payments are made according to an annuity scheme, as a rule, more comfortable than with the differentiated version.  In all cases, early (full or partial) repayment of the mortgage loan is allowed - this is a common practice for VTB 24. </p>

    <p>  Mortgages, reviews of which in other banks are not always evidence of the welcome of the "Stakhanov" policy of <span>repaying loans by</span> borrowers, in this case completely on the side of the client's interests.  The bank is ready to consider a variety of documents confirming income - not just a personal income tax certificate.  There are options for registering a mortgage without guarantors and the use of the so-called intermediate form of collateral.  A number of bank programs may contain a variable (or combined) lending rate - a useful option that can cause positive feedback from customers who are interested in mortgages.  VTB 24 is a bank that tries to monitor the mood among borrowers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Military mortgage </h2><p>  VTB 24 Bank implements a specialized housing lending program for citizens undergoing professional military service.  The main feature of this type of mortgage is a low down payment (from 10% of the cost of housing) (there are no restrictions on choosing the desired property).  Only the services of realtors, appraiser are paid, insurance is bought (if necessary).  It is noteworthy that servicemen of lower and middle officer ranks, aged 22 and over, can participate fully in the program (however, there is also a limitation - a housing loan cannot be issued if the borrower is older than 45). </p>

VTB 24 Bank has been practicing this form of lending since 2011.  Such loans can be issued not only for secondary housing, but also for construction (under an <span>agreement of shared participation</span> or co-financing in housing construction cooperatives).  The key condition of the program is that the amount of maternal capital should be at least 20% of the cost of housing, such standards were established by VTB 24 Bank.  This type of mortgage is issued for a period of up to 30 years. </p><h2>  Governmental support </h2><p>  In a number of cases, VTB 24 borrowers may apply for a <span>mortgage with state support</span> (when part of the interest is subsidized from the country's budget).  This program attracts the bank with a rather low interest rate (about 11% per annum) with a standard maximum mortgage term (up to 30 years).  However, the final rate depends on the number of documents provided by the borrower, as well as on the type of real estate: housing under construction will cost several points more than a new one or on the secondary.  This program is popular with borrowers who want to know the nuances of housing lending and read about what a real mortgage, reviews.  VTB 24 provides interested customers with all the necessary information. </p><h2>  Borrower Requirements </h2><p>  In general, a borrower applying for a mortgage at VTB 24, which is one of the largest banks in the country, must meet a number of criteria.  First, housing loans are issued only to Russian citizens who are 21 years old (for women) or 23 years old (for men).

    <p>  It is important that the credit history is positive.  Borrower insurance is a prerequisite for a mortgage (otherwise, the interest rate will increase by several points).  For many borrowers, it is desirable that there is an inexpensive mortgage: VTB 24, the down payment in which may in some cases be reduced to 10%, is able to meet such clients. </p><h2>  Main programs </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the content of specific mortgage programs of VTB 24 Bank may vary depending on market conditions, there are several standard forms of issuing housing loans in this lending institution.  Firstly, the purchase of housing in the secondary market is the most popular option.  The rate here starts from 11.85% per year, the down payment in some cases can be reduced to 10% of the cost of purchased housing.  The maximum term for which a mortgage is issued is 50 years.  The second most popular lending format is the purchase of housing in a new building.  The conditions are the same as in the ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù program, but the interest rate is highly dependent on the cost of the purchased apartment. </p>

    <p>  In general, the borrower bears absolutely small expenses for the formalities associated with the mortgage.  It is also very important that the bank has an extensive network and is present in almost all regions of Russia.  Thanks to this, a national knowledge base is formed on what mortgages and reviews are.  VTB 24 is one of the centers for the consolidation of relevant information about this market. </p><h2>  Young family </h2><p>  There are borrowers of a special category who are in great need, and, most likely, on the terms of VTB 24, a mortgage.  A young family is talking about her.  One of the bank‚Äôs narrow-profile programs is called that.  It is designed to facilitate the purchase of an apartment on credit to newlyweds, young and middle-aged citizens, raising children and sometimes experiencing material difficulties.  Of course, the bank does not help people at its own expense, but acts as an intermediary between the borrower and the state, which subsidizes the program: real estate becomes cheaper by 35% (for a couple who have no children) or 40% (if there are one or more children) . </p>
