Only approaches to the organization of the acoustic background change.  And if earlier it was stationary speakers and music centers installed in gyms, today even diving into the pool is not an obstacle to using a sound source.  At the moment, the best Bluetooth headphones not only make it possible to listen to your favorite songs in the classroom, but also completely save the owner from unnecessary manipulation of settings and connections.  Of course, this segment also has its own gradation of models in terms of characteristics and functional capabilities, which makes us carefully approach the choice of the optimal solution. </p>

    <h2>  What are the features of headphones with a bluetooth module? </h2><p>  The use of systems that provide wireless data transmission has long been practiced in the electronics industry.  And if before radio modules were mainly used for exchanging files between gadgets or communicating with a computer, today the developers of audio equipment began to master the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãstreaming audio playback, the source of which is located at a distance.  That is, the signal is received, processed and reproduced without acoustic wires. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the moment, the <span>best inexpensive Bluetooth headphones</span> with price tags of the order of 3-5 thousand are able to work with sources at a distance of about 8-10 m and this distance is constantly increasing as new models appear.  Of course, the sound quality as a whole loses to devices that are directly connected to the basic equipment serving as a signal source, but this drawback is gradually minimized. </p><h2>  Philips SHQ7300 </h2><p>  Philips is famous for its high-quality portable acoustics and, of course, the compact headphone segment with the ability to wirelessly receive music is not without its products.  The model is part of the ActionFit line, which indicates its belonging to the sports line.  However, in terms of the implementation of the form factor, this version has several differences from the established fashion.  The developers used more massive cups than in the standard, and also supplemented them with ergonomic clips. </p><p>  It turned out to be a cross between overhead models and gags, but in any case, the device sits securely in your ears and the risk of losing it when running, for example, is low.  Therefore, in terms of physical ergonomics, these are the best Bluetooth in-ear headphones, complemented by clips.  Of course, the mounting system made the construction a little heavier, but this is an insignificant addition and is hardly noticed during wearing. </p><p>  As for user reviews, they include the advantages of the model with the presence of effective protection against splashes, convenient control and a fairly long time on a single charge - 5.5 hours. There are no complaints about the sound quality.  In this regard, Philips' richest experience in creating a small but well-thought-out audio equipment is precisely what affects it.  But there are also negative reviews about the model, which note the inability to start the virtual assistant from the headset. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__5sc"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__5sc"></div><div class="vn-player" style="box-sizing: border-box; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; z-index: 0; margin: auto;"><div style="position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; text-align: center;"><iframe height="100%" width="100%" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginleft="0" marginright="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay" sandbox="allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-pointer-lock allow-scripts allow-popups allow-top-navigation" src="about:blank" style="position: relative; z-index: 1; width: 100%; height: 100%; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: none; overflow: hidden; max-width: initial; max-height: initial;" class="vn-container-iframe"></iframe></div></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  MEElectronics Sport-Fi X7 </h2>

    <p>  Compact model, with a rigid mount and light weight.  The technical device is implemented according to the standard scheme with the Bluetooth 4 module, although in this case there are landing features.  The design is made according to the in-ear concept with a dense entry and effective blocking of external noise.  The result is good bluetooth earplugs for street use.  But you should immediately consider that in the basic configuration only two silicone nozzles are supplied - medium and large.  Now you can go to the immediate reviews of the practice of using the device. </p><p>  The obvious advantages of the owners include noise isolation, autonomy and functionality.  A sound external barrier allows you to cut off all third-party noise, so that the listening process is fully focused on the target signal.  The actual ability to maintain operability, as noted by users, is about 8 hours. With regard to the functionality, no special frills are noted, but ergonomics of management are important for this category, and in this aspect there are no complaints about the device. </p><p>  More importantly, the model does not belong to premium products, but this did not prevent the creators from providing relatively clean and loud reproduction.  At least in the budget category, this version produces almost the best sound.  The Sport-Fi X7 Bluetooth headphones also have a number of disadvantages.  As a rule, many indicate the average quality of the material of the plugs.  They cope with the task of fastening, but there is an unpleasant factor in the long-term preservation of moisture, which does not add comfort when using the gadget. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  JBL Synchros Reflect </h2>

    <p>  Also a small headset released by one of the leaders in the audio segment.  In the manufacture of the structure, the manufacturer used a durable rubber alloy with magnetic protrusions that allow fixing two parts of the headphones.  An interesting find is the presence of a reflective insert, which is visible under the headlights.  This solution will be especially beneficial for cyclists, as well as for those who engage in outdoor sports in the evening. </p><p>  Another feature worth mentioning is the original adjustment system - it is enough to pull the ends of the wire or push it in to get the optimal refinement for the most comfortable closure of the structure.  To implement communication abilities, the creators used a new radio signal module, which provided a number of operational advantages to the device.  In their category, these are the best Bluetooth headphones, given the stability of signal transmission.  The range is 8 m, but the most important thing is the clarity of voice communication.  To transmit intelligible speech, it is not necessary to bring the microphone close to your mouth - the receiver can remain in place. </p><p>  Judging by the responses of the owners, the model is also rather included in the list of successes of the company.  The headset is highly rated for its ease of physical use, sound quality, and overall reliability.  Manufacturing materials are durable and do not cause discomfort when in contact with the body. </p><h2>  LG HBS-500 </h2><p>  An interesting development from Korean audio technicians who relied on high levels of autonomy and volumetric disclosure of musical abilities.  The device is based on a flexible wire design in the form of a "collar", which initially provides good ergonomics and reliable fastening.  It turned out good Bluetooth earphones-earplugs in the sense of a successful combination of wide control capabilities and small sizes.  The headset can not be called quite tiny - it looks rather bulky, but this is less reflected in the comfort of wearing.  But the advantages of the corrugated and prominent buttons above the surface of the case are quite tangible. </p>

    <p>  However, the negative impressions of the model on the part of the users themselves are also associated with a reduction in the number of buttons compared to previous modifications.  In particular, the device is criticized for the exclusion of a separate button for switching songs.  Shortcomings include the dubious quality of individual materials, although they are aesthetic aspects - there are no complaints about the strength characteristics.  And again, the gadget's strength is autonomy.  These are the best Bluetooth <span>wireless headphones</span> in this indicator, since the operating mode consumes energy for 8-9 hours, and while waiting for the device can be as long as 500 hours. </p><h2>  Denon AH-W150 </h2><p>  A solid model with a wide range of accessories, convenient accessories for fastening and a design made on the basis of non-slip high-quality plastic.  The case has a rubberized shell, so the gadget can be safely used under water.  Unlike most representatives of this segment, the AH-W150 device was initially focused on the ability to process a wide range of signals.  For example, these are the best Bluetooth headphones for sports, if it is planned in extreme conditions to listen to the entire range of musical compositions from classical to ‚Äúheavy‚Äù tracks.  11.5 mm speakers provide clear and detailed reproduction of different genres. </p><p>  In reviews of this model, in addition to decent sound, a stylish design, signal transmission stability and a useful accessory in the form of a metal carbine for additional fastening are also mentioned.  It is noted among the advantages of this version and cost.  These are the best inexpensive Bluetooth headphones in the segment of 5-7 thousand rubles.  Of course, there are many competitive options for 2-3 thousand, but for a brand of Denon level 6 thousand - this is very good considering the corresponding quality. </p>

    <h2>  Andoer LH-811 </h2><p>  This is just the representative of the models of a widespread budget level, referring to the same category of full-size headphones.  It is immediately worth noting that this form factor limits the operational capabilities of the design, which should be considered when buying.  The model is of Chinese origin, Andoer is little known in Russia, so you should forget about the high sound quality and technical implementation.  A price tag of 1-2 thousand. Quite logically determines this compromise. </p><p>  However, the model does not cause much criticism for its class.  The performance of the wireless data transmission module is at an average level, the ear cushions are attached without discomfort, and the radius of action is 10 m. That is, by the combination of operational properties, these are the best Chinese Bluetooth headphones in the category of up to 3 thousand. </p><p>  But before buying this gadget you should keep in mind one remark of the owners.  Although the manufacturer positions the headphones as all-weather, there are observations of how water flows under the body.  Therefore, to ensure safety during the rain, it is worth preparing to wear the device under the hood. </p><h2>  Bose QuietComfort 35 </h2><p>  Another proposal from a well-known global brand, made in a full-sized form factor.  The design of the model is traditional, the pillow of the headband and ear pads have soft bases, pleasant to the touch.  By the way, the decoration material is represented by the expensive Alcantara, which is used in the design of salons of premium cars. </p><p>  Largely due to a well-thought-out device and elite materials, QuietComfort 35 can claim the status of the best Bluetooth headphone among fashion models.  However, the choice of color solutions is still not rich for devices of this class - two shades are available to customers - silver and black.  But the controls and functionality are executed at the modern high-tech level.  In addition to standard toggle switches and buttons, even a noise isolation level switch is provided. </p><p>  Users of the model praise the convenient mechanisms for adjusting and supporting the design, indicate the advantages of sound and the successful performance of cups with a headband.  Also, in terms of communication capabilities, these are the best <span>full-sized</span> Bluetooth <span>headphones</span> among direct competitors, although there are certain nuances of operation.  For example, to get expressive and spectacular sound, you should think about the appropriate source in advance.  This model is very demanding on third-party equipment.  As for the cost, it is 25-27 thousand. The price tag is impressive, but the merits of the product justify it. </p>

    <h2>  How to choose the best bluetooth headphones? </h2><p>  The once narrow and specific segment of sports headphones has undergone several cardinal changes associated with increased protective qualities, ergonomic properties and communication abilities.  Today it is a wide niche in which both professional athletes and amateurs find the best options.  In the forefront in this choice, experts advise to make precisely the structural parameters.  The form and method of adjustment are paramount factors, since the convenience of interacting with the gadget depends on them.  So, familiar overhead models are gradually becoming a thing of the past, but for lovers of this configuration there are still suggestions. </p><p>  For example, the best Bluetooth on-ear headphones are featured in the Philips lineup.  This is the SHQ7300 model, which, however, is more likely to be combined.  The choice of designs with gags focuses on ergonomics and a secure fit - it is advisable to physically test the device before purchase.  Do not ignore the operational characteristics, including battery life, communication channels with the sound source, the possibility of settings, etc. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  In the latest models of sports wearable electronics, manufacturers rely on high technology to ensure data transfer, although at the dawn of the formation of this segment, questions of reliability and durability were primary.  The equipment is subjected to physical stress, contact with water, strong vibrations and temperature effects.  Therefore, in the question of which Bluetooth headphones are better for use in sports, it is advisable to take into account the specific scope of their application. </p><p>  Large full-size models, for example, are not suitable for a wide range of sports disciplines - from running to swimming.  A universal solution will be earplugs, but even in this class not every model will be able to withstand the same water environment.  These and other operational nuances should be calculated, as well as the playback parameters of musical compositions. </p><p>  Also, the cost may influence the choice.  As practice shows, high-quality <span>wireless headphones for sports</span> can cost 5-7 thousand. Lowering this bar will result in poor quality sound, and an increase can indicate the use of high-tech element base. </p>
