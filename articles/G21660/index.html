And they, of course, want to dress them up in something special.  You can buy clothes for the doll and in the store, but it is much cheaper to make it yourself.  For example, to tie.  <span>How to make things for dolls</span> using a hook and knitting needles - we will consider further. </p><h2>  Original knitting doll clothes </h2><p>  An ordinary doll, originally from our childhood, similar to all other dolls.  But if you make <span>clothes for her</span> with <span>your own hands</span> using knitting, then it will be impossible to look away from her. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make stuff for dolls" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17517/347972.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <p>  The photo shows several options for <span>clothes for dolls.</span>  Let's take a closer look at each of them. </p><h2>  Cape with a hood </h2><p>  This option fits simply enough, but looks simply charming, somewhat reminiscent of Little Red Riding Hood's outfit.  To knit the same, you will need the remains of red yarn and knitting needles.  But maybe you want to make it in a different color?  This is not important.  Choose what you like best.  So, let's begin.  Now you will learn how to make things for dolls quickly and beautifully. </p><p>  The cape itself and the hood are knitted separately.  Let's start with the cape.  Having measured the necessary girth around the doll‚Äôs neck, we collect the corresponding number of loops.  Next, we continue knitting with any pattern you like, it is the easiest.  In any case, this model will look great.  In the course of knitting, do not forget to make uniform increases throughout the fabric to give the wrap the desired shape.  Having reached the required length, the last few rows can be made with garter stitching, this will help the edge of the product not to bend, to be even. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now you can start knitting a hood.  To do this, we collect the same number of loops on the knitting needles as for the cape.  Only knit without increases.  You should get a rectangular canvas.  After closing all the loops, we make a seam on the upper part of the future hood, and connect its lower part to the cloak.  Do not forget to attach ties at the junction of the hood and the cape, with the help of which it will keep well on the doll. </p><h2>  Fashionable doll kit </h2><p>  Another option that answers the question of how to <span>knit things</span> for dolls is shown in another photo.  Its implementation, as in the first case, does not require much time and effort from you.  And as a material, multi-colored remains of yarn are suitable.  In this case, these are three colors: pink, lilac and blue. </p>

Probably even beginner needlewomen know <span>how to knit a</span> scarf.  You can give it volume and an aesthetic appearance using a garter stitch, alternating it with several rows of facial loops.

    <p>  To make a beret on circular knitting needles (you can use 5 knitting needles), the desired number of loops is typed, equal to the circumference of the head of your doll, and an elastic band is knitted.  After that, in the last row of the elastic band, a uniform increase of loops is carried out around the entire circumference.  You can knit with facial loops or garter stitch.  Having knitted the desired height, we begin to carry out the reduction.  It is better to do this in several places at once, for example in four, through a row.  When 4-6 stitches remain on the knitting needles, you need to throw them on a thread and tighten.  Beret is ready.  You can also decorate it with a <span>knitted flower.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And finally, a bag.  It consists of three parts.  The shape can be any, not necessarily the same as in the photo.  Imagine, and maybe you will succeed even better.  We knit two identical parts in the form of a rectangle, in which the lower part has rounded corners.  Pattern - garter stitch.  The handle is also made with <span>garter stitch.</span>  In our case, it will also play the role of the side parts and the bottom.  After all the details are ready, we combine them and decorate the finished bag with decorative flowers.  No one except your daughter will have such a fashionable doll.  Agree that she will be very happy. </p><h2>  How to make things for dolls?  Knit a stylish dress </h2><p>  The following photo shows a variant of the dress for the doll. </p>

You will need leftover yarn in two colors and thin knitting needles.  You can use circular or knit on five knitting needles.  We collect 20 loops on the knitting needles.  This is an approximate amount, it is better to take measurements from your model and focus on its size.  Next, we perform knitting in a circle, changing the colors of the yarn to make strips.  Having reached the waist, it is necessary to perform several decreases.  This will help the dress to sit on the doll better, so to speak, in shape.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe armhole, on both sides we close 2-3 loops and in the next row above them we collect new ones in the same amount.  Now knitting must continue with an elastic band.  After several rows, close all the loops.  The dress is ready.  Easier can hardly be imagined.

We make a ring of 5 air loops and continue knitting in a circle.  It can be ordinary double crochet or without, or some kind of pattern.  The last row of the cap is crocheted and crocheted using the ‚Äústep of the hound‚Äù technique.

    <p>  And for a poncho, any openwork pattern with an extension to the bottom is suitable.  We start to knit from the neck in a circle.

Yes, for a more aesthetic appearance, the hat can be decorated with a knitted flower or a decorative button. </p><p>  How to make things for dolls?
