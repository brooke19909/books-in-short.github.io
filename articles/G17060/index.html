Only one thing is known from the history of the appearance of this reservoir - sand was previously actively mined here.  Previously, they say, the reservoir was connected to the Ob River.  And probably it‚Äôs true, because when a strong flood, the river and the quarry still merge.  Now Muscovites and residents of the area come here to swim, sunbathe, go fishing and even dive. </p><p>  To get here is not a problem, only 100 km from the capital. </p><p>  In winter, when the quarry is covered with a thick layer of ice, lovers of ice skating and those who are interested in winter fishing come here. </p><h2>  Briefly about the area </h2><p>  On June 6 this year, the Stupino district was abolished and on July 8 it was transformed into a municipality - a city of regional subordination Stupino. </p><p>  Geographically, the city is located on the Moscow-Smolensk Upland.  The population at the beginning of 2017 is 121 332 people.  The radiation environment is considered favorable. </p><p>  The monastery, which is visible from the shores of the Belopesotsky quarry, is actually the "founder" of the Stupinsky settlement.  In the XV century, it was erected near Kashira and was an outpost in the defense of the Moscow state from the raids of the Mongol-Tatars. </p><p>  Already in the XVI century, Prince Vasily III granted the "Stupinsky repair" (monastery and surroundings) to the abbot of the monastery Vladimir.  Since 1511, the village was called the village of Stupinskaya. </p><p>  In the XVIII century, most of the land was transferred to the landlords.  And in the XIX century, industrial enterprises began to appear on the territory of the district.  One of the largest was a print factory in the village of Mescherino, which was undertaken by the Ermakovs.  At that time, it was one of the most significant in the whole Moscow region.  At the end of the century, construction of the Paveletsky railway line began. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Under Soviet rule, the Kashira Electric Locomotive Plant was erected, schools and kindergartens began to open.  Started the construction of a metallurgical plant.  When the plant was launched, more than 18 thousand people already lived in the area.  In the 50s, a combined heat and power plant was commissioned, and infrastructure grew.  The presence of military-industrial complex enterprises in the region made it "closed", but this status has already been withdrawn. </p>

    <h2>  Monastery </h2><p>  On the left bank of the Oka River near the city of Stupino, there is the Trinity Convent, which is visible from the banks of the Belopesotsky quarry. </p><p>  The monastery was erected in the XV century by Vladimir Bolopesotsky.  He came from the Rzhev boyars and became a prince of the Varlaamo-Khutynsky monastery.  The icon of this holy man holds a sanctuary prayer every Sunday. </p><p>  The monastery has many shrines, two reliquaries with holy relics and an icon with holy relics.  On the territory there is a well of St. Sergius of Radonezh with clean drinking water. </p><p>  Visitors are always welcome to the monastery, here you can get clean water from the well and purchase natural products grown by nuns.  If you manage to get here on an Orthodox holiday, you should definitely visit the service. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Fishing and diving </h2><p>  The best fishing on the Belopesotsky quarry of the Stupinsky area after the spills, in early autumn.  But even in other seasons you can catch perch, pike and, of course, crucian carp. </p><p>  Bad fishing after a hot summer, and the higher the atmospheric temperature, the less common fish. </p><p>  Divers also do not bypass this pond.  According to them, in some places the depth reaches 25 meters.  Divers are attracted by the unusual visibility of standing water.  There are no organized dives here, and all scuba diving enthusiasts gather through social networks. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Reviews about the Belopesotsky career are quite laudatory, so many Muscovites come here to relax on weekends and holidays.  To get here without personal transport, you need to catch an electric train at the Paveletsky station and get to the Belopesotskaya station.  After leaving the station, cross the railroad tracks and walk along the embankment in the direction of the train.  Slightly not reaching the bridge over the Oka River, on the left side you can see a barge and a quarry. </p><p>  GPS coordinates for vehicle owners: 54.867452 38.167045 <br>  54 ¬∞ 52'2 "N 38 ¬∞ 10'1" E. </p><p>  The photos from the city of Stupino and the Belopesotsky quarry are extraordinary, there are many interesting places and clear water in the area.  To see beautiful places, it is not necessary to travel outside the country.  You can only be poisoned from the noisy capital for some 100 kilometers, relax and gain strength. </p>
