There are many attractions and memorable places.  The city is a transit for tourists who follow to Rostov-on-Don or to the Crimea.  Novoshakhtinsk hotels offer tourists and guests a comfortable rest before their further journey or accommodation while exploring the city. </p><h2>  Hotel "Zarya" (Novoshakhtinsk) </h2><p>  This hotel is located in the very center of the city (700 meters) on Lenin Avenue, 52. All rooms are located on 3 floors of a spacious building.  The hotel is 200 meters from the city's bus station and 12 km from the M4 highway. </p><p>  Such a convenient location makes it attractive to many visitors to the city.  Rooms of different levels of comfort.

Many believe that the hotel can count on more stars. </p><p>  The interior of the hotel is simple, a bit Soviet.  The spacious halls of the floors are decorated with curtains and tulle.  The rooms also do not stand out with a special design. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="room with a large bed" class="if uuid-2786713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2786713.jpg"></div><p>  Light walls, simple but comfortable furniture.

The bathroom has a shower and all the necessary components. </p><p>  Near the hotel there is a small patio and parking.  The reception and security are open 24 hours a day.

A large high-rise building, completely unlike a hotel.  There are very few reviews about this place.  Apparently, this is due to a not very good location (outskirts of the city). </p><h2>  "Lotus" </h2><p>  This hotel in Novoshakhtinsk is located 100 meters from the well-known Rostov-Kharkiv highway on 40th Street of the Soviet Army, building 10. It offers guests 13 rooms of different comforts, with a total capacity of up to 53 people.  The average room rate per person per day is 500-750 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="directmap.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Alpha&quot;" class="if uuid-2786717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2786717.jpg"></div><p>  You can stay in a single room with private facilities on the floor (2 rooms) for 750 rubles per day per person.  A double two-room room with amenities (1 room) will cost the same as the previous one.  Double one-room room with shared facilities (3 rooms), guests can purchase for a day for 600 rubles.  If you need a four-room single room with conveniences on the floor, then in the hotel it can be rented for 500 rubles per day per person.  For the same price, the hotel offers rooms for 6, 8 and 12 people per day.  Therefore, large companies do not need to worry - there is enough space for everyone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="interior at the Zarya hotel" class="if uuid-2786707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2786707.jpg"></div><p>  On the floors there is a kitchen where you can cook and drink tea.  There you will find a microwave, kettle and kitchenware.  Several rooms have their own TV.  Guests can use the free internet in the hotel lobby.  Novoshakhtinsk hotels almost always provide free Internet access and multi-channel TV to their guests. </p><p>  Hotel reviews are good.  Guests say that it is quite possible to spend the night and relax in front of a long road.  Some guests say that due to the low cost of rooms, different contingents gather here.  However, if you take a separate room, then this will not interfere with your vacation. </p><h2>  Hotel "Rainbow" (Novoshakhtinsk) </h2><p>  Mini-hotel "Rainbow" is located in Novoshakhtinsk at the address: Kharkovskaya street, house 2. It is very close to the city bus station. </p><p>  Quiet and comfortable place with 22 rooms.  Each apartment has hot water, its own shower and toilet, as well as the necessary furniture (bedside tables, wardrobes and a table).  A TV and fridge are also available.  You can ask the administrator for a hairdryer and ironing facilities.  There is a parking place and a courtyard with a garden. </p><p>  There are not many reviews from the visitor about this place.  Guests say in their reviews that this hotel is not recommended for living.  Guests often book a room on the way to the Crimea (to relax before the next leg).  A room for 2 adults and a child costs 2000 rubles.  In the comments, unwashed walls and window sills are noted.  The room and shower have a terrible smell.  Everything is dirty and sloppy.  Guests often do not have the opportunity to go to another place, so they stay overnight at this hotel. </p><h2>  "Comfort" </h2><p>  The hotel was opened in Novoshakhtinsk on Karl Marx Street, 35A, in 2014.  This is a small motel with four rooms, which can accommodate up to 8 guests. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="47.7955304" data-lng="39.88914169999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/4/0/7/8407.png"></div><p>  The hotel has internet and parking for cars.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  Simply furnished but tastefully furnished.  Thought out all the minimum benefits for living.  A small closet with hangers, a comfortable bed and a shower room.  The prices at the hotel are affordable. </p><p>  In their reviews, guests speak pleasantly about the hostess and the mini-hotel as a whole.  They say that everything is clean and clean.  Sheets and towels are fresh and new.  The hostess is responsive and friendly.  There is even a pool table for those who want to get distracted. </p><p>  Hotel "Comfort" (Novoshakhtinsk) has won the hearts of many guests with its soulful atmosphere and cleanliness.  Guests in their reviews thank the hostess and say they wanted to visit this place again. </p><p>  Hotels (Novoshakhtinsk) of any price categories and varieties always provide payment documents to their guests. </p><h2>  Daily rate apartments </h2><p>  As in any city, in Novoshakhtinsk you can stay in a comfortable apartment.  It is worth pre-negotiating the time of the meeting with the hosts, because in this kind of "hotels" there is no 24-hour reception.  It is also important to discuss the time of departure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new buildings in the city" class="if uuid-2786727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2786727.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, in the city of Novoshakhtinsk there are not many daily apartments that are officially rented out.  For example, on Leningradskaya street, 31, you can move into comfortable apartments.  There are 3 sofa beds for up to 6 people.  A kitchen with all utensils, a bathroom and a toilet are also available.  Near the house there is a convenient parking for cars and a playground.  If necessary, you can call a taxi and get to the airport or other point of the city. </p><p>  On the street Radio 90, building 1, there are also apartments for overnight and accommodation.  The apartment is located on the ground floor.  There is a balcony, a bathroom, a kitchen and a bedroom with a TV.  Guests in their reviews write that they liked everything.  The only negative is far from the M4 highway, so for those who want to drive past and spend the night in the city, you will have to take a little ride along the streets of Novoshakhtinsk. </p><h2>  Suburban Housing </h2><p>  If you have not found suitable accommodation in the city of Novoshakhtinsk, then you can pay attention to hotels and guest houses in the suburbs or neighboring cities (for example, the city of Shakhty).  There is also the Don Hotel (44 Mira Street) in the city, which offers 54 rooms for checking in.  However, guests do not leave reviews about this vacation spot, so you need to carefully study the rooms.  You can also look at Komsomolskaya street, house 18. Here a small hotel with 15 rooms is also ready to accept everyone.  There is a similar situation with this mini-hotel - there are no reviews from visitors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="photo.qip.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="appearance of the Zarya hotel" class="if uuid-2786739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2786739.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Hotels in Novoshakhtinsk, Rostov Region, are popular with city guests and transit tourists.  Many are looking for affordable lodging only at night to take a shower and sleep.  Some need comfortable apartments for a few days.  It is worth deciding on the area and price range, and you are sure to choose a convenient option.  If you arrive in the city late in the evening, then you should take care of where you eat.  There are practically no convenience stores and restaurants in the city.  Therefore, it is worth discussing the issue of food in advance at the place of reservation. </p>
