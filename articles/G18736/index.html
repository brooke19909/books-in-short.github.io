Most believe that this fluid is a mixture of many elements and nothing more.  However, this is not the case.  Blood is a <span>connective tissue that</span> is red and constantly in motion.  This fluid performs important and quite complex functions in our body.  It circulates blood through the circulatory system constantly.  Due to this, it transfers all the gaseous components and dissolved substances necessary for metabolic processes.  But why is blood referred to tissues?  She's liquid. </p>

    <h2>  Blood composition </h2><p>  To understand which tissue the blood belongs to and why, one should consider not only its basic functions, but also its structure.  What is it?  Blood is a tissue made up of cells and plasma.  Moreover, each of the elements performs certain functions and has its own properties. </p><p>  Plasma is an almost transparent liquid that has a slightly yellowish tint.  This component makes up most of the total blood volume in the human body.  In plasma, there are three main types of shaped elements: </p><ol><li>  Platelets are blood platelets that have an oval or spherical shape. </li><li>  White blood cells are white cells. </li><li>  Red blood cells are red cells that give the blood a characteristic shade due to its high hemoglobin content. </li></ol><p>  Not everyone knows how much of this fluid is in our body.  About 4-5 liters of blood are constantly circulating throughout the human circulatory system.  At the same time, plasma occupies 55% of the total volume, and the remaining percentages are formed elements, most of which are red blood cells - 90%. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Blood color </h2><p>  So, which tissue the blood belongs to is more or less clear.  But not everyone knows that this liquid can have different shades.  For example, blood that flows through the arteries first enters the heart from the lungs, and then carries oxygen throughout the body.  She has a bright scarlet color.  After the O <sub>2</sub> element is distributed through the tissues, blood flows back to the heart through the veins.  Here, this liquid becomes darker already. </p>

    <h2>  Blood properties </h2><p>  What type of tissue does blood belong to and what properties does it have?  First of all, it should be said that it is not just a liquid.  This is a substance whose viscosity depends on the percentage of red blood cells and proteins in it.  Similar properties affect the speed of movement, as well as blood pressure.  It is the movement of the components of the composition and the density of the substance that determines the fluidity of the tissue.  Individual blood cells move in completely different ways.  They are able to move not only individually, but also in small groups, for example, for red blood cells.  These shaped elements are able to move in the center of the vessels in the form of "piles" that look like folded coins.  Of course, red blood cells can move alone.  As for white cells, they usually stay along the walls of blood vessels and only one at a time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What is plasma? </h2><p>  To understand what tissue the blood belongs to, its components should be considered more carefully.  What is plasma?  This blood component is a light yellow liquid.  It is almost transparent.  Its shade is due to the presence of colored particles and bile pigment in its composition.  Plasma is approximately 90% water.  The remaining volume is occupied by minerals and organic substances dissolved in liquids.  It is worth noting that its composition is not constant.  The percentage of the same components may vary.  These indicators depend on what kind of food a person consumed, how many salts were in it and how much water.  The composition of the substances in the plasma is as follows: </p><ol><li>  1% - minerals, including potassium, magnesium, iron, calcium, sodium cations, iodine, sulfur, phosphorus, chlorine anions. </li><li>  Organic matter, including about 2% uric, lactic and other acids, amino acids and fats, 7% proteins and about 0.1% glucose. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Plasma composition </h2><p>  Proteins, which are part of the plasma, take an active part in the exchange of water, as well as in its distribution between blood and tissue fluid.  Of course, these are not all the functions of these components.  Thanks to proteins, blood becomes more viscous.  In addition, some components are antibodies that neutralize foreign agents in the body.  A special role is given to fibrinogen - a soluble protein.  This substance is involved in <span>blood coagulation</span> processes <span>.</span>  Under the influence of certain light factors, it turns into fibrin, which does not dissolve. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Blood is a type of tissue that performs special functions in the human body.  Its composition is unique.  Plasma also contains hormones produced by the endocrine glands.  The composition of this blood component also includes substances that are necessary for the normal functioning of our body.  As a rule, these are bioactive elements. </p><p>  It is worth noting that plasma in which there is no fibrinogen is usually called <span>blood serum.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Red blood cells </h2><p>  To understand which tissue the blood belongs to and why, it is necessary to carefully consider not only its composition, but also what functions certain components perform.  And there are not so many of them.  Most of all, the blood contains red blood cells.  These components make up from 44 to 48% of the total volume.  Red blood cells are cells in the form of discs, biconcave in the center.  Their diameter is about 7.5 microns.  This form of red blood cells increases the effectiveness of all physiological processes.  Due to the concavity, the cells have a larger area.  This factor is very important for a better gas exchange.  It is worth noting that mature red blood cells do not have nuclei.  The main function of these blood cells is the transfer from the lungs to other tissues of such an important substance as oxygen.  This fact allows us to argue that blood refers to tissue that performs transport functions. </p><h2>  The main properties of red blood cells </h2><p>  The name of the red blood cells in Greek means "red".  The cells owe their shade to hemoglobin protein.  This substance has a very complex structure and is able to bind to oxygen.  In the composition of hemoglobin, several main parts were revealed: protein - globulin, and non-protein, which contains iron.  The latter substance allows you to attach oxygen to the cells. </p>

    <p>  Red blood cells are formed, usually in the bone marrow.  Full ripening occurs after five days.  <span>The life expectancy of red blood cells</span> is not more than 120 days.  These cells are destroyed in the liver and spleen.  In this case, hemoglobin breaks down into globulin and non-protein components.  The release of iron ions is also observed.  They return to the bone marrow and are used to re-create blood cells.  After the release of iron, the non-protein component of hemoglobin is converted to bilirubin - the bile pigment that enters the digestive tract along with bile.  Reducing the level of red blood cells in human blood, as a rule, leads to the development of anemia, or anemia. </p><h2>  White blood cells </h2><p>  Blood belongs to the tissues of the internal environment.  In addition to plasma and red blood cells, it also contains white blood cells.  These cells are completely colorless.  They protect the body from the effects of harmful agents.  In this case, white bodies are divided into non-granular - agranulocytes, and granular - granulocytes.  The latter include eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils.  They differ in reactions to certain dyes.  Granular cells include lymphocytes and monocytes.  They have granules in the cytoplasm, as well as a nucleus, which consists of segments. </p><p>  Granulocytes protect the body from microorganisms.  These components are able to accumulate in the foci of infection and leave the vessels.  The main function of monocytes is the absorption of harmful agents, and lymphocytes - the production of interferon and antibodies, as well as the destruction of cancer cells. </p>

    <h2>  Platelets </h2><p>  The <span>blood</span> also includes platelets.  These are small colorless and nuclear-free plates, which, in essence, are fragments of cells located in the bone marrow - megakaryocytes.  Platelets can be rod-shaped, spherical and oval in shape.  Their life expectancy is not more than 10 days.  The main function of platelets is to participate in the processes associated with blood coagulation.  These <span>blood cells are</span> able to secrete substances that take part in certain reactions that start when damage to the walls of blood vessels.  In this case, fibrinogen gradually turns into strands of insoluble fibrin.  Blood cells become entangled in them, and as a result a blood clot forms. </p><h2>  The main functions of the blood </h2><p>  Blood, lymph belong to the tissue, which not only carries oxygen and other beneficial components to the organs, but also performs several other main functions.  The fact that these fluids are important for humans, no one doubts.  But not everyone knows why blood is needed. </p>

    <p>  This fabric performs several important functions: </p><ol><li>  Blood refers to tissue that protects the human body from various injuries and infections.  In this case, the main role is played by leukocytes: monocytes and neutrophils.  They rush to the affected areas and accumulate in this place.  Their main function is phagocytosis, in other words, the absorption of microorganisms.  In this case, monocytes are macrophages, and neutrophils are microphages.  As for other types of white blood cells, such as lymphocytes, they produce antibodies that fight harmful agents.  In addition, these blood cells are involved in the removal of dead and damaged tissues from the body. </li><li>  Also, do not forget that blood refers to the tissue, which performs transport functions.  These properties are very important for the body.  After all, blood supply affects almost all processes, for example, respiration and digestion.  Cells of liquid tissue carry oxygen throughout the body and remove carbon dioxide, end products and organic matter, transport bioactive elements and hormones. </li></ol><h2>  Special blood function </h2><p>  Blood refers to tissue that regulates temperature.  This fluid is necessary for a person to have all organs functioning normally.  It is blood that allows you to maintain a constant temperature.  Moreover, normally this indicator fluctuates in a rather narrow range - approximately 37 ¬∞ C. </p>
