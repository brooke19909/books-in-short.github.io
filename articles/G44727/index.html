Not all buyers prefer bright accents in design, many are drawn to minimalism and a sense of solidity. </p><p>  The device works well, there are no failures.  The service life is generally suggestible, although some complaints do occur.  However, you only need to take care of your tuner, then it will work for quite some time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tuner t2 channels" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1687139.jpg" width="600"></div>

This model is known for its powerful functional list, as well as its pretty design.  It allows you to happily watch your favorite movies, listen to music, and all this in good quality.  The device is quite successful, and this T2 tuner receives only laudatory reviews. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tuner t2 strong" class="if" height="102" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1687140.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Strong SRT 8500 </h2><p>  Tuner T2 "Strong SRT 8500" is sold complete with a cable for connecting to a TV, manual, remote control and batteries for it.  The case of the device is made of metal, and the front part is made of plastic.  Outwardly, it can resemble aluminum.  The total weight of the device is slightly less than 1 kg.  Of all the devices described above, this is the most difficult, but worth it.  The assembly of the tuner is of the highest quality, as well as the materials used. </p><p>  Consumers call this device balanced.  All details on technical characteristics are in harmony with each other.  Of course, it‚Äôs a little noticeable from the outside that the manufacturer tried to cheapen the product as much as possible.  He overdid it a bit, but for his price category these characteristics are enough.  Its cost is about 1000 rubles.  But I must say that against the background of other devices, more powerful, this receiver has poor performance and slow request processing speed.  But since Russian buyers prefer to use cheap devices with average quality, this receiver is also quite optimal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="T2 tuner firmware" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1687141.jpg" width="600"></div>
