    <h2>  City name </h2><p>  There are different versions about the origin of the name of this city.  One of the most common is the "church".  It is directly related to the location of the monastery and the <span>Valaam archipelago</span> in relation to the city.  Under this assumption, ‚ÄúSortavala‚Äù can be translated as ‚Äúpower at the devil‚Äù.  There is a legend that <span>an unclean force</span> nailed to this shore <span>,</span> which was expelled by the first monks from Balaam.  The second version (which appeared thanks to Academician Grotto) says that this name arose from the Finnish word ‚Äúsorttawa‚Äù, which means ‚Äúdissecting‚Äù.  It belonged to the Vakkolahti Gulf dividing the city into two halves.  This legend is liked by many visitors to the city, and they are happy to retell it to each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city of Sortavala is one of the beautiful and ancient cities of Karelia, which many of its guests recognize, leaving admiring reviews of its beauty.  It differs from the rest by its amazing historical and cultural view, which was formed by 3 states: Sweden, Finland and Russia.  The city appeared during the reign of the Swedes, its economic development and revival is associated with the time of joining our country, while the heyday falls on the period when it belonged to Finland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel wave sortavala" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/475101.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bit of history </h2><p>  The city was formed in 1632 by the Swedes, but in the twelfth century the Karelians here founded a fortified settlement.  A century later, the fortress perished: there is an opinion that it was destroyed by the Swedes.  But at the same moment the lands of today's Ladoga fell under the influence of Novgorod.  On the border of the 16-17th centuries, during the Russian-Swedish war, these lands more than once passed into different possessions.  The city in 1783 became a county and belonged to the Vyborg province, while in 1811 it became part of Finland along with the province.  In 1893, a railway was opened in Ladoga, after which, by the beginning of the twentieth century, a steamboat connection with St. Petersburg, Shlimmelburg, Valaam and <span>Konevetsky monasteries</span> appeared in this place <span>.</span>  Sortavala in 1917 began to relate to the Vyborg province.  Today it is a beautiful city that attracts with its historical sights and unusual architecture, which is confirmed by numerous reviews of tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="g sortavala hotels" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/475100.jpg" width="600"></div>
