The MTPL policy compensates the expenses of the motorist in case of unpleasant situations on the road, that is, accidents, so it is so important that you always have MTPL insurance with you.  What documents are needed and how much will have to be paid - these issues always remain relevant.  Let's try to figure it out. </p>

    <h2>  What do you need to apply for a policy? </h2><p>  Many drivers assume that previous insurance will be enough to get CTP; however, this is not so.  To conclude an agreement between the selected insurance company and the policyholder, a number of documents will be required. </p>

    <p>  However, they will not have to be collected and spent for this precious time for a long time, they are usually always with the drivers.  So, in order to conclude a CTP, you must provide the originals of the following documents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Documents for the car </h2><p>  This is usually either a <span>certificate of registration of the vehicle</span> - STS (it is also called a "pink card"), or a vehicle passport - TCP (popularly - "blue").  These documents indicate the technical data of the car, as well as the basic data of the owner - name, address. </p><h2>  Identity document </h2><p>  Usually this is the passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation - the owner of the vehicle.  If the policyholder and the owner are different persons, then the passport of the policyholder is also required. </p><h2>  Vehicle <span>technical</span> inspection form </h2><p>  Now at the stations conducting technical inspection of the vehicle, the owner is issued a diagnostic card that contains data about the car, the date of the present and future inspection.  In order for CTP insurance to be concluded, you must have a valid diagnostic card.  It must be valid for at least another 24 hours. </p><p>  Many drivers, wanting to save their own money, avoid passing the inspection and try to manage MTPL with the current inspection, but they either forget or don‚Äôt want to get a new one.  Remember that in the event of an accident, if the database does not contain data on the technical inspection of the vehicle, the insurance company has the right to refuse to pay you. </p><h2>  Driver's license </h2><p>  This document is necessary if the MTPL agreement is concluded with a limited list of drivers.  Moreover, certificates of all drivers are required, which will be entered in the insurance policy.  In extreme cases, you can provide copies of them.  It is important to know that the number of drivers entitled to drive a car cannot exceed four people.  Otherwise, you can take out insurance without restriction.  With unlimited insurance, driver's licenses are not required. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In some cases, representatives of the <span>insurance company</span> may require a contract of sale or some other documents.  But this is rather an exception than a rule. </p>

    <p>  Only after everything you need is prepared, can you take out <span>compulsory motor third party liability insurance.</span>  What documents are needed for this, you already know, therefore, problems should not arise.  The next question that logically arises from the owner of the car: "How much money to cook?" </p><h2>  Cost of CTP </h2><p>  Pleasure is not the cheapest, but you still need to get a policy.  In this case, driving is safer.  After all, no matter how confident the driver is in his professionalism, no matter what driving experience he has, situations happen different.  Even one minute, during which the driver was distracted, can turn into an accident.  Therefore, it‚Äôs cheaper to apply for a policy than to pay for the repair of a damaged car. </p><p>  The cost of OSAGO is the sum of the base rate multiplied by several factors.  The maximum base rate for individuals is 4118 rubles, the minimum is 3432. Insurance companies have the right to establish the base themselves, so the price of the policy may vary slightly. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the coefficients that are taken into account when calculating the cost, insurance companies are also required to see the driver's discount, which is provided to him for each accident-free year in the amount of 5%.  Data is contained in a single database and does not depend on the preferences of insurers.  Now let's talk more about the coefficients. </p><h2>  Insurance Rate Coefficients </h2><p>  The following <span>insurance</span> rate <span>ratios are available</span> . </p><p>  1. The territory of preferential use of the vehicle. </p><p>  It is determined at the place of registration of the owner of the vehicle.  It is established by the law on compulsory motor liability insurance, for example, the coefficient in Moscow is 2, in Irkutsk 1.7, but in Sevastopol it is only 0.6. </p><p>  2. Age and experience of the driver. </p><p>  If the driver is younger than 22 years old, and his experience is less than three years, or any of this item separately, then an increased coefficient in the range of 1.6-1.8 is applied. </p><p>  3. The number of persons allowed to drive a car. </p><p>  If the insurance policy does not provide for restrictions on the number of drivers, then a <span>multiplying factor of</span> 1.8 is also applied. </p><p>  4. Vehicle power in hp </p><p>  The greater the power, the greater the coefficient.  For example, the coefficient applied to the base rate for a car with 135 hp.  equal to 1.4.  Up to 50 hp  - 0.6. </p><p>  5. The period of use. </p><p>  Basically, the owner concludes the CTP policy for a year.  The applied coefficient in this case is equal to one.  But if you take out insurance for six months, you will have to pay 70% of the cost of the policy for a year, that is, the coefficient will be 0.7. </p><p>  That's all the coefficients that are taken into account when calculating the cost of the policy.  Do not forget about the existing discount.  If it is owned by the owner, but it was not taken into account, then OSAGO insurance may also be invalid.  What documents are needed to confirm the discount?  Only a driver‚Äôs license or, if insurance is unlimited, the passport of the owner of the vehicle. </p>
