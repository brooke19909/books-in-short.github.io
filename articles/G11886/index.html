To do this, fill out the corresponding report.  This document displays data on income and deductions to the budget by citizens or foreigners.  The employer is required to submit this documentation annually to the appropriate regulatory authorities at the place of registration.  Instructions and rules for filling out certificate 2 personal income tax will be discussed later. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Before you consider the sample of filling out income statements 2 personal income tax, you need to pay attention to general recommendations regarding this process. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.glavbukh.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="income statement 2 personal income tax sample" class="if uuid-3171236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/3171236.jpg"></div><p>  So, the Ministry of Finance approved the new form, which is valid in 2019, by order of 02.10.18.  It also contains the following applications: </p><ul><li>  No. 1. Reporting form. </li><li>  No. 2. The order of filling. </li><li>  No. 3. Report in electronic format. </li><li>  No. 4. The procedure for submitting completed documentation to the tax office. </li></ul><p>  For the first time, the recipients of income will apply when filling in statements for 2018 for the first time to apply for personal income tax 2.  It is composed of authorized representatives.  It can be entrepreneurs, companies, lawyers, notaries.  In addition, representatives of foreign organizations on the territory of our country can be the drafters of this document.  The submitted reporting form is filled out by those citizens who pay salaries, dividends or other types of income.  This provision is regulated by the tax legislation of the Russian Federation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The submitted document is prepared for the calendar year.  In some cases, the tax office may require reporting for 2, 3 or more years.  Such reporting may be nullifying or corrective. </p><p>  If the company where the employee worked has ceased its activity, documentation is submitted from the beginning of the year until the organization ceases to work. </p><h2>  When else is the document filled out? </h2><p>  Filling out an income statement 2 PIT is a mandatory procedure for people who receive different types of taxable income.  The information that is entered in the corresponding form reflects information about the tax withheld and transferred for the calendar year.  Also, this procedure is mandatory if it is impossible to withhold such deductions from income, for example, upon dismissal of an employee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nicepng.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Help form 2 personal income tax form" class="if uuid-3171230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/3171230.jpg"></div><p>  All the necessary information is submitted on one form, even if a citizen or a foreigner receives different types of income.  If in previous periods mistakes were made when filling out or recalculation occurred in previous years, a corrective note 2 of personal income tax is compiled in a new form.  A sample of the filling is presented in the order of the Ministry of Finance and will be considered later.  If passport or other taxpayer data has changed during this period, new information must be provided. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you want to completely cancel the accruals for the previous period, in the current year a cancellation document is prepared in the specified form.  In it you need to fill in only the title and the first section. </p><p>  If a company reports for the year as a successor of rights and an entity listing taxes for itself and another taxpayer, two reports are filled out.  One of them provides information before the reorganization, and the second after it. </p><p>  The current sample for filling out the form 2 of the personal income tax certificate is applied if only part of the tax was withheld.  But in this case, you need to pass two documents.  The first document of the established form shall be submitted with the indication in the corresponding lines of code 1 or 3. All income should be reflected in it.  The second document is handed over with codes 2 and 4. This document displays data only on income that was not withheld until this point in the reporting period. </p><p>  There are situations when reports with codes 1 and 2 are the same.  In this case, you must first report with the second sign, and then with the first.  According to the judges, in such a situation it is enough to provide only a document of the second category. </p><p>  The presented reporting is not executed for the entrepreneur, since such entities themselves pay the corresponding deductions to the budget and report on such payments. </p><h2>  Rules for registration </h2><p>  There is a certain procedure for filling out certificate 2 of personal income tax.  Correction of errors by means of a corrector or other means is not allowed.  Two-sided printing, stapling of sheets, which leads to damage to the document, is also prohibited.
