Triac power phase control</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many appliances in the house a person has the ability to customize.  This process is carried out using a special regulator.  To date, a triac subtype has been singled out in a separate category, but many know little about this element.  In fact, the feature of this part is a two-way action.  Perhaps this is due to the anode, as well as the cathode.  As a result of their movement in the device, the <span>current direction</span> changes <span>.</span> </p><p>  Some believe that triacs may well be replaced by contactors, relays, and starters.  However, this opinion is erroneous.  First of all, the durability of these regulators should be noted.  In terms of switching frequency, they are practically unlimited and this is good news.  The wear of parts is minimal.  In addition, it should be noted the complete absence of sparking in devices of this type.  At times of zero mains current, regulators are capable of switching.  Due to this, interference in the circuit is significantly reduced. </p>

    <h2>  Simple controller circuit </h2><p>  The power regulator circuit on the triac includes one chip, as well as a set of thyristors.  They can be located in the circuit after the capacitor or immediately at the board.  <span>A variable resistor,</span> as a rule, there is one in the device.  He is in the regulator responsible for the interference.  The voltage resistor is able to withstand the most diverse.  In this case, much depends on the freedom of the device.  The resistor, which is located behind the capacitor, must limit the resistance to 3 ohms.  In turn, the element at the output is set slightly weaker.  Also, the power regulator circuit on the triac includes a fuse. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Regulators on the triac "KU208g" </h2><p>  This triac is different in that it is able to work with switched <span>alternating current.</span>  In this case, the voltage in the system is maintained up to 5 A. The power regulator on the KU208g triac, as a rule, is compact and can be used in various equipment.  An example is a soldering iron. </p><h2>  Power Regulators for Soldering Iron </h2><p>  The power regulator of the soldering iron on the triac does not need a microcircuit.  There are two transistors in the standard circuit.  They are installed in some cases of a bipolar type.  The first one should be located directly near the power source.  At this time, the second bipolar transistor is located behind the triac. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of such regulators is considered to be the presence of weak-watt Zener diodes.  Most often, these elements on the market can be found with the marking "KD2".  This indicates that the zener diode can withstand a voltage of 2 V. In turn, the alternating current in the system can be a maximum of 5 A. There is always only one capacitor in the circuit.  Solder it in some cases immediately after the <span>bipolar transistor.</span> </p><p>  This element in the device is responsible for the conversion of current.  Resistors The power regulator on the triac has a different type.  The analog input elements withstand a maximum resistance of 2 ohms.  In turn, behind the zener diode, resistors are installed of variable type with increased frequency.  They are able to work in both directions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Model diagrams for vacuum cleaners </h2><p>  The power regulator on the triac of a vacuum cleaner consists of a set of diodes, as well as resistors with one capacitor.  For good conductivity, the triac in some cases is equipped with a finned heat sink.  This further helps in stabilizing the voltage.  Capacitors in the system cope with pulses.  Transistors mainly use silicon. </p><p>  They can pass through themselves only <span>direct current.</span>  The output impedance in the system must not exceed 4 ohms.  Otherwise, a large voltage is applied to the triac.  A lot in this situation also depends on the current transfer coefficient.  The collector affects it along with the installed emitter. </p>

    <h2>  The difference between phase regulators </h2><p>  Microcircuits in such regulators use low-frequency ones.  This is necessary for a quick conversion process.  Zener diodes are used quite rarely.  The phase change in the system occurs due to the switching of the capacitor to the upper position.  To stabilize the voltage, the phase power regulator on the triac has two thyristors, and they work in pairs in a circuit.  Due to the high frequency at the cathode, diodes are very rarely soldered. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Faultless Regulator Diagram </h2><p>  A simple noiseless power regulator on a triac is usually used on devices with voltages above 200 V. In this case, two-channel chips are used.  The diode system is installed next to the capacitors.  Variable transistors are not used in the circuit.  The maximum resistance of the capacitor must withstand up to 3 ohms.  Directly regulating the power of the device is carried out using the receiver. </p><p>  The level of duty cycle of the pulses in this case changes.  Capacitors in the system pass only direct current through themselves.  <span>The frequency of the clock</span> transistor depends on the division ratio of the counter.  Microcontrollers in the system are used to suppress interference.  The pulse frequency at the input depends solely on the limit register. </p>

    <h2>  Regulators with triacs "TC80" </h2><p>  A simple power regulator on the TC80 triac is capable of boasting good heat conductivity.  The conversion process is carried out directly in the transformer.  The limiting frequency in this case depends only on the voltage in the network.  In general, regulators with triacs of this type are characterized by increased reliability, and they are able to work for a long time.  However, they also have disadvantages. </p><p>  First of all, a low level of stabilization should be noted.  This is due to the large load that is placed on the thyristor.  To cope with the stability of the current, in some cases, special filters are used.  However, for household equipment this does not help.  Thus, it is best to use this type of regulator on receivers and other low-frequency devices. </p><h2>  Models with triac "TS 125" </h2><p>  The power controller on the triac "TC 125" is used for powerful power supplies.  Resistance, it is capable of withstanding a maximum of 4 ohms.  In this case, the heat conductivity is at a high level.  In addition, it should be borne in mind that triacs of this type are equipped with indicators.  These devices are designed to combat electromagnetic interference. </p><p>  In some cases, the display system is set active.  This involves the use of a low frequency controller.  This element in the system works in conjunction with limiters.  It allows only alternating current to pass through it.  In case of negative polarity, capacitors are included in the operation.  To switch to mains voltage, there are a number of transistors. </p>

    <h2>  Remote control devices </h2><p>  The remote power controller on the triac is necessarily equipped with a controller.  Diodes in the system are installed only analog type.  The chip for the normal operation of the capacitors requires a three-channel.  Resistors, as a rule, need only three.  One of them is needed to transmit and stabilize the signal from the transformer.  The remaining two resistors are installed opposite the capacitors.  In this case, the interference amplitude is significantly reduced and this should be taken into account. </p><p>  Additionally, converters are available in the regulators.  The rated load of these elements is maintained at 5 A. Variable resistors in the circuit are used quite rarely.  This is due to the fact that there are high voltage power sources.  Filtration systems are installed exclusively in front of the transformer.  In this case, the accuracy factor will be maximum. </p><h2>  Soft start regulators </h2><p>  For a smooth start, a special block is inserted into the power regulator on the triac.  Its main objective is dual integration.  This happens by determining the limit value of polarity.  The display system in the regulators is quite rare.  Such devices can be used at temperatures from -20 to +30 degrees.  The power source of the system can be a unit with a capacity of up to 10 V. The sensitivity of the device depends solely on the types of resistors.  If analog elements are used in the system, current conversion is much faster. </p><p>  The common-mode voltage of the regulator can be maintained at 5 V. The capacitors in the device are installed with a limit resistance of 6 ohms.  In this case, their minimum capacitance should be 2 pF.  All this will significantly stabilize the output voltage.  Diodes in the regulator are soldered with low power.  The maximum load they must be prepared to withstand at 5 A. </p>
