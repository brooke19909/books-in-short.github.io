It will come true in Pattaya, in a Thai city on the seashore, in one of the most beautiful corners of the world. </p><p>  To fulfill your dream, you just need to come to the four-star Ambassador Pattaya Hotel.  Here you will find a wonderful vacation away from civilization.  And the location of the Ambassador Hotel in Pattaya contributes to this.  The hotel itself is located 13 kilometers from Pattaya, in the southern Thai coast of Jomtien, on the seashore.  It consists of five buildings and includes more than four thousand rooms.  The main building of the Ocean Wing Hotel is a magnificent eighteen-story building.  But tourists are very fond of taking photos that are inserted into their reviews about the Ambassador Hotel in Pattaya, from the roof of another building - Marina Tower.  It has 42 floors, which provides not only an excellent overview of the hotel, but also offers a magnificent view of the city, the sea and the exotic nature of this area.  The hotel offers guests different in size (from 19 to 48 m2) and the number of accommodation (from two to four people) rooms.  They have all the conditions for living - bath or shower, hairdryer, TV, telephone, minibar, furniture.  In the smaller buildings of the hotel (Inn Wing, Garden Wing) there is no only a hairdryer, and all other benefits of the hotel will remain unchanged. </p><p>  The hotel has four outdoor pools, and, if desired, before reaching the sea beach, you can refresh yourself in clear transparent water.  Also, Ambassador Pattaya Hotel has at its disposal four restaurants, six bars and cafes.  In restaurants you can enjoy Thai, Japanese, Italian and Chinese national dishes.  And at <span>Espresso Coffee</span> Bar you will be offered many varieties of gourmet coffee for every taste.  AtriumCafe serves a la carte <span>Thai specialties</span> prepared around the clock.  And after six in the evening, the performance of talented musicians begins, the national coloring of which adds a large portion of exotic. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When you, having tried all the works of art by local chefs, decide to go to the beach, the road will not take you much time.  Indeed, the huge <span>Ambassador Pattaya</span> hotel is built right on the seashore and has its own sandy beach with beautiful palm alleys.  Sun loungers, umbrellas and <span>beach towels are</span> free for hotel guests.  Swim in the clear sea and sunbathe under the tropical sun.  A beautiful even tan will delight you for a long time. </p><p>  If you are a fan <span>of outdoor activities,</span> you can work out in the gym or play beach volleyball, tennis and badminton.  Jacuzzi and sauna are an integral part of relaxation in Pattaya.  And what a <span>vacation in Thailand</span> without a real Thai massage, which you will make the skillful hands of oriental girls. </p><p>  Arriving with your children will give them an unforgettable vacation.  A mini club, a playground and a children's pool will bring them a lot of pleasure.  Upon request, the hotel staff will install a baby cot or babysitting service in the room. </p><p>  After reviewing the reviews about the Ambassador Hotel in Pattaya, you will realize that you cannot find a better place to relax.  Here you can rent a car, or maybe take a tuk-tuk to Pattaya itself.  Or go on a <span>voyage</span> to the neighboring islands.  If you are a lover of water sports, then try yourself in diving and plunge into a world full of enchanting beauties. </p><p>  In Pattaya, the tourist season lasts all year round.  But the hottest months are in March, April and May.  In these months it is most pleasant to swim in the sea or bask in the pool.
