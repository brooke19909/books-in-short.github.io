  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Heart rate monitor with chest sensor: overview, description, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you carefully monitor your health, want to lose weight or just go in for sports, then the segment of heart rate monitors (trackers) is probably familiar and interesting to you.  The first devices of this kind appeared in the distant 80s.  They were quite massive and performed only one function - they measured heart rate. </p><p>  Today's gadgets have stepped far ahead in technical terms and can offer a lot of interesting things that greatly increase the effectiveness of training.  The modern market for sports devices offers a wide range of models that differ from each other not only in price, but also in functionality, size and other characteristics. </p><h2>  What are heart rate monitors? </h2><p>  Almost all sports trackers can be divided into two types - wrist and chest.  Both varieties have both their pros and cons.  Let's start with the most important parameter - measurement accuracy. </p><p>  Independent experts in this field unanimously declare that the models mounted on the torso are much more accurate than all others.  Judging by the reviews of <span>wrist heart rate monitors</span> without a chest sensor, they lose to their counterparts by an average of 10-15%. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.danishbike.dk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best heart rate monitor on hand without a chest sensor" class="if uuid-3161420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3161420.jpg"></div><p>  But torso models are somewhat limited in applications.  They are not suitable for use in fitness rooms, and especially for weightlifting.  Yes, and swimmers experience discomfort from the pressure belt, when it is necessary to work hard with the chest on inhalation and exhalation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But if we are talking about cycling, running and other similar disciplines, then even the best heart rate monitor on hand without a chest sensor will give only approximate data.  The fact is that a belt attached to a torso is less susceptible to vibrations than arms or legs.  Hence, more accurate indicators. </p><p>  In our article, we will just consider models with fastening on the torso.  So, we bring to your attention an overview of heart rate monitors with a chest sensor.  Our list includes the most popular devices, distinguished by their effectiveness and a considerable amount of positive feedback from consumers. </p><h2>  Wahoo Fitness Tickr X </h2><p>  This is a multifunctional model for both amateur athletes and professionals.  A heart rate monitor with a digital chest sensor counts repetitions during training and captures some features of the exercises: vertical body vibration, speed, distance, time of contact with the ground, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wahoo Fitness Tickr X" class="if uuid-3161426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3161426.jpg"></div><p>  The device offers high accuracy of heart rate readings and a generally convenient design.  This is a great heart rate monitor with a chest sensor for running and cycling.  Judging by the reviews, the model reveals itself fully when working with a special proprietary application Wahoo Fitness.  Even cadence here can be calculated with high accuracy, not to mention the more familiar cycle parameters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Any ‚Äúsmart‚Äù gadgets like a smartphone or watch can be used as a data receiver.  The heart rate monitor with a chest sensor works via ANT + and bluetooth protocols.  The device itself has a built-in memory, where up to 16 hours of related information can be stored. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  But even without auxiliary gadgets, the device proved to be excellent.  As feedback, either LEDs (red with blue) or vibration are used.  Users in their reviews of a sports heart rate monitor with a chest sensor Fitness Tickr X also noted that the model is not only effective in its work and high ergonomic performance, but also extremely well assembled.  And the presence of protection according to IPX7 is a significant plus. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  accuracy of measurements; </li><li>  water tightness; </li><li>  support for a wide range of sports applications; </li><li>  the presence of ANT + modules and bluetooth; </li><li>  high ergonomic performance; </li><li>  decent battery life (up to six months); </li><li>  clear and understandable user feedback. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  the device itself shows only heart rate, and for the rest, ‚Äúsmart‚Äù gadgets with installed applications are needed; </li><li>  the model is not suitable for long periods under water. </li></ul><h2>  Garmin hrm tri </h2><p>  The model is designed specifically for triathletes and has related functionality.  The heart rate monitor with a chest sensor feels equally good both on the torso of cyclists and runners, and swimmers.  The device is fully revealed, working in tandem with smart watches of the same brand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Garmin hrm tri" class="if uuid-3161425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3161425.jpg"></div><p>  The tracker transmits real-time heart rate data via the ANT + wireless protocol.  The only thing worth clarifying is that for swimmers the procedure for interacting with the watch is slightly different than for land athletes.  When in the water, the chest heart rate sensor stores up to 20 hours of heart rate information.  And only after the user leaves the pool, transfers them to the paired gadget.  The fact is that ANT + signals do not pass through the water column. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the Garmin Hrm Tri is a great heart rate monitor with a chest sensor for running.  In addition to the usual indicators, the model tracks the frequency of steps, the vertical oscillation of the body, the time of contact with the surface and other dynamics. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  It is also worth noting the presence of an extensive Garmin web community where you can store your data, share it with friends, plan workouts, view graphical indicators, maps, and much more.  There are more familiar statistics: steps, calories burned, sleep time, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bikester.dk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heart rate monitor Garmin Hrm Tri" class="if uuid-3161427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3161427.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by user reviews, the universal heart rate monitor with a chest sensor Garmin Hrm Tri is an excellent option for athletes in almost all areas.  The device is accurate, convenient, cute and high quality assembled.  The only fly in the ointment is far from an affordable price tag. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  high accuracy of heart rate measurement; </li><li>  versatility / practicality; </li><li>  high-quality assembly; </li><li>  convenient design; </li><li>  compatibility with almost all smart watches that support the ANT + protocol; </li><li>  reliable protection against water (50 meters to dive); </li><li>  nice appearance. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  no bluetooth protocol; </li><li>  the price tag is high for an ordinary domestic consumer. </li></ul><h2>  Suunto smart belt </h2><p>  This heart rate monitor with a chest sensor is notable for its small size, comfortable to wear design and efficient operation in almost any environment.  As in the case of Garmin, the model is fully disclosed in tandem with the smart watches of the Suunto brand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.suunto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Suunto smart belt" class="if uuid-3161422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3161422.jpg"></div><p>  The device transmits information through the wireless protocol of bluetooth and can work both with gadgets on the iOS platform and on the Android OS.  The heart rate monitor does not display any data due to the lack of a display, but it saves a sufficiently large amount of information for subsequent transmission to a mobile device. </p><p>  You can work with the device through special software.  If this is a branded Suunto watch, then nothing needs to be installed.  The heart rate monitor collects data not only about heart rate, but also other information: steps taken, vertical body vibration, calories burned, etc. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  Judging by user reviews, it is best to use the brand‚Äôs proprietary application - MovesCount.  The utility allows you to keep logs, collect statistics and offers a detailed analysis of your sports activities.  All parameters are easily configurable, and remote control of the device occurs literally in one click. </p><p>  It is also worth noting the good protective characteristics of the heart rate monitor.  The case of the model is able to withstand pressure in 3 atmospheres, which is equivalent to diving to a depth of 30 meters.  Users have no complaints about the build quality.  The design does not play, does not creak and looks monolithic. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  high accuracy of heart rate measurement; </li><li>  Excellent ergonomics </li><li>  good protective characteristics; </li><li>  works with almost all sports applications; </li><li>  attractive appearance; </li><li>  Perfect balance price / quality. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  sometimes the device ‚Äúthinks‚Äù for a few seconds; </li><li>  the belt loses its elasticity over time. </li></ul><h2>  Sigma PC 15.11 </h2><p>  A Sigma heart rate monitor with a chest sensor is very popular among domestic consumers.  It is noteworthy that here we have a complete set of a belt with a device and a watch.  So you don‚Äôt have to bother with synchronization on smartphones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trisportowy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sigma PC 15.11" class="if uuid-3161424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3161424.jpg"></div><p>  The device displays the average, normal and maximum heart rate and displays all the information on the watch screen in real time.  If any parameters have been exceeded, then the sensor delivers sound, light or vibration signals to choose from. </p><p>  The device also knows how to count target zones, circles, jumps, training time and calories burned.  Naturally, in addition to sports performance, the watch also works for its intended purpose - a stopwatch and a date. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  Judging by user reviews, the watch, as well as the belt with a sensor, are distinguished by good ergonomic indicators.  Pleased with the assembly.  Both accessories look solid and solid: nothing crunches, does not play and does not creak.  In addition, the watch has an intelligent backlight that does not dazzle in the dark and is evenly located around the entire perimeter. </p><p>  There is also protection against water, but it cannot be called reliable.  With the kit you can run into the rain and plunge into the bathroom, but you should not swim in the pool, and even more so you can not dive to a solid depth.  In general, users are satisfied with the solution from Sigma and consider it the best option for beginner athletes. </p><p>  Heart Rate Benefits: </p><ul><li>  accurate heart rate readings of various types; </li><li>  brand watch included; </li><li>  advanced and clear alert system; </li><li>  an abundance of functions; </li><li>  multi-platform ("Android" / iOS); </li><li>  high level of ergonomics of gadgets; </li><li>  good build quality; </li><li>  adequate price tag. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  poor water protection; </li><li>  The sensor housing made of plastic quickly erases and loses its presentability. </li></ul><h2>  Polar H10 </h2><p>  The model is also very popular among domestic athletes and consumers leading a healthy lifestyle.  The heart rate monitor does not have a digital screen, so it reveals all its capabilities paired with some kind of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù gadget - a watch or a phone.  The device‚Äôs internal memory stores up to 65 hours of information and throws it off at the first synchronization, freeing up space for a new one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hinta.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Polar H10" class="if uuid-3161421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3161421.jpg"></div><p>  If you run or pedal along with a mobile gadget, then all data is displayed in real time.  The model is compatible with almost all popular sports applications.  In addition, the Polar brand is engaged in the production of sports equipment, and the heart rate monitor synchronizes with it without any problems. </p><p>  The device works over the wireless bluetooth protocol and is multi-platform.  Judging by user reviews, the model synergizes perfectly with both the Android platform and iOS.  Unlike the gadgets described above, this one does not count steps, does not track sleep and other activity.  But the problem is solved by purchasing Polar branded watches.  Such a tandem can offer an extensive list of features. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The build quality and ease of wearing also have no questions for users.  The model sits comfortably on the torso and does not rub the skin.  An elastic strap allows you to do breathing exercises without visible constraint.  The case looks solid.  Users do not mention creaks, backlashes, crunches and other shortcomings in their reviews. </p><p>  Also pleased with the protective characteristics of the gadget.  The model is not only resistant to physical influences, but also has a good indicator of water resistance.  With it you can safely visit the pool and dive to a depth of 30 meters. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  acceptable accuracy of heart rate readings; </li><li>  high-quality assembly; </li><li>  good ergonomic performance; </li><li>  water tightness; </li><li>  the ability to work in conjunction with GoPro cameras; </li><li>  Support for a large list of sports applications. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  almost all the useful functionality in the proprietary application is paid; </li><li>  for some users, the belt seemed too wide. </li></ul>
