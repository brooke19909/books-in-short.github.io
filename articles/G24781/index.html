    <p>  Tourists consider the Royalton Hotel 2 hotel to be quite a worthy place for spending the night. Guest reviews about its decoration, service and comfort are entirely objective.  No one has any complaints about the interior and furniture.  Separate plumbing, in the opinion of the guests, requires replacement.  Between breakfast and lunch, vacationers recommend giving preference to the latter type of food.  Lunch at restaurants is tastier, more generous and more varied than breakfast. </p><p>  In order for the apartments to be cleaned, it is necessary to leave a plate with the appropriate message on the door of the room.  Not every traveler likes this approach.  In general, tourists note that the price-quality ratio in the economy-class business hotel is maintained at a decent level. </p>
