Therefore, in the country's economy, this industry is gaining momentum. </p><h2>  About the current situation </h2><p>  At the moment, energy is in a difficult situation.  According to official data, wear of power lines in the EU was 25%, and substations - 45%.  40% of heating networks are in need of repair, and 15% are in extremely poor condition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Scheme of work" class="if uuid-2867088" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2867088.jpg"></div><h2>  In Russia </h2><p>  Energy conservation in the Russian Federation is characterized by new areas of activity.  And first of all, this is expressed in the increasingly frequently used sources of distributed generation.  This concept refers to small-scale energy facilities less than 25 MW.  Distributed generation plants cope with the tasks of local power supply for individual buildings and areas.  In addition to standard energy sources (coal, fuel oil, gas), their alternative types are also included here. </p><h2>  New opportunities </h2><p>  Distributed electricity generation is relevant in a wide variety of organizations.  It is used both in the service sector (in hotels, sanatoriums), and in agricultural facilities.  At the moment, legal entities in the country are trying to mobilize the resources they possess, and at the same time minimize costs.  And electricity is a pretty big expense item.  The development of distributed generation is an excellent way out of the situation for enterprises.  This is especially true of the largest industrial enterprises.  From the point of view of specialists, distributed generation facilities save many industrialists in the course of a change in the situation in provincial energy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, at the moment they make up only a share of 8% in the state‚Äôs electric power industry.  The niche of distributed energy generation begins its formation.  Positive examples of its development are rare.  One of the most striking objects is the point of small distributed generation in the Sredneuralskoye smelter. </p><p>  Projects for its construction were implemented with funds raised from investors.  Further, the owner implemented the operation of a distributed generation facility based on an energy service contract.  An important condition for a positive future for the electric power industry is to save the resource base.  When the energy service contract ends, the distributed generation facility becomes the property of the organization.  This happens after 9 years, and then the organization itself uses the object.  Such a scheme serves as an excellent tool for innovative support of distributed generation.  It should be used throughout the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  About the "green" sources </h2><p>  The discovery of sources of distributed generation by signing such agreements leads to the fact that the organization practically does not spend its resources.  In addition, investors are interested in the source working efficiently.  This conclusion is confirmed by the experience of the Sredneuralskiy smelter.  Currently, the station is loaded at 92% on average per year.  And when the agreement expires, the organization will receive its own mini-CHP, which will operate for at least 20 years.  The increasing popularity is evidenced by the increasingly appearing associated with distributed generation LLC.  So, one such society appeared in Rostov.  Distributed Generation LLC is engaged in the transfer and distribution of steam and hot water, as well as another 102 activities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="In Astrakhan" class="if uuid-2867086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2867086.jpg"></div><p>  In cases when, after the expiration of the agreement with the investor, the company cannot use the source of distributed generation, the agreement is extended.  And she continues to save on energy. </p><p>  Distributed generation design is carried out in such a way that energy is lost in minimal amounts during product transfer.  The efficiency of modern power plants is more than 90%.  Mini-CHPs remain cleaner in environmental terms.  Designing distributed generation allows you to achieve a minimum of noise during the operation of objects.  Harmful substances are practically not emitted.  This is due to trends associated with distributed generation. </p><p>  For block-modular variation does not require a large area.  It is combined with a minimum of construction work.  Distributed generation in Russia is increasingly represented by installations of this type.  Block-modular objects are considered the most reliable. </p><h2>  New technological way </h2><p>  Given the difficulties associated with raising funds for the construction of large power plants, the construction of mini-CHP seems to be an increasingly attractive and effective action.  Very popular LLC ‚ÄúEvrosibenergo-Distributed <span>Generation‚Äù.</span>  This organization is engaged in the distribution of steam and hot water, and also operates in 20 areas.  Eurosibenergo-Distributed Generation LLC has two branches in Krasnoyarsk and Nizhny Novgorod. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the moment, the company directs purchases to the satisfaction of its units, including subsidiaries.  Eurosibenergo-Distributed Generation LLC (Nizhny Novgorod and Krasnoyarsk branches) is interested in mutually beneficial relations with partners.  In order to work fruitfully on this aspect, a page on tenders was published on the company's official website.  LLC Eurosibenergo-Distributed Generation announces its purchases throughout the year, publishing them in the appropriate section on the website. </p><p>  And this is not the only large company operating in this area.  LLC Inter RAO - Distributed Generation is a large holding company engaged in increasing economic activity in the Russian Federation.  He makes an active contribution to the development of new energy.  LLC Inter RAO - Distributed Generation has gone from being an intermediary to the largest energy company. </p><h2>  Difficulties </h2><p>  However, there are several difficulties in introducing a mini-CHP.  Often, the relationship between large and distributed energy comes to a standstill.  This was expressed at the II All-Russian Conference ‚ÄúDevelopment of Small Distributed Energy in Russia‚Äù.  The thing is that the cost of electricity has become unprofitable, it is growing.  Big energy does not attract a lot of investments, and the bulk of the money comes from the state - about 85%.  And most importantly, there is no launch of competition, since there is centralized energy.  If you do not change the number of intermediaries, then it will not appear.  The conference participants came to the conclusion that distributed generation solves this issue.  It is she who grows through private initiatives, and sells final products at a real price. </p><h2>  In the world </h2><p>  In many states, there is a tendency to use distributed energy sources.  The Russian Federation has only embarked on this path, but in its most remote regions, it is precisely distributed generation that will become a point of growth in energy.  At the moment, issues are being resolved about using it in utilities to offset production costs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Researchers Findings" class="if uuid-2867085" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2867085.jpg"></div><p>  Properly applied distributed energy will open the country's energy potential and will have the most positive impact on the Russian economy.  Now, if in the world the share of small generation was 10-20%, then in Russia it took 1.5%. </p><h2>  About laws </h2><p>  For the development of this sphere, legislative norms are needed that would regulate this sphere.  The development of distributed generation in the Russian Federation is spontaneous, and this does not affect efficiency for the better.  The actions of consumers and suppliers are not coordinated. </p><p>  In order for the process to be regulated by legislation, one of two options must be implemented.  The first suggests that adjustments should be made to current legislation by creating a section on distributed generation.  And the second stipulates the creation of a new federal law so that it will reflect all the necessary terms and norms. </p><p>  It is important that the law regulates the operating modes of small thermal power plants, the nuances in their activities, and so on.  Today, about 50,000 sources of small energy are operating in the country, and their number is growing steadily.  Consumers generate demand for them, which leads to diversification in this industry.  When a law is developed that regulates the activities of mini-CHPs, a number of packages from the Government of the Russian Federation and federal authorities will also be needed.  All these documents will determine prices, stimulate the development of distributed generation. </p><h2>  About platforms </h2><p>  The transition to distributed energy is hardly monitored by the state.  There are no official statistics, and without these data, policy formation is impossible.  There is only the most general information that mini-CHP plants are underdeveloped.  Therefore, at the confederation that took place, the CEO of APBE CJSC emphasized that first of all, everyone needs to fill this industry, and only then introduce large generation facilities to ensure demand is covered.  Russian realities are distinguished by the fact that centralization in the energy sector has manifested itself in them in a much more vivid measure than in other states.  At the same time, the country has great potential in the field of large energy.  The territorial feature of the state is the real field for the application of local energy facilities.  At the moment, the country has a technological platform that has a large number of participants - 168 organizations.  In addition, new clusters appeared in this area.  There are many examples of successful distributed generation projects in Russia.  For example, these are the projects of the Altenergo enterprise, the complexes of Kuzbass, Yaroslavl and so on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="In the far north" class="if uuid-2867084" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2867084.jpg"></div><p>  As for APBE, it has formed its own scheme for a mini-CHP, which provides for the fact that large energy and utilities will be implemented in one facility.  This is a direct path to the latest prospects for increasing productivity in the energy sector.  The existing balance is filled thanks to a new way of generating electricity.  Standard boiler rooms are replaced by cogeneration units. </p><p>  Such a procedure has the most positive effect on the industry as a whole.  Firstly, fuel is saved.  Secondly, the situation related to energy is improving in the province, where boiler houses are mainly available, and there is no cogeneration.  But at the moment, the law prohibits combining network business with generation.  The abolition of this provision is necessary; an amendment is needed with respect to mini-CHP.  It is also important that legislation foster competition between large and small energy.  To do this, you need to do pricing.  It is important that sales enterprises purchase electricity from small facilities, but at a cost that does not exceed prices in the wholesale market.  It is necessary that the purchase be carried out at the wholesale price plus the network component.  All this will lead to the fact that the mechanism of serious competition between small and large energy facilities is launched.  This whole process will lead to opportunities to sell electricity to consumers at a retail price.  This will be done through surplus production.  At the moment, consumers do not have such opportunities. </p><p>  Mikhail Kozlov, Director for Innovation and RES of JSC RusHydro, said that he had the feeling that the time for using renewable energy sources in the country had not yet come.  There is only a guideline to European states in which this issue has become urgent.  He also noted that there are difficulties in official support, it is necessary to reserve capacity.  And this is possible when an adequate level of electricity production in renewable facilities is achieved. </p><p>  There is no logic in the import of necessary equipment.  It is necessary to develop the Russian technological base.  RES rates are rising due to inflation and other factors of the economy.  At the moment, in the documentation, which is being prepared in the Russian Federation, state support of tariffing is noted so that the efficiency for the investor is ensured.  This is an important moment for Russia, since in this way a strategic reserve will be formed. </p><p>  At the moment, investments have become necessary with the goal of ten to twelve years to get a reduction in the prices of renewable energy sources.  For example, RusHydro in Kamchatka has three stations - one in the remote area, and two in the central part, and they provide Petropavlovsk with thirty percent of the total electricity.  Previously, fuel oil stations provided more volume, but now they are converted to gas.  Previously, station tariffs were six rubles for industrialists and three rubles for the population.  The rest is government subsidies.  The fuel part of the stations was 2.3 rubles, and in the GeoPP - 1.8 rubles.  Tariffs provided by geothermal stations were lower than the fuel portion of neighboring standard stations.  This situation is unique, since in this region there is only imported fuel.  But, according to calculations, by 2020, taking into account the implementation of state programs, tariffs for the population should not exceed two percent.  In remote areas of the country, energy is always distributed.  There are no large-scale sources in the plans, and the development of wind energy projects, geothermal, mini-thermal power plants, solar projects.  There are a large number of plans, and there are points at which their implementation will occur without government intervention.  But, nevertheless, this will not be enough, since the generation will be about 1 GW, and this will not be enough for the development of industry in the region.  An adequate market in this case will not be formed, although it will be found about two manufacturers who, with given volumes, will be able to build factories.  For this reason, renewable energy should develop not only in remote areas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="In Yakutia" class="if uuid-2867091" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2867091.jpg"></div><p>  Mentioning the Far East, a representative of RusHydro mentioned that the company has RAO Energy Systems of the East, which is engaged in supplying electricity to the population of this site.  Sources are hybrid systems, sun and wind diesels.  Among the main projects implemented in the region, pilot capacities for solar stations - 10-30 kW, for generators - about 300 kW are noted.  In cold Yakutia, solar stations are the most effective, since the climate itself involves a large amount of sunlight.  For this reason, the examples implemented in the settlements of Yakutia demonstrate excellent results. </p><p>  Another point of view, voiced at the conference, testified to the fact that there is no exact concept of distributed generation.  There is a vast field of energy that has decentralized attributes.  In fact, it is autonomous energy.  It provides consumers with a choice - to use the product of a centralized energy supply system or distributed generation products, guided by the ideas of economy. </p><p>  Widespread development in Western countries has received another industry - individual generation.  It involves the use of completely different types of technology.  If cogeneration is used in distributed generation, then we are talking about trigeneration.  When a call is made for supporting distributed generation, a number of businessmen are wondering why they should be involved in supporting someone else‚Äôs business.  But with the development of its own technologies and the generation of added value, it turns out to be higher than given to those who took up the mini-CHP.  A major role in the development of distributed generation is played by scientific and technological progress.  Outdated equipment does not help in new records.  The development of cogeneration based on boiler houses will become effective only if the necessary equipment is available.  Gas turbine engineering of the country has the ability to produce products that will be required in this process. </p><p>  But there are other obstacles to the implementation of all these plans.  It is not known to the end what exactly cogeneration will give to the energy system, how the latter will respond to the new phenomenon.  It will require the creation of microgrids, systems that solve a number of issues related to peak power and reliability.  Such projects have already been implemented in Germany and Japan.  And while in these facilities about 40-50% of the cost of equipment is subsidized by the official authorities. </p><p>  To a large extent, the situation in Russian reality will not change until the moment when in the energy sector a bet is made on increasing the number of consumers of gas and coal.    ,    ,        .      .           ,   . </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="  " class="if uuid-2867090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2867090.jpg"></div><p>    - ,      .    2010      ,       -    ,         . </p><p> Electricity, which was generated from distributed generation sources, is put up for sale in an extremely small amount.  The thing is that in the country the development of the electric power industry is significantly hindered by the fact that it is difficult to sell electricity from alternative sources to the network.  In addition, there are dozens of enterprises in the country that produce equipment for generating energy using non-traditional methods.  But the market in this area remains narrow.  Most often, it is represented by private individuals who install the appropriate equipment in country houses.  There are also organizations that are interested in improving their green status.  Most of the demand was identified for heat pumps and solar panels. </p><p>  Sergey Chizhov, Vice President for Government Relations of Fortum OJSC, noted that the most important task of the OJSC is to implement a major investment program.  Currently, the volume of investments is more than 2.5 billion euros.  The organization continues to follow the strategic line.  She commissioned more than 600 MW of 2400, which are indicated in the plans.  The commissioning of the first capacity at Nyaganskaya GRES is expected.  The implementation of the investment program will lead to an increase in the initial capacity in terms of electricity to 5300 MW, which is 85% compared to 2007. </p><p>  On this path, the enterprise faced a number of difficulties that reduced the interest of investors in the field of electricity.  Often the inconsistency of government decisions in this industry leads to the emergence of uncertainty in the market.  It is difficult to plan the integrity of the development model of the electric power industry, not taking into account the global trend, developments related to renewable fuel facilities, including Fortum.  There are no effective mechanisms for the formation of the industry in the long term.  For example, policies aimed at increasing profitability from gas sales while lowering income from electricity sales. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Distributed generation" class="if uuid-2867087" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2867087.jpg"></div><p>  Particular attention should be paid to the fact that there is no incentive for the formation of cogeneration.  Practice has shown that investors in this area have little interest, since the market itself has a number of unattractive features.  The authorities, in conditions of unregulated realities, are equipping new boiler houses, since they see little sense in fuel economy.  And the legislation stimulates the "kotelnizatsiya" state.  For this reason, we need a mechanism that supports cogeneration.  A ban on the construction of boiler houses in the largest areas of heat consumption is needed. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Given the difficulties in investing in the construction of large power plants, the construction of distributed generation facilities seems efficient and quite real.  The time has come for the energy revolution in the country.  A lot of economic and consumer prerequisites have arisen.  If you save resources, the future of energy in Russia will be bright. </p>
