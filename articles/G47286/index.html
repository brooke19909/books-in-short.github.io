The beach season here lasts from May to October, and the water temperature averages from 21 to 25 ¬∞ C.  The banks are shallow and shallow, rains are rare.  The coastline is built up with hotels, but there are also wild places.  One of such places is the Bugaz Spit, where lovers of "wild relaxation" and kitesurfers gather. </p><div class="photo" data-original="guide.travel.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="The place where fish migrate to the sea" class="if uuid-2324972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2324972.jpg"></div><h2>  general description </h2><p>  This spit is 12 kilometers long.  A strip of land on one side is washed by the Bugaz or Kiziltash estuary, on the other hand by the waters of the Black Sea.  The width of the spit is from 250 to 300 meters and is located on the territory of the reserve under the name "Annunciation Spit." </p><p>  The Bugaz spit of the Krasnodar Territory begins from the border of Anapa <span>(the village of Blagoveshchensk)</span> and stretches to the village of Veselovka.  The coast is represented by fine quartz sand, sometimes small pebbles and shell rock are found.  The beach consists of small dunes, on which grows stunted and constantly drying grass. </p><p>  An artificial channel has been created in the middle of the spit so that the fish can freely migrate from the estuary to the sea and vice versa.  It is in this place that there are always the most fishermen. </p><p>  In addition, the scythe is an ideal place for relaxing in the wild and kayaking, sailing, because there is always a wind. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="anapacity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Blagoveshchenskaya village" class="if uuid-2324980" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2324980.jpg"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  In the old days, when the Bugaz spit became part of the Kuban river delta, Meot lived here.  It is believed that this people are related to the Sarmatians and Scythians, and their language was Iranian. </p><p>  Later the Greeks appeared on the spit and established fishing villages here, and even later - the Circassians descended from the mountains.  Once there was a road that connected Greek policies.  Over time, due to storms and constant winds, the coast ceased to be holistic. </p><p>  The Kiziltash estuary itself got its name during the Horde period, literally translated as ‚ÄúRed Stone‚Äù.  Indeed, the waters in the estuary are saturated with hydrogen sulfide, so the stones on the shore have a reddish hue.  And two centuries ago on the spit they even planned the opening of a mud bath. </p><p>  The modern Annunciation village appeared on the site of a fishing settlement in 1836.  The main inhabitants were the Kuban Cossacks, who gave this name to their village in honor of the Annunciation Day. </p><p>  In the Soviet period, a fish factory worked in the village, and in the south of the spit began to build pioneer camps and recreation centers.  And during the Second World War, fierce battles fought over the scythe when our troops tried to break through the Germans' Blue Line and get on the Taman Peninsula.  Until recently, the German bunker remained on the spit, but it has already been disassembled.  Periodically in the sand you can find cartridges and other artifacts of that period. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Bugaz spit is the shortest route from the village of Blagoveshchensk to the village of Veselovka, but you will have to travel along a dirt road for about 20 kilometers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ygra-anapa.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pension &quot;YugRa&quot;" class="if uuid-2324984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2324984.jpg"></div><h2>  Comfortable conditions for relaxation </h2><p>  This place is appreciated among travelers because it is here that you can merge with the wildlife.  However, at the beginning of the Bugaz Spit, rest can be very comfortable - this is the Kassandra boarding house, which is now called Ugra.  The recreation center has inexpensive rooms for living with all amenities.  But most importantly, the pension is located 30 meters from the sea.  On the territory there is a playground, on the beach - a slide and a trampoline.  There is also a billiard room, sauna and bar. </p><p>  50 meters from the base there is an estuary, which is famous for its healing mud. </p><p>  The base provides meals according to the "buffet" system.  Check in at 12:00, check out until 10:00.  The boarding house is located 30 kilometers from the city of Anapa, from the airport - 15 kilometers, you can take a minibus to the village of Blagoveshchenskaya. </p><p>  Approximate prices for accommodation in a boarding house: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúHigh season‚Äù (July-August), 2375 rubles per person per day with three meals a day; </li><li>  in June and September from 1800 to 2000 rubles. </li></ul><p>  It should be borne in mind that the boarding house does not have single rooms, so you will have to pay for full accommodation in a double room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="villa.kiteworld.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;KAITWORLD&quot;" class="if uuid-2324986" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2324986.jpg"></div><h2>  Eco holiday </h2><p>  Another comfortable place to relax on the Bugaz spit of the Krasnodar Territory is an eco-hotel located on the territory of the kite station and is called Villa Kaytvord.  This is a hotel on the seashore, consisting of stylized bungalows.  The interior decoration of the houses is conducive to relaxation; these are huge viewports the height of the entire wall. </p><p>  The hotel is built to all environmental standards, no harmful effects on the environment.  The electrical energy at the base comes from solar panels.  For cooking outdoors, the guests have a barbecue area.  On the territory you can play volleyball or basketball, there is a specially equipped playground. </p><p>  The hotel provides additional kite training services.  At the hotel you can rent equipment and go to school. </p><p>  Villa "Kitworld" is not the cheapest place, and bungalows can be rented at a cost of 4,500 rubles, but with three people on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã16 square meters.  10 meters from the hotel there is a restaurant for those who are not ready to go for groceries to the village or to the city. </p><h2>  Another ecohotel </h2><p>  It cannot be said that there are a lot of hotels and recreation centers on the Bugaz Spit itself.  Only the YugRa boarding house is closer to the spit, but about 6 kilometers to the place where kitesurfers gather.  Only auto campsites and another eco-hotel - Blaga beach are located further. </p><p>  For the summer season of 2018, the following accommodation rates are provided: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúHigh season‚Äù, from July 1 to August 31, from 4,500 to 6,000 rubles per room per day; </li><li>  in May and June - from 3,500 to 5,000 rubles; </li><li>  in September - from 3,000 to 5,500 rubles. </li></ul><p>  This price includes: accommodation, free use of the beach, sun loungers and parking services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.privetsochi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kitesurfing" class="if uuid-2324982" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2324982.jpg"></div><h2>  Kitesurfing </h2><p>  It is the Bugaz Spit that is the Russian Mecca for kitesurfing.  This place is attractive for athletes in that there is always a pressure wind.  Beginners can ride on the estuary, and for professionals - the other shore, where the open sea. </p><p>  For 5 months, several kite schools have been working on the spit.  And at the end of August, with the support of the Ministry of Sports, the annual BeeKiteCamp festival is held here.  The event attracts beginner kitesurfers and professionals from both Russia and other countries: from Germany, Canada and England. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aviamaniya.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea on the spit" class="if uuid-2324981" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2324981.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The easiest way to get to the sea on the Bugaz spit is by personal transport.  If you move from the city of Anapa, you should go to Simferopol highway and go along the A290 highway towards the port "Caucasus".  At the very beginning of the village of Vinogradny, you need to turn left, towards the village of Blagoveshchensk.  And some 20 minutes - and in the village.  In the village itself, you should go along Tamanskaya Street to the Pogranichny Lane, turn onto Chernomorskaya Street, this is already the beginning of the spit. </p><p>  Entrance to the spit for cars is paid and is 150 rubles per day.  At the entrance there is a parking lot and a tow truck.  If the car does not have 4 driving wheels and a high suspension, then it is better not to risk it, and not to go where there are deep sands. </p><p>  On your own, you can take the bus number 106 from Anapa.  The bus leaves from the stop at the Severny market to the final one.  To get to the spit itself, where there are wild beaches, you still have to walk about 7 kilometers or drive up by passing transport. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="45.0880556" data-lng="36.95944439999994" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/5/1/1451.png"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Reviews about the Bugaz spit are mixed.  Someone is delighted with the clean and "wild" beaches.  Someone does not like remoteness from "civilization", mosquitoes.  In any case, rest in this place is an opportunity to breathe fresh air, see dolphins (they arrive in the morning when the weather is calm) and, of course, go in for kitesurfing.  If you have a personal car (and you are planning a vacation), be sure to go on a trip to the Krasnodar Territory in the summer. </p>
