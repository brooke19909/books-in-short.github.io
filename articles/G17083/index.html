    <p>  The reviews left by our compatriots about Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 * contain a lot of useful information that can be useful to tourists who have just begun to plan their trip.  In this article we will focus on existing comments and data from advertising catalogs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 *: hotel description </h2><p>  This hotel complex belongs to the category of small city hotels, designed for guests without children, ready to spend most of the day outside the room.  Of course, if you plan to call here with a baby, they will not refuse you, but he will be bored at the hotel.  Also, the absence of a children's menu and extra beds may affect the child. </p><p>  In advertising catalogs, the description of Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 * is very scarce, so to find out more about this hotel, you need to refer to the reviews of other tourists.  They write that the hotel is a four-story building, its own territory is absent.  This distinguishes most of the hotels in Phuket.  Those that are built near the sea always face busy streets and cannot boast of shady, green areas. </p><p>  Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 * offers guests ninety rooms of various categories.  The complex itself was built recently, so it is very popular among tourists from Russia.  It is noteworthy that most vacationers have chosen this hotel for themselves, focusing on reviews and its novelty. </p><h2>  The location of the hotel complex </h2><p>  If you want to know Phuket as best as possible, Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 * will be the best option, because it is located almost in the center of tourist life.  Across the street from the hotel is Patong's most popular beach.  Here are concentrated numerous cafes, nightlife and shops with products of local craftsmen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Those who love all kinds of nightlife can visit the famous Bangla Road.  It is a four-minute walk from the hotel complex.  Almost also close to Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 * is the largest shopping center on the island. </p><p>  In their reviews, tourists more than once mention that it is very easy to get from any hotel to any point in Phuket.  This makes the rest even more fun and gives a lot of positive emotions. </p><h2>  Patong Beach </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="araya patong beach hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2025918.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Reviews of tourists about Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 * never do without a description of the beach area.  If this is your first trip to Phuket, you should know that it is almost impossible to find a private beach here.  All of them are municipal, tourists have to pay for sunbeds.  "Patong" is considered to be the center of tourist life.  People come here from other parts of the island for entertainment and good mood.  Such an abundance of tourists has its drawbacks - dirt and noise on the beach.  Many vacationers say that you can go to Patong only when you are too lazy to go to other coastal areas of Phuket. </p><p>  Most often, tourists go to Karon or Katu, because these beaches are characterized by white sand and cleanliness.  Therefore, this part of the coast is recommended for families with children of any age. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Keep in mind that at Patong it is customary to bargain when you rent sun loungers and umbrellas.  Therefore, with some persistence, you can significantly save money, especially when you go to the sea with a fun company.  On average, a deck chair costs about twenty baht.  Three or four sun loungers can be rented for fifteen baht. </p><h2>  A few words about infrastructure </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="araya patong beach hotel 4 phuket patong" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2025908.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><p>  Checkin at Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 *, keep in mind that the hotel is located on a busy street and does not have its own territory.  Therefore, do not expect that you will be entertained here either in Turkey or Egypt. </p><p>  The main attraction of the hotel complex is the pool.  It is located on the roof itself, it offers a magnificent view of the surroundings.  The most beautiful and unusual photos in Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 * are obtained in this pool.  However, many guests complain that it closes too early, at about nine o‚Äôclock in the evening.  After the specified time, getting onto the roof is simply impossible.  Hotel staff thoroughly clean the pool and the surrounding relaxation area.  It is quite crowded during the day, guests can use the sunbeds and umbrellas absolutely free of charge.  You can also get beach towels around the pool, they are issued without a deposit. </p><p>  In the building of Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 * (Phuket, Patong) there is a SPA-center.  Its staff offers massage and other wellness facilities.  Reviews about the work of beauty masters are always filled with positive. </p><p>  The staff at the reception is open 24 hours a day and speaks fairly well in English and Russian.  This facilitates understanding between guests and hotel staff.  Luggage storage and currency exchange are also available here.  Typically, guests try to leave their bags in the left luggage room rather than in the room.  After all, its size does not allow you to place in it a large number of suitcases and bags. </p><p>  Some hotel guests book excursions at reception, although there are quite a few local tour desks in the nearby streets.  The cost of tours from street vendors is low, and the quality of the services provided is no different from large travel agencies. </p><p>  On the territory of the hotel there is a shop with various souvenirs and items necessary for relaxation.  If you are not afraid to travel to foreign resorts by means of rented transport, then in Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 * (Phuket, Patong) you can rent a car or a bike for yourself.  Many tourists opt for two-wheeled transport, which allows them not to depend on distances and the schedule of tuk-tuk traffic.  Thanks to the motobike, they get the opportunity to explore almost all the attractions of Phuket. </p><h2>  Service on site </h2><p>  Many, traveling to Phuket for the first time, are worried about how good the level of service is provided by four-star hotels.  In fact, they are considered one of the best in Thailand.  Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 * is ready to offer its guests an excellent service corresponding to the stardom declared in the advertising catalogs. </p><p>  Almost all guests noted that Wi-Fi works fine in the hotel complex.  The signal catches in public areas and in rooms.  Tourists say that at any time there is the opportunity to contact their relatives and friends staying at home. </p><p>  Many travel directories indicate that there is a gym in the hotel building.  However, none of the guests found him.  Therefore, we can say that the booklets made a serious mistake. </p><p>  Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 * has its own laundry and dry cleaning.  This is especially pleasing to young guests who are happy to be distracted from all household worries during their holidays. </p><p>  If you need, the hotel complex staff will check in your room ahead of schedule.  This service is free and is very popular. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="araya patong beach hotel 4" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2025914.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Those who are not ready to independently plan their movement around the island can use the transfer from the hotel.  You can arrange delivery to the airport or to any other place in Phuket.  The cost of the transfer depends on the distance you plan to travel. </p><h2>  Rules of check-in and hotel accommodation </h2><p>  Keep in mind that you can get into the room no earlier than two in the afternoon.  If you use the early check-in service, you will be in the apartment immediately after arrival at the hotel.  Departure is carried out before noon, in the same time period it is necessary to pay all additional bills. </p><p>  Those planning to go on vacation with pets should look for another hotel complex for accommodation, since Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 * is unacceptable. </p><h2>  Accommodation in a hotel complex with children </h2><p>  We have already specified that the hotel is not intended for families with children.  But no one will refuse to book a room for a guest with a child.  Toddlers up to three years old can stay in the room for free when sharing the same bed with their parents.  With this crumbs food will not be provided. </p><p>  Children from four to twelve years of age on existing beds are free of charge, when installing an extra bed will have to pay extra at the rate of one thousand baht per night. </p><p>  Please note that the hotel does not accommodate children's beds.  There are simply no small beds in the building. </p><h2>  Dining on site </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="araya patong beach hotel 4 description" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2025922.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  For those who are used to the variety of dishes in Turkish hotels, Thailand may not seem too hospitable.  After all, here you can rarely find the all-inclusive concept of food.  Even if it is, it differs significantly from similar services in Egypt and Turkey. </p><p>  Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 * does not work on an all-inclusive basis.  Guests can only take breakfast, half board or full board.  However, most tourists, nevertheless, are inclined to the first option and book rooms, which include breakfast.  They are served in accordance with the concept of the buffet, so vacationers often praise the restaurant chefs for the variety and taste of the dishes.  Absolutely no one goes hungry with breakfast. </p><p>  But guests staying at full board are not particularly happy with the food.  In reviews of Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 * they write about the uniformity of dishes on the menu, from which it is quite difficult to choose something worthwhile and really tasty, unlike breakfasts.  Tourists are advised to have lunch and dinner at a cafe adjacent to the hotel.  There are a lot of them around and all of them offer delicious and inexpensive dishes of local and European cuisine. </p><h2>  A brief description of the number of rooms </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="araya patong beach hotel 4 hotel description" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2025910.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Hotel rooms receive different ratings from guests.  But most of the tourists were satisfied with their settlement.  All guests acknowledge that the rooms are a bit small.  However, they have everything you need, including spacious cabinets where you can put your things. </p><p>  The apartments do not have enough balconies, but many guests write in the comments that they were not too upset by their absence.  This complicates the drying of things a little, but after a request, a compact dryer can be brought to the room, which will solve the problem. </p><p>  Room equipment itself is not satisfactory.  It has air conditioning, a TV and a telephone.  The bathroom comes with towels, a hairdryer and toiletries.  Their guests are often written in reviews by female guests.  Many people mention that cosmetics in Thailand are of very high quality, so ladies use it with great pleasure. </p><p>  During cleaning, maids regularly change bed linen, towels, replenish tea sets and cosmetics.  It is nice that the tea set includes not only black, but also green, as well as herbal teas.  Additionally, the maids put a few bags of coffee. </p><h2>  Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 *: hotel reviews </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="araya patong beach hotel 4 pics" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2025912.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  If you are used to choosing a hotel complex for yourself, focusing on reviews, then this hotel will definitely appeal to you.  It is difficult to find negative comments about him on the Internet.  However, after analyzing some of the administration‚Äôs shortcomings, we were nevertheless able to single out from the general mass of rave reviews: </p><ul><li><p>  small area of ‚Äã‚Äãrooms; </p></li><li>  the proximity of a busy street often prevents guests from falling asleep; </li><li>  service that does not reach four stars; </li><li>  frequent denials of simple requests. </li></ul><p>  The pluses of Araya Patong Beach Hotel 4 * include the following points: </p><ul><li>  excellent food; </li><li>  good design and equipment of rooms; </li><li>  great location; </li><li>  high-quality cleaning of apartments; </li><li>  lack of deposit upon check-in; </li><li>  beautiful pool; </li><li>  the cost of the tour to the hotel. </li></ul><p>  I want to dwell on the last point in more detail.  Holidays in Thailand are considered expensive compared to trips to Turkey and not everyone can afford it.  However, you can come to this hotel without spending all your savings.  Just now the tourist season in this country begins, so the interest in trips has noticeably increased.  If you are planning on traveling in October, be prepared to pay a little over eighty thousand rubles for eight nights.  The price includes flight, accommodation and breakfast for two people. </p><p>  In general, you can safely recommend this hotel complex to those tourists who plan to relax without children under the age of twelve.  An older child in the hotel will be quite comfortable and convenient. </p>
