  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a tablet for drawing</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the modern world, so much has been invented to realize the creative possibilities of man that the creators of the past can only envy.  This is 3d drawing, and work in Photoshop, and vector programs for designers.  However, such a variety of choices also implies difficulties in choosing the right things.  But since progress does not stand still, it is simply necessary to introduce technical innovations into your work or leisure. <br>  Those who like to draw, probably know what a tablet for drawing.  And since many have long moved drawing to the computer field, the regular drawing tablet has become electronic. <br>  So, a graphic tablet is a kind of device that allows you to enter hand-drawn images into a computer.  It consists of a tablet with a flat sensitive surface and a pen.  This device allows you to very accurately reproduce drawing by hand.  If you look at the screen during the drawing process, you can see that the cursor moves on the computer screen after the pen, which the person moves on the tablet.  There are also tablets, to which, in addition to the pen, a special mouse is attached, which works similarly to the pen. <br>  A tablet for drawing will be an indispensable help for you if you like to draw, photograph or do vector graphics.  It will help to reproduce in electronic form those images that were previously available only when drawing by hand.  For a design firm, this will also open up new perspectives: hand-drawn fonts and logos are rare and unique.  In addition, the tablets have a set of tools that allow you to make brighter and more unusual images. <br>  <strong>Choosing a tablet model for drawing</strong> <br>  We assume that you have definitely decided that you just need a tablet for drawing.  It remains now to determine the model. <br>  When developing tablets, the latest achievements of science and technology are used, and every year more and more advanced models appear. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When choosing a tablet, you need to focus on the model that is most suitable for you, not only in terms of functionality, but also in size. </p><p>  <strong>Tablets are divided into three types:</strong> <br>  1.Models designed for drawing.  They have a format from A6 to A4 and a lot of necessary functions and tools for translating a freehand drawing into a graphic view.  Equipped with a pen, and sometimes a mouse. <br>  2. Models, which are a kind of hybrid tablet and monitor that realize the dream of drawing directly on the computer screen.  This type of tablet has appeared relatively recently and is considered the most advanced. <br>  3. Small tablets with limited functionality, which are considered more office equipment than a gadget for drawing.  Their functions will not allow the artist to realize their plans, however, such tablets are more often used for signing documents in electronic form.  This includes the electronic notebook - an A4 folder in which you can make notes as in a regular notebook, and then transfer them to a computer. </p><p>  When buying a tablet for drawing, you need to pay attention to the main characteristics: </p><p>  1. The size (both the entire tablet and the working surface itself) is important when you decide whether the tablet will stand on the table or if you are going to move with it.  The working area should be related to the working area of ‚Äã‚Äãyour monitor so as not to lose space. </p><p>  2. The resolution of a professional tablet should be 5080 dpi, and 2040 is enough for amateur drawing. </p><p>  3. The accuracy and sensitivity of the pen are important for the naturalness of the drawing.  Modern tablets "understand" 2048 levels of pen pressure, which allows you to transfer the entirety of a manual drawing. </p><p>  4. The accuracy of the mouse (if any). </p><p>  5. The angle of inclination is an indicator of how the pen can be at the angle to the tablet. </p><p>  6. The working height of the pen is the height at which the pen can be above the tablet without touching it. </p><p>  A tablet is a true gift for art lovers.  Any action, whether it be a phased drawing of a landscape or an animal, a portrait or a still life, will become more interesting, and most importantly, it will be possible to post the fruits of their labors on the Internet! </p><p>  As for the manufacturing companies, it is perhaps worth paying attention to Wacom, but by price it is not available to everyone.  If you want a quality tablet, then you can try those that are released by Genius or Aiptek.  They are about the same in quality, have a number of drawbacks, but given that they are cheaper than Wacom, you can get used to these drawbacks. </p>
