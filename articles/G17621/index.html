The reason is that any building is very, very expensive.  Take a look at offers for the sale of real estate - few people can afford house prices.  Therefore, many do not even think about the possibility of solving the housing problem in this way. </p><p>  However, today there are many modern technologies and building materials, the use of which can dispel such pessimism.  Increasingly, we are able to make sure that a house built with our own hands is quite capable of being reliable, aesthetic and, most importantly, inexpensive! </p>

    <h2>  Cheapest homes - what are they? </h2><p>  Let's try to understand what common features are inherent in budget new buildings.  Are there cheap homes in principle?  Nobody canceled prices for materials and services of contractors.  But if you correctly observe certain conditions, construction costs can be reduced by almost a third. </p><p>  So, the signs of cheap housing.  First of all, these are houses (cottages) that are optimally planned.  They can be not only modern, but also functional, thoughtful, compact.  The usable area should occupy the largest possible share (ideally up to 90 - 95%).  Having successfully planned the house, we will achieve at least 20% cost savings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another "trick" is the use of modern economical building materials and the conduct of the construction process with new high-tech methods.  This will give us savings of about 40% of our budget. </p><h2>  Country house cheap </h2><p>  Both external and internal design of the house should be as functional as possible, simple, not containing any frills.  This will actually save another 10% of the budget.  The roof should be either gable or five-gable.  There should be only one floor.  Luxury cottages with balconies and columns are not our option.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe home should initially be small with the possibility of transformation, that is, the addition of additional premises in the future. </p>

    <p>  We do not need a basement.  The foundation should not be deepened very much.  If the geological and climatic conditions allow, it is better to make it easier.  Finishing both internal and external, you should choose as simple as possible.  For the facade, the option of cement-lime plaster is quite suitable.  Believe me, and with her the house can look just fine. </p><p>  The presence of numerous windows (especially of irregular shape), a multi-pitched roof with a complicated relief, several floors, a large number of partitions, and an abundance of decorative external elements makes the construction estimate much more difficult.  All this eats up a huge amount of money.  Avoiding unnecessary expenses, while maintaining the basic functionality, is quite realistic.  In addition, a country house built concisely without an abundance of "bells and whistles" looks elegant and stylish. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Themselves with a mustache! </h2><p>  Another serious saving item is the use of one's own labor.  Theoretically, you can build a private house yourself.  About 90% of all construction work can be done by almost anyone with their own hands.  Hiring people from the outside makes sense only for complex types of work, which independently do not allow the skill level.  Or for those that are basically impossible for a layman. </p><p>  A prerequisite for keeping the budget ‚Äúwithin the framework‚Äù is strict and constant control over the quality of the work carried out (if we are talking about a hired team).  Check and track necessarily need and prices for purchased materials, and the process of their acquisition.  The matter, again, is that the involved workers will deal with the delivery. </p><p>  The expense of attracting a specialist engineer will fully justify itself, which will help to adapt the standard project you have chosen to suit specific wishes, taking into account climatic conditions.  In any "typical" you can make budget-friendly changes.  For example, replace part of the building materials with cheaper analogues.  The project itself is quite realistic to finalize for specific requirements.  In this sense, a private home is an uncultivated field for creativity. </p>

    <h2>  What else can we save? </h2><p>  It is possible to optimize, in addition, the engineering equipment system incorporated in the project, which will give further savings during operation on maintenance and heating.  The cheapest houses cost well with domestic equipment, which in a number of parameters is not inferior to imported equipment.  Plumbing and other items should also be chosen as simple as possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When buying building materials, it should be remembered that the purchase of a large batch involves a good discount.  But still, before heading to the market or to the store, it is best to carefully study prices taking into account seasonal fluctuations, the range of available products (both imported and domestic), get acquainted with reviews, find out about current promotions and in As a result, choose the option that is optimal in terms of price and quality. </p><p>  With any choice, if you are too carried away by the saving process, you risk acquiring low-quality materials.  Even the cheapest houses should look aesthetically pleasing and have a margin of safety.  Do not forget that housing is being built several decades in advance.  Therefore, the "components" should be bought as sound as possible, as far as your wallet allows.  Otherwise, the ‚Äúshining" need for additional costs for remaking the marriage and quick repairs. </p><p>  The best option is to use seasonal discounts.  In winter, due to falling demand for building materials, prices can be significantly reduced.  Save, in addition, you can self-purchased purchased to the construction site. </p>

    <h2>  Human factor </h2><p>  If you absolutely can not or do not want to do the job yourself, you will have to "bow to" the specialists.  It‚Äôs best to invite a team immediately.  Her choice should be approached as seriously as possible.  Do not be too lazy to ask all the applicants in detail, to communicate with those who hired them shortly before you, to study the reviews.  This will subsequently save you not only a decent amount of money, but also time and invaluable nerves. </p><p>  Attracting specialists, it is imperative to conclude a written contract with them.  It should be compiled in the most detailed manner, indicating the smallest nuances: the timing of the work, their volume and quality, full cost.  The contract must be written down such moments as the type and size of the penalty for violation of its terms and conditions, as well as all other obligations of both parties.  This includes a clause on providing workers with accommodation, tools, household amenities and, if necessary, food. </p><p>  For failure to comply with the stated conditions, a fine must be agreed.  If the contract was violated by the brigade, it is best to terminate the contract and hire other people or complete everything yourself.  Remaking low-quality work will be much more expensive. </p><h2>  What is your home worth? </h2><p>  How to save on foundation?  If the project is small (with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãless than 40 square meters or it is a country house), it can be made pile.  This is the most economical, although not the most reliable option.  Larger housing with heavy load-bearing structures will require a strip foundation.  It is the most durable, but it is also the most expensive. </p>

    <p>  The way out may be an intermediate option with a combination of one and the other, which may turn out to be a reasonable compromise while retaining all the advantages.  We repeat: as at any stage of construction, carrying out the maximum possible number of works by yourself when building the foundation can save a lot of money.  On our own, it‚Äôs quite possible to dig a pit or trench, mount the formwork or dig holes under the piles. </p><p>  <span>The calculation of the foundation</span> must be performed especially carefully.  The width of its tape or the number of piles should be sufficient to reliably support the entire structure.  At the same time, it should not be unnecessarily weighted - again, in order to save. </p><h2>  Look above </h2><p>  Let's move on to the walls.  How can you save on a box at home?  This is easier to achieve by taking cheap building materials - timber, logs, foam blocks.  One of the budget options is prefabricated houses.  Numerous supplier companies urge us to purchase and assemble a frame house on our site cheaply and without much hassle.  Such prefabricated buildings (Canadian type) have recently gained immense popularity due to the combination of price and the possibility of quick assembly. </p><p>  This option is not the most durable in our climatic conditions.  But with careful assembly, such a house can last a number of decades.  Since the <span>climate of Canada</span> resembles that of Russia, inexpensive prefabricated houses made using the local technology do not require special refinement.  It is only important to pay attention to the <span>thermal conductivity of the material by</span> which the walls will be formed.  In general, the frame house will cost you cheaply and can be an excellent outlet for those who are not inclined to "long-term construction." </p><p>  When purchasing material for a roof, pay attention to bituminous tiles, corrugated steel or metal tiles.  Of course, you can choose any material, carefully studying and comparing all the advantages and disadvantages.  It is clear that the <span>country house is</span> being built taking into account the requirements are not as stringent as in the case of housing for permanent residence. </p>

    <h2>  And what can not be saved? </h2><p>  First of all, do not try to do this due to the quality of the materials purchased.  After all, it directly depends on how your home turns out.  It will also not come out to ‚Äúfool around‚Äù on paperwork (documenting and obtaining <span>a building permit).</span>  This procedure, unfortunately, will require a lot of personal time and certain costs. </p><p>  All design should be undertaken before you start building anything.  Otherwise, at the end of the work, you will have no less painful procedure to legitimize your squatter.  In addition, correctly and timely executed documents are the key to the installation and connection of utilities in the optimal time. </p><h2>  Reliability is paramount </h2><p>  It will also fail to save on pouring a quality foundation.  This is the case when the quality factor and reliability is fundamentally more important than any economy.  The roof frame is also not the most suitable article for saving.  Best and most reliable if it is made of wooden beams. </p>

    <p>  Materials for engineering communications should initially be selected high-quality and modern (plastic pipes, reliable electrical cables) and not save on their professional connection.  Necessarily require technical supervision during the implementation of the project.  It should be carried out by a visiting engineer, in extreme cases, by an experienced familiar builder.  Even the cheapest homes require such supervision.  It is especially necessary in case of independent performance of work or disagreements with the hired team.  With an experienced look, a specialist will be able to instantly identify shortcomings and resolve relations with contractors. </p><p>  Thus, to build a cheap house is quite possible, and how quickly you do it is up to you. </p>
