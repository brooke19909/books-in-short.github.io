    <h2>  Icmeler.  Features </h2><p>  Many tourists, having decided to go on vacation to Turkey, are torn between noisy resorts with vibrant evening life and quiet secluded places with beautiful nature.  What to choose?  Of course, Icmeler!  This village surrounded by greenery at the foot of the mountains is located just eight kilometers from the big city of Marmaris.  To get to the famous Bar Street, you need to take a shuttle bus for about ten minutes.  And in Icmeler itself, nature resembles Eden: pine trees, lush Mediterranean vegetation and, of course, the gentle Mediterranean Sea.  In a few kilometers, waves of another water area are rolling ashore. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Swim in one day in the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas and feel the difference between them - isn't that a miracle?  Therefore, Icmeler, which some reviews call the Marmaris region, and others a separate town, is considered a prestigious holiday destination.  There are mainly hotels with five stars.  And Mirage World Hotel 5 * is one of them.  You can walk to Marmaris on the beautiful promenade.  The whole journey will take about an hour.  Or take the city shuttle in ten minutes.  Barov Street, where young people from all over Marmaris flock in the evenings, is located near the Old Fortress.  <span>Dalaman Airport is</span> 110 kilometers from the hotel.  The general transfer to the hotel will take more than two hours, because first tourists will be transported, vacationing in Marmaris itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mirage World Hotel 5 Marmaris" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2079873.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  All resort life in quiet Icmeler is concentrated on the promenade.  There is the lion's share of restaurants and bars.  Therefore, many vacationers so highly appreciated the location of the Mirage World Hotel 5 * hotel.  It is on the second line.  On the one hand, no unwanted noises from outside enter the hotel grounds.  On the other hand, it takes about 3-5 minutes to go to the sea.  The beaches in Icmeler are all municipal, the beds and umbrellas on them are paid.  Therefore, the first or second line - there is no fundamental difference.  And "sea view" opens from the upper floors of the hotel we are describing.  The Mirage World Hotel is surrounded by small shops selling fruit or excellent Turkish textiles.  Nearby there is a bus stop dolmushe - minibuses with which you can get to the center of Marmaris.  Also within walking distance there are several tour agencies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  The Mirage World Hotel 5 * hotel (Marmaris) was built in 2001.  The last time he was renovated in 2014.  Reviews note a fresh whitewashing of the facades and new furniture with appliances in the rooms.  Tourists also give top marks to landscape designers and the efforts of gardeners.  Everywhere, wherever you look, flowering oleander bushes can be seen on the emerald lawns, coconut palms and banana trees languidly swinging leaves under the breeze.  The Mirage World Hotel has a vast territory of 7800 square meters.  There are four 4-story buildings, built so that the sea can be seen from the maximum number of windows.  All these buildings have elevators.  When choosing a room, tourists are advised to ask for building A. Building C is considered the worst, since some of the rooms have a view of the wall and back yard of the hotel.  Between the buildings are swimming pools.  A little far away are other hotel buildings - a snack bar, a playground.  The hotel is not too far from the beach.  The distance separating it from the sea is only eighty meters.  It takes about three minutes to reach him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mirage World Hotel 5 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2079871.jpg"></div>

There are two balconies adjacent to the family room.  Both living rooms have air conditioning.  The highest category of rooms at Mirage World Hotel are suites.  These rooms are designed for 4-5 guests.  Choosing this category for relaxation, reviews recommend taking a corner suite.  These corner rooms are more spacious and bright.

    <h2>  What's in the rooms </h2><p>  The equipment of rooms in the Mirage World Hotel 5 * hotel is fully consistent with its five-star status.  Southern heat reliably leaves a split-system of a new generation behind the windows.  But if you want to open a balcony, then at your service will be a table and two soft chairs.  The flooring in the rooms is tiled, which makes it very pleasant to walk barefoot in hot weather.  But if you drive at the beginning or end of the season, bring slippers with you!  In the bedroom, guests will find a minibar with replenished drinking water, a TV with satellite channels (among them there are Russian ones).  The bathroom comes with a shower and hairdryer.  Toiletries and cosmetics are replenished daily.  Paid services include the use of a safe, as well as filling the minibar (excluding drinking water).  Maids clean the rooms every day.  According to reviews, in good conscience.  They sweep and wash the floors, clean the bed, change towels.  Clean linen is laid every other day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mirage World Hotel 5 meals" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2079874.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Mirage World Hotel 5 *: food </h2><p>  Is it worth it to paint the Turkish all inclusive system?  Anyone who has ever visited an all-inclusive hotel on the Anatolian coast earned a lifelong nostalgia for these endlessly lasting feasts.  The hotel we are describing is by no means an exception.  From seven to ten in the main restaurant breakfast.  Who overslept or who thought it was not enough, can eat up to 11:00 in a tent by the pool.  Another hour - and guests are invited to dinner.  Then tea or coffee with sweets.  A little more time, and a very plentiful dinner awaits the guests.  Anyone who has a bad habit of eating up before bedtime can satisfy her - from midnight to an hour, a snack is provided in the restaurant.  And between all these meals, a variety of drinks are served in the hotel bars and snacks are served.  Imported alcohol, ice cream and fresh juices are paid.
