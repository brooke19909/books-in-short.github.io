Of course, a huge number of hotels were built on its territory.  And one of the rather prestigious, and at the same time inexpensive, is considered White Rock Castle 4 *. </p><p>  According to reviews, this is a really good place.  Nevertheless, an experienced <span>traveler, while</span> planning a vacation, tries to get as much useful information as possible about the chosen place.  What does the hotel look like and what amenities in the rooms should you expect?  Do you have bathrobes, towels and other amenities?  Are there any catering facilities in the hotel?  Is it suitable for family holidays? </p><h2>  Features of the location of the hotel complex </h2>

    <p>  Of course, the location is a powerful argument when choosing a hotel.  The modern hotel complex White Rock Castle 4 * is located almost in the center of the town of Balchik.  From here it is a stone's throw to cafes, shops and entertainment centers.  By the way, just a five-minute walk is the Botanical Garden with a huge collection of flora representatives - both children and parents have a good time here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth saying right away that the hotel is located some distance from the beach, or rather, 1000 meters.  Tourists love to take walks to the sea, but if this is not for you, you can always use the shuttle service or public transport, which runs here regularly.  By the way, the nearest international airport is located in the city of Varna - the distance to it is about 47 km. </p><h2>  White Rock Castle Hotel 4 * <span>(Bulgaria, Balchik):</span> what does the territory look like? </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth saying that the hotel was built recently - for the first time tourists began to receive here in 2013.  The hotel is a large, six-story building, built in a modern style.  Own territory is available, although not too large.  Nevertheless, there is a swimming pool, relaxation terraces and even a small flowering garden. </p><p>  The interior decoration of the building is also modern, even luxurious - marble floors, large halls for relaxing and waiting, upholstered furniture, in a word, everything you need for comfort.  The hotel has a system of elevators, so do not worry about moving between floors.  Everything here is really very well thought out. </p><h2>  Description and photos of living rooms </h2>
