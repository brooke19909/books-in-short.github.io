  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Japanese management: features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The study of Japanese management is a whole branch of the Western economy.  This interest is caused by the fact that the employees and workers of this country, receiving approximately the same salary, work with full dedication and intensity, as well as a longer working day than in other countries. </p><p>  Therefore, Japanese management is recognized as the most effective worldwide.  The main reason for its success is recognized as the ability to correctly use the human factor.  Consider in more detail the basic features. </p><p>  Features of Japanese management are as follows. </p><p>  First, the organization must have a confidential atmosphere and a guarantee of employment.  The latter is confirmed by the unique lifetime employment system used in the country.  This distinguishes Japanese management from European. </p><p>  It is the feeling of stability that can strengthen the sense of community in the team, harmonizing the relations of employees and management.  Workers who are relieved of the threat of remaining unemployed are given opportunities to move up the career ladder. </p><p>  Secondly, publicity is present in any corporation and its values ​​are voiced.  Workers and managers use a single database of the main policies and activities of the company.  Due to this, there is a development of an atmosphere of participation of each and a common responsibility for its functioning.  The result is increased employee engagement and productivity. </p><p>  Japanese management implies a corporate value base.  This is about: </p><ul><li>  the priority of quality service and services; </li><li>  cooperation of employees with the administration, as well as departments among themselves. </li></ul><p>  This system encourages the desire to instill and stimulate a system of corporate values ​​at all levels. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thirdly, the <span>Japanese model</span> of personnel management is based on information.  Particular importance in organizations is given to the collection of various data, as well as their use in order to increase the economic <span>efficiency of production</span> and the qualitative characteristics of products. </p><p>  Managers monthly check the income, volume and quality of production, <span>gross revenue.</span>  This is necessary in order to make sure that the numbers have reached a given indicator, as well as to "calculate" difficulties at an early stage of their occurrence. </p><p>  Fourth, management should be focused on quality and constant control over it.  The personal pride and professionalism of any leader lies in this matter. </p><p>  Fifth, managers are always in production.  It is not even about the fact that management is always present on the territory of the enterprise, but that management personnel are located directly in the shops.  Thanks to this, you can quickly solve all the difficulties as they arise.  Most often, based on the data, innovations are introduced, for the effectiveness of which not only the leader, but also all employees are encouraged. </p><p>  Sixth, Japanese management relies on maintaining order and cleanliness in production.  Managers establish a special organization that can become a guarantee of quality and will increase productivity. </p><p>  Japanese governance places emphasis on improving human relations.  It is about coherence, group orientation, moral qualities of employees, stable employment and <span>harmonization of relations</span> between employees and managers. </p><p>  Therefore, the success of Japanese management lies not in the mystical qualities of a national character, but in the implementation of a special management system, thought out to the smallest detail, perfectly organized, adaptive and flexible. </p>
