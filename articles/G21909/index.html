The ancient people, who once came to this land, said that the first founded city was destined to become a collection area, the second - a city, the third - a capital.  During the kingdom of Shu, Chengdu, Sindu and Gaundu (now Shuangliu), which were collectively called the "Three Du", were popular.  Subsequently, only Chengdu rose, and the other two became its constituent parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chengdu places of interest" class="if uuid-2544038" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2544038.jpg"></div><p>  Chengdu (China) in different years was the capital of the kingdom of Shu, Shu-Han, the state of Cheng, Western Shu, Early Shu, Late Shu, Li Shu (rebel).  All this time, the village was famous for the production of brocade.  After the Great Peasant War, the war of the three princes and the Manchu conquest, the city was practically depopulated.  New residents moved from the provinces of Hubei, Cantonese, Hunan and others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1952, Chengdu became a city of provincial subordination. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.adp-i.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chengdu Airport" class="if uuid-2544034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2544034.jpg"></div><p>  The city of Chengdu (China) is located in the southwestern part of the country, is the administrative center of Sichuan.

The fare is 1.5-2 dollars (approximately 100-150 rubles).  A high-speed train runs that will allow you to quickly get to the city.

This is one of the oldest cities in the world, which for about a thousand years has been the capital of the powerful kingdom of Shu, a large industrial and production center.  Fans of excursions can see ancient temples and visit interesting museums.  Chengdu, as noted above, is also famous for its unique natural attractions, among which the Chinese Natural Reserve is especially notable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.destination360.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chengdu sights" class="if uuid-2544020" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2544020.jpg"></div><h2>  Ancient Jinli Street </h2><p>  Many tourist groups begin to explore the sights of Chengdu from Tianfu Square with many landscape decorations.  Nearby is one of the most populous streets of the city.  The Jinli story began before our era.  Historical documents mention this place in the third century BC.  Trade was actively going on here, it was possible to purchase the best decorative fabric in the city.  Walking along this street, you can get acquainted with ancient customs and culture.  On the ancient theatrical stages, performances are organized, and local craftsmen are happy to show everyone who wants samples of their unique work, various costumed shows are held on the street, scenes are staged, and traditional Chinese holidays are celebrated. </p><h2>  Boulder Nature Reserve </h2><p>  The Chengdu reserve is home to more than four thousand species, but this place has gained popularity among tourists due to the maintenance and development of large pandas - an unofficial symbol of China and the most popular character among local people.  The reserve area is two hundred thousand hectares.  To care for such a vast territory, more than a thousand Chinese families live and work here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drinkteatravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chengdu Nature Reserve" class="if uuid-2544023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2544023.jpg"></div><h2>  Research Center </h2><p>  Probably the main attraction of Chengdu (China) is a research center for the study of pandas.  In the northern suburbs you can watch leisurely panda bears.  Good conditions have been created for them: spacious enclosures, rooms for sleeping, feeding and treatment.  The grown bears are released.  The best time to visit the center is from 8:30 to 10:00 in the morning, when animals are fed.  Many tourists confirm this.  At other times, there is a high probability of catching pandas at their favorite thing - sleep. </p><h2>  Big buddha </h2><p>  Chengdu's architectural landmark is the Buddha statue carved into the rock.  Big Buddha is located in the mountains of Lingyushan.  The height of the monument is seventy-one meters, only the index finger of the Buddha is eight meters long, and the nose is five and a half meters.  The construction of the statue began in about 713, the work lasted almost a century.  Nearby are grave caves, which are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, and the Park of a Thousand Buddha. All paths of the most beautiful park lead to the main monument. </p><h2>  Chengdu Museum </h2><p>  An interesting place is the city museum, which was created to preserve and popularize the local cultural heritage.  The construction of the building began in 1992, and the opening took place in 1997.  Four expositions are presented: the main characteristics of ancient culture, the art and technical achievements of the Shu culture, the craft of ancient people who lived in these territories, architecture, the spiritual world.  In 2004, a new hall was opened, in which the attention of tourists presented products from bronze, jade, ceramics and gold jewelry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chengdu Museum" class="if uuid-2544025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2544025.jpg"></div><h2>  Wan Nian Monastery </h2><p>  The monastery was built during the Jin Dynasty, that is, approximately in the third or fourth century AD.  This is the oldest building in the area.  Pusian, one of the preachers of Buddhism, is considered the patron saint of the temple.  Inside is a bronze statue.  The age of the bronze Pusian exceeds a thousand years.  The statue has reached us in its original form (even despite several fires).  According to legend, it was in this place that the <span>Buddha Shakyamuni</span> received enlightenment.  His spirit remained here to help all believers. </p><h2>  Summer Residence and Museum </h2><p>  What to see in Chengdu?  The Bishushanzhuang park can conditionally be divided into two often: the park and the imperial palace.  The residence is located in the southern part of the park, its main purpose was to provide conditions for conducting public affairs and comfortable living of the emperor's family.  The park part is a real paradise with numerous pavilions connected by bridges, a picturesque lake and even small mountains.
