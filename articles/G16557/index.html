It is located on the east coast, between the island of Djerba and Hammamet.  Mahdia gained fame for its sparsely populated beaches covered with clean white sand.  This resort is most suitable for lovers of a secluded relaxing holiday, as well as for spending quiet leisure time with family.  Mahdia cannot boast of a particularly developed tourist infrastructure; there are almost no hotels directly in the city limits.  The tourist area here is distinguished by the fact that almost all hotels, with the exception of the central one, are located outside the city, on the first coastline. </p>

Many argue that no one will be bored at the hotel: the animators are entertaining both children and adults.  For kids, even mini-discos are held.  In addition to animation, adults are also offered many other interesting events: sports, discos, theme parties.  Some guests, on the contrary, call the animation one of the minuses of the hotel and claim that in the evening there is absolutely nowhere to go.  In their opinion, the local amusements are boring, and the music coming from evening and afternoon performances only disturbs peace and interferes with relaxation.

The beach is also described as "very good", with clean white sand, shells.  True, the loungers here are almost all broken, to occupy the lounger, you have to wake up at five in the morning.  Hotel guests note the presence of garbage on the beach, but the responsibility lies with tourists leaving empty glasses, bottles, etc. The bar starts operating at ten in the morning, and a rich assortment of food and drinks is offered.  At night, the beach closes. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  The conditions for the youngest guests are represented by the opportunity to resort to the services of animators, nannies.

Many people call the local cuisine excellent, serving a huge variety of dishes: guests are offered a wide selection of fish (tuna, mackerel), meat (turkey, lamb), side dishes, salads, pastries, fruits.  Guests can try watermelon with melon, peaches and grapes, ice cream, however, very rarely - twice a week.

Many guests call the living quarters ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, all the equipment in them, according to reviews, serves properly.  This does not apply to air conditioners: often guests say that ‚Äúkondeas‚Äù practically do not work here.  The stuffiness is brightened up by a light night breeze from the sea, because vacationers have to sleep with an open balcony. </p><p>  Other guests rate the hotel rooms as "not so good."  According to reviews, hotel rooms are not always cleaned before check-in.  the plumbing in them is often dirty, although they clean and change clothes every day.  The rooms are cleaned well if you leave a tip (1-2 dinars), otherwise the maid may not wash the floors.  Wi-fi in the rooms is called terrible, very slow, about four days a week may not work at all. </p><p>  Water (drinking) in the rooms is issued by coupons, which can be received at the reception in unlimited quantities.  For water (sparkling and without gas), you should contact the Hannibal bar. </p><p>  The authors of the reviews recommend choosing rooms on the second or third floor, here they are "more tolerable" in comparison with others.  On the ‚Äúminus first‚Äù and ‚Äúzero‚Äù numbers, according to reviews, are very old. </p><h2>  What languages ‚Äã‚Äãdoes the staff speak? </h2><ul><li>  Russian. </li><li>  French. </li><li>  English. </li><li>  Deutsch. </li><li>  Czech. </li><li>  Arab. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel club thapsus aqua 4 tunisia mahdia reviews" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/2012942.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Other useful information </h2><p>  Check-in: from 14:00 to 00:00.

It is said that the arriving guides quite quickly distribute the guests to the buses.  The journey from Monastir to the hotel takes about an hour and a half.  Upon arrival, tourists immediately put on bracelets. </p><p>  The hotel has a lot of greenery, quiet, comfortable.  The territory of the guests is called clean, well-groomed.  For guests with disabilities, there are special ramps and separate toilets.  There are shops nearby.  You can take a taxi to the eastern bazaar. </p><p>  Advantages of the hotel include acceptable service, wonderful sea, wonderful beach, convenient location, tasty and varied food. </p><h2>  What do not like? </h2><p>  Many guests are unpleasant to recall their first acquaintance with the hotel.  This is due to the fact that during resettlement is not without problems of various kinds. </p><p>  Guests call the hotel so crowded that staff are unable to cope with their duties.  Settlement after the flight can last for three to four or even more hours, both at night and during the day.  According to some reviews, the staff allows themselves to frankly extort money from the visitors for resettlement.  Those who pay immediately get the keys.  Not without swearing and tears.  According to the guests, there is a complete mess with the number of rooms in the hotel.  They can settle in a basement without an air conditioner, which does not correspond to the category of paid accommodation, and then for a long time do not agree to change the room, although available premises, according to reliable information, are available.  Vacationers are nervous and spend precious time changing rooms. </p><p>  Minuses are also called a weak air conditioning system, old repairs in the hotel, broken sunbeds, poor cleaning of the rooms, dirt in the hotel, stuffiness in the dining room and in the lobby, bad Wi-Fi. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel club thapsus aqua 4" class="if" height="205" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/2012940.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The opinions of the guests agree on one thing: everyone unanimously believes that the most delightful and wonderful during their vacation is the gentle and warm emerald sea.  But in order to enjoy it in its entirety, as many believe, it is better to choose another hotel.  Holidays in "Tafus" recommend the most unpretentious and picky tourists. </p>
