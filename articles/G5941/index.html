    <p>  This will help the vehicle owner to save his nerves and money in case of an emergency, causing harm to someone else or his car.  How much does car insurance cost?  It depends on many factors, and first of all on which insurance policy you purchase: <span>compulsory motor liability insurance or hull insurance.</span>  Also, the driver‚Äôs experience, and trouble-free behavior, and age and other things, also affect the cost of the policy.  Where to get car insurance?  Of course, in the insurance company, visiting her personally or by inviting an insurance agent to your home.  However, you should not be limited only to superficial information, you need to find out in more detail. </p><h2>  Why do I need an insurance policy? </h2><p>  Car insurance is necessary in order to partially or fully compensate the cash expenses of the vehicle owner in the event of an emergency on the road.  If the owner of the car that caused the accident didn‚Äôt have the OSAGO policy, he will have to pay the cost of the repair out of his own pocket.  And there are isolated cases when repair costs as much as car insurance costs.  And who will pay for the repair of your own car depends on whether you have issued a CASCO policy at the insurance company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  It is worth explaining what OSAGO and CASCO are, and how they differ from each other. </p><h2>  CTP and CASCO </h2><p>  So, OSAGO is <span>compulsory motor third party liability insurance.</span>  Insurance conditions imply payment to the driver through the fault of the insured in a traffic accident to the driver.  At the same time, in 2015, the maximum payment for car repairs is 400 thousand rubles, and the maximum payment aimed at redressing damage to human health is 500 thousand rubles.  In this case, the repair of your own car is carried out at the expense of personal funds.  To have an insurance policy is a mandatory requirement, the failure of which entails a fine of 800 rubles.  And in case of repeated violation - removal of registration numbers. </p><p>  CASCO - comprehensive auto insurance apart from liability.  If you have such a policy, you can safely forget about the costs of your car associated with insurance claims.  Among them: accident, scratch, car theft, wheel removal, broken glass and so on and so forth.  Compensation for damage can be expected even if the damage was caused not during the accident with the participation of another owner, but also through personal fault, for example, entering a fence or a tree.  CASCO - pleasure is not cheap, but in case of damage, he boldly pay for himself.  How much is car insurance - information on this below. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  CASCO insurance policy cost </h2><p>  The cost of hull insurance is set by each company individually, at its own tariffs and is not regulated by the state.  Basically, the cost of such an insurance policy depends on the year of manufacture of the car, on who has the right to drive, on the availability of an anti-theft system. </p>

    <p>  Well, the main factor determining the cost of insurance is the price of the car. </p><h2>  The cost of the insurance policy </h2><p>  The cost of the MTPL policy is regulated by the Federal Law on MTPL and is controlled by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.  The following factors or, as they are also called, coefficients influence the cost of the policy: <br>  - base rate (regulated by the insurance company independently, but cannot exceed the rate established by law, as of June 2015, the maximum base rate is 4118 rubles); <br>  - type of vehicle; <br>  - car power in horsepower; <br>  - the territory of the predominant use of the vehicle (determined by the place of registration of the owner); <br>  - insurance period (from 3 months to one year); <br>  - how many drivers will be included in the insurance (limited or unlimited number); <br>  - age, length of service of drivers with the right to drive a vehicle; <br>  - <span>the bonus-malus class</span> assigned to the driver for trouble-free driving. </p>

    <p>  Now, each driver will know how much insurance covers the car. </p><h2>  Where to get insurance? </h2><p>  You can issue an insurance policy for a car at any insurance company.  Their selection is currently quite large.  Previously, you can visit the office of each company in order for you to calculate the exact amount, and choose the most attractive for you.  You also need to know the reviews, especially with regard to insurance claims payments.  Some companies have a negative rating, because in the event of an accident they do not pay the due amount, or the expectation of payments lasts for many months. </p><p>  Many vehicle owners, having chosen a company for the first time, remain there for many years.  Units move to another company, perhaps this is due to the opinion that the policyholder loses a discount when switching from one insurance to another.  This is a huge misconception.  The discount does not depend on where the car owner made out insurance last time.  The discount is awarded for trouble-free driving.  Each plus is a five percent discount.  This is important to know. </p><h2>  What documents do you need to have with you? </h2><p>  In order to take out insurance for the car, you must submit the following documents. </p><p>  1. Documents for the car.  This can be either a vehicle registration certificate (STS) or a vehicle passport (PTS). </p><p>  2. Identity documents of the owner.  This is mainly a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  3. It is also necessary to have a diagnostic card confirming the passage of the technical inspection of the car.  The card must be valid at the time of registration of the insurance policy. </p><p>  Most often, both the inspection and the CTP insurance policy are issued on the same day, but if the owner draws up insurance with a terminating inspection, then in the near future he will need to undergo an inspection.  This is a very important factor for assigning payments in the event of an accident.  There are many factors that an insurance company may refuse to pay, but it is mostly illegal.  Therefore, drivers create their own rating of insurers. </p><h2>  Rating of insurance companies </h2><p>  There is a so-called rating of companies in which car insurance was issued.  Rosgosstrakh, Energogarant, MSK, SOGAZ and other companies, of course, want to take a leading position in the insurance market, but not everyone succeeds.  For a long time, the rating of the company "Rosgosstrakh" was kept at a high level, but recently, more and more often you can hear negative reviews about it. </p>

    <p>  At present, AlfaStrakhovanie holds the leading place in the reliability rating, Ingosstrakh takes the second place, and Renaissance Insurance holds the fifth place. </p><h2>  Reviews about insurance companies </h2><p>  Many reviews can be found by contacting avid drivers.  Many of them already know where and what pitfalls can await them.  So, for example, some companies without fail draw up an additional life insurance against accident.  Its cost reaches one thousand rubles.  Insurers may not even say why they charge extra money, but indicate only the final amount.  Therefore, it is very important to understand what you are paying for.  Remember: imposing additional insurance without your voluntary consent is illegal! </p>
