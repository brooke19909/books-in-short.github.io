Central Bank revoked the Legion license</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The issuer of Russian, landscape, monochrome miniatures and the master of equilibra with a portrait gallery of American presidents a couple of years ago realized that the printing press was not a panacea.  Tough measures are required.  Only a regulator measures are applied after the fact, when the army of indignant investors of the bankrupt institution hopelessly asks: "Where is our money?" </p><p>  Such a complication struck in the summer of 2017 on the multi-sized clients of Legion Bank.  The revocation of the license hit the welfare of depositors in ten cities of the country and destroyed 832 jobs in the financial sector.  The register of creditors' claims is closed on November 29.  The external administration takes measures to eliminate the financial market participant. </p>

    <h2>  Portrait of a hero </h2><p>  The organization is preparing to be excluded from the register.  The company has been operating in the financial services market for 23 years.  LLP and LLC, CJSC, OJSC and, finally, AO - a chain of states of the organization. </p><p>  The state has never been listed among shareholders.  Absolutely private company.  The authorized fund is divided between majors in the form of a management elite with a share of 85.31% and <span>minority shareholders</span> with a share of 14.69%. </p><p>  Labor victories in a declared bankruptcy are of no interest to anyone.  Talk about the revocation of the Central Bank license.  Legion Bank was a member of the registry of the Deposit Insurance Agency.  Investors - individuals - are guaranteed reimbursement within the limits of the money placed on the accounts, but not higher than 1.4 million rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The bank attracted free cash from working people and pensioners.  Working with Legion cards was difficult.  KFU had two dozen of its own ATMs.  Rescued "Uralsib" with an extensive technological network of OBB "Atlas". </p><p>  Loans were issued without proper risk calculation.  Therefore, by January 2016, the debts of 22 borrowers in the amount of 7.2 billion rubles had accumulated.  Strange projects like buying jeans in Turkey for one and a half billion rubles were a cover for obtaining loans with the subsequent redistribution of money in private pockets. </p><h2>  Rubles and people </h2><p>  The amount of deposits of individuals is fixed at 12 billion Russian rubles.  In addition, legal entities entrusted 2 billion overwork.  The agency checked the forms of KFU and estimated the size of the assets at 5.2 billion.  Total, according to the initial audit, the difference between liabilities and own assets amounted to 8.8 billion Russian rubles.  Money depositors flew irrevocably. </p><p>  Co-owners of the battery "Legion" are two dozen people.  Five people were on the board of directors.  Five people worked on the board.  Among the manager of the work of the composition there were individuals whose track record contains the concepts of "embezzlement of funds", "appropriation of funds" through fictitious agreements.  One of the leaders was the founder of a scientific and production association with a sad past - the directors of this NGO deprived of property in another country by a court verdict. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Reasons for Deprivation </h2><p>  The regulator made attempts to direct the defendant to the legislative channel.  He severely threatened and forbade private mountains to promise golden mountains in exchange for placed deposits. </p><p>  But attempts to restrain themselves were not productive.  In the midst of summer vacations, the Legion Bank arranged a revocation of the Central Bank license. </p><p>  Private office has the right to independently plan areas of work.  A group of persons associated with the bank started investment projects against attracted funds of depositors in the interests of shareholders - majors. </p><p>  Investments are long-term investments.  And returning the enclosed is not an instant matter. </p><p>  The dynamics of the financial result is as follows: </p><p>  The year 2014 is up 91 million rubles in profit. </p><p>  2015 is still in positive territory, 9.5 million rubles. </p><p>  2016 - in a deep minus, losses of three hundred million rubles. </p><p>  2017, the end of June - the problem with the issuance of deposits to numerous customers. </p><p>  If the bank is represented by a ship, then on July 7, the Delta flag would be appropriate above the entrance - keep aloof, managing with difficulty.  The revocation of the Legion Bank license is based on three reasons: </p><p>  1. The authorized capital was 973,068,400 rubles.  During the audit, it was found that the amount of equity was lower than the minimum authorized capital fixed at the time the KFU was entered in state registers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  2. Special parameters of the category ‚Äúsufficiency of own funds‚Äù at the date of verification fell below 2%. </p><p>  3. Repeated violation of the requirements of the Central Bank and the provisions of the Federal legislation on banking. </p>

    <h2>  Self-employed private financier </h2><p>  The Legion Bank entered the list of 45 KFUs that survived the revocation of the license in 2017 in July. </p><p>  The private lending financial institution did not plan to submit the permit form to the regulator.  Financiers provided a standard set of services: </p><ul><li>  monetary intermediation as the main type of work; </li><li>  dealer operations; </li><li>  securities management; </li><li>  brokerage functions; </li><li>  depositary; </li><li>  luggage storage of values. </li></ul><p>  The listed types of work are licensed.  But in the last couple of years, performance has remained negative.  The odious expression "hole in your pocket" describes the situation of KFU in the best way possible. </p><h2>  Dark Hollow Violations </h2><p>  At the time of verification, the following were recorded: </p><p>  1. Lack of cash in the amount of 360 million rubles. </p><p>  2. The disappearance of material assets in the amount of 370 million rubles. </p><p>  3. Loss of creditor files. </p><p>  When an institution goes into bankruptcy, ways of salvation are possible: </p><p>  1. Remediation under the wing of the Central Bank.  Only large, backbone companies can appear here, as happened with Otkrytie financial institution and with Binbank. </p><p>  2. The license is not revoked, they give a deadline for the search for investors. </p><p>  3. Bankrupt financiers appeal to shareholders with a request for a free transfer of funds to the authorized capital. </p><p>  But it is difficult to talk about the trust of shareholders when the classes of the company‚Äôs management are skillfully reflected in the Criminal Code.  For example, participating in the withdrawal abroad of large sums of forged contracts with Turkish businessmen. </p>

    <h2>  Presence in Vladimir </h2><p>  By the end of 2017, the location of the regulator had lost 350 banks.  The most common reason for liquidation is participation in the shadow economy, and the laundering of capital obtained in violation of Russian laws. </p><p>  In Vladimir, the revocation of the Legion Bank license was not surprising, but it brought troubles to the depositors.  The average monthly accrued salary in the city is 27.1 thousand rubles.  Behind the minus income is 23.5 thousand.  But even with these incomes people manage to open deposits and deposits.  In addition, a thin layer of the middle class receives income above the average.  Savers upset.  According to the law, funds of individuals are insured in the DIA, but in the amount not exceeding 1.4 million rubles. </p><p>  A business usually starts with good intentions.  To expand the customer base, branches and additional offices are opened.  Corporate customers have long been divided.  Hope remains with individuals, lending and on-lending. </p><p>  In the city of Vladimir, Legion Bank applied the same license as in the other eight cities.  When the regulator issued the order, a bankruptcy notice was sent to the branches and placed in mass media.  Vladimir depositors wrote applications for a refund, stood in line and waited the same way as depositors in Yekaterinburg, Penza and Moscow. </p>

    <h2>  It was in Ivanovo </h2><p>  In the city of brides, a branch and three additional offices were opened to meet the needs of customers.  Reviews on the quality of work of KFU were polar.  Some clients noted professionalism and loyalty to the client, accelerated processing of a package of certificates and contracts.  Other clients expressed unpleasant amazement at the refusal to make payments on the details of the bailiffs. </p><p>  In the city of Ivanovo, the revocation of the Legion Bank license brought disappointment and hassle to customers. </p><p>  Be that as it may, loans were issued, deposits brought interest, maternity capital was taken to repay loans. </p><h2>  Debt Management Hand </h2><p>  The Legion Bank was taken away a license.  The current leaders lost confidence and passed into the care of the RF IC and the General Prosecutor's Office.  The regulator has appointed interim management to the organization. </p><p>  The appointed provisional administration in the conditions of the disappearance of the original loan agreements conducted its own investigation.  The results were stunned: loans were granted to firms without real production activity and without proven solvency;  without risk assessment of non-return.  The subject matter of individual contracts is formulated as assignment of claim rights.  There was a conclusion of assets. </p><p>  This usually happens.  First, management makes a mistake, and the mistake goes unnoticed by supervisors.  Then there is the temptation to repeat, since the ‚Äúmistake‚Äù brings profit in your personal pocket.  The shaft of such events is becoming unmanageable.  In the end, the person decides to grab big in front of the inevitable end. </p><p>  This happened at the Legion Bank.  The revocation of the license in 2017 was replenished in July with another defendant.  The expected finale, because the hired staff will not even think responsibly assess the risks of lending to projects if the project is promoted by the owner of the office.  More precisely, employees will not be allowed to voice this risk. </p>

    <h2>  Depositors - to the left, creditors - to the right </h2><p>  The problems with the Legion Bank license have become a headache for thousands of people.  Significant persons stole 11.9 billion rubles from working people and pensioners.  And along the way, they grabbed 3.1 billion money of legal entities. </p><p>  ‚ÄúPhysicists‚Äù, albeit partially, but under state protection.  The companies and individual entrepreneurs who opened accounts for production activities said goodbye to money forever. </p><h2>  Lessons of another's rake </h2><p>  It's a thing of the past, but it‚Äôs useful for customers of other KFUs, especially not from the top ten, to know the procedure. </p><p>  Check the presence of the client in the DIA list for refund.  If the surname is not found, or the client is included, but the amount to be reimbursed is less than the size of the deposit, then urgently write a statement of disagreement to the Agency.  It is necessary to write on paper and send by registered letter with notification.  Just one statement is not enough.  It is necessary to make certified copies of money certificates at a notary public: a deposit agreement and payments with the amount of operations on the account.  Papers attached to the statement.  Originals are best kept until the issue is resolved. </p><p>  The deprivation of the license of the Legion Bank does not cancel the right of the depositor to apply to the DIA for compensation, even if part of the due is returned to the person.  Except through the Agency, money can be claimed in court from the debtor.  It is appropriate for a user of bankruptcy services to file a lawsuit in court, to back up the petition with evidence;  Demand to restore the size of the deposit and pay compensation on it. </p><p>  Law enforcement agencies should file a fraud statement on the part of financiers when accepting a deposit. </p><p>  Bankruptcy of the creditor does not relieve the borrower of the obligation to repay the debt.  Until September, the office accepted payments to repay loans.  Further, Alfa-Bank took over the acceptance of payments in payment of loans issued in dollars and euros. </p>
