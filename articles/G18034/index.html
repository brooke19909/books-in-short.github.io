    <p>  The architecture of the "Silver Park" worked bureau SPEECH under the leadership of <span>Sergei Choban.</span>  The appearance visually demonstrates how architecture has changed over the centuries.  The lower tiers of the facades are represented by classic semicircular arches that correspond to the best traditions of Moscow buildings of the 19th century.  And the upper tiers are reflected by the predominance of glass elements, which is so characteristic of 21st century architecture.  And finally, the culmination was the non-standard roof - when you look at it, it literally takes your breath away.  Obviously, a company of real professionals worked on architecture. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  LCD "Silver <span>Park" (Moscow)</span> is located in the north-west of the capital.  For the construction of a new complex, the Khoroshev-Mnevniki district was chosen.  A few minutes walk from the complex is the natural monument "Silver Forest", which formed the basis of the concept of the entire project.  It will surely become a favorite place for walks and outdoor recreation for all those who purchase real estate for themselves here.  The first apartment buyers leave rave reviews about the construction site.  It is hard to imagine that you can even feel the charm of suburban life in the capital.  Clean air, chic forest belt, silence and tranquility are what many residents of the metropolis dream of, so tired of the bustle and endless noise.  Literally a stone's throw away, and to the Great Stroginsky backwater, from where a stunning view of the Moscow River opens. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  The southern border of the complex is adjacent to Parshin Street, and the northern one goes directly to General Barzarin Street.  Due to this, residents of the Silver Park will be able to choose alternative routes to the city center.  Zvenigorodskoye and Volokolamskoye shosse are currently in excellent condition, so using them to move in your own car, you can easily get to the right place.  Only 20 minutes by car and you are already on the Garden Ring.  The first buyers focus on the variety of public transport routes: as the microdistrict grows in its direction, additional routes will be launched. </p><h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  LCD "Silver Park" ("Ingrad") is a project that includes not only the construction of residential buildings, but also large-scale improvement of the adjacent territory.  Designers have worked on the landscape of the area, creating a kind of hills, plains, breaking elegant flower beds and walking areas. </p>
