Millions of tourists annually visit the best cities of this state.  The UAE is the most modern and most developed territory of the entire Arabian Peninsula. </p><p>  In just a few decades, instead of the desert, a great country was formed here.  And the people who are the indigenous inhabitants of this territory have enriched themselves in connection with huge oil reserves. </p><h2>  UAE: attractions, photos and description </h2><p>  UAE is definitely a country of contrasts.  Here you can see the highest skyscrapers in the world and at the same time poor markets.  At home for millions of dollars, and on the other hand, rotting huts and hard-to-survive people.  What are the attractions in the UAE?  The most interesting places will be briefly presented below. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the government has done everything to attract an endless stream of tourists.  In addition, many Russians like to relax here, because the weather is almost always hot here, and here are very cheap tickets from the central cities of Russia. </p><p>  There are also many very popular hotels here.  Many of them differ in class of service.  There are even six-star ones, but this is not the main thing.  The United Arab Emirates is full of architectural structures.  And it is about the sights of the UAE that we will tell you in this article. </p><h2>  Burj khalifa </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.planetyatra.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Burj Khalifa in Dubai" class="if uuid-2280438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2280438.jpg"></div><p>  Everyone knows about this famous tower, although it is not easy to pronounce its name.  It is one of the main attractions of the UAE.  Burj Khalifa is the highest of all skyscrapers in the world.  Many tourists come here to see this wonderful invention of mankind.  The height of the architectural structure is eight hundred meters!  Number of floors - 163. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many different services are provided inside the building.  There is a hotel, private apartments, fountains, as well as an observation deck, which is daily visited by tourists from all over the world.  It is from here that you can see the best and most spectacular view of Dubai. </p><h2>  Palm islands </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.fansshare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Artificial Island in Dubai" class="if uuid-2280443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2280443.jpg"></div><p>  The artificially constructed island consists of three parts.  Among them are Deira, Jumeirah and Jebel Ali.  It is considered one of the main attractions of the UAE. </p><p>  All this is made in the form of a palm tree.  Agree that looks wonderful.  These islands were created from sand, stone, as well as limestone, which was mined on the shores of the Persian Gulf. </p><p>  The famous project "Palm Island" is one of the most popular attractions in the UAE. </p><h2>  Dubai Music Fountain </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.getyourguide.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai Fountains" class="if uuid-2280434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2280434.jpg"></div><p>  To see this spectacular event, which happens very often, tourists come from different continents.  Definitely, the singing fountains are breathtaking. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  They are located next to the highest skyscraper Burj Khalifa, and against its background this view looks even more interesting. </p><p>  The musical fountain is a man-made wonder of the world, which was built on the state‚Äôs oil revenues.  The design was done by the popular California company WET, which also made a fountain in Las Vegas opposite the Bellagio Hotel. </p><p>  This is the only fountain in the world, illuminated by six thousand sources.  The length is two hundred and seventy-five meters, and the height of the stream reaches more than one hundred and fifty meters, which is about fifty floors of a high-rise building (one third of the Burj Khalifa).  The fountain also creates more than a thousand different shapes. </p><p>  Construction began in 2008.  Officially, the fountain was open to citizens and tourists only by mid-2009. </p><h2>  Sheikh Zayed Mosque </h2><div class="photo" data-original="veryclose.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheikh Zayed Mosque" class="if uuid-2280459" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2280459.jpg"></div><p>  A majestic historical building made of white marble.  This building is the clearest example of the modern architectural style of UAE attractions. </p><p>  The famous mosque was erected in honor of the very first president of the country.  The construction of this building was attended by many famous architects from other countries, including Germany, the United States of America, as well as Italy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Around the mosque is a picturesque area with many palm trees and lawns.  Inside the structure, a carpet of immense sizes is woven in Iran.  Its dimensions are 5.6 thousand square meters. </p><h2>  Hotel Parus </h2><p>  A hotel that was seen by all the people who visited Dubai.  This luxury hotel is located on the shores of the Persian Gulf and reminds many of a real sail, soaring through the waves.  It is located on an artificial island.  It is believed that the hotel has seven stars, but the classification has five.  The height of this skyscraper is three hundred meters, and the maximum ceiling height of the hall is one hundred eighty meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wsllpaper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Sail" class="if uuid-2280445" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2280445.jpg"></div><p>  It was built at the end of the twentieth century and was then considered the highest in the United Arab Emirates, but nine years later it was ahead of another hotel, whose name is "Rose Tower".  Its height is 333 meters, which is twelve meters more than the "Sail". </p><h2>  Bastakia District </h2><p>  Bastakia district is one of the most ancient historical sights of the UAE (Dubai).  Once upon a time there lived people engaged in pearl fishing.  This happened before oil became the country's main income. </p><p>  Here you can see the traditional houses in which people lived.  There are also wind towers that replace air conditioners, because the UAE is very hot. </p><h2>  Gold market </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gold market" class="if uuid-2280450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2280450.jpg"></div><p>  As mentioned above, the United Arab Emirates is one of the richest countries in the entire planet, so gold is not so important here, and it is sold on the local market for a pittance.  People buy it in bags and boxes. </p><p>  It should be noted that in many places of the city there are machines with gold bullion.  Such a low pricing policy is due to the fact that the country has very low taxes. </p><h2>  Theme Park Ferrari </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bookmundi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ferrari Park" class="if uuid-2280453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2280453.jpg"></div><p>  Where, if not in the Emirates, can I rent a Ferrari and drive along the wide avenues and bridges of the city?  This place is located very close to Abu Dhabi, on an artificial island. </p><p>  The park looks like one of the brand‚Äôs models, or rather, GT.  This place is painted red and the company logo is painted on the roof. </p><p>  Inside the building is an exhibition of the achievements of the famous Italian company. </p><p>  Here you will see the famous car models, show programs, copies of the sights of Italy, as well as some technologies. </p><p>  If you will be in Abu Dhabi, then be sure to visit the center Ferrari World. </p><h2>  Dubai Mall </h2><div class="photo" data-original="whatson.ae" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai Mall" class="if uuid-2280465" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2280465.jpg"></div><p>  One of the largest shopping centers of the United Arab Emirates, as well as the world.  Here you will not even have time to go to all the shops in a day.  In addition, you can get lost here. </p><p>  The most popular places of the shopping center are the largest aquarium in the world, several cinemas, as well as a large-scale Olympic ice rink, which was included in the Guinness Book of Records. </p><h2>  Aquarium at the Dubai Mall </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.memphistours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aquarium at Dubai Mall" class="if uuid-2280467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2280467.jpg"></div><p>  We decided to dwell on this place in more detail, since nowhere else in the world will you ever see such a large aquarium.  It was created to attract citizens, as well as tourists from other countries. </p><p>  Inside it live more than thirty thousand species of fish!  There are only four hundred sharks and stingrays. </p><p>  Not many people know that this design weighs more than two hundred tons.  The aquarium holds more than ten million liters of water. </p><h2>  Ski Resort Ski Dubai </h2><p>  This place may not seem special to many Russians, since in our country there are quite a lot of such ski resorts where you can go snowboarding or skiing. </p><p>  But in Dubai, this is the only place of its kind.  Here at the same time more than one and a half thousand people can ride.  The infrastructure in this place is very thought out, so vacationers have nothing to worry about.  In case of emergency, medical care is always available inside the facility. </p><h2>  Jumeirah Mosque </h2><div class="photo" data-original="allcastle.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jumeirah Mosque" class="if uuid-2280470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2280470.jpg"></div><p>  The mosque is one of the oldest in the country.  The UAE appeared in the seventies of the twentieth century, so the construction of those years can be called one of the very first in the state. </p><p>  The mosque is made of pink sandstone.  This material is considered traditional in the United Arab Emirates.  Many architectural structures erected from it. </p><p>  As you know, the entrance to the mosque is allowed not only to Muslims, but also to citizens of other faiths.  Anyone can come inside and learn many interesting things about the traditions in Islam, history and interesting facts.  All this happens under the supervision of a guide. </p><h2>  King Faisal Mosque </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tutu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Faisal Mosque" class="if uuid-2280536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2280536.jpg"></div><p>  As you know, in the United Arab Emirates, laws differ in different territories.  It is believed that the most stringent are in Sharjah.  This is where King Faisal's mosque is located.  It is rightfully one of the most interesting sights of the UAE. </p><p>  The temple was built not at the expense of the state, but at the expense of King Faisal, who ruled in Saudi Arabia.  Later, this architectural structure was transferred to the authorities of the Emirate. </p><p>  Since then, the mosque has been owned by the state and has been an important place for Muslims. </p><p>  The interior of this room is simply amazing with its magnificence and luxury.  Especially worth a look at the first and second floor. </p><p>  This place is always open and admission is free.  But tourists who are not Muslims, the entrance, unfortunately, is prohibited. </p><h2>  Al Jahili Fortress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Al Jahili Fortress" class="if uuid-2280484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2280484.jpg"></div><p>  This fortress is located next to the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, on the border with Oman.  Outwardly, it resembles a large sand fortress, agree?  It was built at the end of the nineteenth century, when the United Arab Emirates did not exist at all, so the Al-Jahili fortress can rightfully be called one of the oldest attractions in the UAE.  Photos of this building are above. </p><p>  In this area, the fortress became the largest and most famous.  In modern times, Al-Jahili is one of the national attractions of the UAE. </p><h2>  Ajman Fortress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.smileplanet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ajman Fortress" class="if uuid-2280487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2280487.jpg"></div><p>  Many tourists from Russia like to come to the emirate of Ajman.  Of course, you can not compare with the flow of visitors to Dubai, but there is an opportunity to enjoy the Persian Gulf in silence.  By right, this place is one of the most interesting sights of the UAE. </p><p>  This building was erected in the eighteenth century.  The material from which it is made - gypsum and coral stone.  An African tree was also used here. </p><p>  In the seventies of the twentieth century, the place served as a residence for the sheikh, as well as his family.  After he decided to move, the emirate police began to be based in the fortress. </p><h2>  What can you see from the attractions in the UAE in the first place? </h2><p>  By far, Dubai is the most interesting emirate in the UAE, and if you have very little time to stay in the city, we recommend that you visit the following places: Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall, Kayan Tower, and if you have time, swim in the bay or take a look at the singing fountains. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The UAE is the richest, mysterious and unpredictable country.  If you want to see a new civilization, then you should definitely go here and look at the most interesting places in the UAE, their sights. </p>
