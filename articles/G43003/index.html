    <p>  The <span>New Economic Policy</span> , and this is what most often called the <span>new economic policy,</span> introduced in the early twenties of the last century, was to be a transitional step towards building socialism.  The country, only recently recovering from revolutions and civil war, wanted peace.  The temporary policy of the Bolsheviks, which had outlived itself, lived out their last days.  Once great Russia was on the verge of a serious social crisis - then the transition from war communism to the NEP was ripe.  It was this decision that was proclaimed at the next (tenth) <span>congress of the Bolshevik party</span> in Moscow in 1921. </p><p>  The reasons for the transition to the NEP were clear.  First of all, the country's difficult situation at the turn of such changes affected: Russia suffered a political and <span>economic crisis.</span>  The industry was destroyed, the plants stood.  Workers were declassing more and more - there were a lot of them, they wanted to work and fought hard for every job (but they were not enough). </p><p>  And those who worked did not receive any particular moral and monetary satisfaction from their labor.  In connection with the cancellation of commodity-money relations, people received wages as a natural product, not money.  Such egalitarianism did not lead to a sense of satisfaction from moral justice, but to an ever-increasing bitterness and rampant speculation throughout the country. </p><p>  Agriculture, namely the disobedient peasants, were generally seen by the Bolsheviks as destructive elements.  Peasant possessions, due to the reduction in cultivated areas and the instability of the situation in the country, became more and more self-contained and resembled subsistence enterprises.  Entering the consumer market for them was uninteresting, unprofitable.  In addition, the peasants fed the Red Army, and then the demobilized soldiers more and more filled the cities and villages, replenishing the ranks of cripples, losers and foster children. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now, a long-term transformation of all areas of the economy under a new policy was ahead - a direct transition to the NEP.  Its main ideas (the abolition of the surplus appraisal and the introduction of a tax in kind) were not yet fully understood by the simple peasantry, which was hiding in anticipation of changes, although anti-Bolshevik uprisings arose in the south of Russia against any reforms - that‚Äôs how Ukraine reacted to any changes (like ‚Äúthere will only be more worse"). </p><p>  The second significant change is the development of <span>market relations</span> and the resolution of various forms of ownership.  The market, in turn, could be revived by injections of foreign capital, which ensured the transition to the NEP.  The depreciation of the currency at that time and terrible inflation required a monetary reform, which was carried out in the first years after the introduction of this policy. </p><p>  During the existence of <span>war communism, the</span> party finally strengthened its position - the Bolsheviks ceased to be associated with political power.  From now on, they became part of the <span>state apparatus.</span>  The expansion of ideology and its introduction into all spheres of public and private life led to the complete and undivided control of society by the Bolshevik party.  In such circumstances, the transition to the NEP became the most possible, since the economic, political, and ideological spheres were concentrated in the hands of one "puppeteer." </p><p>  The introduction of a new economic policy was met by the population differently.  Many peasants quickly reoriented themselves and began to actively enter the market, workers, in turn, received an excellent opportunity to use their forces in production, because the transition to the NEP provided an opportunity for the country's economy to flourish, which, unfortunately, was so stupidly lost in subsequent years. </p>
