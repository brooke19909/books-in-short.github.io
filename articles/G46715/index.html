Most often, fake 500 rubles are found.  The bill is common in circulation and does not attract attention like 1000 or 5000 rubles.  Forging fraudsters with money of a lower denomination is simply not profitable. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of fakes </h2>

    <p>  Specialists in monetary matters focus on the fact that the authenticity of a banknote of 500 rubles should be checked with signs of fake.  For example, the crunch of genuine and fake money is almost the same, but the surface relief will differ significantly.  The fakes are smooth to the touch, but real bills are rough.  On fake money, <span>watermarks are</span> either completely absent or have an unconventional design.  They can be very dark or blurry.  If there is a magnetic thread, then it is very sloppy.  The silver strip that hit the numbers in the face value of the banknote is a clear sign of a fake.  It is especially worth taking a closer look at the small letters that counterfeit money is almost indistinguishable.  Microperforation is done with a regular needle, not a laser, in accordance with the technology. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Common signs of real money </h2>

    <p>  Most often, scammers try to fake money in denominations of 500 rubles, 1,000 and 5,000. This is due to the fact that faking a 100-ruble banknote promises small benefits, and the risk of punishment remains very high.  By order of the Bank of Russia, a banknote of 500 rubles, in fact, like banknotes of a different denomination, must have the following characteristic parameters: </p><ul><li>  The upper and lower parts of the ribbon with ornaments on the front side should be decorated with lines with microtext, which are very easy to see even with a slight increase. </li><li>  In separate parts of the security thread, which is visible on the surface of the banknote in the area of ​​the figured window, if you tilt the bill, you can see the repeating numbers that determine the face value of the money.  They are usually separated by rhombs or rainbow shine without any image. </li><li>  On the outskirts of the coupon fields of the banknote there are subtle touches.  They are designed for people with low vision and have a high relief, which is easy to perceive by touch. </li><li>  The monotonous green field is decorated with blue and yellow stripes, which can be seen if you tilt the bill. </li><li>  If we consider 500 rubles, the bill against the light source will be decorated with the number "500".  It is worth looking for on the right side of the coat of arms.  The numerical value is made of even parallel rows of micro-holes that are not felt by touch. </li></ul><h2>  General individual features 500 rubles </h2><p>  Each banknote of Russia is characterized by the presence of individual characteristics.  If you study 500 rubles, the bill should have the following features: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  The primary color of the banknote is purple. </li><li>  We draw attention to the fact that the city on a banknote of 500 rubles is Arkhangelsk.  The front side should be decorated with a monument to <span>Peter I</span> with a sailboat and the building of the Marine River Station.  The reverse side of the banknote is framed by the Solovetsky Monastery. </li><li>  When considering a banknote at an angle, in the field of a plain field, the number "500" appears.  Each digit of the number has its own coloring.  By turning the banknote, but without changing the viewing angle, you can see how the numbers change their colors. </li><li>  On the watermark in the form of Peter I there are both light areas and dark areas that smoothly flow into each other.  Near the portrait there is the number "500", which is a tone lighter than the portrait itself. </li><li>  On the back of the banknote, in the area of ​​the security thread, you can see the repeating number "500", which is divided by rhombs.  If we consider the clearance under the rays of light, then the numbers will be bright against a dark background. </li><li>  The image of the marine station is assembled from separate graphic details. </li></ul><h2>  Banknotes 1997 </h2>

    <p>  Like all monetary units, 500 rubles - a bill issued in 1997 and put into circulation in 1998, has its own protective signs.  There are about 12 of them, 4 of which can be seen using special equipment.  In addition to the main parameters specific to each 500-ruble banknote, we can talk about such features: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  The presence of a multi-ton watermark. </li><li>  The security thread has a thickness of 1 millimeter, and on it is a combination of letters and numbers "CBR 500". </li><li>  When studying banknotes in the light, you can pay attention to the mutual complementarity of the drawings on the front and back. </li><li>  Ornamental ribbon in the light and at different angles will have the inscription "PP".  Letters can be both light against a dark background, and vice versa. </li><li>  The bill is equipped with protective violet, red and green fibers, the location of which has no patterns. </li><li>  The presence of embossed inscriptions: “Bank of Russia ticket” and two points, two stripes. </li><li>  A banknote of 500 rubles in 1997 is protected by a micro-clog that is not visible with a simple eye.  When copying banknotes, moire appears in the form of dark and light patterns. </li><li>  The presence of two microtexts: "500" and "CBR 500". </li><li>  The text of the emblem and digital face value when tilted changes from brown to greenish. </li></ul><h2>  2001 Modifications </h2>

    <p>  A banknote of 500 rubles of the old model (1997) practically coincides in format, plot and color with a modification of 2001.  The only innovation is the relief inscription “Modification 2001”  It is located in the same place as other elements for people with low vision.  The main difference between an old and a new bill is machine-readable signs of authenticity.  Under ultraviolet light, the background glow of the paper is absent, and the gray elements glow green.  Such manipulations did not bring results and fake banknotes of 500 rubles did not appear less commonly.  This forced the government to issue new banknotes in 2004 and in 2010. </p><h2>  2004 Modifications </h2>

    <p>  In 2004, the Russian government issued new 500-ruble banknotes, which were modeled on the 1997 banknote.  Among the main differences it is worth highlighting 4 protective fibers.  In addition to red, green and two-tone stripes, gray ones also appeared.  The security thread is now sewn in the bill.  The denomination is presented in perforated form.  Microperforation is smooth on both sides and is imperceptible to the touch.  When copying, moire stripes appear in a special field.  A gray color was selected for printing the face value.  A significant difference between the banknotes of 1997 and 2004 is noticeable when studying them under ultraviolet light.  On the front side you can find the inscription “2004 modification”.  It is palpated by fingers.  The size of the banknote 500 rubles in 2004, as well as other years of issue, is 150 millimeters by 65 millimeters. </p><h2>  2010 Modification </h2>

    <p>  The last banknote of 500 rubles was issued in 2010.  The banknote is characterized by the decoration and format that were used in 1997, 2001 and 2004.  The artwork and plot have been changed.  The reverse side of the banknote is decorated with a view of the Solovetsky Monastery, but in a completely unconventional perspective.  The front side of the banknote is decorated with the structure of the river station, which is significantly shaded.  The foreground went to the image of a sailing ship.  The right coupon field is decorated with a combined watermark.  <span>The serial number is</span> now spelled out from numbers that quietly increase in the direction from left to right.  For individual parts of the image, the presence of magnetic properties is characteristic.  When checking a bill in ultraviolet radiation, it will radically differ from the design that the bill had 500 rubles in 1997, and all banknotes of other issues. </p><h2>  If a fake falls into your hands </h2><p>  If a fake bill fell into your hands, do not try to sell it.  The most correct solution is to tear up and destroy the fake.  If in doubt about the authenticity of the money, you need to contact the bank.  However, in this situation, it is worth considering that when fixing the fact of the presence of fake, the employees of the financial institution will call law enforcement officials for further proceedings.  If you plan to borrow or provide a sufficiently large amount of money for temporary use, you need to protect yourself by rewriting all serial numbers of banknotes.  This will prove both their authenticity and fake in certain circumstances. </p><h2>  Be carefull </h2>

    <p>  A genuine 500 ruble note must be carefully studied to protect yourself from unpleasant situations.  Despite the efforts of the Russian government to protect the national currency, the number of counterfeits is increasing.  The number of fakes in the first quarter of 2015 alone increased by more than 13.3%.  Since the beginning of the year, law enforcement agencies managed to identify 16 thousand fake banknotes.  The first place for fakes went to 5000 banknotes.  In just 4 months, 3,300 banknotes with a face value of 5,000 thousand and 435 banknotes with a face value of 500 rubles were withdrawn from circulation.  The main number of frauds recorded in the Central Federal District (12 thousand counterfeit notes).  There are practically no fakes in Sevastopol (14 pieces).  Last year was ended with the seizure of about 80 thousand fake banknotes in different parts of the country.  Counterfeiting foreign currency, in particular dollars and euros, is not so common in the country. </p>
