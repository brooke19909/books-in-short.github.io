This may be due to an error in paperwork, illness or other factors.  Because of this, people do not go to their favorite resort, and also lose finances.  But there is the possibility of compensation.  Non-departure insurance would be the best solution.  More about it will be described in the article. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Unlike medical <span>insurance,</span> non-departure <span>insurance is</span> issued at will.  Often, the service is included in the price of the tour, but often people have to deal with the purchase of the policy on their own.  With the onset of difficult circumstances, the agreement allows almost completely, 80-90%, to cover costs. </p>

    <p>  You should not really count on the help of a travel agency, because when you refuse a ticket, it pays fines to various partners: organizers of excursions, hoteliers, carriers.  Therefore, with the purchase of vouchers, you need to think in advance about possible surprises, as well as insurance against their consequences. </p><h2>  Why is it required? </h2><p>  Travel insurance is a common and convenient option for those who do not want to be deceived and injured when traveling to another country.  This service is necessary if you are not sure whether a visa will be granted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Insurance fully reimburses costs.  You can issue it to everyone, including in addition to other insurances.  But before that, you need to familiarize yourself with what this service includes.  Do I need insurance against no-fly?  To offset the costs of many risks, you need to arrange this service. </p><h2>  Insured events </h2><p>  There are several reasons why non-departure insurance is required.  Insured events are as follows: </p><ul><li>  death or illness of relatives; </li><li>  the presence of medical contraindications; </li><li>  hospitalization of relatives; </li><li>  refusal of a visa; </li><li>  urgent subpoena; </li><li>  attraction of a person to military service; </li><li>  damage to property that prevents travel to another country. </li></ul><p>  For everything else that is not spelled out in the document, compensation will not be paid.  Please note that insurance must be issued no later than 3 days from the date of purchase of the ticket and no later than 2 weeks before departure.  Only then will it have legal force. </p><h2>  Features of non-travel insurance </h2><p>  Now claimed insurance against non-departure to another country.  When making such a service, the insured person is compensated: </p><ul><li>  payment for tickets; </li><li>  reservation of rooms, hotels; </li><li>  permits. </li></ul><p>  There are several options for obtaining travel insurance.  The first case involves the availability of medical <span>insurance for traveling</span> to another country, but not to leave the city.  In this situation, you should not change or renew the service.  It is important to contact the company that provided the policy.  There they will add insurance against non-departure.  Many forms provide the ability to include additional features, but at an additional cost. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In the second case, it is assumed that there is no insurance policy.  To visit another country, you need to buy a policy, otherwise it will not work to be there.  The reason for this is the effect of the new RF law on the lifting of state obligations for citizens of the Russian Federation who are in another country.  Therefore, with the purchase of the policy it is necessary to provide insurance against non-departure.  This will protect your vacation.  But you need to consider that each company has its own conditions, so you need to carefully study the documents before registration. </p><h2>  What risks are not covered? </h2><p>  But not all risks are covered by non-flying insurance.  Travel incidents are different, and compensation is not provided for each of them.  These include: </p><ul><li>  illness or injury of the insured person and his attendants, if only outpatient treatment is necessary for treatment; </li><li>  pregnancy and its consequences; </li><li>  attempted suicide or other similar act; </li><li>  incorrectly executed documents; </li><li>  delay by law enforcement; </li><li>  natural disasters, war; </li><li>  injuries resulting from alcohol and drug intoxication. </li></ul><p>  Usually the risks for which compensation is not reimbursed are stated in the policy.  The document includes the duration, rights and obligations of the parties, other important nuances. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The price of the service is determined depending on the cost of the ticket.  In the event of an insured event, the company reimburses the expenses spent on the trip.  It is only necessary to adhere to deadlines so that payments are not refused. </p>

    <p>  Typically, non-departure insurance costs about 10% of the ticket price.  For example, insurance for 30 thousand euros will cost about 1870 rubles if the trip is canceled due to a visa denial or in other emergency cases.  In many companies, the cost of the service can be calculated using an online calculator. </p><h2>  Cancellation of a tour or denial of a visa: what to do? </h2><p>  In case of an insured event, it is necessary: </p><ul><li>  during the day to notify in writing about the reason for the denial of travel; </li><li>  the application is accompanied by documents serving as confirmation of this event; </li><li>  prepare the rest of the documentation - tickets, insurance, passport. </li></ul><p>  The trip is a crucial event, but there are situations that it breaks.  Then, in addition to personal difficulties, material losses are expected.  Non-departure airline tickets insurance allows you to offset costs. </p><h2>  Features of travel insurance </h2><p>  The companies offer travel insurance.  Many people think: why overpay if a difficult situation may not occur?  But with the advent of problems, people usually regret that they did not overpay the extra 6-10% of the ticket price.  After all, then they would be protected from many difficulties. </p>

    <h2>  Policy purchase </h2><p>  Before registration of the service it is necessary to check the company.  It will take a little time, but there will be confidence in the chosen option.  To do this, you need to visit the websites of firms, familiarize yourself with the conditions.  Everything should be written clearly. </p><p>  It is advisable to see photos and videos about the company, as well as read reviews.  This will make the right choice.  It should be borne in mind that a reliable company will not hide anything from its customers. </p><h2>  Service benefits </h2><p>  Such insurance appeared due to the activities of travel companies.  They are intermediaries between the client and the destination.  With the signing of an agreement with a tour operator and settlements, the company pays for the services of foreign partners, which is stipulated by the ticket.  Payments are also made related to the departure of the customer and obtaining permission. </p>

Therefore, usually the funds are not returned.  In order to avoid such cases, insurance is used, which guarantees a refund upon departure.  Many firms compensate 85-90% of paid funds. </p><h2>  Refusal Actions </h2><p>  In an insured event, the company must pay the costs of the client.  Only for this you need to provide documentary evidence of a difficult situation.  But sometimes the agency refuses to pay funds.  If the client is confident that he is right, then he must file a lawsuit in court to receive his money. </p><p>  Usually, with the occurrence of an insured event, firms fully pay the required funds.  Otherwise, the license may be revoked during the trial for violations, and because of this, the work of the company cannot be continued.  Therefore, before taking out insurance, you need to choose a reliable company that will fulfill its obligations. </p>
