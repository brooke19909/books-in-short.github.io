It has long attracted people with silence and amazing landscapes.  In our article we want to talk about one of the resort hotels - Merperle Hon Tam Resort. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel </h2><p>  Vietnam is known to tourists from all over the world as a place of budget vacation.  However, besides the mainland resorts, the country is rich in exotic islands, on which numerous hotels are built that offer rest in the "bounty" style.  One of such places is the island of Hon Tam, located next to the well-known resort of Nha Trang. </p><p>  Merperle Hon Tam Resort is a small hotel located on the beach.  The complex consists of bungalows surrounded by a green garden.  It was built in 2008 and consists of 49 rooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="merperle hon tam resort" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1717564.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The direct distance from the airport to the island is 20 kilometers.  The hotel will appeal to those tourists who prefer a relaxing holiday on the sea coast away from the hustle and bustle.  Despite the fact that the complex is located on an island, not far from it are the most interesting sights of Nha Trang, which we will talk about later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Merperle Hon Tam Resort offers its guests rooms in bungalows.  All apartments have balconies or terraces.  Among them there are numbers of the following categories: </p><ol><li>  Deluxe Bungalow - Deluxe Bungalow with a double bed (area 52 sq. M.).  The apartments are equipped with satellite channels and a flat-screen TV, refrigerator, safe, wireless internet, fan, air conditioning, minibar, safe, bath accessories, and a set for ironing. </li><li>  Deluxe Bungalow with Two Single Beds.  These rooms do not differ in equipment from the previous category of rooms. </li><li>  Family Suite - family suite (area 64 sq. M.).  If the first two categories of rooms are designed to accommodate no more than two people, then three guests can be accommodated in family suites.  This apartment has one large double bed and one single.  The rest of the room equipment is no different. </li></ol><p>  All apartments overlook the ocean, as the bungalows face the coast.  The cottages are arranged in several rows, the closest are almost on the beach, the rest are in the garden.  Therefore, guests have the opportunity to choose the appropriate accommodation option. </p><h2>  Additional privileges for children </h2><p>  Merperle Hon Tam Resort provides a number of privileges for the youngest guests: </p><ol><li>  Any room can accommodate no more than two children, whose age does not exceed 12 years. </li><li>  Kids who are not yet five years old can stay for free, provided that they will not be provided with a separate bed. </li><li>  When settling at the reception for children from the age of five to twelve years, a breakfast fee is charged (this is done directly at the hotel, and not when booking rooms). </li><li>  Children over 12 years old are considered adults, and therefore their accommodation and meals are paid in full. </li><li>  If you need to install extra beds, you should contact the reception.  The cost of the service depends on the category of apartments. </li></ol><h2>  Catering </h2><p>  Merperle Hon Tam Resort 5 * offers food in the main and only restaurant.  The price includes breakfast only.  However, if you wish, you can arrange full board upon arrival.  In the mornings, food is served as a buffet.  The rest of the time, you can order dishes on the menu.  If you wish, your portion can be brought to your room, and no one takes delivery charge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="merperle hon tam resort 5" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1717566.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many operators offer New Year tours in Merperle Xon Tam Resort 5 *.  The peculiarity of such trips is that from the cold winter you find yourself in amazingly warm weather on the ocean.  On New Year's Eve, the hotel organizes a festive banquet, the cost of which is included in the price of the ticket.  For this reason, New Year's tours are more expensive than ordinary.  In general, such trips are very popular among our tourists. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Merperle Hon Tam Resort (Vietnam) has a very beautiful and well-groomed territory, on which numerous exotic trees and bushes grow.  In addition, there is an incredible number of flowering flower beds along the paths.  It can be seen that the hotel staff carefully monitors the cleanliness and order, not forgetting to care for the plants.  The territory is so well-groomed that it is pleasant to walk along it in the shade of tropical plants. </p><p>  The complex has a very large swimming pool, which is divided into separate zones of different depths.  There is also a children's section.  The pond is beautifully decorated with lush vegetation, harmoniously fits into the overall composition. </p><p>  Merperle Xon Tam Resort (Vietnam) has a gift shop, tennis court and spa.  You can move around the hotel in tuk-tuk if you do not want to walk.  However, the road in any direction does not exceed 200 meters. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel is located on an island, tourists always have the opportunity to go to Nha Trang for shopping or for a walk.  Bots are sent to the coast every hour, so there are no problems with transport. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Guests can play billiards on site, while kids can play in the games room. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Merperle Hon Tam Resort 5 * (Vietnam) is located on the coast.  Therefore, the main advantage of the hotel is the fact that during the whole vacation you are at the sea and admire its beauty.  The large and wide beach is equipped with numerous sunbeds of various kinds.  There are so many of them on the coast that you can find free space at any time.  Beach towels are issued at the reception in unlimited quantities. </p><h2>  Merperle Hon Tam Resort (Vietnam): Hotel Location Reviews </h2><p>  Speaking of the stunningly beautiful island of Hon Tam and the hotel, I would like to refer to the reviews of tourists who visited there in order to have a more real idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis place.  Merperle Hon Tam Resort 5 * (Vietnam) is built on the coast.  The hotel will appeal to those guests who are supporters of outdoor recreation, because during the whole vacation you will be surrounded by exotic plants and the ocean.  Rest on Hon Tam is significantly different from staying in the same Nha Trang.  These two resorts are completely different from each other, although they are in close proximity.  If Nha Trang is a city resort, then Hon Tam is a stunningly beautiful nature with pristine beaches and water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="merperle hon tam resort vietnam" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1717576.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the same time, while on the island, tourists are not completely divorced from civilization and can at any time cross the mainland.  In Merperle Xon Tam Resort 5 * (Nha Trang) it is good to relax with children, because the sea is very close. </p><h2>  Reviews about the number of rooms </h2><p>  Merperle Hon Tam Resort offers villas and bungalows built in a distinctive national style.  According to tourists, the villas are newer, and the rooms in them are more spacious than in a bungalow.  At this point, you should pay attention when choosing a home, because tour operators do not specify such nuances.  The interior is also Thai-style. </p><p>  All apartments have approximately the same equipment and differ only in size and distance from the coast.  Experienced tourists do not recommend choosing a bungalow near the beach.  Many people prefer to stay in them in the hope of getting a quiet and relaxing holiday.  But it turns out the opposite, since it is in this place that all the staff and the Chinese who come for one day pass early in the morning.  For a more relaxing holiday, houses in the back of the garden are suitable. </p><p>  According to guests, the rooms need fresh cosmetic repairs, but in general their condition does not overshadow the rest.  The hotel provides daily housekeeping.  But in fact, if you want your apartments to be cleaned, you should remind the maid about this.  Towels are changed daily and bed linen several times a week.  Every day, maids leave water bottles for each guest in the rooms, however, this amount of water is not enough for the whole day, so tourists have to buy it in Nha Trang. </p><h2>  Catering reviews </h2><p>  Merperle Hon Tam Resort 5 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang) offers its guests meals in a restaurant on site.  As a rule, it is the quality of food and the variety of dishes that cause a lot of controversy among vacationers.  In this sense, Merperle Hon Tam Resort 5 * (Nha Trang) was no exception.  The assortment of buffet dishes in the morning was not enough for all vacationers.  Many guests note a meager selection of food.  It is difficult to judge how true this is, because opinions on this issue are quite contradictory. </p><p>  The rest of the time, tourists have the opportunity to order dishes according to the menu of the restaurant.  Unfortunately, vacationers note that it is difficult to decide on the choice of food, since there is no Russian translation in the price list.  Visitors actually make an order at random.  The restaurant employees deliver food to their rooms for free, this is a very convenient service if you do not want to leave the apartment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="merperle hon tam resort 5 vietnam" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1717579.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The peculiarity of rest on the island is that there is not such a huge selection of cafes and restaurants as in Nha Trang.  Therefore, you have to eat exclusively at the hotel.  If you want to purchase products, then you need to go to the mainland to the supermarket. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  If you are planning a vacation to Vietnam, Merperle Hon Tam Resort is a good option for a secluded seaside vacation.  Good location, beautiful landscapes and endless beaches - this is the hallmark of the complex.  The hotel makes the most pleasant experience, as evidenced by the many positive reviews of tourists.  The only drawback that vacationers often mention is the incredible number of Chinese.  Daily guests from the Middle Kingdom are brought to the island for a one-day vacation.  Sometimes they behave quite noisily, which causes dissatisfaction with the guests of the Merperle Hon Tam Resort 5 * hotel, whose reviews are confirmation of this.  Although it is worth noting that a separate beach is allocated for Chinese tourists. </p><p>  The rest of the vacationers on the island is not overshadowed by anything.  Experienced tourists recommend that you diversify your holiday by visiting sightseeing trips.  It‚Äôs better to buy them at any Nha Trang agency, as the cost of tours at the hotel is higher.  Sightseeing trips involve a very early departure from the island, but boats at this time still do not go.  However, this moment is easily decided by the reception staff.  They provide one boat for all tourists traveling to the coast. </p><h2>  Quality of service </h2><p>  I would like to pay special attention to the quality of service at Merperle Hon Tam Resort.  Reviews of tourists are full of gratitude and admiration for a Russian-speaking girl named Albina, who works at the reception of the institution.  According to the guests, it is she who is the face of the hotel for Russian tourists, as it helps to solve all issues, from the settlement to the excursion trips.  You can contact her for any question, and she will never refuse you.  No matter how good the knowledge of English, it is very difficult to understand the speech of the local population with a strong accent.  Therefore, the presence of a Russian-speaking representative greatly facilitates the life of tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vietnam hotel merperle hon tam resort" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1717582.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In general, the entire hotel staff is friendly and good-natured, but only one person has earned numerous positive reviews. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  If you once rested in a resort such as Nha Trang, Merperle Hon Tam Resort can pleasantly surprise you with its stunningly beautiful territory and its close location to the coast.  City hotels of Nha Trang, as a rule, have a small territory and are not always located by the sea.  Noise and vanity are the eternal companions of the city.  A completely different matter is rest on Hon Tam Island.  Here, surrounded by the sea and nature, you can relax from the problems and immerse yourself in the idle contemplation of stunning landscapes. </p><p>  The endless sandy beaches of the island are much cleaner than on the continent.  Moreover, the hotel employees clean it daily.  An important advantage of the island is the complete absence of waves.  Here the sea is always calm and clean, and therefore you can swim at any time.  It is especially convenient here to relax with children.  Despite the number of tourists staying at the hotel, the beach is always sparsely populated, which is why rest on it is comfortable and pleasant. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  If you have chosen the Merperle Hon Tam Resort hotel in Nha Trang, then it will not hurt you to familiarize yourself with the resort in advance.  Hon Tam Island is just 4 kilometers from the coast.  It is not difficult to get here, since bots ply on a strict schedule.  The island has the best conditions for relaxing on snow-white beaches.  Many tourists vacationing in Nha Trang come here to go diving. </p><p>  Despite the fact that rest on the island is calm, even here tourists can find suitable entertainment for themselves.  It offers parasailing and paragliding, the most courageous ones can try their hand at mountain climbing, as well as go windsurfing, diving, ride a motorcycle or ski. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="merperle hon tam resort vietnam reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1717583.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Guests can enjoy a visit to the ethnic village.  Her visit will allow you to get acquainted with the culture and customs of the people.  The village was recreated in full accordance with the traditions that local residents adhered to when building their dwellings.  Here you can look at the elements of household utensils, clothes and musical instruments.  Numerous shops are located near the village, offering tourists to buy traditional Vietnamese souvenirs. </p><p>  However, experienced vacationers recommend not limited to viewing only the village, but are advised to go to the mainland in order to be able to see the most interesting places of the resort. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  The main attraction of Nha Trang can be considered the towers of Nagar.  Buddhist temples are well preserved to this day, despite the fact that they are more than a thousand years old.  Once the towers were part of a large temple complex, which was built in 7-12 centuries BC.  e.  The Vietnamese endow this place with special spiritual strength.  It is for this reason that Buddhist ceremonies and other ritual ceremonies are held here. </p><p>  Numerous tourists come to Nha Trang not only in search of a beach holiday, but also for recovery.  On the outskirts of the resort is the famous Thap Ba mud bath.  The wellness center has a stunningly beautiful area, surrounded by flowers and tropical vegetation.  Here visitors can plunge into the waters of the mineral spring, swim in the pools, plunge into the healing mud baths.  After all the wellness treatments, visitors have the opportunity to enjoy delicious dishes of European and Vietnamese cuisines.  There are shops in the center where you can buy not only souvenirs, but also dirt and local cosmetics. </p><p>  The most popular among tourists is the amusement park "Winperl", located on the island of Hong Che.  The huge tourist complex includes a chain of hotels, restaurants, shopping centers, spas and all kinds of entertainment.  Winperl is the largest and best entertainment center in Vietnam, which has no analogues in the country.  Tourists who visited the island are waiting for all sorts of entertainment.  The vast territory of the park is divided into zones.  There is a water park, an amphitheater, a shopping center, an amusement park, a playground and much more.  In addition, guests of the island can visit several cinemas, karaoke, children's attractions. </p><p>  One of the most interesting places in the resort can be considered Monkey Island, located 20 kilometers from Nha Trang.  Currently, about 1,500 monkeys live on it.  It will be interesting not only to children, but also adults to see these cute animals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel merperle hon tam resort" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1717586.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Institute of Oceanography is one of those places worth showing to children.  Under the roof of the institution currently is not only an oceanographic research center, but also a large aquarium, as well as a huge skeleton of a real whale.  The institute began to work in 1922, during its activities in the study of the South China Sea and other seas and oceans, a large collection of exhibits was collected, which became the basis for the creation of the aquarium.  Back in 2005, the research center received the status of a cultural and historical landmark, so now it is open for tourists. </p><p>  No less interesting for visitors is the Chi Nguyen Aquarium.  Locals call it Neptune's Palace.  This establishment owes its appearance to one local fisherman, who treated him with an unlimited love of nature.  He decided to independently create a maritime museum.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is noteworthy that almost all the money spent on the construction and opening of the institution was his own means. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the help of builders, a large pond was created for marine inhabitants. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Currently, guests from different countries visit the aquarium to see the results of many years of work of an amazing person who devoted his dream to many years.</font></font></p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  ,         ,          .
