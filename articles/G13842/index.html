    <p>  The price of this device is very low, about 10,000 rubles, but such a low cost entails the absence of some functions, such as automatic document feeding when copying, the inability to connect the device to a computer network. </p><h2>  Device Options </h2><p>  Canon has made this printer model cheap enough, but the equipment is poor.  The consumer in the box will be able to detect not only the printer itself, but also the drivers and instructions.  The manufacturer is struggling to preserve the environment, so it will not be possible to find instructions printed on paper here, in this case it is in electronic form, on a CD. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="laser mfp canon 3010" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2117778.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Note!  The kit also lacks a USB cable for connecting the printer.  Therefore, if it is not available, then you should immediately purchase it at a point of sale where the purchase of a multifunctional device is made. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The Canon 3010 Laser MFP is manufactured in a new form factor, so it has a reduced size and takes up much less space on the table.  Device Dimensions: </p><ul><li>  width - 37 cm; </li><li>  depth - 27.5 cm; </li><li>  height - 25 cm. </li></ul><p>  The small size is achieved thanks to the folding paper exit and feed tray.  Along with the reduced dimensions, the characteristics of the Canon 3010 MFPs indicate its fairly light weight, which is only 7.7 kg, so that transferring the device from one place to another will not be difficult. </p><p>  As for the control panel, you need to get used to it.  It is simple and intuitive, but first you need to read the instructions and deal with the meaning of the characters, because there are no letters on any button.  The printed manual is not in the box, so you should use the electronic manual where you can find out the meaning of all the symbols on the control panel. </p><p>  This model does not have impressive features, the copy function is limited to only 29 sheets at a time.  The scanner also leaves much to be desired, because its resolution is only 600x600 pixels.  Compared with other laser printers of the same category, the scanner resolution is usually twice as large, and the copy function is limited to 99 sheets.  But it is worth considering the factor that, on average, such models have a higher price than this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="laser mfp canon 3010" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2117781.jpg"></div>

There is no automatic feed system (ADF), and there is no possibility of two-sided printing.  Another technical feature is the ability to connect the device to only one computer. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Despite the fairly large number of disadvantages of this model, there are also very positive aspects.  Canon 3010 is compatible with almost all computers, it is freely installed on modern versions of Windows, as well as on the Mac operating system.  Installation of the Canon 3010 MFP is quite simple and does not take much time from the consumer.  Simplicity also lies in the fact that a person does not need to fill out data for wireless access. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="printer mfp canon 3010" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2117775.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Also, if desired, the consumer can install two additional programs that simplify the work with the device a little: MF Toolbox and Presto PageManager.  The first program is intended for those who actively use the functions of scanning and copying.  Thanks to the MF Toolbox, the consumer has the opportunity to change the permissions of the scanned document, and you can also change the file type. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Presto PageManager is needed for those who are actively working with documents that need text recognition.  It is worth noting that the program only works on the Windows operating system. </p><h2>  Driver installation </h2><p>  The device comes with a CD that contains the necessary drivers.  There are files that are designed for Windows and Mac operating systems. </p><p>  When you connect the MFP to a computer, the system automatically prompts you to install drivers, at which time the disk should be in the computer.  By clicking the appropriate buttons, installation is completed within a few minutes, and the printer will be ready for use. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The Canon 3010 MFP is a standard printer that does not have an impressive print speed, but it is not an outsider in this setting.  <span>The print speed</span> is 18 pages per minute, with the first printing takes almost 8 seconds.  These parameters are very standard, and if there is no need to print very large volumes daily, then the model is quite good. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon 3010 MFP Features" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2117776.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For comparison, the fastest printer in this category is the Oki 431, with a print speed of almost 34 pages per minute.  In this case, 3010 is significantly behind in this indicator.  If you compare this model with the MFP Lexmark E460, then Canon produces 10 pages per minute more.  Therefore, focusing on other printers, we can safely say that this model is quite suitable for home printing, and it can also be safely used in places where it will not be loaded for a whole day. </p><h2>  Warranty service </h2><p>  By purchasing the products of this company, the consumer can be sure that within 1 year from the date of purchase, if necessary, the device will be repaired for free in an official service center.  However, so that warranty repairs can be carried out free of charge, the buyer must not disassemble and repair the product on his own.  Also, warranty repairs cannot be performed if the failure was committed through the fault of the owner of the printer. </p><h2>  How to refill the cartridge for Canon 3010 MFP? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cartridge for mfp canon 3010" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2117771.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Before refilling cartridges, you should pay special attention to the fact that those purchased have a bunker twice as many as those sold with the multifunction device.  This part should always be considered when backfilling toner.  So, to refill the cartridge, a person will have to follow the following steps exactly: </p><ol><li>  Take a regular Phillips screwdriver and unscrew the screw that is located on the side of the cartridge. </li><li>  Remove the side cover.  Please note that there is a small spring on it, which bounces when removed, so you should be careful not to lose it. </li><li>  Move one part of the cartridge relative to the other and split the cartridge in half. </li><li>  Next, take out the drum unit.  Do this procedure with extreme caution so as not to scratch the work surface.  If the drum unit is already worn out, you should purchase a new one.  The following drum units are suitable for this printer model: P1005, P1006, P1505. </li><li>  Take out the charge roller. </li><li>  Using a Phillips screwdriver, unscrew two more screws and remove the cleaning blade.  It is recommended to wipe it and the roller with a lint-free cloth. </li><li>  Remove waste toner from the hopper. </li><li>  Loosen the screw on the other side and remove the cover. </li><li>  Remove two more screws and remove the metering blade. </li><li>  Fill toner.  If the cartridge was purchased separately, then 85 grams of the coloring matter should be poured, but if the starting cartridge is still in the MFP, then the toner should be filled not more than 65 grams, but not less than 50 grams. </li><li>  Cartridge assembly.  All of the above steps should be performed in reverse order. </li></ol><p>  The process of refueling this multifunctional device is quite complicated and requires certain skills and knowledge.  Therefore, if you are not confident in yourself, it is better not to take risks and turn to specialists for help.  In this case, the cartridge refill will be fast and high-quality, and all printer parts important for life will be undamaged. </p><h2>  Canon 3010 MFP: customer reviews </h2><p>  People who have purchased this printer model generally leave positive feedback about the model.  On average, 4 points out of 5 possible are put - this indicates that the model is of very high quality for this price category. </p><p>  Users of the device note that print quality is very high and fast (as for home use).  Negative reviews are extremely rare, where any damage is reported.  From this we can conclude that the 3010 is a pretty good model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canon 3010 mfp reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2117774.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is also noted that the photocopy mode is better than the scanning mode.  Typically, users use the scanner only when there is a need to translate documents into electronic form. </p><p>  People speak negatively about the control panel, at first it is quite difficult for them to figure out what this or that button is responsible for.  Also, the device gives out rather low quality drawings, there are no complaints about printing the text. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If we summarize all of the above, we can draw certain conclusions.  Firstly, this MFP model is one of the cheapest in its segment, which is a definite plus.  Secondly, the printer takes up very little space on the desktop and is ideally suited for normal home use in technical parameters. </p><p>  All the main parameters are average, the device does not have frankly weaknesses, but it is not in any way the best either.  Canon 3010 - a very good budget model for a multifunctional device designed for home use. </p>
