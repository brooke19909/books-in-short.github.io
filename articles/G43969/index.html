But quite a long time ago this man was rehabilitated and his activities earned respect from grateful descendants.  Today, the great politician Alikhan Bukeikhanov, whose anniversary is celebrated in 2016, is one of the national heroes of the Republic of Kazakhstan.  After all, he laid his whole life on the altar of independence of this Central Asian country. </p><p>  He is an active <span>public figure, a</span> brilliant politician, a brilliant publicist, a talented researcher and a patriot with a capital letter ... And also an ethnographer, agronomist, economist, lawyer, literary critic - and this is not a complete list of all his roles.  Not much of the history of Kazakhstan knows personalities of this magnitude! </p><p>  Today, his biography and life activities are studied in Kazakhstani schools.  In this country, he is considered a national hero.  For this reason, in Kazakhstan textbooks, a lot of pages are devoted to the history of his personality.  So, let's move on to the biography of this great man in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alikhan Bukeikhanov" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1240852.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Childhood and youth Bukeikhanova </h2><p>  Childhood and youth of the future leader of the nation took place in the remote aul No. 7 of the Tokraun volost of the Karkaraly district of the Semipalatinsk region (now it is the Aktogai district of the Karaganda region).  It was there that Bukeikhanov Alikhan Nurmukhamedovich was born on March 5, 1866, becoming the firstborn of his father and mother. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  His family belonged to the descendants of the Kazakh sultans of the Torah, and Alikhan's father wore the title of Genghiside with pride.  True, on the wealth of the Bukeikhanovs, an elegant pedigree was not particularly reflected.  The family hardly found the money for the most necessary. </p><p>  Wanting to provide their son with a reliable piece of bread, Alikhan's parents gave it after graduating from the madrassah to the Karkaraly vocational school.  But a capable and wayward boy considered the quality of education unsatisfactory here and arbitrarily transferred to a Russian-Kazakh school.  At that time, young Bukeikhanov was only nine years old. </p><p>  The release came in the nineties of the nineteenth century, when the construction of the Siberian Railway was in full swing and lower technical workers were in demand.  They were prepared by the Omsk Technical School, the student of which was the heir to Genghis Khan. </p><p>  But he was not destined to work as a railwayman.  A talented young man goes further and receives the profession of an economist at the St. Petersburg Imperial Forest Institute.  In parallel, he mastered jurisprudence at the university (also St. Petersburg).  Having passed the final exams, Alikhan Bukeikhanov begins his adult life as a brilliantly educated young man - professionally savvy, knowledgeable in modern realities, knowing nine foreign languages.  Even then it was clear that this young man had a great and brilliant future. </p><h2>  Research activity </h2><p>  Throughout his life, Alikhan Bukeikhanov managed to take part in four research expeditions, write fifty serious scientific works and more than a thousand notes and various articles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A multifaceted, unexplored world beckons him, and, first teaching mathematics at an agricultural technical school, and then serving as an official at the Omsk Technical School, he continues to discover something new and engage in self-education.  And above all, Bukeikhanova was always interested in the history of Kazakhstan. </p><p>  The first of four expeditions for him was Tobolsk, during which the issue of the resettlement of Russians on Kazakh land was studied.  This was immediately after graduating from the Forest Institute - in 1894.  And eight years later, the study of the Steppe Territory began - and again the immigrants were in the spotlight.  By order of the government that organized the event, scientists were supposed to identify free land suitable for new relocations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prime Minister of Kazakhstan" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1240845.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  But the young patriot used his knowledge in his own way.  Everything that he saw and heard during the expeditions later became the basis for his scientific and journalistic works, in which the author showed and proved the disadvantaged position of the Kazakhs in their native land as a result of a purposeful resettlement policy of tsarism.  This state of affairs could not leave indifferent Bukeikhanov.  He ‚Äúhurt‚Äù him and fought with him until the end of his life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition to socio-historical research, the future Prime Minister of Kazakhstan was also involved in economics, local history, agriculture, animal husbandry, etc. </p><p>  Of great interest, for example, is his work on sheep husbandry in the Steppe Territory, with invaluable recommendations for breeding these animals: where and which breeds take root better than to feed, how to care, etc. </p><h2>  Abay: acquaintance with the work of the poet </h2><p>  The information that Alikhan Bukeikhanov received while traveling through his native Kazakh land became basic when working on the eighteenth volume of the meeting ‚ÄúRussia.  Full geographical description of our region. ‚Äù  It is easy to guess that this volume was dedicated to Kazakhstan, and Bukeikhanov was one of the authors.  In his section, he spoke about the culture, way of life, mentality and ethnographic composition of the Kazakh people, actively using both folklore and author‚Äôs creativity, in particular poetry, as illustrations.  Alikhan Bukeikhanov was very interested in the poetry of his contemporary - Abay, whose poem "Kozy-Korpesh and Bayan Sulu" he analyzed in his scientific work. </p><p>  In the eyes of the researcher, Abay was one of the best representatives of the new Kazakh intelligentsia, advocating for the independence of Kazakhstan.  And Bukeikhanov tries in every possible way to emphasize his spiritual kinship with this great <span>Kazakh poet.</span> </p><p>  It should be noted that he further ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù Abay and his work to a wide circle of readers, becoming the first biographer and preparing for publication a book of the poet‚Äôs works.  But the publication of the collected works was prevented by the arrest of Bukeikhanov, which occurred in 1905. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alikhan Bukeikhanov led the party" class="if" height="261" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1240850.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <h2>  Active public figure </h2><p>  According to information provided to us by the official biography, Alikhan Bukeikhanov from an early age has been an active public figure.  His figure became especially noticeable by 1893, when a descendant of Genghis Khan, a member of various circles (from literary to economic), took part in mass riots organized by students.  It was then that the police paid attention to Bukeikhanov for the first time, and he fell into the list of people considered to be "politically unreliable." </p><p>  The young patriot joins the national liberation movement of the Steppe Territory and eventually becomes its leader.  This is largely due to the brilliant oratory ability of Bukeikhanov.  Some contemporaries who had the good fortune to attend his speeches compared them to the speeches of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin himself and said that they were almost as good as expressive and convincing. </p><h2>  Beginning of a brilliant political career </h2><p>  Naturally, such a person had a direct road to politics.  And on this road he walked confidently.  In 1905, Alikhan Bukeikhanov became a member of the Constitutional Democratic <span>Party (Cadets)</span> and dreams of creating a local (Kazakh) branch.  On this occasion, holds a meeting in the cities of Uralsk and Semipalatinsk.  In the same year he was elected to the First State Duma of the Russian Empire. </p><p>  But Bukeikhanov did not manage to represent the interests of the Kazakhs at the highest state level, since the Duma was dissolved almost immediately after the election.  Time began rebellious, unstable - Russia was shaking seriously.  The deputies tried to defend their rights by issuing a Vyborg manifesto demanding to cancel the dissolution of the Tsar‚Äôs Duma, but their efforts were unsuccessful.  Under the message was the name of Alikhan Bukeikhanov. </p><p>  As mentioned above, in 1905, a novice politician closely monitored by gendarmes was arrested for the first time.  He was accused of calls for <span>civil disobedience.</span>  The second arrest occurred in 1908, and this time he could not get off with a slight startle.  <span>The</span> authorities considered Alikhan Bukeikhanov, who opposed the aggressive colonial policy of tsarist Russia, to be incompatible with freedom and exiled the activist to exile Samara, where he lived until 1917, in which great changes took place in the country.  This year Russia has become different.  1917 gave Bukeikhanov hope that his people could finally become independent. </p><p>  The biographers of Bukeikhanov consider him a good example for modern politicians.  He proved his crystal honesty and decency repeatedly, until his very last breath, remaining faithful to his native land and its people.  This man was one of those who goes into politics not for personal gain, but in the name of public well-being. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alikhan bukeikhanov book exhibition" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1240846.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Brilliant journalist </h2><p>  Journalistic and journalistic activity is a special, very important layer in the legacy of Alikhan Bukeikhanov.  Understanding perfectly that the word is the best weapon, he tried to use it maximally and effectively. </p><p>  In the period from 1905 to 1907, Bukeikhanov worked as an editor in the party newspapers of the cadets Golos, Omich, and Irtysh.  He writes scientific articles for the ‚ÄúNew Encyclopedic Dictionary‚Äù.  And since 1910, it has been closely cooperating with the first Kazakh-language magazine ‚ÄúAikap‚Äù, which covers the <span>political life of the</span> region, raises the problems of education, medicine, science, literature, the agricultural sector and much, much more.  All that was on the lips of the advanced Kazakh intelligentsia of that time. </p><p>  The Kazakh newspaper, which Bukeikhanov publishes along with other active public figures and journalists Dulatov and Baitursynov, became a real light in the matter of awakening national self-consciousness.  The contribution of this trio to the development of democratic and patriotic processes in Kazakhstan is difficult to overestimate. </p><p>  By the way, Alikhan Bukeikhanov published most of his materials in ‚ÄúKazakh‚Äù under the pseudonym ‚ÄúSon of the steppes‚Äù (‚ÄúKir balasy‚Äù). </p><h2>  Freemasonry </h2><p>  There is information that for some period Bukeikhanov collaborated with Masons.  His surname was found in the memoirs of Kerensky, who headed the Little Bear‚Äôs Masonic Lodge in St. Petersburg. </p><p>  The reliability of this information is also indicated by the fact that the creation of the Samara group of Freemasons happened exactly after the meeting between Kerensky and Bukeikhanov.  In addition, it is known that among the participants in this movement there were most of all the cadets to which the hero of this article belonged. </p><p>  In the masons, the descendant of Genghis Khan saw primarily allies.  He explained his friendship with them with hopes of helping to provide autonomy to the Kazakhs.  In the seventeenth year, he was even appointed head of the Provisional Government of Kazakhstan, but soon after this the Masons and Alikhan Bukeikhanov parted ways, since the latter realized that he would not wait for support in his aspirations from the organization.  How not to wait for her from the Cadets.  With them in the seventeenth year, he said goodbye too. </p><h2>  Alash party: a new round of political career </h2>

    <p>  The disappointments that befell Bukeikhanov did not break his spirit.  After the revolution of the seventeenth year, a politician does not fold his arms, but, on the contrary, spreads his wings.  Together with his comrades-in-arms who appeared during the creation of the Kazakh newspaper, he organizes a new, absolutely independent political force, Alash-Orda (alash is the common name of all nationalities, which eventually became known as Kazakhs). </p><p>  This event was of great historical significance and in many respects determined the fate of today's modern Kazakhstan.  The Alash party united the true patriots of the republic at the beginning of the twentieth century, and its ideology was based on the desire to achieve independence of Kazakhstan as part of a democratic Russia.  Almost a whole color of the Kazakh intelligentsia of that time was part of a powerful new organization. </p><p>  Alikhan Bukeikhanov led the party since its inception.  During the functioning of the political force, she held several congresses, at one of which in 1918 an unprecedented event occurred - the first independent state of the Kazakhs was declared.  And the creator of the Alash party received the highest position - the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan! </p><p>  Meanwhile, the Civil War in Russia flared up more and more.  The country was swept by real chaos.  At first, the Alash-Ordinians fought with the Bolsheviks on the side of the whites.  But when the Soviets won, they had to come to terms with ideological opponents about peace and cooperation.  The main condition for "friendship", of course, was the preservation of the independence of the newborn state.  It was approved by the Reds, but only on paper.  In fact, since the conclusion of the contract, the independent republic of Kazakhstan has ceased to exist. </p><p>  Thus, for a short while Alikhan Bukeikhanov led the Alash party, which was his last achievement in the political arena.  With the advent of Soviet power, the proud Kazakh considered it necessary to abandon state activity in all its manifestations. </p><h2>  Repression and the death of Bukeikhanov </h2><p>  Despite Bukeikhanov's departure from politics, the young Soviet government saw him as a dangerous enemy.  He interfered with the new young Soviet system, as he did not share the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcommunism.  They played with him like a cat with a mouse, then arresting, then letting go. </p><p>  It was very important to exclude the influence of the creator of the Alash-Orda party on fellow countrymen, therefore in the twenty-second year he was forcibly transferred to Moscow, where he is engaged in science, literature, and ethnography;  teaches at the university.  For some period, Alikhan Bukeikhanov was allowed to ‚Äúleave‚Äù only in Leningrad - there he was also waiting for teaching work.  But most of the fifteen-year ‚Äúexile‚Äù took place in the capital of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  The ‚Äúprisoner‚Äù Kazakh quietly and modestly ponders over scientific works, collects folklore, studies history (while secretly maintaining contact with compatriots and directing the underground national liberation movement in the right direction).  From the side, his behavior looked completely harmless. </p><p>  But in the thirty-seventh year they ‚Äúmowed‚Äù not those ... Naturally, the former national leader did not leave Stalin's reprisal.  In the seventy-second year of his life, Alikhan Bukeikhanov was arrested, accused of terrorism, and sentenced to death on September 27, 1937.  Nobody began to pay attention to the advanced age of the Kazakh patriot.  The sentence was executed on the same day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alikhan bukeikhanov family" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1241439.jpg" width="386"></div>

    <h2>  Alikhan Bukeikhanov: family and personal life </h2><p>  Not much is known about the personal life of the largest political figure in Kazakhstan at the beginning of the twentieth century.  But even the information that is there is enough to understand that it was not cloudless. </p><p>  In 1901, Bukeikhanov married Elena Sevastyanova, who was the daughter of journalist Yakov Sevastyanov, with whom Alikhan Nurmukhamedovich worked in the publication Stepnoy Kray.  Already in 1902, the spouses gave birth to a daughter, Kanipa (officially Elizabeth).  And eight years later, in 1910, the heir appears in the family - the son of Oktay (officially - Sergey). </p><p>  In the eighteenth year, Elena Bukeikhanova suddenly dies and leaves her husband with two children in her arms.  But Alikhan turned out to be a good educator and raised decent people.  Both followed in the footsteps of their father and became scientists.  The grandson (son of Elizabeth) died on the battlefield during World War II.  The second time the Kazakh patriot did not marry.  And until the end of his days he remained faithful to his beloved beloved wife. </p><p> It is noteworthy that none of the relatives of Alikhan Bukeikhanov began to "mask".  The heirs of the Kazakh sultans proudly bore their name, despite the danger that it was fraught with.  And when, after rehabilitation, one of Bukeikhanov‚Äôs nephews received a ‚Äúdeath sentence‚Äù in the archive, tears flowed down his face, and his soul was filled with pride for his great relative. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  But not only relatives and friends keep the memory of the great Kazakh named Alikhan Bukeikhanov.  150 years since his birth this year is celebrated under the auspices of UNESCO!  Only a few bother with such recognition ... </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alikhan Bukeikhanov 150 years" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14449/1241533.jpg"></div>
