    <p>  The hotel is located in the Costa Brava resort north of Barcelona.  This place is remote from resort life, therefore it is suitable for those tourists who are tired of the hustle and bustle of everyday life.  Hotel Golden Sand Hotel 3 * (Spain) is quite clean, bright, and can offer good service.  This is a city-style hotel, located on the third coastline, 10-15 minutes from the sea in a calm step. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  So, Golden Sand Hotel 3 * (Spain) is located in one of the small towns of the Costa Brava resort, namely Lloret da Mar.  Tourists will appreciate the good location: near the sea and the historical center of the resort town. </p><p>  Just 3-5 minutes from the hotel there is a bus station from where you can reach the center of spa life - the city of Barcelona.  Even the most passive vacationers, preferring exclusively beach vacations, are unlikely to abandon the splendor of this luxurious European city.  Moreover, you do not have to spend a lot of time on the road. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  So, the hotel is represented by small but bright rooms.  The furniture is old, but quite solid, high-quality and comfortable.  It is not so much, but enough for a comfortable stay.  It offers tourists beds, a chair in the room and two chairs on the balcony, a pedestal and a small table.  There is no closet for clothes, so things will have to be stored in a suitcase. </p>

    <p>  All tourists can count on air conditioning, satellite TV and a private bathroom.  Air conditioning and TV are controlled by remote controllers, which can be obtained only for an additional fee at the reception.  The technique works properly, does not cause any complaints.  Unfortunately, you will not find a refrigerator in the room.  And this is a rather significant drawback.  While relaxing in Spain, it is simply impossible not to buy a bottle of local wine, fresh fruit, but there is nowhere to store it.  Rooms cannot boast of good insulation.  This is another drawback.  If you come across noisy neighbors, relaxation can turn into a real disaster.  Tourists also did not notice problems and interruptions in the supply of hot water.  Plumbing is old, but solid. </p><p>  If we talk about the decor of the rooms, then it is quite comfortable.  There is a complete feeling that real experts worked on the arrangement of the interior. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  All vacationers are waiting for a very small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Golden Sand Hotel 3 * (Spain).  Photos of tourists only confirm this.  There is a small pool with sunbeds and umbrellas.  Admittedly, almost never anyone bathes here.  Agree, why do we need a swimming pool, all the more so very small, when the gorgeous sea is 300 meters away. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Let's evaluate the level of service provided by Golden Sand Hotel 3 * (Spain).  Reviews of tourists note the lack of Internet in the rooms.  Yes, for a modern traveler and an active user of the World Wide Web this is a significant drawback.  But in all public areas of the hotel you can connect to wireless high-speed Internet, so you will definitely not be left without a connection.  The signal level can hardly be called high-quality, but in order to check e-mail and exchange with friends and close messages and photos via social networks, it is enough. </p>

    <p>  The rooms are cleaned daily, cleaning is quite high-quality: bath towels are changed, dust is wiped on furniture, floors are washed, plumbing is cleaned.  And all this is a modest Golden Sand Hotel 3 * hotel (Spain).  Reviews of tourists emphasize that cleaning is carried out during their absence, which is very convenient.  Upon returning to your room, you feel clean and fresh. </p><p>  The hotel staff is polite and helpful.  Yes, many of the employees do not speak English well, but they are always ready to help tourists and vacationers.  Airport shuttle services are available at an extra charge.  Here, at the reception, you can get acquainted with a rich excursion program of the resort.  Tourists note that prices for many excursions are more affordable than those offered by most tour operators working in Spain. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Golden Sand Hotel 3 * (Spain, Lloret de Mar) offers meals in its own restaurant.  Tourists themselves decide what it will be: breakfast, half board or full board.  Breakfast is quite modest, not impressive in its variety: several types of sausage and cheese, scrambled eggs, eggs, toast with jam and drinks to choose from.  For lunch and dinner, chicken broth, several types of meat, rice, spaghetti, and some pastries are served.  Not enough vegetables, fresh fruits.  Therefore, if you like a tasty meal and, in principle, want to appreciate the local Mediterranean cuisine, its flavor, it is better to refuse food at the hotel and eat at local restaurants and cafes. </p><p>  Prices in cafes are not the most affordable, do not forget that this is Spain.  Lunch for two people on average will cost 30-40 euros.  Of course, when ordering wine, the cost increases. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  You will have to walk to the beach: 10-15 minutes - and you are on a beautiful sandy coast with crystal clear sea water.  Lovers of wild beach vacations will definitely like it here.  It is worth taking a walk along the coast, as you will surely find rocky beaches surrounded by stunning nature, where there is no one: only you and the sea.  If you prefer a more civilized vacation, feel free to go to the municipal beach with a developed infrastructure.  Here you can rent sports and water activities, have a bite to eat at the cafe and enjoy water sports. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  If you are looking for an inexpensive, but at the same time comfortable place for your summer holidays in Spain, Golden Sand Hotel 3 * (Spain) will be a good option.  Of course, it certainly will not suit the demanding, demanding natures who expect a 3 * hotel of excellent service and highest comfort from a hotel.  In general, it is quite clean, comfortable.  Vacationers and tourists can arrange an entertainment program on their own. </p><p>  That is why we recommend that you take a closer look at this option. </p>
