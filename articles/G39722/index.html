    <h2>  Photographer biography: youth </h2><p>  Steve McCurry was born in 1950 in Philadelphia.  He was seriously interested in photography in his youth, while studying at the Department of Cinematography at the University of Pennsylvania.  His photographs in those days were often published in student newspapers. </p><p>  In 1974, after graduation, Steve began working in one of the local newspapers.  To an active young man, life in his hometown seemed boring, as he longed to bring at least some benefit to people.  For this purpose, in 1978, the future celebrity went to India. </p>

    <p>  There he lived in the worst conditions of local hotels.  He often had to risk his health and sometimes even his life.  However, beautiful and successful pictures, in his opinion, compensated for all the hardships and tribulations experienced. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hot Spots </h2><p>  Already in 1979, Steve went to the <span>hot spots of</span> Afghanistan to make photo reports there.  Quite a difficult trip brought good results.  A photograph of an Afghan girl with incredibly piercing green eyes, taken by him in a refugee camp in 1984, was subsequently included in the list of 100 best photographs according to National Geographic.  The famous cover with an incredibly serious adult look of the girl in 2005 entered the TOP ten best for 40 years. </p>

    <p>  In 2002, not without effort, Steve was able to again find the very matured girl named (as it turned out this time) Sharbat Gulu and repeat the pictures already of a woman, a mother of three children, but with the same invariable piercing green eyes. </p><p>  Steve McCurry has received many awards not only in his homeland, but also abroad.  He several times earned the title of best photojournalist of the year.  As a war photographer, he was awarded the <span>Robert Capa</span> Medal <span>.</span> </p><p>  A special place is occupied by the work of McCurry, made in New York on September 11.  Before the attack, he spent the whole month in Asia and returned to America just the day before.  He shot everything that was happening on his camera, while hiding from certain representatives of the authorities.  The pictures of him clearly show the scale of the terrible tragedy. </p><h2>  What the photographer says about his work </h2><p>  The most important thing for Steve is to be very attentive to any person, to be consistent and serious in his intentions.  Only in this case, the picture will be sincere. </p><p>  The photographer loves to closely monitor people.  It seems to him that it is the person‚Äôs face that can tell a lot. </p><p>  American Steve McCurry in his series of works Where We Live ("Where We Live") demonstrates a touching journey through different houses around the world.  First of all, he focuses on the poor and very modest houses and families living in them.  He shows through his works that, despite adverse living conditions, each of the families or individuals is good-natured and touching. </p><p>  According to the master, he does not seek glory where misery and sorrow reign.  He just wants to capture this moment and convey to all people that there is such a life, a life in need and suffering.  He believes that, in general, human existence is incredibly tragic, and during periods of hostilities, all values ‚Äã‚Äãare reassessed.  Success, prosperity and career are in the background.  The main thing is family happiness and health, and the main thing is the desire to survive at all costs. </p>

    <p>  In an interview, McCurry usually says that he has absolutely no sense of being a celebrity.  This is due to the fact that people do not know him, but mostly just pictures. </p><h2>  Steve McCurry in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  The exposition under the name of the famous American photojournalist was represented by more than 80 of his works.  As mentioned above, the most memorable of them is a photo portrait of a girl from Afghanistan.  This picture, unique in its incredible penetration, not leaving any spectator indifferent, was recognized in the most recognizable way. </p>
