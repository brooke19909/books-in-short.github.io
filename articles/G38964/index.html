Recordings made by the camera can be useful in case of penetration and help to find the attacker. </p><h2>  Home Security Systems </h2><p>  Standard home <span>security cameras</span> consist of: </p><ul><li>  Camcorders connected to your home network by cable or wireless. </li><li>  A recorder that records all the recordings on a video capture card or hard drive. </li><li>  A modulator that monitors what is happening through the monitor. </li></ul><p>  The best option is to purchase a ready-made video surveillance kit and install it.  Installation can be done both independently and with the help of specialists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.businessnewsdaily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hidden home security camera" class="if uuid-2618679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2618679.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a home security camera </h2><p>  CCTV systems consist of several components: </p><ul><li>  DVR </li><li>  Cameras. </li><li>  Hard disk for saving video from cameras. </li><li>  A computer. </li><li>  Wires for connecting power and data. </li></ul><p>  After placing the cameras in the room at the required places, they are connected and configured.  Modern camera models are equipped with installation instructions and the necessary special software that facilitates their setup.  Installation of a video surveillance system includes several points: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  The system is connected via the LAN connector. </li><li>  Through the server, one of the installed cameras is connected to the LAN. </li><li>  Software is being installed. </li><li>  After starting, the program automatically finds the camera and gives its IP and MAC address. </li><li>  The resulting IP address is driven into the browser search bar, which opens the camera control panel.  The image is immediately displayed on the monitor. </li><li>  Similarly, the remaining cameras of the video surveillance system are installed. </li></ol><p>  Remote access is configured using the standard software that came with the camera.  The equipment is configured through a WAN interface that supports communication between the server and the receiver.  Setting up a video surveillance camera can be carried out both independently and with the help of specialists who can tell you how to make a video surveillance camera at home. </p><div class="photo" data-original="usa.ioncamera.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="home security camera" class="if uuid-2618681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2618681.jpg"></div><h2>  Myfox Camera BU4001 </h2><p>  Myfox home security camera with an original design and built-in motion sensor is of high quality video recording, has advanced functionality, including the option to control the lens shutter.

The Chinese camcorder Spicam SP009 is offered by the manufacturer for at least 1800 rubles, which is its additional advantage. </p><p>  For a very modest amount, the owner of the camera receives an infrared sensor, a CMOS 1 / 3.6 matrix with a resolution of 1 megapixel.  Video recording, as with other analogs, is carried out at a speed of 25 FPS with an image resolution of 1280 x 720. The design includes a Wi-Fi module that allows you to connect to a mobile device.  For such a budget camera, the presence of a slot for microSD memory cards with a capacity of up to 128 GB and two-way communication with a microphone is a very high indicator and advantage. </p><h2>  Security Camera Zmodo ZM-SH75D001 </h2><p>  The camera with the Zmodo video recording function is a model for those who choose a multifunctional version that is not inferior in performance to expensive analogues. </p><p>  The universal design of the ZM-SH75D001 allows you to mount the camera on a wall or on any other surface.  The cost of the model is 2500 rubles.  The functional and hardware component of the camera allows you to shoot objects located at a distance of up to 10 meters in night mode, which is enough to shoot in large rooms and stairwells. </p><p>  The matrix does not have a fairly high resolution - only 1 megapixel, but the encoding of the recording is carried out using the H.264 codec in a resolution of 1280 x 720. </p><p>  The camera can sync with Windows mobile devices.  Connecting to devices based on iOS and Android is via a Wi-Fi channel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="surveillance camera home wifi" class="if uuid-2619457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2619457.jpg"></div><h2>  Remote video surveillance </h2><p>  Arrangement of remote video surveillance enables remote access to video materials recorded by any devices installed by the owner. </p><p>  The advantage of this method is the protection of the house and the ability to respond quickly in case of penetration. </p><p>  The DVR and other home surveillance cameras are connected to a single IP video surveillance system, which is assigned a specific IP address. </p><p>  The system is controlled by a remote locking device with special software that comes with the camera.  An alternative is to use a regular Internet browser and install IP cameras with a built-in web server.  After installation, the camera connects to the network and receives its individual IP. </p><p>  Installation of such a remote video surveillance system allows you to monitor what is happening at the location of the cameras around the clock.  To view the recording online or archive the video, just dial the required network address of the camera in the browser. </p><p>  Unlike analog systems, remote surveillance cameras will cost many times more, but recently there has been a tendency to lower the cost of such equipment while maintaining its quality and reliability. </p><p>  Installation of home video surveillance cameras will ensure the safety of property and keep calm during a long absence.  With proper installation of all equipment, the correct operation of CCTV cameras is ensured. </p>
