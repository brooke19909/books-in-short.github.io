    <h2>  Briefly about hotels of Greece </h2><p>  Tourists who have been to Turkey more than once know that Greek hotels differ from each other not by starryness, but by category.  A five-star hotel is equal to the Delux category, 4-star - to category A, 3-star - to category B, 2-star - to category C. Hotels B and C are suitable for tourists who prefer an excursion vacation.  They are usually small, comfortable and clean.  Such institutions have everything necessary for a comfortable stay - air conditioning, TV, shower, etc. Every second tourist leaves reviews of hotels in Greece, after reading them, you can easily figure out the categories of hotels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Beach hotels are not inferior in quality to the rest.  On the coast, you can stay both in the luxurious Deluxe Hotel and in a simple category B hotel - a three-ruble note. </p><p>  Having settled in the same hotel with a youth disco, you can expect that in the next one there will certainly be a large restaurant with national cuisine or an aqua park.  More information about the hotels of the most popular resorts in Greece can be found below. </p>

    <h2>  Kos Hotels </h2><p>  As for holidays on the island of Kos, here tourists are forced to choose a hotel from a small number, since there are not so many hotels.  This can be explained by the small territory of the island, so just physically the island cannot have a lot of hotels.  But despite this, there are both inexpensive hotels and fashionable luxury hotels. </p><p>  On the banks isolated from the noisy streets and crowded resorts, there are quiet beach-style hotels for families to relax.  Also, the hotels of the Dodecanese archipelago are happy to shelter couples in love who want to be alone. </p><p>  Guests often leave positive reviews about <span>hotels in Greece (Kos).</span>  Basically, travelers select several hotels and advise others to stay there.  This is the Blue Lagoon hotel complex, which pleases guests with silence, quality service and impeccable service;  Neptune Hotels Resort and Gregotel Kos Imperial Thalasso.  The listed hotels are the best on the whole island.  You can relax on the highest level with due magnificence right there. </p><h2>  Halkidiki Hotels </h2><p>  Halkidiki resort attracts travelers with its unusual geographical position - the peninsula resembles a trident, on each coast of which there are famous cities - Athos, Kassandra, Sithonia. </p><p>  Most often, tourists with children relax here, a calm atmosphere and silence are the main reasons for the popularity of family holidays on the island.  Travelers, leaving reviews of <span>hotels in Greece (Halkidiki),</span> note the fact that almost all hotels are located away from the noisy center - on the coast.  Some tourists were embarrassed by the fact that they had to go to shops and restaurants, but most of the walk along the picturesque and green peninsula brought maximum pleasure. </p><p>  The clear leader in the number of positive reviews is the hotel hotel complex Potidea Palace Bomo Club.  The four-star hotel located in Sithonia welcomes tourists with children with hospitality, as well as large and noisy companies. </p>

    <h2>  Corfu Hotels </h2><p>  "Emerald" island is suitable for an elite and respectable vacation.

Of course, there are more budget options on the island - bungalows and youth camps. </p><p>  Those who do not skimp and are ready to pay a considerable amount of money for their vacation, tourists recommend staying at the Grecotel Corfu Imperial Exclusive Resort, as well as at the Grecotel Eva Palace or the Kontokali Bay Resort &amp; Spa.  Hotel complexes are located on the coast of the <span>Ionian Sea,</span> quiet bays allow you to relax here with the whole family.  Hotel reviews (Greece) Corfu in the absolute majority are also positive. </p><h2>  Mykonos Hotels </h2><p>  Mykonos has always been considered a bohemian vacation spot, so the price tag here is quite high.  The number of hotels on the island is small, so it is better to book a room in a few months.  As for the category, then mainly 4 and 5 star hotels prevail here, but you can find more budget options. </p><h2>  Samos Hotels </h2><p>  <span>Samos Island</span> attracts tourists with its calm and clean beaches and the opportunity to spend your holidays in private.

As for the service, almost all Samos hotels boast a high level of service. </p>

    <h2>  General recommendations for finding the best hotel </h2><p>  The first thing you need to pay attention to when choosing a hotel is the number of hotel stars.  A 4-star hotel is not always worse than a five-star one.  Often the owners of such hotels simply do not pursue status, but the service and entertainment there are on the top five.  Vacationers from Russia should not forget that Greece mainly relies on European tourists, so special attention should be paid to the presence of Russian-speaking staff at the hotel.  It certainly will not work to meet compatriots in Crete hotels - Grecotel Amirandes, Domes of Elounda or Kalimera Kriti.  It is better to book hotels in advance.  Almost all Greek hotels operate on an all-inclusive basis; the optimal range of services can be found at Candia Park Village (Crete), etc. </p><p>  Reviews of tourists about hotels in Greece are different, so before you travel you need to check with the tour operator about the availability of certain services that are most important to you. </p>
