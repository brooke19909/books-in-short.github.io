    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Hotel "Tourist" (Barnaul) collects reviews from guests, for the most part, positive.  The people who stayed at the hotel were very pleased.  But there are those who did not really like staying here.  Let's start with the pros: </p><ul><li>  Attentive, helpful and polite staff.  Even when checking in at night, I am ready to offer my services. </li><li>  Excellent location - in the very center of the city, so you can quickly get to any objects. </li><li>  An interesting and unusual design of rooms that is found in hotels of this level is extremely rare. </li><li>  The rooms are spacious and bright, with a good repair. </li><li>  The rooms have everything you need for a comfortable stay - from slippers to a minibar; </li><li>  Beautiful view from the window, the city, at a glance. </li><li>  Large and beautiful bathrooms in the rooms. </li><li>  Cleaning is done every day, so the rooms are always clean. </li><li>  The system of showers, bathrooms and kitchens is carefully thought out. </li><li>  With a high level of service and room comfort - affordable price. </li><li>  Spacious secure parking for which you do not need to pay extra. </li><li>  Conveniently, the building has many organizations providing a wide range of services - no need to travel far. </li></ul><p>  Hotel "Tourist" (Barnaul) has its negative sides.  Here's how the guests described them: </p><ul><li>  Poor insulation. </li><li>  Bad smell of sewage from the toilet. </li><li>  Lack of curtains on the windows. </li><li>  The inconvenient location of the smoking area is on the 16th floor, which is very difficult to find and then come back to your room. </li><li>  Breakfast is provided only to guests from rooms above economy class. </li><li>  The beds in the rooms are old. </li><li>  If you live in a hotel for a long time, towels and linen change much less frequently. </li><li>  Air conditioning is not working well. </li></ul><p>  So, if you plan to visit the capital of the Altai Territory - the city of Barnaul, it will be difficult to find a more suitable place than the Tourist Hotel.  You will remember the atmosphere of her rooms for a long time, because they have practically no analogues among other <span>hotels in Russia</span> .  Well, a pleasant service, a wide range of services in organizations working nearby, a stunning view from the window and a good location will complement the picture. </p>
