    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo hotel is characterized by some negative aspects.  Reviews indicate such shortcomings and shortcomings: </p><ul><li>  in the rooms of the second category, the toilet is shared by the unit, and the cost is slightly lower than in more comfortable rooms; </li><li>  girls working at the reception are not very polite with guests; </li><li>  there is no shower holder in the bathroom; </li><li>  in spite of the fact that a repair was recently made, a lot managed to break down; </li><li>  not enough tasty and satisfying breakfasts, moreover, they are the same every day; </li><li>  elevators when thundering rattle and ride very slowly; </li><li>  the hotel is far from the metro; </li><li>  old TVs in rooms (the opposite is stated on the official website); </li><li>  the rooms do not have balconies; </li><li>  the hotel is in a constant state of repair, which is why building materials can often be seen in the corridors; </li><li>  there are no grocery stores within walking distance; </li><li>  the carpet in the room is dirty (apparently, they do not vacuum it at all); </li><li>  in the cold season, rooms are poorly heated; </li><li>  there is no hairdryer in the bathroom; </li><li>  even in newly refurbished rooms, wallpapers are peeled off; </li><li>  poor-quality plumbing in the bathroom (everything falls off, leaks, works every other time); </li><li>  breakfasts are not held in the hotel premises, but in the nearby cafeteria, which is especially inconvenient in bad weather; </li><li>  a small parking lot, which is also not guarded; </li><li>  the registration procedure lasts long enough due to paperwork and sluggishness of employees; </li><li>  the refrigerators in the rooms are very noisy; </li><li>  on the upper floors, the internet is practically not working. </li></ul>
