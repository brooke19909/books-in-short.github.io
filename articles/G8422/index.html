    <h2></h2><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  So, the hair for the doll can be from a wide variety of fibers.  Satin ribbons, knitting yarn, floss thread, wool and even old wigs and hairpieces will be used.  Of course, each material has its own working technique, but in any case, this process is very painstaking and requires accuracy.  Only in this case can an excellent result be achieved.  To make hair for the doll, you will need auxiliary materials: glue, thread with a needle, scissors and a lighter.  In work, you can use a gun with silicone sticks or the usual ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù in a tube. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When choosing a material, it is worth considering that for playing dolls you need to choose a simpler material, such as yarn or a chignon, such hair can be combed.  What can not be done with wool and satin ribbons, however, this material is ideal for an <span>interior doll.</span>  For restoration of the doll, both ribbons and floss threads are well suited. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Yarn hair for textile doll </h2><p>  Each craftswoman has her own secrets, but the principle of creating hair at the root is not different.  So, we make the hair of the doll from yarn. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make doll hair" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/345106.jpg?1393589037997" width="489"></div>

    <p>  <em>Method one</em> </p><p>  First, the head of a <span>rag doll</span> must be embroidered with the same threads, from which there will be ponytails or pigtails.  The stitch after stitch fills the entire surface, starting from the extreme line of growth to the crown.  After that, ‚Äúhairs‚Äù are implanted in a checkerboard pattern all over the head about half a centimeter apart. </p><p>  <em>Second way</em> </p><p>  Hair for a doll can be made in another way.  The yarn is cut into segments equal to double the length of the hair, laid in the middle on a strip of paper tightly to each other and stitched on a sewing machine.  After the base is removed, and the stitched locks are attached to the head.  To make a hairstyle for a girl, you will need several such strips with threads that are placed evenly throughout the head.  If you need to update the head of the doll-boy, then one strip with small hairs, which is placed from ear to ear through the crown, will be enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY doll hair" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/345105.jpg?1393589110638" width="260"></div>

Then this peculiar wig is glued with hot glue. </li><li>  The second option is more painstaking, but it looks more aesthetically pleasing.  To begin with, all old hair is pulled out, leaving traces of firmware clean.  The next stage is filling with new strands.  How to sew a doll's hair in the wake of an old hairstyle is not at all difficult to guess.  To do this, the head is removed and, having threaded a strand into a needle, from the front side they enter it into one hole and bring it to the nearby one.  At the same time, the desired length of curls from each point is left.  After all the strands are pulled off, inside the head is poured with glue so that when combing the hairs do not fall out. </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that thin silk or cotton knitting threads are best suited for Barbie. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Satin Ribbon Hair for Rag Doll </h2><p>  This material is one of the most affordable.  And it is from him that it is easy to make interesting curls and curls.  To create such hair, you will need several meters of a wide satin ribbon, which is cut into pieces corresponding to the length of the doll‚Äôs hair.  From one edge, the segments are fused with a lighter, and from the other they dissolve, leaving one centimeter from the edge.  How to curl a doll with satin ribbon hair?  To do this, the loose sections are wound on a pencil like a snail, fixed with thread for sewing, removed from the base and boiled for 5-7 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The next step is sewing or gluing blanks to the base of the head.  How to sew doll hair from satin locks?  Start work from the back of the head, gradually moving towards the temples and the crown. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to curl doll hair" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/345117.jpg?1393589213029" width="384"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Satin ribbons for restoration </h2><p>  If this is a restoration of a plastic doll, then undoing the tape, leave the edge about 0.5 centimeters, and glue the blanks with hot glue.  Curls are glued in a circle of hair growth from the edges to the crown, in the center they close the place of combining the last strand.  It is worth noting once again that such hair for a doll cannot be combed and braided, so it will be rational to make curled curls out of them. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Mouline thread hair for a rag doll </h2><p>  Hair from floss thread looks beautiful on the doll, and it does not matter on which doll, whether it is rag Tilda or standard Barbie.  So, <span>how to make a doll</span> hair from embroidery floss threads?  To create a hairstyle for a textile doll, you need to draw hair growth lines, and then, as in the case of knitting threads, fill the entire contoured surface of the head <span>with embroidery smoothness</span> .  Then, starting from the back of the head, locks of hair are gained.  To do this, a piece of thread equal to the double length of the doll‚Äôs hair is threaded into the needle with a large eye, the needle is dragged into the fabric and displayed at a short distance.  Leaving a suitable length from one edge, the thread is fixed as with ordinary sewing, the free edge remains the same length as the first. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="make hair doll" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/345131.jpg?1393589261135" width="333"></div>
