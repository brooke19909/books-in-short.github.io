  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a lamp for the projector</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the operation of the projector, a lamp is a rather important element.  It is the whole load that falls on it, so quite often the bulb is replaced.  Projector lamps currently vary in size and power.  You need to know which bulb to purchase specifically for the projector.  Often, a breakdown of the equipment may well be a too powerful light bulb.  Undoubtedly, brightness and quality depend on the operation of the lamp.  The lamp for the projector has a special property - not to burn out instantly, but to fade out smoothly, although the fading process itself can continue to infinity. <br>  As a rule, most projectors are configured in 2 modes - it is forced with an increase, where the lamp functionality is reduced by half and optimal with a sufficiently long lamp life.  As a result, the forced mode is considered standard, and the optimal one is an economical mode. <br>  In projectors with a usual sharp shutdown, the need to change the lamp appears after 1000 hours of operation in standard mode and in economic mode after 2000 hours.  In projectors that are configured for smooth shutdown, the timing is accordingly doubled.  Projection lamps, as a rule, are gas discharge - this is an electric discharge, similar to a lightning discharge, is formed in a gaseous medium as a light source.  A modern option is metal halide lamps for projectors, which are distinguished by sufficient efficiency and maximum service life.  Such lamps contain mercury vapors, which significantly increase the power of light radiation and increase the light output.  Their luminescence is uniform and intense and the cost is quite low, which is in great demand in office and home multimedia projects.  Quite often, lamps of this type are supplied by manufacturers with filters, making the image more real and clear.  Today <noindex>  <span>buy a lamp for a projector</span> </noindex>  You can in any online store at a fairly attractive price. <br>  Xenon lamps are considered an excellent option in professional projectors for movie theaters and fairly large halls, in which super bright projections of large sizes are obtained.  The principle of operation of these lamps is a bit similar to metal halide, but instead of mercury vapor, xenon gas is used under pressure.  This type of lamp for projectors has the correct color distribution and high light output.  A huge advantage of these types of lamps is a quick warm-up, after which the highest quality picture is demonstrated. </p></div></article>
