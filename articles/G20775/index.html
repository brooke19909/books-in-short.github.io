  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Era of the earth</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In one of the corners of space many millions of years ago a powerful explosion thundered.  As a result of such a shock, a star that has long been obsolete has become like a huge cloud.  It rotated and destroyed around itself the remains of a red-hot body.  For millions of years, unfamiliar and mysterious forces of nature have attracted particles of the cloud, thus forming a ball.  The new <span>celestial body</span> became denser in its structure and became more and more massive.  Unprecedented pressure in the center of the ball lit a fire that could no longer be extinguished.  This flame enveloped the whole body - this is how the Sun was born.  From the remnants of a dead star, planet balls were formed over time. </p><p>  Before the beginning of the first era of the Earth, the structure of the planet was quite loose and loose, its dimensions were even larger than that of the Sun.  Over time, the ball became denser and began to heat up, but then its surface cooled.  Before space flights became possible, it was impossible to estimate even the approximate <span>age of the Earth,</span> and samples from the Moon, which is considered the same age as our planet, showed that the beginning of the history of its development was laid 4‚Äì4.6 billion years ago.  Famous paleontologists at one time created a special <span>geochronological scale</span> , which, in fact, is a chronicle of the creation and development of life on planet Earth.  This scale was divided into periods and eras of the Earth, the duration of some of them is measured in hundreds of millions of years. </p><p>  ARCHEY.  It was in this era that the evolution of the Earth began.  For two and a half billion years, the planet cooled down and was covered with solid stone crust, there was no oxygen in the atmosphere.  When the temperature reached one hundred degrees Celsius, dense clouds tightened the sky and heavy rain began.  After that, seas and oceans appeared on the surface <span>of the globe</span> , in which life was subsequently born - microscopic cells capable of releasing oxygen. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  PROTEROSE.  The Earth <span>era</span> following <span>Archean</span> is already more closely associated with organic life.  During the Proterozoic, multicellular organisms appear.  Unicellular organisms united, increased in size and formed nuclei and membranes.  There are many different forms of building the structure of living organisms. </p><p>  PALEOZOIC.  During the time of Paleozoic, the active development of land by marine organisms began.  This stage was divided by scientists into additional eras and periods, which makes it possible to study them in more detail. </p><p>  CAMBRIA.  The era is also known as the "skeletal revolution."  And this was not done in vain, because it was at that time that the existing organisms acquired solid skeletons, as well as spikes, "houses" and shells. </p><p>  ORDOVIK.  At this time, reigned beings that were vaguely reminiscent of modern scorpions and <span>poisonous spiders.</span>  Small clams also appeared.  But the most important achievement of this period is the appearance of vertebrates, and specifically chordates. </p><p>  SILUR.  The new period was marked by the modification of fish, the release of algae from the seas to land and the emergence of vegetation on the rocks. </p><p>  DEVONIAN.  Many scholars call this period the "kingdom of fish."  The evolution of terrestrial organisms continued. </p><p>  CARBON.  Dawn of flora and fauna: everything is green, bloomed.  The ancestors of modern conifers appeared.  Insects mastered the air.  Some of them were huge: for example, the wingspan of a dragonfly could reach two meters. </p><p>  PERMIAN.  Perm is an age of all-consuming deserts.  During this period, Pangea was formed. </p><p>  The era of the Earth and their study enables each of us to know the history of the emergence of our unique world, nature, life and the development of all orgasms on the planet.  The history of our planet is the most mysterious of all that exists today, and if you know its laws, you can discover many interesting and unexpected things. </p>
