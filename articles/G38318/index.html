This is a recognized symbol of the great lake, which is sometimes called the "lonely loach".  It separates <span>the Angara River</span> and Lake Baikal. </p><p>  In clear weather, only its tip is visible above the water, which protrudes one and a half meters.  Under the water is a rock mass.  Thanks to him, the Angara does not freeze in winter.  In a huge wormwood, which stretches for almost fifteen kilometers, about fifteen thousand waterfowl nest.  In North Asia, this is the only non-freezing wintering. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shaman stone" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1373493.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  If you go to one of the two sites near the shore, which are located near the Vampilov Stone and Chersky Stone, you can see that the Shaman Stone is a single rock that divides the waters of the Angara into two parts. </p><p>  Geographical location of the stone: the source of the river.  Hangars, half a kilometer from the standard alignment.  Coordinates: 51 ¬∞ 52‚Ä≤18.65 ‚Ä≥ s.  w.  104 ¬∞ 49‚Ä≤14.89 ‚Ä≥ in  This tiny island, remaining here from the Primorsky ridge, which Angara eroded in antiquity, is a very popular place on Lake Baikal.  The shaman stone has a large rock base, which forms a threshold in front of the depths of Lake Baikal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the story of a shaman stone on Baikal" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1373494.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Confirmation of these facts can be found in the works of the German historian G.F. Miller, who described Siberia in the 18th century.  Some researchers suggest that the existing legend about the amazing movement of this stone is a direct confirmation that ancient people could witness some geological disasters occurring on the shores of Lake Baikal.  First of all, this concerns disasters, as a result of which new drains from the lake appeared, and old ones, for example, in the areas of Buguldeyki or Kultuk, were blocked. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Legend </h2><p>  The stone shaman, whose photo you see below, from ancient times aroused the interest of local residents.  Shamans performed mysterious rites here.  Indigenous people believed that Ama Sagan Noyona, the owner of the Angara, lived here.  All this was reflected in numerous legends and legends that the old-timers of these places gladly tell.  Below we will present one of the most beautiful and romantic of them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shaman stone photo" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1373491.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This happened in those ancient times, when valiant heroes and mighty heroes lived in the world.  Baikal was great and rich at that time.  Everyone respected and respected him.  And he had a daughter, whose name was Angara.  Everyone admired the unearthly beauty of the girl.  Baikal loved and indulged its only child.  And Angara, meanwhile, grew proud and wayward. </p><h2>  Irkut </h2><p>  Years passed, and it was time to choose a beautiful husband.  It was in the summer, on the eve of the Surkharban holiday.  The great Baikal summoned warriors from all the surrounding villages to them to measure courage and strength and try to win the heart of his daughter.  Among the applicants was also one who was especially fond of the father of the bride - a handsome athlete Irkut. </p><h2>  Yenisei </h2><p>  But no laudatory words of Baikal addressed to him found a response in the heart of his daughter.  Finally, a holiday came, the heroes came together to measure their strength, and saw among them Angar Yenisei, the son of the mighty Sayan.  He was the strongest, most agile, his valor and courage won the heart of the beauty. </p><p>  But Baikal was not satisfied with the choice of his daughter and did not give his consent to this marriage.  The young had to leave.  Day and night, the father persuaded his darling to marry the strong and courageous Irkut.  However, the daughter remained adamant.  In anger, Baikal imprisoned her, and after some time he said that he had given Irkut consent to the marriage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shaman stone legend" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1373489.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Escape from captivity </h2><p>  And then Angara decided to run away.  She turned for help to her younger brothers - streams, which eroded the prison wall.  The proud Angara broke free.  The angry Baikal demanded that the runaway return.  At that time, a terrible wind rose over the Earth, lightning flashed, thunderclap shook everything around.  In fear, animals and birds sought refuge. </p><p>  Following the Angara, the hero Yenisei rushed.  And at this time, lightning, like a sliver, split an old mountain.  Baikal picked up a fragment of the mountain and threw it after the disobedient daughter to block her path.  But he didn‚Äôt have time - Angara was already near the Yenisei, and he grabbed her into his arms.  Since that time they are inseparable.  All the tears of joy and grief that cried out Baikal, Angara, Yenisei and Irkut, turned into water currents.  And since that time, people have known the fragment of the rock that the angry Baikal threw after his daughter as a Shaman-stone.  Legend has it that if Baikal is very angry, then it will wash off this stone with water and flood the whole world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the story of a shaman stone on Baikal" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1376621.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In order not to anger Lake Baikal, the locals for a long time brought various offerings here, and now they are throwing coins into the water.  Another legend, more precisely, a legend, says that if you look closely at the rock for a long time, you can see the faces of shamans who in the old days held mysterious rites here.  For several years now, the Shaman-stone on Lake Baikal has been destroyed, and local old people see this as a bad sign. </p><p>  This amazing natural monument is not only a witness to the past of the peoples of Lake Baikal.  The stone shaman is a certain mystical component of these places.  If you have the opportunity to visit these places, visit the famous stone, appreciate the beauty of local landscapes, listen to numerous legends.  By the way, today anyone who visits an excursion to Listvyanka can see the legendary rock.  There is an equipped observation deck with excellent views of the stone. </p>
