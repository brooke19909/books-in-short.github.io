    <h2>  The basic basis of being is movement </h2><p>  There is no need to explain that a person cannot just be born, then stop, then continue moving again.  Even if science fiction writers come up with the perfect refrigerator to freeze life, still no process can be stopped.  Life is a movement in any of its contexts.  In addition, movement is common to all objects and things, no matter how long they are in one place or in one position. </p><p>  The principle of continuity accompanies any movement.  He is invisibly present in everything that surrounds our perception.  He acts outside of him and for many billions of years from him. </p>

    <h2>  The exit of the personal into the public </h2><p>  It has long been a custom not to make dirty linen in public, but things are still there.  The majority of mankind cannot independently follow its own path: any society invariably and continuously takes part in everything that belongs to its space and is located outside it.  By the way, this is one of those cases when distances and energy do not matter.  A public thought in general has no idea that overcoming distance requires energy, and speed is actually a very costly and expensive parameter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is precisely for these vital circumstances that the principle of continuity became obvious and was recognized in ancient times as fundamental in resolving relations between subjects of relations in society.  Relations have historically been divided into civil and criminal, although not all laws have always adhered to these two poles.  Administrative, labor, economic and other relations had their legal <span>right to life</span> and their niche. </p>

    <h2>  The principle of continuity in civil proceedings </h2><p>  Any litigation is a costly procedure.  Being free in many cases, in all cases it leads to costs both from the state and from all participants. </p><p>  The principle of continuity is a classic position in jurisprudence in general.  Various laws and legislative acts fixes the obligatory consideration of each case continuously without distraction to other cases. </p><p>  In reality, it does not happen that something does not distract, and even more so, the parties to the process always have their own vision of continuity: interrupting the process is often a method of achieving the desired result.  Legislation regulates this point and obliges to start the hearing of each pending case from the very beginning. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The legal sphere and the logic of lawyers are not characterized by adjective and universal values ‚Äã‚Äãin their constructions and formulations, but in terms of the continuity of the process, it appeals to the concept of ‚Äúcourt attention‚Äù. </p><p>  Attention, perception, thinking are not legal concepts, but in this case their use with the participation of the words ‚Äúdo not be distracted‚Äù, ‚Äúadmits‚Äù, ‚Äúholistic perception‚Äù are just ‚Äúsome exceptions‚Äù.  They testify to unconditional recognition: the principle of continuity is crucial for a comprehensive, complete and objective clarification of all circumstances that are essential for the proper consideration and resolution of the case. </p><h2>  Education and the concept of continuity </h2><p>  You have to learn constantly, every day, every hour, every moment in time.  Even the simple application of accumulated knowledge leads to their improvement and change.  Any close learning process takes noticeable time and requires adequate effort.  Like new knowledge, even though thought and thinking have nothing to do with speed.  For them there are no barriers, distances and friction.  Everything new eclipses the old, as a result of which, in order to return back, it will be necessary, as in the civil process, to start all over again. </p>

    <p>  The principle of continuing education is not a tribute to fashion or tradition, it is the fundamental foundation of any educational process.  In the most critical training programs, the student is placed in clear conditions in which he does not even have the opportunity to distract himself from something. </p><p>  Not only the knowledge that makes up the subject under study, but also the movement must be brought to unconscious automatism.  But even if we are not talking about the training of astronauts, surgeons and teachers, even training in kindergarten, at school, at the institute is calculated on time, and the <span data-mce-mark="1">principle of continuity</span> underlies it. </p><p>  If a quality result is paramount in legal application, then in education this result is strengthened by the fact that a person is growing, and at each stage of his development his learning abilities are very different.  Age and physiology, as well as the objective environment, are laws that are absolutely impossible to ignore.  In any case, it never led to anything good. </p><h2>  Life and work, rest </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Each person always respects the principle of business continuity, but this is not always perceived adequately by others, or rather, often it simply contradicts their plans and ideas about how to live and what to do.</span> </p>
