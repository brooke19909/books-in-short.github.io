How to disable paid services on Beeline</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Beeline regularly develops new options to improve the level of service and create additional savings opportunities, but updates are not always combined with the wishes of users.  In addition to adequate offers, people automatically subscribe to unnecessary entertaining actions for them, and money is debited daily.  There are several rules that allow you to save finances and establish a ban on connecting paid Beeline services. </p><h2>  How to find out what additional services are connected </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mxsmart.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="verification of connected services" class="if uuid-2962886" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35446/2962886.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes users subscribe to paid services, but for this they do not take any actions on their own, the state of the account can unpleasantly disappoint.  If you do not check the balance daily, it may turn out that the monthly replenishment amount was only enough for 2 weeks. </p><p>  To find out if there are any paid options that you did not order, use one of the available methods: </p><ol><li>  In most cases, automatic registration of new services finds itself quickly enough.  Notifications regularly come to the phone that indicate news, entertainment, or advertising.  Pay attention to such messages, sometimes they are not free. </li><li>  If you notice that the money leaves your account faster than before, order details of recent transactions.  To do this, just dial * 110 * 091 # and press the call button. </li><li>  If you have a Beeline card, it means you can use your personal account.  To do this, go to the official website, register or go to your profile, click on the "Service Management" tab.  You will see a list of all connected paid features.  Also in your personal account there is an opportunity to find out the tariff plan updates, the latest changes concerning the user.  To use the options of your personal account, it is enough to have Internet access. </li><li>  You can quickly learn about the appearance of new functions using the mobile application ‚ÄúMy Beeline‚Äù.  Download and open the program, go to the ‚ÄúServices‚Äù tab and check if there are any extra ones. </li><li>  Contact service support at 0611.  The call is free, you can call around the clock. </li></ol><h2>  More complicated ways </h2><p>  Another easy and free way to find out about the availability of paid options is to use the SIM-menu of the phone.  If you have Android, finding it is easy.  It is enough to go to the main menu and find the desired section.  When using the iPhone, you must first go to the phone‚Äôs settings, then click on the appropriate section.  Among the main positions will be SMS-subscriptions with current data. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Go to the Beeline service office, ask the employee to independently check and, if necessary, disable the options you do not need.  The most detailed information can be obtained by dialing * 110 * 09 # to call up the self-management menu for paid options. </p><h2>  How to disable paid Beeline services on a mobile phone </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tariffy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable additional services for Beeline subscribers" class="if uuid-2963022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35446/2963022.jpg"></div><p>  To avoid further spending of money, it is urgent to disable paid subscriptions when they are detected.  There are several ways to quickly deactivate unnecessary options: </p><ol><li>  Call 0684006.  If you dialed it correctly, the answering machine will say that all paid subscriptions are disabled. </li><li>  In most cases, when a new option is connected, the user receives a notification that indicates the name and price, as well as the main commands with which you can manage its status, for example, how to disable a paid service on Beeline.  Sometimes it‚Äôs enough to send an SMS with the short word ‚ÄúSTOP‚Äù to the number indicated in the message in order to forget about the unnecessary service. </li><li>  Log in to your account.  Find the ‚ÄúService Management‚Äù tab, see if you have connected all of the specified options, if necessary, disable the ones you are not going to use. </li><li>  Use the Beeline mobile app.  Go to the tab ‚ÄúYour tariff and options‚Äù, deactivate unnecessary services if available. </li><li>  In the SIM menu you can select, then turn off subscriptions that are activated automatically. </li><li>  By entering * 110 * 09 #, you will receive a complete list of paid subscriptions and the ability to disable any of them. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="tarifam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="disabling unnecessary services" class="if uuid-2962891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35446/2962891.jpg"></div><p>  On the operator‚Äôs official website there is a note on how to disable paid services on Beeline using special commands.

To do this, use one of the following methods. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.credibly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cost control" class="if uuid-2962892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35446/2962892.jpg"></div><h2>  Black and White Lists </h2><p>  You can use this opportunity absolutely free.

If you follow all the steps according to the instructions provided, sending and receiving messages to short numbers will not be possible, which will automatically establish a ban on connecting paid Beeline services. </p><h2>  Separate personal account </h2><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ways to no longer deal with connecting unnecessary options" class="if uuid-2962820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35446/2962820.jpg"></div><p>  Beeline provides an opportunity to create a separate account from which payment of additional options is carried out.  If you do not replenish it, no service can be activated.  To find out the current account status, dial * 622 #.
