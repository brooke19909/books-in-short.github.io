For example, instead of compact mobile phones, we got large touchscreen devices with a large screen that can play widescreen games and applications. </p><p>  This article will be dedicated to finding the best big screen smartphone.  And since it is obvious that it is quite difficult to single out a single model because they have their own advantages and disadvantages, we will try to find phones worthy of attention for each of the presented categories, focusing primarily on customer reviews. </p><h2>  Selection criteria </h2><p>  To begin with, we will determine what exactly we will take into account as we conduct our analysis.  These are the most common indicators, such as: the cost of the device, its power, practicality, and several others.  Each of them in our article will be assigned a section where one or another of the most common models of mobile devices will be described.  We emphasize that we will carry out the search for models from one or another category using customer reviews.  The criteria that were selected for analysis are found among users most often, and each of us pays attention to them.  Let's start with the most obvious - cost. </p><h2>  Price </h2>

    <p>  Very often, buyers evaluate one or another model of the device at its price.  The logic is simple: the more expensive the device, the better.  True, this approach does not always work, often low-cost models are able to show better results at lower cash costs.  A very revealing example of this category of smartphones is the products of some of the most common Chinese brands - for example, Huawei, Xiaomi or Meizu.  At their low price, Ascend P6, MX4 and Mi4 (respectively) phones became real bestsellers, despite the fact that partially stolen concepts of Apple and Samsung technology came into their development.  After reading reviews about them, you yourself will see for yourself.  Due to this, the price of devices is lower, and the quality is decent.  Such a large-screen smartphone is definitely worth the money. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Other examples of inexpensive, but quite effective models are Asus Zenfone 5, LG G3 and several others.  These phones belong to the "middle" class, but they show quality worthy of the level of "flagships", according to a large number of reviews. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Another criterion that I would like to draw attention to is performance.  It determines the final speed of the device, how vividly it responds.  <span>A good smartphone</span> with a large screen should respond to user commands instantly - only then can we talk about its high quality. </p>

    <p>  To find out what the performance of a device will be is quite simple.  Take at least the technical specifications that are present in each model.  It indicates the type of processor used on the phone, an indicator of its clock frequency.  The logic is simple: the higher the last parameter, the faster the phone will respond to your commands.  <span>The most powerful</span> large-screen <span>smartphones</span> are the flagship models.  Reviews confirm this trend.  All the ‚Äútop‚Äù devices in the lineup - Apple iPhone 6, Samsung S6, Lenovo K900, HTC One - have the best performance that the company that released the device is capable of.  Therefore, buying the most expensive smartphone in the line, you can be sure of its high speed.  As practice shows, there is a reverse effect - <span>cheap smartphones</span> with a large screen from Lenovo or Samsung work less efficiently, often slow down and ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù, which greatly annoy their owner. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Style </h2>

    <p>  An important issue when <span>choosing a phone</span> is its style.  No matter what the model‚Äôs functionality is, they are ‚Äúgreeted‚Äù precisely by its appearance, that is, by the way the smartphone is made.  Of course, steel cases have some attractiveness, due to which such devices seem more stylish.  The same iPhone 6, Galaxy S6, <span>Huawei Ascend P6,</span> Sony Xperia T3, Jiyau G5 (and a number of other ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù), as noted by customers in their reviews, have a steel shell, due to which their appearance can not be compared with what the budget ones look like large-screen smartphones made of plastic. </p><h2>  Opportunities </h2>

    <p>  Another important factor that a good large-screen smartphone can determine is its capabilities.  This primarily includes the features that the device has.  This, for example, the ability to synchronize with other gadgets, work with certain applications, the presence of a powerful camera, flash, 3G / LTE modules and the like.  According to reviews, many of them are not critical, and some even have inexpensive smartphones with a large screen.  Each of these functions is an additional convenience, and the user independently determines whether he needs them or not.  Perhaps someone will be more interested in a smartphone with a large screen with a minimum set of such tools at a more affordable price.  Again, if we take, for example, flagship devices, then they even have heart rate sensors or fingerprint scanners, while more affordable devices cannot boast of such modules.  Naturally, you have to pay for all this. </p><h2>  Practicality </h2>

    <p>  Another important component of a good phone is practicality.  The way a large-screen smartphone behaves in everyday life determines the impression of it and measures the degree of pleasure from working with it.  In this vein, every detail plays an important role - from the resistance of the display to scratches and ending with how quickly the back cover of the device wears out.  In this regard, the advantage of inexpensive smartphones with a large screen, because they are often equipped with a less fragile body and, in addition, work on the basis of more affordable components.  According to reviews (yes, however, and as you can understand without outside help), the flagship devices, on the contrary, are made with more expensive parts (for example, shock-resistant screens, metal rims), but this does not save them from the possibility of being damaged.  Take at least the same iPhone - repair of these devices is no less popular option in service centers than after-sales service of any other model.  Only the price of such an operation is many times higher. </p><h2>  How to make a choice? </h2>

    <p>  Choosing a smartphone that is the best option for you is quite easy.  As the recommendations of customers based on their experience show, two parameters should be calculated - their capabilities and needs.  The first is the price that you are willing to pay for the device, and in the future the cost of servicing the device (including repair).  The second is your expectations from the gadget.  Think about exactly what you would like to receive from your smartphone: an excellent camera, a hardy battery, a colorful display, a powerful processor or a stylish design.  Perhaps you would not want to seek compromises and all these qualities would be happy to combine in one phone.  In this case, purchase a more expensive and advanced model that will satisfy all your needs.  Thus, you will come to your ‚Äúright choice‚Äù by defining a phone with which you will be happy to work in everyday life. </p>
