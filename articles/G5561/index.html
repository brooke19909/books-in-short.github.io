First of all, you should choose the style of the picture.  For example, if you want to make a sculpture, then you need a fairly hard plasticine.  Its feature is that it is quite difficult to work with it, especially to draw small details.  To create such a product, a single piece of material is used.

First of all, you need to get ready for work.  To do this, prepare a dense base on which you will mount the clay.  Now you need to warm up the raw materials so that it kneads well and sticks to the prepared base.

    <p>  A very important part of the work is the sketch of the future product, drawn or printed on a standard sheet of paper (or several pages).  This will make it easier for you to draw all the necessary details.  Subsequently, the sketch must be transferred to the base.  Now you can apply clay.  To do this, smear small pieces of a certain color in the desired area of ​​the picture. </p><p>  Observe safety precautions during operation.  In this case, the image should turn out to be very beautiful and neat.  Make sure that the clay does not go beyond the edges of the base.  Note that at the junction of parts you need to pay attention to the color transition.  After the main elements of the picture are filled with plasticine, you can begin to design the background.  To do this, you can use plastic and pencils.  In principle, clay can be used for the same purpose. </p><h2>  How to make volumetric pictures: step by step instructions </h2>

    <ol><li>  Selection of materials and the basis for the product. </li><li>  Plasticine preparation (it is necessary that the raw materials are soft enough). </li><li>  The location of the sketch on the base.  In this case, you need to consider where the background will be located, how much space it will occupy. </li><li>  Making the necessary elements from pieces of plasticine.  They can have different shapes and sizes.  In the process, various techniques are used: rolling, flattening, pulling the part from the general shape. </li><li>  Attaching pieces of a given shape to the desired area. </li></ol><p>  The voluminous picture from plasticine is a real masterpiece that will become a wonderful decoration for your interior.  Its plot may be different.  For example, the image of the sea will be very beautiful.  The product in this case will turn out pretty colorful.  In order to make such a masterpiece, you will need to follow a certain sequence of actions: </p><ol><li>  We start work from the top of the base.  To do this, smear plasticine of white, blue and blue shades on the surface of the cardboard.  Naturally, you can add gray or <span>pearl color here.</span>  In order for the material to be well spread, it must be softened.  To do this, heat the raw materials with a hairdryer.  For a more impressive effect, all shades of plasticine can be mixed and only then smeared on the base.  Although sometimes a blue background is first made. </li><li>  Once the sky is ready, you can begin to create water.  To do this, use a dark blue color for the background.  Next, determine whether waves will be present in the picture.  If so, they may be lighter or darker than the background.  In addition, you can apply <span>shades of green</span> and turquoise.  In order for the wave to look voluminous, darker plasticine should be used. </li><li>  A separate element of the picture can be the setting sun.  Usually it has a reddish tint and is located on the horizon.  In addition, you must definitely make a solar path on the water. </li><li>  If in the picture you want to depict an island with a palm tree, then yellow, brown and green plasticine is used for this.  At the same time, note that the tree can be made voluminous.  To do this, you need to lay pieces of raw materials on top of each other.  For the manufacture of palm leaves, green plasticine is necessarily used, from which oval elements roll and then flatten.  Using the stack on the tree trunk, the corresponding pattern is made. </li></ol><p>  In principle, in a few hours you can build a real masterpiece, which should be placed in a frame.  However, be careful, since plasticine can come under the glass, and the picture will no longer have its former appearance. </p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  In order for the product to please your eye for a long time, certain nuances should be taken into account during its manufacture.  For example, the base should be light.  If you have not practiced such art, then you can take transparent plastic as the basis, since it is easier to correct mistakes on it. </p><p>  <span>Crafts from plasticine</span> (paintings in particular) will look very beautiful if the items are made correctly.  For example, if you make flower petals or leaflets that should have the same shape, then you first need to make a small long roller from the material presented.  To do this, you can use a syringe through which a well-heated plasticine is pressed. </p><p>  It is better to start work from the top edge of the base.  Otherwise, you may accidentally ruin the image with a careless hand movement.  If you decide to make pictures from plasticine, the master class described above will help you get started and plan your work. </p>
