    <h2>  For subscribers of Ukraine </h2><p>  There is a separate support line for company customers in Ukraine, which can be reached by phone.  Moreover, the call can be made both from a mobile number and from a landline.  How to contact the operator "Life" (Ukraine)? </p><ul><li>  Contacting tech support from the SIM card of this operator is free.  You need to dial a single number 5433. After dialing, the automatic voice system will turn on and offer to familiarize yourself with the menu items.  By the way, through this service you can also get the necessary data.  It is enough to select the desired menu item, and the voice system will report the information by number.  But there is a flip side to this system - among the proposed menu items, you can easily get lost.  Therefore, immediately after dialing the number, press the number 5, then 3 and at the end 0. After that, the subscriber will hear a greeting from the support service specialist.  In the event that there are no free consultants at the moment, he will be informed about this and will be able to wait for an answer. </li><li>  How to contact the Life operator from a SIM card of another mobile service provider or from a landline phone?  You should dial 0 800 20 54 33. It should be noted that when calling from a fixed-line telephone, you will not have to pay for the connection.  However, when calling from a SIM card of another operator, the cost of a minute will be determined by the terms of the tariff plan. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="contact life operator ukraine" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45312/2108119.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Support calls from roaming </h2><p>  When traveling outside the country, the following numbers should be stored in the smartphone's memory: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  +380 635 433 111; </li><li>  +380 442 336 363. </li></ul><p>  It is through them that you can contact the support service from roaming (from other countries).  In this case, the call will be paid.  The cost of a minute is determined by the tariffs for the outgoing communication of the operator in the host country.  You can clarify them immediately before leaving the operator‚Äôs official website or by contacting the support service, specifying which country the departure is planned to be.  Perhaps the support service representative will tell you how you can save on calls outside the home region. </p>

    <h2>  Other ways to get support </h2><p>  How to contact the Life operator in another way?  If there is no possibility to make a phone call, then there is also an option for Belarusian subscribers to use other communication channels.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  Email.  By sending a request to info@life.com.by, you can get an answer to your question.  If necessary, you can attach screenshots or attach documents to circulation.  It should be noted that the waiting time can be from several hours to several days. </li><li>  Fax machine.  You can also send a request by fax to the number +375 (17) 328 58 86. Thus, you can send not only questions to specialists, but also send the necessary documents upon request. </li></ul><h2>  For corporate clients </h2><p>  For subscribers who are serviced on corporate terms, the following methods of obtaining support are possible: </p><ol><li>  A call to tech support.  In this case, all the same numbers are used as for individuals (they are given above).  When connecting, it should be clarified that the issue relates to corporate communications - perhaps the specialist will have to switch the call to the employee responsible for consulting corporate clients. </li><li>  Contacting the salon of communication.  On the operator‚Äôs website, you should choose the most affordable office for servicing <span>corporate clients.</span>  You should go to it with a passport, power of attorney, certified by a notary, if an agent of the organization applies. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to contact the operator of life by phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45312/2108137.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In this article, we talked about how you can contact the Life operator by calling the number, and also provided information about other options for sending calls regarding communication services.  Please note that support service phones differ for subscribers in Belarus and Ukraine.  When in roaming, you should also use specially allocated numbers to contact the operator, the call for which will be paid.  Since the cost of roaming calls is quite high, it is recommended to call technical support in the most extreme cases, when it is really not possible to do without the help of a specialist.  Also, Belarusian subscribers can send requests by e-mail. </p>
