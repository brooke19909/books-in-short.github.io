Moreover, the king took these trips in all directions, gradually conquering all neighboring areas.  One of the famous campaigns was when Artashes tried to capture the <span>Hellenistic states of the</span> Middle East, but with the help of the Seleucids they remained independent.

    <p>  The Armenian king Tigran the Great stayed in power for 40 years, during which Armenia achieved incredible previously imperial power.  His reign began in a favorable period when Roman power in this region was overthrown by the Evpatorian king Mithridates (king of Pontus), who was able to consolidate the entire Black Sea coast. </p><p>  Tigran marries the daughter of Mithridates Cleopatra.  His entire foreign policy was directed by large-scale military campaigns at first with the Romans (with the support of Mithridates of Pontus), as a result of which he was able to return the land he had given, conquer Assyria, Edessa and other territories, and annex the lands of Northern Mesopotamia. </p><p>  In 83 BC.  e.  in agreement with the Syrian nobility and merchants, the Armenian army invaded Syria, capturing Cilicia and Phenicia to northern Palestine.  Subjugating 120 provinces and satrapies, he began to call himself the King of kings and the Divine, issuing silver coins, which became the best (according to historians) among all that were minted by Armenian kings (see photo below). </p>

    <p>  Coins were minted in Antioch and Damascus and depicted Tigranes the Great in a 5-point tiara with a star and eagles.  Later, he built his own mint.  Having reigned in Syria for 14 years, the Armenian king Tigran II the Great helped their economic revival, bringing peace and prosperity to these lands. </p><p>  During these years, his power spread over a vast territory, ranging from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean, from Mesopotamia to the Pontic Alps.  The Armenian Empire became politically united, and each of the controlled states paid tribute to it, but at the same time retained its laws and the status of an autonomous principality. </p>

    <p>  In this era, Armenia represented a social structure, gradually moving to the nascent elements of feudalism.  At the same time, the clan organization was combined with the widespread use of slave labor, in which prisoners captured in neighboring territories during various wars were involved. </p><p>  Tigran the Great began the construction of his capital Tigranakert (the modern territory of southern Turkey), which he conceived as the political and economic center of the state, in which the Armenian kings would rule.  To populate the city with people, he encouraged the emigration of Jews, and also forcibly resettled the inhabitants of the ruined provinces, according to some sources, even forced 12 cities of Greece to move - the total number of immigrants was estimated at 300 thousand. </p><p>  However, in 72, due to his father-in-law Mithridates, Tigran entered the war with Rome, which was the beginning of his defeat and the collapse of the Armenian Empire.  The Roman commander Lucullus inflicted a severe defeat on him, having rejected Syria and Phenicia, besieging the ancient capital Artaxata.  Then in 66 the Parthian troops entered the war, and the king surrendered to the Romans, having made a hasty peace.  The remaining 11 years, being already old and weak, the Armenian king continued to rule the country as a vassal of Rome. </p><h2>  Tsar Artavazd II </h2><p>  Artavazd became king in 55 BC.  e.  and was the most educated and learned.  This king was fluent in Greek, known as a connoisseur of literature and even composed tragedies and historical works.  Faithful to the alliance with Rome, Artavazd sent a 50,000th army to attack the Parthians.  However, he later entered into an alliance with them, passing off his sister as the son of the Parthian king Orod. </p><p>  He ruled the country for 20 years that have passed in peace and prosperity.  However, speaking on the side of the Roman rulers Mark Anthony and Cleopatra, he was accused of treason.  The Armenian king Artavazd and his family Mark Anthony brought in chains and gave to the mercy of Cleopatra, who tried to ruthlessly torture them to find the place of storage of treasures that the Armenian kings collected.  And the army of Anthony at that time robbed the <span>Armenian cities</span> and destroyed the temple of the goddess Anahit.  Having never learned anything, Cleopatra ordered to kill the king of Armenia, who is in prison. </p><h2>  Arshakid dynasty and the birth of Christianity </h2><p>  Arshakids - the dynasty that ruled in Parthia (now Iran) in 250-228 BC.  e.  This family was royal for many centuries; it was connected with the events of world history.  The ancestor of the Armenian royal branch was Tiridat (Trdat I), who occupied the throne of Armenia at the end of the 1st century.  All this time, endless Roman-Persian wars and conflicts continued. </p><p>  Trdat I is the first Armenian king who introduced the Christian religion in Armenia.  In the 2-3 centuries.  this religion is widespread in the regions surrounding Armenia.  Thus, the Apostolic Church of the State of Antioch and the ancient center of Edessa in Mesopotamia contributed to the spread of Christianity, then the writings of Bishop Theophilia and Marcus Aurelius, preaching the Christian doctrine, became popular. </p>

    <p>  One of the most famous historical names beloved by the Armenian people over the centuries: St. Gregory the Illuminator, who returned from Parthia to Armenia to preach the Christian faith here.  Due to the fact that his father was the murderer of Tsar Khosrov I (238), the ruler of Armenia, Trdat III, threw Gregory into the dungeon of the royal castle, where he subsequently spent 15 years. </p><p>  Trdat I later freed St. Gregory, who, as a sign of forgiveness, cured of a severe mental illness and christened him and the whole royal court.  In 302, Gregory the Illuminator became a bishop and was elected head of the Armenian Christian Church. </p><p>  In 359, the Persian-Roman war begins, the outcome of which is the defeat of Rome.  At this time, Arshak II (345-367) reigned on the Armenian throne, who began a war with Persia, which at first was quite successful for Armenia, but then the Persian king Shaluh tricked and imprisoned Arshak, where he dies. </p>

After long battles, famine and the outbreak of the epidemic, the fortress fell, and Parandzem is killed, betraying her torture. </p><p>  Her son Pap returns to Armenia and becomes king thanks to the Roman emperor Wages.  The time of his reign (370-374) was a period of restoration of destroyed settlements, restoration of churches and putting government affairs in order.  The Armenian king Pap at the head of the army defeated the Persian battle in Dzirav and restored peace in Armenia. </p><p>  Having cleansed the country of foreign invaders, Tsar Pap worked intensively to restore the state, he limited the land tenure of the church and established the initial independence of the Armenian Catholic Church, strengthened the army, and carried out some reforms.  However, by order of the Roman emperor Wages, he was lured to a magnificent feast, where they vilely dealt with a young Armenian patriot. <br>  In history, he remained as one of the most active Armenian kings. </p>

    <p>  After the death of the Pope, kings Varazdat (374-378), Arshak (378-389), Khosrov, Vramshapuh (389-417), Shapur (418-422), Artashes Artashir (422-428) were on the throne. </p><p>  In 428, the Persians captured Armenia - thus ended the period of greatness and prosperity of the state of Great Armenia, which was ruled by the famous Armenian kings. </p><h2>  The collapse of Great Armenia and the resettlement of Armenians </h2><p>  Armenians began to settle in Byzantium since the 4th century due to the unstable situation in their homeland, where there were constant military conflicts with neighboring states.  When the destruction of tsarist power and the division of Great Armenia between Byzantium and Persia occurred, many princes rushed to Byzantium with their families and military detachments.  They sought to use their military knowledge and talents in the administrative service. </p><p>  In the same years, there was a massive resettlement of Armenians in the Balkans, Cyprus and Cilicia, North Africa.  The tendency to recruit military and bodyguards of Armenian descent into the palace guard in the Byzantine state has existed for a long time.  Armenian cavalry and other military formations were very much appreciated.  Moreover, they were located not only in the capital, but also in other cities (in particular, in Italy and Sicily). </p>

    <h2>  Armenian kings of Byzantium </h2><p>  Many Armenians held high military and spiritual posts, were engaged in scientific activities, teaching in monasteries and universities.  Artists and architects have earned fame.  The Armenian nobles, being descendants of the ancient royal families, gradually settled from Byzantium throughout Europe, entering into kinship with the noble and royal families. </p><p>  In the <span>history of Byzantium,</span> more than 30 emperors of Armenian origin visited the throne.  Among them: Mauritius (582-602), Emperor Heraclius I (610-641), Filippik Vardan (711-713), Leo the Armenian (813-820), Vasily I Macedonian (867-886), Roman I Lakapin (920- 944), John Tzimiskes (969-976) and many others. </p><h2>  Famous Byzantine kings of Armenian descent </h2><p>  According to historical information, in the 11-12 centuries.  10-15% of the ruling aristocracy in Byzantium had Armenian nationality, but among the kings there were natives of Armenian peasants who achieved the throne in various, not always righteous ways. </p><p>  The most famous Byzantine kings of Armenian descent: </p><ul><li>  Emperor Irakli I. Along with the Arshakid dynasty, was gifted with military talent, carried out reforms in command and troops, restored the power of Byzantium, concluded a mutually beneficial agreement with Great Bulgaria on economic and military assistance, conducted many military operations during the Iran-Byzantine War, returned to Jerusalem its main Christian shrine, the Life-Giving Cross (previously captured by the Persian king). </li><li>  Philippine Vardan.  He claimed claims to the imperial throne, was exiled to the island of Kefalonia, then Chersonese, where he raised a rebellion, with the help of the Khazars captured Constantinople and became emperor.  He was convinced that he was a Monofelite, which led to a conflict with the Roman Church, and was blinded by the conspirators. </li><li>  Leo Armenian.  It came from the Arzruni clan, at the head of the army he repelled the Bulgarian attack on Constantinople, ousted the Patriarch of Nicephorus of Constantinople (815) and convened a local church council, proclaiming a return to the decrees of the iconoclastic cathedral in Hieria.  He was killed during the Christmas service in December 820. </li><li>  The biography of Vasily I the Macedonian is full of twists of fate.  By origin, a peasant, he spent all his childhood with his family in captivity in Bulgaria, then fled to Thrace.  After moving to Constantinople, he entered the service of the imperial stables, his beautiful appearance attracted the attention of Emperor Michael the 3rd and became his favorite, and later married his mistress.  After the removal of an influential imperial relative, Vasily became co-ruler in 866, after which, having killed the emperor, in 867 he took the throne, founding a new dynasty.  Among his merits to Byzantium: the systematization of Byzantine legislation, the expansion of the army, etc. He died from an accident during the hunt (886). </li></ul>

    <ul><li> Roman I Lakapin.  He also came from Armenian peasants, converted to Orthodoxy and rose to the rank of chief of the imperial fleet, seized power with the help of cunning and cunning, then passed off his daughter to the emperor and became a ‚ÄúVasileopator‚Äù (tsar‚Äôs father), and then took the royal throne.  His activity was aimed at combating the aristocracy, which owned large land territories, in favor of the small landowners of stratiotics.  He became famous as a master of intrigue and conspiracy, but suffered precisely at the hands of the conspirators - their own sons, who arrested him and exiled him to the monastery, where they themselves joined him a year later as the same prisoners.  He died in 948. </li><li>  John Tzimiskes.  He came from a noble Armenian family and was a relative of the previous emperor Nicephorus, in the murder of which he participated.  Having become king of Byzantium, he was actively engaged in charity affairs, building hospitals and distributing property to the poor.  His military campaigns took place in the east, the result of which was the return of Syria and Phenicia under Byzantine rule.  He was poisoned by his first minister Lekapen. </li></ul><h2>  Dynasties of kings who ruled after the destruction of Great Armenia </h2><p>  <span>The great Armenian</span> kings - Artashes I, Tiger II the Great - were the rulers of Armenia during its heyday and wealth.  After 428, an era came when the country was ruled by rulers appointed by other states.  And only since the end of the 9th century Armenian dynasties returned to power: </p><ul><li>  Bagratids (885-1045 gg.); </li><li>  Rubenides-Hetumids-Lusignans (1080-1375). </li></ul><p>  The first representatives of the princely clan of the Bagratids, uniting most of Armenia under their rule (after the period when the Arabs were in power), were the Armenian kings Ashot I and II Zhelezny, Smbat I, Ashot III the Gracious.  The last representative of this kind, Gagik II, was captured and after negotiations with Byzantium renounced the kingdom. </p>
