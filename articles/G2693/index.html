Many customers are impressed that you can apply for a Visa Classic credit card as well as a MasterCard. </p><h2>  About the disadvantages of plastic cards </h2><p>  The shortcomings are examples of intrusive advertising in order to force customers to issue new credit cards.

In addition, an unpleasant residue leaves a deduction of interest when withdrawing funds from the card.  Therefore, you should weigh the pros and cons, thinking about what is better: a loan at PrivatBank or a credit card. </p>
