    <h2>  Prices, shopping </h2><p>  Now let's talk about how much money is required to visit the hotel Hurghada Marriott Beach Resort 5 *.  Room prices start at four thousand eight hundred rubles.  But given that services such as a sauna and a hamam are free here, it‚Äôs not so expensive.

This is the main place where tourists are bought.  Aromatic lamps, handmade embroideries, jewelry and stone crafts are sold here at every step.
