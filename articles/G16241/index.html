    <p>  The distance from the capital of the republic to Sosnovka is about 260 km.  Some guests begin their journey to the place of rest from the Beloretsk bus or train station.  The road lies southwest along the highway.  Before reaching the village of Sosnovka, you need to turn right (there is a pointer).  Heading to the camp site by car from Ufa, you can turn south without stopping in Beloretsk.  About 1.5 km to Sosnovka there will be a turn with a pointer to the path to the recreation center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The pristine beauty of the wildlife of the Southern Urals </h2><p>  In the vicinity of the Arsky Kamen tourist complex (Beloretsk), mountain peaks overgrown with coniferous and broad-leaved forests, subalpine meadows alternate with the green shores of the Belaya River valley.  In prehistoric times, the entire South Ural territory went through long stages of development as part of the paleo-ocean.  His retreat was associated with powerful mountain building processes.  On the modern western slope of ancient ranges, limestones, dolomites and other sedimentary rocks are exposed.  Debris and imprints of ancient mollusks and corals - inhabitants of warm and shallow sea basins - are found everywhere in rocky scree.  Valuable igneous rocks were also found in the mountains of the Southern Urals, there are traces of ancient volcanism. </p>

    <p>  The Bashkir people preserved the legend of the ancient giant, who protected a belt in the place of the modern mountain range, composed of semiprecious stones and minerals useful in the household.  To the riches of the mountains, nature has added the beauty of rivers and forests, the healing power of the air.  The conditions of the recreation center are excellent for improving health, testing your abilities and activating the body's reserves. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Legendary cliff </h2><p>  20 km south-west of Beloretsk and a few hundred meters from the camp site is a historical and geological monument - Arsky stone.  The height of this sheer rock outcrop of limestone rocks reaches 30 m. Weathering has changed its shape for 400 million years, leaving bizarre patterns on the surface.  The rock is surrounded by a pine forest and the majestic bend of the Belaya River.  Relict species of plants of forest and steppe flora are found here (Podolsk shiverekiya, Coin sunflower, poligranous scrub). </p><p>  The spirit of the time, the power of natural forces are reflected in the folklore of the Bashkir people.  Part of the legends and traditions associated with the Arsk stone and the Agidel river belong to the period of the popular uprising led by Emelyan Pugachev.  According to one version, in 1774 the rebels captured the Beloretsk plant.  Having been refused the demand to melt the guns, they threw the manager from the top of the Arsk stone into the river.  After the execution, according to popular rumor, the waters of Agidel retreated hundreds of meters from the cliff of Arsky stone (photos of the mountain formation are presented in the article).  According to another legend, in a cave under the cliff Pugachev hid looted treasures.  The entrance to the underground grotto was deliberately destroyed in the 30s of the last century in order to cool the ardor of treasure hunters. </p>

    <h2>  Rehabilitation Center Project </h2><p>  In 2014, the recreation center "Arsky Kamen" (Beloretsk) could be converted into a rehabilitation center for drug addicts.  The project was initiated by public organizations with the support of the Office of the Federal Drug Control Service of Russia for Bashkiria.  If it were to be implemented, the borders of the camp site would have to be closed, which would mean the end of a well-developed tourist brand.  When the heads of the Beloretsk district administration and representatives of the national association of rehabilitation centers discussed the prospects, it was decided that it would be inappropriate to place the rehabilitation institution on the territory of the tourist complex.  The opinion of residents and the public, who opposed the implementation of the rehab center project, was also taken into account.  The recreation center on June 1, 2014 began to accept tourists as usual. </p><h2>  Summer sightseeing </h2><p>  In summer, horseback riding, hiking and cycling routes, caving trips, river rafting prevail in the recreation program.  Themed bus excursions to historical and natural monuments of the Southern Urals are organized.  Hiking routes introduce tourists to the protected corners of the region.  Horseback riding is a tradition of the recreation center, which is over 40 years old.  A popular equestrian and speleological route has been added to popular hikes in the mountains, river valleys and forests, historical places. </p>

    <h2>  South Ural River Rafting </h2><p>  Traveling on the waters of the Belaya and Inzer rivers in kayaks, catamarans and rafts is an attractive type of outdoor activity for courageous and hardy people.  The routes of rafts prepared by the recreation center ‚ÄúArskiy Kamen‚Äù come in various complexity and duration.  Experienced travelers and beginners in this type of tourism take part in fascinating hikes.  For the first, an interesting 7-day route along the Inzer River and an 11-day water hike of increased complexity to the Shulgan-tash cave, which runs along the Belaya River.  Beginners will like short introductory alloys lasting up to 5 hours.  Even families with children can go on a hike on the water of the Ural rivers, because the course here is not as fast as in the Caucasus. </p>
