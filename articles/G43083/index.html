It has an interesting story full of dramatic events, and today it hospitably opens its doors to those who decided to relax and improve their health in the LRC of the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  The history of the estate from its foundation until the 19th century </h2><p>  The manor court on the site of modern Voronovo existed before the Time of Troubles and the Polish invasion.  It belonged to the Voronov-Volynsky, who were direct descendants of one of the heroes of the Battle of Kulikovo - the famous Prince Bobrok.  During the reign of Anna Ioannovna, the owner of the estate, Artemy Petrovich Volynsky, married to the cousin of <span>Peter the Great,</span> took part in a conspiracy against Biron, so he was executed.  As a result, the estate was confiscated in favor of the treasury, but after the accession of <span>Elizabeth Petrovna</span> it was returned to the daughter of the former owner, who by that time was married to Count Ivan Vorontsov. </p>

    <p>  The new owner of the Voronovo estate has done a lot to make it one of the most comfortable and beautiful corners of the Moscow region.  In general, representatives of this genus entered the history of Russia as the founders of new traditions of Russian noble life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Palace construction </h2><p>  The Vorontsov brothers invited the famous architect Karl Blanca from the capital, who designed and built for them a three-story manor house with magnificent columns, a portico and outbuildings.  The result was a real palace that aroused admiration and envy among contemporaries.  In 1775, even with great pomp, Catherine the Second was received there, in memory of which two paired obelisks were erected in the estate. </p><h2>  Manor at Count Rostopchin </h2><p>  The squandering of the Vorontsov brothers led to the fact that they had to sell their favorite estate for a huge sum at that time - 320 thousand rubles.  Thus, <span>the</span> Voronovo <span>estate near Moscow</span> began to belong to Count Fedor Rostopchin.  This favorite of Paul the First lived there almost eight years, during which he spent huge sums on arranging greenhouses, a garden and a horse yard. </p><p>  As a result, according to contemporaries, Voronovo became the main decoration of Podolsky Uyezd, where they traveled to see the eccentricities of the Count, who planted Mediterranean plants and built a flying ship.  This device, vaguely reminiscent of a balloon, Rostopchin intended to use in the war with Napoleon, whom he fiercely hated and considered the Antichrist.  However, the ship was never able to fly into the air, and all the funds for its construction were wasted. </p>

    <h2>  Arson and Recovery </h2><p>  When the French occupied Moscow, Rostopchin, who at that time held the post of Moscow military governor, burned his favorite estate with his own hands and left a message to the invaders.  In it, he wrote that he himself destroyed his own home so that it would not be defiled by the presence of a hated enemy.  Such an act in the spirit of the heroes of antiquity made a strong impression on his contemporaries, as well as an unexpected transition to Catholicism of the count‚Äôs wife - Ekaterina Petrovna. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Rostopchin first spent the last years of his life abroad, and then in Moscow, and almost did not appear in Voronovo, where his son and daughter-in-law settled.  They built on the foundation of the old palace a two-story manor house, which was no different from other noble nests of its time. </p><h2>  Voronovo at the Sheremetyevs </h2><p>  In the mid-19th century, new owners appeared at the estate.  They were Alexander and Sergey Sheremetyevs, who acquired Voronovo.  The estate in this period began to resemble the suburban dwellings of the French rich bourgeois.  In particular, an attic roof was built over the house, the south wing was dismantled, the gallery was expanded, and an arcade with a balcony was added to the front facade. </p><p>  In the last decade before the revolution, the estate fell into disrepair, as its owners: the Sheremetyevs' daughter and her husband - only occasionally visited Voronovo.  The estate was nationalized with the <span>coming to power of the Bolsheviks,</span> and in 1949 a sanatorium was founded there.  In this regard, the manor house was rebuilt, and a medical building with rooms and other buildings appeared on the territory.  In the post-Soviet period, the Voronovo estate was transferred to the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia, and a modern treatment and prevention center was founded there.  It is equipped with the most modern equipment, and there are all conditions for recreation for adults and children. </p>

    <h2>  Description of the estate </h2><p>  To visit Voronovo, you should go to the village of Voronovskoye, which is part of the Trinity administrative district of the capital.

This church was built in 1762 by the owners of the estate and consecrated a year later with the blessing of the then Metropolitan Timofei.  Three decades later, the spouses of Vorontsov were buried in it, but to this day their tombstones have not been preserved.  A little later, a baroque bell tower was built at some distance, which, together with the Dutch house, is considered a symbol of the estate.

    <h2>  Legends </h2><p>  Like any old manor, Voronovo has its own secret.  So, they say that after the fire set up by Rostopchin, not a single marble statue was found on the ashes, although there were many of them in the manor house and in the garden.  Moreover, it is known for certain that the Moscow Governor-General did not evacuate any values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom there.  These facts suggested that under the house or nearby should be a dungeon where the treasures of the Rostopchins family were hidden during the occupation.  Whether it actually exists or not, it is not known for certain, but old-timers say that during the construction of the sanatorium in the late 1940s an underground labyrinth was discovered. </p><h2>  Voronovsky sanatorium: description </h2><p>  As already mentioned, today in Voronovo there is a modern medical and preventive institution owned by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.  In the Soviet period, it was called the sanatorium ‚ÄúVoronovo‚Äù and was considered one of the most prestigious places for recreation and treatment in the suburbs.  Its number of rooms consists of comfortable rooms of the categories ‚Äústandard‚Äù (double and single), ‚Äújunior suite‚Äù and ‚Äúsuite‚Äù, located in a building in the style of Soviet modernism, built in the 1970s. </p>
