    <h2>  How many years did civil wars last in Rome? </h2><p>  The period during which the battles were fought is described by a number of historians as one of the largest systemic crises in the history of the Empire.  The most famous <span>civil war</span> in Rome occurred in the 40s BC.  e.  During it, Julius Caesar opposed the senatorial elite, whose head was Pompey the Great.  How many years the civil wars lasted in Rome, how many constant internal reforms took place in the state.  In total, the battles lasted more than 100 years - from 133 to 31 BC.  e. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="roman wars" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/838183.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  What are the <span>causes of the civil wars</span> in Rome?  By the end of the 2nd century BC.  e.  Gaius Marius conducted an army reform.  The peasantry was ruined, and therefore the recruitment to the troops on the property qualification was impossible.  Thus, the poor sought the army.  And the soldiers began to serve exclusively for salaries and did not have other sources of income. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the victory over the Teutons and the Cimbri was won, Rome had no serious enemies for several decades.  At the same time, contradictions intensified within the Republic itself.  They are the causes of the civil wars in Rome.  They culminated in the establishment of a monarchy with the preservation of certain republican institutions. </p><p>  The beginning of the civil wars in Rome came at the end of the 90s.  The first of them was called Allied.  This civil war in Rome was waged by Italian allies against the authorities.  To end the confrontation, the government was forced to go up against the rebels.  As a result, the Italian allies received Roman citizenship.  However, after this battle the following almost immediately followed.  A new civil war in Rome ensued between the aristocratic party, whose head was Lucius Cornelius Sulla, and the Democrats, led by Gaius Marius. </p>

    <h2>  Late republic </h2><p>  Many civil wars in Rome were accompanied by special bloodshed and ended in repression.  Such was, for example, the confrontation of the aristocracy and the Gracchus brothers.  In 133, there was a skirmish on the Capitol.  During it, the people's stands Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, as well as 300 Gracchians fell directly during comitia at the hands of senators and accomplices who supported them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The next clash occurred in 121.  <span>The people's stands</span> Guy Sempronius Gracchus and about 3,000 Gracchians were defeated during the assault of Aventine by troops called up by the Senate.  A follower of the Gracchus, Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, in 100 fell at the hands of the optimists during the assault on the Capitol.  The next clash occurred in 91-88 years BC.  e.  It was an Allied war, which was not formally considered civilian, since the Italians did not have citizenship. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how many years civil wars lasted in rome" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/838179.jpg" width="241"></div>

    <h2>  Marians and Sullans </h2><p>  The civil war in Rome between the supporters of Gaius Maria and Sulla occurred in 88-87.  As a result of the battles, the first fled.  However, after some time there were new civil wars in Rome with the participation of the Marians.  So, in 87-83 there was a coup.  Marians, recovering from the previous defeat, seized power.  In 87, a coup attempt was made by the consul Lucius Cornelius Zinnoy.  However, the rebellion was crushed by Gnei Octavius.  As a result, Zinn was forced to flee. </p><p>  In the same 87th year, Mari returns and besieges Rome.  Quintus Sertorius and Zinn immediately connect with him.  At that time, an epidemic began in Rome.  The army of the Senate, the father of Pompey, perishes, and the authority itself surrenders.  After that, Octavia was executed, and Mary and Zinn were elected consuls for the 86th year.  The second tried to bring the war with Sulla closer, but died during the rebellion in Ancona.  Nevertheless, a new war was inevitable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="causes of civil wars in rome" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/838180.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <h2>  Events 83-77 years </h2><p>  The next battle took place between the Sullans and the Marians in 83. Mari died, and Sulla was able to occupy Rome.  So in 82, a dictatorship was established. </p><p>  After the resignation and death of Sulla, a rather unstable period began.  During it, several conflicts occurred.  So, in the years 80-72 there was a protracted war between the Sullans and Quintus Sertorius (Marian).  The victory was for the senate (sullans).  In 77 there was a short-term war - the rebellion of Lepidus.  I must say that he was not formally a Marian.  The clash again ended with the victory of the Sullans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="start of civil wars in rome" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/838181.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Rise of Spartacus </h2><p>  It happened in 74 / 73-71.  This conflict became one of the largest in the era of internal contradictions.  Slaves participated in the uprising, led by Spartak.  The victory was won by the army of Rome.  In 74 or 73 in Kapua, at the school of gladiators, a conspiracy arose.  Of the 200 rebels, only 78 were able to escape, including Spartak. </p><p>  The gladiators were, in fact, professional military.  They fought to the death in front of the public in the arenas.  Experienced gladiators were very valuable capital.  The owners took care of them and did their best to prevent the death of their slaves.  Many such gladiators received freedom.  However, they did not leave schools, but remained in them as teacher-rudiarists.  Many experienced gladiators were in the protection of distinguished persons and participated in the struggle between factions and parties not only in Rome, but also in other Italian cities. </p><p>  Spartak and his comrades, of whom Enomai and Crixus stood out, decided to form a powerful army.  They wanted to fight on equal terms with the <span>Roman legions.</span>  There is no exact answer in history to the question of whether Spartak planned to withdraw the rebels outside the territory of Italy, where he, together with the army, could engage in service to some hostile state.  Maybe he was going to seize power in Rome itself, relying on the support of the Italian peasantry and liberated slaves, thus achieving goals that the Italians could not realize during the Allied War.  In 63-62 years there was a rebellion of Catilina.  The plot was uncovered and quickly crushed by forces supporting the Senate and the Republic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="table civil wars in rome" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/838182.jpg" width="345"></div>
