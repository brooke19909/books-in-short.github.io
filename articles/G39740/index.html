Many of the needlewomen do this in a way familiar to themselves, without resorting to experts for advice.  But in vain, since there are very convenient methods for adding loops, which they are not even aware of.  Of course, experienced craftswomen cannot be perplexed by such a question, but novice needlewomen quite often ask: "How to add loops when knitting?"  We are happy to answer this question.  After learning how to properly perform this technique, you can give the knitted product the desired shape and aesthetic appearance.  Let's look at a few basic ways to add loops.

    <p>  Most often, the addition of loops from the broach is done in the center of work.  To add a loop from the broach, with the help of a working needle, you need to pick up the broach located between the two loops of the previous row and put it on the left knitting needle.  But that is not all.  Now we bring the right knitting needle under the front of the loop and knit the front loop.  As a result of this addition, neat holes appear on the knitted fabric, performing a decorative function. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Two-way broaching </h2><p>  In principle, this type of addition is carried out in a similar manner to the above.  Its implementation is possible both at the beginning of knitting, and in the center. </p><p>  For example, having completed the facial knitting of the first half of the fabric, a broach located between the just connected and central loops is picked up with the help of a working needle.  After that, place it on the left knitting needle and perform knitting of the front loop.  Next is the knitting of the centrally facial loop.  Now again, we catch the broach and throw it on the left knitting needle, and again we knit it like a facial loop. </p>

    <h2>  A variation of the method of adding from a broach - crossed option </h2><p>  This type of application completely coincides with the first option.  The only difference is that the facial loop is knitted crossed.  This version of the addition is carried out at the center of work.  To do this, the working spoke is inserted between the two loops of the previous row to capture the broach.  Now it needs to be thrown onto the left knitting needle, after which the right one should be inserted behind the back wall and knit the front loop. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Typically, this method is suitable for performing reliefs on the canvas, in the case when it is necessary to save the overall pattern.  This method can be tied, for example, tucks. </p><h2>  Cross Broach Addition Method </h2><p>  Above, we considered a one-way way of adding loops from a broach.  The method described now is similar in its execution to it.  Such an addition is performed at the beginning of the row, it is it that gives the product the necessary shape and makes it beautiful in appearance. </p><p>  We divide all the loops into two parts and define the central loop.  We knit the first part of the fabric with facial loops, then with the help of a working needle we catch the broach located between two loops of the previous row and place it on the left knitting needle.  Now, with the right knitting needle, we hook this broach behind the back wall, we perform facial knitting.  Next, we knit the central loop of the front and again we catch the broach with the help of a working knitting needle, we perform crossed facial knitting. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to evenly add loops" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17517/345022.jpg?1393784438996" width="600"></div></h2><h2></h2><h2>  How to evenly add loops around the edge of the canvas? </h2><p>  This view differs from the previous ones and is used if it is necessary to obtain a sufficiently dense edge of the canvas.  With this method, the necks, sides and other parts of knitted products are usually knitted. </p><p>  The addition is carried out at the end of the row.  To do this, you need to pick up the <span>edge loop with a</span> free spoke <span>.</span>  Then, with a working knitting needle, they perform facial knitting of this edge, grabbing it by the back wall.  Next, edge knitting is performed. </p><p>  This method of addition makes it possible to uniformly add along the entire edge of the product.  Repeat this technique is necessary in the next front row. </p><h2>  The addition of the loops of the previous row </h2><p>  This type of addition is done both at a certain point in the product, and over the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe knitted fabric.  Learn how to add loops on the needles in this way. </p><p>  Having reached the place where it is necessary to perform the increase, the working needle picks up the loop from the previous row and knits it with the front one.  Next, you need to knit a loop located above the just knitted, and then all the other loops on the spoke. </p>

    <p>  This method can also be used in the decoration of the product. </p><h2>  How to add loops on the edge of the canvas to the right and left? </h2><p>  This method is more suitable for knitting a neckline or armhole.  Using it, you will get even regular edges, which will stretch less. </p><p>  Increases are performed in the front row.  To do this, free the loops with a needle to pry the first loop and knit it with the front one.  Now this knitted loop needs to be thrown from the right to the left knitting needle and knit again in the facial way.  The addition is carried out in such a way until their required amount is typed. </p><p>  This method can also be used when it is necessary to increase several loops in a row. </p><p>  And now let's find out how to add stitches on the knitting needles along the left edge of the canvas.  Difficulties, like the previous method, such a technique will not give you. </p><p>  In this case, additions are made at the end of the front row.  Having finished his knitting, they wrap their thumb around the working thread.  Please note that its free end should be a continuation of the front wall of the resulting loop.  Then, with the help of a working needle, they pick up the thread located closer to you, catch the portion of the thread located further from you, after which the thread is lowered from the thumb and tightened on the spoke.  It turns out a loop.  Thus, the desired number of loops are added.  The necks connected in this way differ from others in their neatness and aesthetic appearance. </p><p>  Now it will be easier for you to knit beautiful and unique things, because you know how to add loops on knitting needles. </p>
