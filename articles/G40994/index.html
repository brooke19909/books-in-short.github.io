    <p>  Cottages in Madison Park embodied a harmonious combination of magnificent mansions built in a modern style, and nature, almost untouched by man.  The village is surrounded on all sides by forest, due to which, including the competent design of sites, residents can get into it directly from the sites.  Not all suburban cottages boast natural objects artificially created by developers.  For example, rivers.  This village is a pleasant exception.  A river flows through Madison Park, which was man-made by the developer of the project and along which it is so nice to walk in the evening or on a hot day. </p><h2>  Infrastructure of the village </h2><p>  The developer of the village provided for the presence of all the infrastructure necessary for a comfortable stay of residents.  Little tenants will be able to play and play sports at children's playgrounds and sports grounds.  Adults at this time can enjoy a good rest in specially equipped areas.  No one will be bored in Madison Park.  Also built a boulevard decorated with lush green vegetation.  For walks there is a luxurious park with shady places and walking paths. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The cottage community is part of the Villagio Estate club system, which gives its residents the opportunity to use the entire infrastructure offered by the system.  For example, a tennis court located in Madison Park.  For small residents there is the opportunity to attend kindergartens and schools in villages and villages located about a short drive away or in the capital itself.  There are many restaurants in the nearby villages where you can enjoy your evening.  For sports enthusiasts there are several gyms, which are also located about a ten minute drive from the cottage village. </p><h2>  Novorizhskoe highway </h2><p>  Country cottages in large numbers are available in the Novorizhskoe direction.  This is due to the recognition of the area as the most environmentally friendly zone.  What is the cottage village <span>Millennium Park,</span> which offers luxury elite mansions for lovers of a rich life.  There are also many other cottage villages and <span>residential complexes</span> located along the highway. </p><h2>  Offered Homes </h2><p>  The housing stock of the elite cottage community Madison Park is composed mostly of two-story mansions.  They are already built by the developer.  But you can also just buy a land plot with a building contract and build your dream house on it. </p><p>  All the mansions built are made according to the original author's projects, and there are none similar to each other.  At the same time, architectural styles are very different: empire, neoclassic, renaissance, deco and many others.  Decorating houses is made only of high quality building materials. </p><p>  Thus, in a series of elite cottage villages and offers of capital developers, Madison Park takes its place of honor.  He is able to provide his tenants with exactly that level of comfortable life for which they are willing to pay.  And the surrounding nature will provide them with such a life. </p>
