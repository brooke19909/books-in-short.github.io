    <h2>  Pledges and sureties </h2><p>  When deciding whether to take a mortgage, please note that in the conditions of market instability, credit organizations set strict requirements for securing a loan. </p><p>  Prior to registering the ownership of the property to be acquired in the registry, it is likely that it will be necessary to draw up not only a guarantee of solvent individuals, but also an additional liquid security deposit - an existing car or apartment. </p><h2>  Crisis Mortgage Products </h2><p>  Credit organizations are interested in attracting wealthy customers.  Mortgage banks are actively offering new products to individuals, in demand in a crisis, but quite expensive. </p>

    <h2>  Loans for the purchase of housing with state support </h2><p>  The most significant parameter when a mortgage is issued is the rate.  A calculator for calculating overpayment amounts is on the official website of each bank. </p><p>  The cost of servicing a mortgage decreases when a loan is received as part of a government subsidized loan program for the purchase of still unfinished apartments in the primary housing market. </p><p>  Banks-participants are allocated funds from the Pension Fund, due to which they get the opportunity to reduce mortgage rates for the purchase of apartments in new buildings.  Currently, PJSC Sberbank of Russia, Gazprombank, VTB 24, Uralsib, Rosselkhozbank, Promsvyazbank and many other lending organizations have joined the program. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Mortgages with state support can be obtained in the amount of up to 8 million rubles.  in the Moscow and St. Petersburg regions, in other regions - not more than 3 million rubles.  The longest loan term under the Newbuilding program, according to the rules, is 30 years.  Your contribution should be at least 20% of the price of housing that is purchased .. </p><p>  You can buy square meters from loans received under the subsidy program only from developers approved by banks. </p><p>  When applying for a loan with state support, a corresponding calculation of the mortgage is carried out.  Sberbank sets a fixed interest rate, 12% per annum, before and after registration in the registry of ownership of the acquired property.  In this case, it is mandatory to conclude a borrower life insurance contract.  For violation of the terms of the annual extension of the policy, the rate rises to 13% per annum. </p><p>  In VTB 24 PJSC, you can also get a loan with state support at 12% per annum, with the obligatory execution of a comprehensive insurance contract. </p><p>  At Gazprombank, the interest rate on mortgages is between 11.25% per annum. </p><p>  At VTB Bank PJSC, a Newbuilding loan is issued with an initial payment of 15% of the amount at 11.75% per annum.  The decision to grant a loan is made in 24 hours. </p><p>  In Otkritie FC, the mortgage rate with state support is from 11.45% per annum, mandatory payments (surcharges) in the amount do not exceed 2.5% per annum.  A large number of construction companies are accredited with the bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Credits under the program "Young Family" </h2><p>  Another way to ensure that the mortgage rate is lower is to apply for a loan under the Young Family subsidy program. </p><p>  If the age of both husband and wife does not exceed 35 years, and the couple, according to the legislation, needs better living conditions, it is advisable to contact the district administration.  When buying a house or an economy class apartment, the state will pay up to 30% of the housing price. </p><p>  At <span>banks, a mortgage</span> for a young family is usually cheaper.  Fewer multiplying factors apply to it. </p>

Sberbank, VTB-24, Otkrytie FC and other banks on official websites show only an approximate amount of future loan servicing costs. </p><p>  Check with the responsible person who is advising you: </p><p>  1. Is an assessment of the acquired property required?  If so, at whose expense is it carried out? </p><p>  2. How much will the costs of notarizing the transaction amount to? </p><p>  3. Which party to the transaction pays the state fee at the registration chamber? </p><p>  4. Will the mortgage rate be higher until the burden of pledging is registered in favor of the bank? </p><p>  5. What will be the additional payments under the loan agreement, except for the interest rate? </p><p>  6. Is it necessary to insure collateral, as well as the life and health of the borrower?  How much will the cost of policies be? </p><p>  7. What will be the loan repayment schedule? </p><p>  8. Are there any restrictions on early repayment of a loan? </p><p>  9. What fines and penalties are stipulated by the loan agreement? </p><p>  Only with complete information can you decide whether to purchase housing right now. </p>

    <p>  Competitive mortgage lending programs in the secondary market are offered by VTB24 Bank.  Its main advantage is that the down payment can be from 15% of the cost of a house or apartment. </p><p>  Loans are provided for up to 30 years at 13.5% per annum upon conclusion of a comprehensive insurance contract.  In the absence of an insurance policy, the interest rate is 14.5%. </p><p>  A 0.5% discount is granted to customers receiving salaries in accounts at VTB 24 PJSC. </p><p>  PJSC VTB Bank previously worked exclusively with representatives of large and medium-sized businesses.  However, after the takeover of <span>Bank of Moscow,</span> he began to develop the retail business. </p><p>  Since May 2016, VTB has also been offering mortgage products to individuals.  Since the retail direction of lending in the bank is only open, the mortgage rate is extremely low, ranging from 11% per annum. </p><p>  Favorable financing conditions are offered by PJSC Promsvyazbank.  The down payment for individual programs is from 10%.  The interest rate on mortgages in the secondary housing market - from 13.35% per annum. </p><p>  Inexpensive loans are issued to clients of Raiffeisenbank JSC.  Interest rates for the purchase of finished housing and apartments in new buildings for salary clients range from 11% per annum, for people who receive salaries outside of Raiffeisenbank JSC - 12.25-12.5% ‚Äã‚Äãper annum.  Down payment - from 15% of the cost of housing.  However, the maximum possible loan term is quite short, only 25 years, which affects the amount of monthly payments. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In the conditions of the financial crisis, banks are still interested in active cooperation with solvent customers.  If you have a sufficiently high income, which is officially confirmed, do not rush to accept an offer from the first mortgage center that agreed to lend you.  Look for optimal conditions. </p><p>  In conclusion, I would like to give advice, borrowed from Bodo Schaefer‚Äôs book ‚ÄúA Dog named Mani‚Äù: try to deal only with those bank managers that you like.  In this case, each transaction will be successful. </p>
