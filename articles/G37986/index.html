The memorial is a magnificent building, standing on an artificial hill in the middle of the city park.  Celebrations in honor of Victory Day are held here annually.  Now it is one of the main attractions of <span>Bryansk,</span> city <span>residents</span> and tourists visit this memorable place. </p><h2>  Where is the Immortality Barrow? </h2><p>  The mound of Immortality in the city of Bryansk is located in the park "Nightingales".  It is located in the Soviet district on the banks <span>of the Desna River.</span>  This is a favorite place for walking citizens.  The park was created in the 1960s, when it was decided to improve the territory of the ancient tract "Nightingales".  The project provided for the creation of a natural recreation area and a memorial part dedicated to the memory of those who fell during the Second World War.  In 1985, the park received the name "Central Park of Culture and Rest named after the 1000th anniversary of Bryansk" on the anniversary of the city. </p><p>  Park "Nightingales" is located in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBezhetskaya street.  The memorial part is located on Duki Street. </p><h2>  Monument History </h2><p>  The history of the Barrow of Immortality in Bryansk began in 1966.  It was decided to create a memorial in the park.  The laying of the monument took place shortly before the celebration of Victory Day on May 7, 1967.  Thousands of city residents took part in this ceremony.  The gun barrel was laid at the base of the future structure.  He was removed from the tank that participated in the battles.  A capsule was placed inside the trunk with an appeal to the descendants.  Her autopsy was scheduled for 2017. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Then a mound was erected.  Land for its erection was delivered from the soldier‚Äôs graves of the <span>Bryansk region, hero cities,</span> as well as from Shipka Pass in Bulgaria.  The ceremony was attended by mothers of fallen soldiers, veterans of the Great Patriotic War, youth and schoolchildren. </p><p>  Architects proposed several construction options.  The project was won by V. Teplyakov, who developed a monument in the shape of a five-pointed star. </p><p>  The construction of the memorial began.  Komsomol members of the city held paid concerts, the proceeds of which were transferred to the monument construction fund.  Young people organized Sunday and Subbotniks, helping to erect the Immortality Barrow in Bryansk.  In 1968, the main part of the monument was built.  This date is engraved on the board, as the year the memorial was founded.  At that time, the monument looked like a high five-sided pyramid. </p><p>  The history of the Barrow of Immortality in Bryansk continued for many years.  Only 8 years later, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe architect Teplyakov was fully realized.  At the top of the pyramid, a five-pointed star was created.  September 17, 1976 the opening of the monument.  Now this monument is the center of the composition of the Nightingale Park. </p><h2>  General description of the monument </h2><p>  A wide park alley with a fountain leads to the majestic monument.  The lower part of the Immortal Mound memorial in Bryansk is a five-sided pyramid.  It is created as an artificial embankment from the earth.  Its height is 12 meters, and the volume is about 20 thousand cubic meters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The top of the pyramid is crowned with a concrete pylon.  It is created in the shape of a five-pointed star, which consists of several petals.  Elements of the pylon are interconnected by a ring with a mosaic.

    <h2>  Time capsule </h2><p>  <span>The time capsule</span> on the Barrow of Immortality in Bryansk was laid in the foundation of the monument in 1967.  She was bequeathed to open exactly 40 years later.  On May 9, 2017, a message from the capsule was read out during the Victory Day celebration. </p><p>  The appeal of the Komsomol members of the 1960s to the youth of the 21st century was announced by the graduate of the Lyceum Egor Kelmyashkin.  In a message to the descendants, it was bequeathed to love the Fatherland, to remember the fallen heroes of the Bryansk region and to protect their native land as the apple of an eye. </p><p>  September 17, 2017 in Bryansk celebrated City Day and the anniversary of the liberation from the Nazis.  During the celebrations, a new capsule was laid at the base of the monument with an appeal to future generations.  It is a cylinder of titanium.  The text of the message was compiled on the basis of proposals from residents of the city.  Currently, the content of the appeal is kept secret. </p>

    <h2>  Viewpoint </h2><p>  Climb to the observation deck of the Immortality Barrow in Bryansk by one of the stairs.  And you can also walk along one of the faces of the pyramid.  Despite the fact that the embankment is quite high, the rise will be convenient, since the stairs leading up are wide and gentle. </p><p>  Access to the observation deck is free.  From a height of 12 meters you can see the wide alley, the park and the Desna River.  If you stand in the central part and look up, you can see how the pylon of 5 rays looks from below. </p><h2>  Stormwater System </h2><p>  The lower part of the Immortality Barrow in Bryansk is entirely composed of land.  To preserve the embankment and stairs, a constant and reliable drainage of rainwater is required.  During the construction of the building by architects and engineers, an interesting and original storm drain system was designed.  Around the perimeter of the upper part of the pyramid runs a gutter with a water outlet.  And the other part of the drain in the form of a lattice is located below the facade with a slab.  This contributes to the rapid and reliable discharge of water. </p><p>  In 2017, to commemorate Victory Day, the storm sewer of the monument was updated.  This will continue to keep the high earthen embankment intact. </p><h2>  Stele </h2><p>  In the park "Nightingales" it is worth paying attention to another interesting attraction.  This is a stella on the Barrow of Immortality in Bryansk.  It is located next to the main monument and forms a single architectural ensemble with a memorial. </p>
