The combination of circumstances that led to the birth of life on it still seems incredible to many.  People have discovered a great many planets, but why on one of them there is not what is on Earth?  Why is it so unique? </p><p>  Over the question of how the Earth arose, people have been thinking for many centuries.  Of course, no one can answer for sure, however, there are a number of very convincing hypotheses based on various <span>scientific facts.</span> </p><p>  <strong>How did the earth come about</strong> </p><p>  Earth is our home.  This is an occasion to learn all that is possible about her.  This is a beautiful planet that holds many secrets.  <span>How did the earth come about?</span>  Once upon a time, myths were born from such questions.  People imagined this process in different ways: some believed that God created it, others believed that it appeared on its own, that is, even before the birth of God. </p><p>  Note that the first scientific hypotheses, with the help of which attempts were made to give an answer to the question of how the Earth came about, appeared only in the seventeenth century.  One of them was proposed by a physicist from France.  His name was <span>Georges Buffon.</span>  According to him, our world arose as a result of a catastrophe of universal proportions.  This catastrophe itself occurred because some large object crashed into the sun.  The collision caused the spread of "spray", which, after cooling, became planets. </p><p>  Immanuel Kant also hypothesized the origin of the Earth.  His version was based on the possibility of the formation of celestial bodies.  In his opinion, the entire solar system was originally a cold dust cloud, the particles of which were in continuous chaotic motion.  They not only repelled from each other, but also stuck together like a snowball. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Pierre Laplace</span> also put forward an interesting hypothesis.  He stated that both the planets and the Sun arose from a red-hot gas cloud that was constantly in rotation.  This cloud was slowly but surely compressed.  As a result of compression, rings appeared, which eventually turned into planets.  The central clot became the Sun. </p><p>  A little later, the world learned the theory of James Jeans.  The English scientist tried to explain not only education, but also the development of our solar system.  In his opinion, once upon a time some kind of star flew by very close to the Sun.  Due to increased gravity from the Sun and this star, matter was released - planets originated from it. </p><p>  <span>Otto Yulievich Schmidt</span> was our compatriot.  Reasoning and research made him think that once there was a big cloud around the Sun.  It consisted mainly of gas and dust.  Over time, clots began to form in it, which became harder and harder and centuries later began to move around its axis.  As you already understood, these clumps, in the end, turned into the planets known to us. </p><p>  All of the above hypotheses have much in common.  With the naked eye it is clear that scientists thought in one direction.  Modern ideas about how the Solar System and the Earth appeared are based on roughly the same thoughts. </p><p>  What do scientists say today?  There is reason to believe that the planets and the Sun arose from gas and dust particles, that is, interstellar matter.  The largest clot eventually turned into the Sun.  The sun became a source of energy, affecting the remaining clots, which later turned into planets. </p><p>  Note that the shape and dimensions of the Earth are no longer the same as before.  This is proved by the fact that development is still taking place.  The <span>speed of the Earth's rotation around the Sun is</span> also changing.  Of course, all these changes cannot be just noticed - they occur once in a thousand, or even a million years. </p><p>  Yes, there is no unequivocal opinion about the emergence of the Sun and planets.  Even today, all this remains a mystery. </p>
