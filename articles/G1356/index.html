The apartments in it are quite compact and modest, which allows tourists to take advantage of a fairly budget vacation in the resort city of Pattaya.  Ambassador In Wing offers accommodation prices quite affordable.  A week stay in a double room, taking into account transfer and flight, as well as medical insurance, will cost you about $ 1,300. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Ambassador In Wing Resort is located in Thailand, about 15 km from Pattaya city center.

Hotel "Ambassador In Wing" offers a fairly budget accommodation in a chic area that accommodates several hotels of different categories.  If you do not take into account the modest apartments, as well as their small size, then guests can feel like guests of an upscale resort.  Here you can use the modern gym, several swimming pools, as well as visit chic and inexpensive restaurants and many other institutions that provide leisure activities and specialize in wellness treatments.  The problem of remoteness from the city can be solved using the services of a tuk-tuk. </p>
