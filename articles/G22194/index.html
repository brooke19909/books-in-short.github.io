True, the ocean will still be spilled in a basin or bath, and we will make waves with our own hands, but the ship will overcome them with the same stubbornness as the Fearless battleship or the Invincible cruiser from a children's book! </p><p>  Origami <span>paper boat</span> <br>  Now the question arose: how to make a <span>ship out of paper?</span>  Firstly, in order to make a model of a boat in the origami technique, or rather a steamer, you need to take a notebook sheet or A4 sheet for a printer, or you can use a regular newspaper.  The main condition that must be met before <span>making a boat out of paper</span> is that the sheet for work is square. </p><p>  We bend all four corners of the paper square strictly to the center.  We should get a new square, smaller.  Turn the product over to the other side.  Repeat this action and again get a smaller square.  And once again turning the product and folding its corners to the center, we get a square of an even smaller size. </p><p>  Turning the product on the other side, we see four angles folded to the center, which in turn are diagonally divided by openings.  Carefully and slowly, we begin to fold the model diagonally inward, while simultaneously revealing two opposite corners outward.  And now in front of us is an almost finished boat with an even stable bottom!  Only in the middle, on the so-called deck, dense undisclosed squares stick out, like small sails that make our boat look more like a boat than a steamer. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, you can stop at this stage.  But if we really want to learn how to make a boat out of paper, a steamboat with pipes, from which steam seems to be escaping, then we need to perform another important action. <br>  Take a peek into the middle of a paper boat.  Two double-layer squares abut against the center of the deck with their corners.  They are diagonally separated by holes.  And we begin to push these holes along the separation strip, as if to open the "pipe".  During this action, you should keep the entire finished model so that it does not lose shape.  The finished open ‚Äúpipe‚Äù should not be ironed, let it maintain roundness, because the pipe cannot be flat.  We do the same with the second square. </p><p>  Paper boat - Christmas tree decoration <br>  Now let's talk about how to make a boat out of paper using scissors and glue so that they can decorate a Christmas tree or hang it above a children's desk. </p><p>  Such a toy-decoration can be made even by a very small child.  Of course, adults will definitely help him!  First, draw the outline of the boat on a sheet of paper and cut out two identical parts.  Then you need to color these patterns from opposite sides, so that when you put the cut boats one on top of the other, they match the unpainted sides. <br>  Particularly creative natures can also use the application technique to make the paper patterns of the boat brighter, and the toy looks more like a real craft. </p><p>  In the middle of one of the parts on its unpainted part we put a very small piece of cotton wool to create volume.  We smear the edges around the cotton wool with glue and lay a loop of threads on top so that the cut ends of the thread fall on the glue, and the loop itself is outside.  After the toy is ready, using this eyelet it will be easy for us to hang the decoration on a Christmas tree or carnations above the table. </p><p>  If we are concerned about the question of how to make a boat out of paper, now we need to cover the entire structure with a second detail - a template so that on both sides in front of us is a bright multi-colored toy with a loop on top.  If the baby didn‚Äôt do it very accurately, and in some places the details did not match, the adult needs to cut the protruding corners with scissors.  And believe me: even among the expensive glass toys bought in the store, this slightly curved sided simple little boat for the baby will long be the most beautiful and precious decoration! </p>
