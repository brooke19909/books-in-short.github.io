Many colors flare up in front of you, eyes are scattered to keep track of each movement of individual elements.  There are truly many shades.  You can watch the game of water, light for a long time, but you can‚Äôt see the repetitions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  When to come </h2><p>  When can you see such a stunning sight as the singing fountains (Sochi)?  Opening hours from May to August daily from 20:00 - 21:00.  With the onset of September, time moves to 19:30 - 20:30, and from November 2, the performance can be seen even earlier - from 18:00 - 19:00.  This applies only to evening shows. </p><p>  During the day, you can look at the work of the fountain every half hour.  The schedule changes periodically if, say, preventive measures are needed.  Then the complex may be closed for a week. </p><h2>  Scale </h2><p>  The show of singing fountains (Sochi) is compared with the flapping of the wings of a firebird, whose image is firmly entrenched in our tales.  The scale of the structure is amazing, because the diameter of the bowl is 75 m. Each of the 264 fountains has an individual illumination. </p><p>  The guns with which the design is equipped can lift water up to 30 m.  There are 252 of them, of which 6 are considered hyper-guns, and the rest are mini-guns.  Manages the action of a specialist sitting at a special remote control.  He has the responsibility of combining all the functions performed by the structure into a single composition. </p>

The dance begins, which has a bewitching effect on the imagination.  A mysterious fog and light flare appear.  Every half hour a performance takes place. </p><p>  Through smooth movements to the sides, water is sprayed with soft waves.  This is an unusually harmonious sight.

    <h2>  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  As a rule, people who look here feel admiration and remember all the emotions they have experienced for a long time.  A musical fountain is a curiosity for many tourists, because such things can by no means be found in every settlement. </p><p>  They note the beauty and grandeur of the design, the excellent execution of an engineering idea.  Near the sculpture, a large number of people always want to enjoy the sight.  Even the locals do not get tired of admiring. </p><p>  Many come here in the evenings to relax, listen to good music and nourish the imagination with bright colors.  Such things simply do not bother, they delight every time you see them.  For visitors, these places are especially convenient because you can eat nearby, buy souvenirs.  Everything here was arranged and built just for the tourist audience traveling to Sochi for the Olympics. </p><p>  The favorite place for many to see is the edge of the square, where you can comfortably sit on a bench, relax and enjoy a great view.  Although those for whom all this is new prefer to take positions at the very bowl so as not to miss a single detail. </p><p>  However, just in this way you can narrow your review.  Focusing on one of the elements of the picture, you can not notice the rest.  The only thing that confuses people is the small number of toilets in a large area. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  People who have been here really are not averse to peeking at a beautiful place again, so they generously pour coins into the water, following a common sign.  When the Olympic Games ended, cleaning was carried out, during which they discovered such an amount of trifle that fit in three buckets.  And that‚Äôs just 25 days.  Any numismatist would be envious, because there were coins from various countries of the world. </p><p>  This place was built by the Krasnodar company Stroy International, which collaborated with WET Design, whose specialization is the creation of unique objects whose work is related to water.  Now in a sunny city called Sochi is their successful project. </p><p>  The performance, which is shown in its framework, gives all viewers incomparable pleasure because of its uniqueness and uniqueness.  This is not only a unique beauty, but also an action connected with Russian culture and folklore, which became such thanks to the chosen musical compositions. </p><p>  It is better to come to the show in advance, since when you reach the entrance to the Olympic Park, you will have to go to the right place for another half hour.  You can go to the bowl itself, but to enjoy the fullness of the picture and relax away from the crowd, if it is possible to spread the litter on a lawn covered with grass.  And, of course, do not forget the camera or camera.  Such a spectacle should be captured in order to remember for a long time the charming moments spent next to the complex. </p>
