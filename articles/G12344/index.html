How to choose a LED lamp</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, many people choose LED lamps.  Unlike conventional devices, they have quite a few advantages, among which, first of all, energy saving can be noted.  Due to the fact that tariffs for housing and communal services are constantly growing, they began to use such a light source not only in homes, but also in other important institutions whose owners do not want to overpay. </p><p>  But among all the pluses, there is one minus - the flickering of a lamp when the light is off.  There are several reasons for this.  <span>Why the LED lamp glows after turning off</span> , how to choose such a device correctly, will be discussed later. </p><h2>  Why is the lamp blinking </h2><p>  There can be a lot of problems for which the <span>LED lamp continues to light after turning off</span> .  Moreover, the device can blink not only in the off state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Why the LED lamp lights after turning off" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1998799.jpg" width="400"></div>  Some people think it's a marriage and take it back to the store.  But it's not always the case.  Here are a number of reasons why an unpleasant problem arises:

    <ol><li>  The quality of the LED lamp is affected by the rather weak driver power, which makes it impossible to make a full launch of the entire device. </li><li>  The driver rectifier is not designed for high voltage drops.  It happens that because of this, deviations in work occur. </li><li>  <span>A backlit switch</span> may also cause flickering. </li><li>  A switch that is connected correctly must interrupt the phase.  If this does not happen, that is, the gap is zero, then blinking can not be avoided. </li><li>  High-frequency waves can affect the work.  In the case when a mobile communications tower is located nearby, the LEDs will light up. </li></ol><p>  It is these reasons that explain the occurrence of flicker.  Poor dump assembly also contributes to this phenomenon.  You can fix the problem only after identifying the cause. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Troubleshooting </h2><p>  From the foregoing, it is clear that the LED lamp fails for a number of reasons.  To help eliminate an unpleasant defect, you need to understand in detail each problem.  You can fix the backlight problem.  To do this, you need to consider <span>the connection diagram of the LED lamp.</span>  It can be connected to a backlit switch.

    <p>  There is a small bulb in the switch housing that is used for backlighting.  It is part of an electrical circuit.  When the key is off, the indicator is off.  But at this time, the current goes to the lamp.  It is only necessary to turn off the key, and the scheme will change.  The indicator will glow, as all the current will be directed towards it. </p><p>  The driver capacitor is charging due to the small voltage passing through the indicator.  The LEDs receive accumulated energy.  Its small amount can cause one outbreak.  In the case when the process is repeated constantly, the flicker becomes visible. </p><p>  There are several ways to solve the problem of <span>glowing diodes</span> .  The first option is suitable only for those who are at least a little versed in electrics.  You need to find the indicator wires inside the switch and bite them with special nippers.  It is very important to be careful at such a crucial moment.  One mistake - and you can remain without light.  If there is no experience with an electrician, it is better to eliminate the cause in a simpler way.  To do this, go to the store and buy a switch there without backlight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another simple solution is suitable for people who have a chandelier at home, into which you can insert not one but several bulbs at once.  A weak incandescent lamp should be screwed into one of its cartridges.  In this case, it will repay the voltage coming from the indicator. </p><h2>  What to look for when choosing an LED lamp </h2><p>  Professional advice will help you decide <span>how to choose an LED lamp.</span>  The main parameter in this case is power.  Efficiency of lighting directly depends on how many watts a light source consumes.  If the owner of the house decided to change the usual bulbs to LEDs, then it is necessary to reduce the power.  About 7.5 times.  Simply put, if an ordinary lamp was at 75 watts, then the LED should be no more than 10 watts.  One of the most correct solutions for lighting the entire apartment will be the purchase of bulbs from 6 watts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to choose a LED lamp" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1998798.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  An important factor when choosing high-quality lighting for the home is the manufacturer.  Today, a huge variety of this product is presented on the shelves of supermarkets.  Do not take the first light bulb.  It is best to take into account the advice of specialists, and only then decide which of the lamps will be the best option. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Good and Bad LED Lamp Manufacturers </h2><p>  <span>How to choose a LED lamp</span> will help sort out the advice of experienced professionals.
