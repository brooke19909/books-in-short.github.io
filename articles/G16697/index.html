By the beginning of the 16th century, a powerful fortification system was already built in it.  Bobruisk by that time had already become one of the major centers of the Principality of Lithuania.  At the end of the 18th century, the city came under the jurisdiction of the Russian Empire and became one of the largest suppliers of forest (this event was reflected in the coat of arms).  In 1810, the construction of a new fortress began in Bobruisk, which after 2 years played a big role in protecting the city from Napoleonic troops.  Since the beginning of the 20th century, it has occupied an important place in the revolutionary movement in the country, and during the Second World War the fortifications of the city detained the invaders for some time. </p>

    <p>  At the moment, Bobruisk is one of the regional centers of the <span>Mogilev region,</span> famous for its cultural monuments and a large number of historical sites, as well as the famous balneo-mud resort of Belarus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bobruisk fortress </h2><p>  So, you have come to Bobruisk.  It is better to start sightseeing of the city from the city fortress.  Founded more than 200 years ago, it has been well preserved to our times.  Now this object is included in the list of historical and cultural values ‚Äã‚Äãof the country.  The bastion of the citadel includes more than 50 objects: the ruins of forts located between the railway and automobile bridges, barracks, Opperman‚Äôs tower, lunettes, the remains of earthen fortifications and about twenty buildings of the administrative zone. </p><h2>  Beaver Monument </h2><p>  Bobruisk, whose sights are considered in this article, is sometimes jokingly called the "city of beavers."  In honor of this, a monument to this animal is erected here.  In the center of the city stands an impressive dam builder, dressed in merchant clothes and raising his hat in a welcome gesture.  There is a sign that rubbing a chain of pocket watches on a beaver's belly can attract happiness. </p>

    <h2>  Streets of Bobruisk </h2><p>  In addition to the monument to Bobru and the fortress complex, Bobruisk preserved many interesting historical buildings on its streets.  Sights of greatest interest to tourists are located in the central part of the city, in its historical center.  For a long time it was forbidden to build houses with a height of more than two floors here, thanks to this Bobruisk retained the romantic look of the late 19th century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Church of the Virgin Mary </h2><p>  One of the most significant architectural monuments of the city is the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, built at the very beginning of the 20th century in the Gothic style.  In Soviet times, the temple was first closed and used for household purposes, and in the 58th year a significant part of the facade was completely destroyed and an administrative building was added to it.  A significant part of the church has survived to this day, in which services are carried out after restoration work. </p>

    <h2>  St. Nicholas Cathedral </h2><p>  Another <span>architectural monument of the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãis St. Nicholas Cathedral.  This is the oldest church, the first building of which was built in the early 19th century on the banks of the Berezan River.  At the end of the 19th century, thanks to donations from parishioners and money allocated from the state treasury, the church was moved to the city center.  Now, after carrying out restoration work, the cathedral again shone with all the facets of its pristine beauty. </p><p>  This church has always been and remains the main center of the spiritual life of the city, whose inhabitants consider St. Nicholas to be the patron saint of Bobruisk.  It is noteworthy that the services in the temple did not stop even in Soviet atheistic times. </p>
