They can be knitted with a hook, and on knitting needles, using various techniques and manufacturing techniques.  But for just beginning craftswomen, it is better to dwell on the option of creating a track model using two knitting needles.  It is the simplest in execution, the finished thing is obtained without seams.  To get tracks on <strong> </strong>  two knitting need one evening.  Read more about knitting these products article. </p><p>  <strong>Knitting Technique</strong> </p><p>  First of all, you need to pick up the threads.  For traces, wool and synthetic yarn are suitable.  The second is used as a sock supplement.  Needles with number four and a hook.  The beginning needlewoman, getting to work, should be able to make crochets and distinguish loops - wrong and facial.  <span>Knit tracks</span> on two knitting needles with a toe.  It is necessary to tie four rows with an elastic band, in which the front and the back will alternate in one loop.  The finished gum will be located at the bottom of the lower leg, forming the top of the track.  Next, you need to divide the canvas into two parts and mark the middle.  In the center of the toe you get a track consisting of yarn and facial loops, and knitting will go in breadth.  Forming the toe, the odd rows must be tied with purl loops, starting from the first row.  In the second row, observe this sequence of loops.  To remove the hem, not knitted, seven facial, one yarn, facial, yarn.  Then make two front loops and a double crochet, one front and a double crochet.  Complete the row with seven facial loops and one hem.  Continuing the <span>knitting of the tracks</span> on two knitting needles, even loops should be added in even rows.  By the sixth row we get nine added faces, in the eighth row there are ten of them.  This ends the formation of the toe.  The next row to perform facial loops.  To get the bottom of the track, you need to continue knitting from the middle of the part with the front surface.  To do this, add ‚Äúextra‚Äù to the main working thread and take a hook.  Knit sixteen facial loops, and knit the last pair together.  Turn the knitting over, make three seam loops, and knit the next pair again together, but now seamy.  Starting each new row, remove the first loop without knitting.  Thus, knitted footprints on two knitting needles get a finished sock.  On the spoke there is only a small row consisting of facial loops.  He will form the sole of the track.  All parts of the product must be connected using a hook.  To do this, knit a row on the knitting needles, then insert the hook into the next pigtail and pull out the working thread.  The resulting loop is placed on the knitting needle, it must be tied inside out with the bottom loop, which is the first.  Loops should be done according to the pattern.  So the back of the track will be connected.  When the part reaches the elastic, the canvas should be completed in similar rows and close the loops.  One track is ready.  In its likeness, a second one is also created. </p><p>  <strong>Baby tracks</strong> </p><p>  Knitted slippers are loved not only by adults, but also by children.  There is already room for imagination.  Indeed, for a child things are always created more beautiful and unusual.  To connect the tracks on two knitting needles for a newborn child, you need to dial eighteen loops (although this must be watched individually, depending on the specific size of the leg and the selected thread).  Tie an elastic band.  Next, use the <span>front surface.</span>  In the rows alternate the observance of the pattern and the crochets, which are then knitted with purl together with the loops located between them.  In general, one can adhere to the knitting technique already described above.  But for the baby, the little ones can be decorated with ribbons or roses made from them, you can embroider a drawing - a funny animal or a flower. </p><p>  Any novice craftswoman will be pleased to independently create such a convenient thing <span>as knitted tracks on two knitting needles, to</span> please herself and loved ones.  Give your child beautiful knitted slippers that he doesn‚Äôt want to part with. </p>
