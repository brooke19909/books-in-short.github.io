This is a university city with a rich history, which is reflected in its architecture - tourists from all over the world come here to see the old city castle, the Gothic church and other ancient attractions. </p><p>  In the 16th century, the world's first Protestant university opened, where young Boris Pasternak studied for one year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="elevation.maplogs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marburg landmarks" class="if uuid-2552543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2552543.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is Germany and Marburg located? </h2><p>  The Federal Republic of Germany is located in Western Europe and occupies 62th place in terms of area among European countries.  The capital of Germany is Berlin.  A state with 16 administrative-territorial units is washed by the North and Baltic Seas.  In the east, Germany borders with the Czech Republic and Poland, in the north - with Denmark, in the south with Austria and Switzerland.  In the west, the border with the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.165691" data-lng="10.451526000000058" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="5"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/5/4/2/4542.png"></div><p>  The city of Marburg is located on the state of Hesse and is the center of the Marburg-Bidenkopf district.  The population is about 73 thousand people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  City Attractions: Town Hall </h2><p>  One of the oldest and most beautiful town halls in the country.  The structure resembles an amazing fairytale castle.  It is made of natural stone.  The building is crowned by an original roof with small turrets.  The exterior facade of the building is decorated with an antique clock that notifies the townspeople about the exact time every hour. </p><p>  The interior of the building is also impressive.  Although the town hall was rebuilt several times, the main antique elements of the decor were saved.  Tourists are not allowed to visit the building, so you can only view it from the outside. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mrburg Town Hall" class="if uuid-2552554" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2552554.jpg"></div><h2>  University of Marburg </h2><p>  The oldest institution of higher education in Marburg in Germany, which is located in a building of extraordinary beauty.  The university began its academic activities in 1527.  The University of Marburg is a prestigious educational institution of the country, consistently included in the top 30 universities in Germany.  According to international experts, the strongest areas in which the institution confidently occupies 288th position in the world are life sciences and medicine. </p><p>  More than 26 thousand students study at the University of Marburg in Germany.  To enter this educational institution can not only citizens of the country, but also foreigners.  The university has more than 2100 teachers.  During the training, students can participate in various international exchange programs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.esosedi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="University of Marburg" class="if uuid-2552562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2552562.jpg"></div><h2>  Ernst von H√ºlsen's House </h2><p>  A low but skillfully designed building was built in the city at the beginning of the 20th century for the needs of the expanding Marburg University.  It became one of the most important educational institutions in the twenties of the last century.  It was originally named Jubilaumsbau ("Jubilee"), since it was built on the 400th anniversary of the founding of the university. </p><p>  After the death of a prominent cultural figure and politician Ernst von H√ºlsen, who oversaw the construction of the building, it received his name.  Now there is a museum, whose expositions are dedicated to the university and Marburg since its inception.  The museum is adjacent to a cultural center with a concert hall. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ernst von H√ºlsen's House" class="if uuid-2552567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2552567.jpg"></div><h2>  Marburg Castle </h2><p>  The ancient palace, which is located in the city of Marburg, rises on a hill, and therefore it is clearly visible from anywhere in the city.  An unusually beautiful castle was built in the XI century as a defensive structure.  This confirms the presence of massive towers.  It became the first residence for the counts of the Hessian landgrafism.  Over the centuries, the castle was built and expanded, which is why different parts of the building and neighboring buildings are made in different styles. </p><p>  Today, the castle houses a cultural and historical museum, the exposition of which tells about the history of the ancient fortress.  In addition, the castle hosts tours, exhibitions, concerts, theatrical performances and other cultural events. </p><div class="photo" data-original="benedante.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of St. Elizabeth" class="if uuid-2552618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2552618.jpg"></div><h2>  Roman catholic church </h2><p>  The parish church of St. Elizabeth, unfortunately, has not been preserved in its original form.  The temple, which tourists can see in this German city, was built in 1960 by the architect of Munich Armin Dietrich.  The building was designed to replace the temple, built in 1777.  The architect planned to make the new church a part of the city.  I must admit that he succeeded: huge windows on both sides of the structure, resembling walkways, seem to break the boundaries between the city and the parish. </p><h2>  Brothers Grimm Museum </h2><p>  Paul du Ri in 1714 built a small castle near the New Gallery, to which he gave the name "Bellevue".  In 1960, a museum was opened in it, dedicated to the famous storytellers and linguists Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm.  The brothers lived in this city for 30 years, working in the Elector's library, processing numerous folk tales. </p><p>  The museum exposition is represented by numerous exhibits telling about their work.  Among them, manuscripts and the first books of the authors have been preserved.  In addition, in the Marburg Museum in Germany, you can get acquainted with the work of the brother of storytellers - Ludwig, who was a talented illustrator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedition-grimm.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Brothers Grimm Museum" class="if uuid-2552620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2552620.jpg"></div><h2>  Elnhausen Castle </h2><p>  The magnificent palace complex, which is located on a hill in the vicinity of Marburg in Germany.  This estate is a two-story building with a tented roof, which was built in the Baroque style at the beginning of the XVIII century.  This is the only secular Baroque building in the district, which has survived to our days with almost no changes - it has never been destroyed or rebuilt. </p><p>  Over the course of its long history, the Elnhausen mansion has changed its owners several times and today it is privately owned. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden </h2><p>  It includes an arboretum and a city public park.  The Botanical Garden is located in the historical part of Marburg in Germany.  This is a very cozy old and picturesque park with several lakes, shady alleys, arboretum and groves, rare plants. </p><p>  In the distant XV century, the park was founded by a doctor, humanist and botanist Eurikos Kordus.  Active development and expansion of the garden began only at the end of the XVIII century.  Today, the area occupied by the picturesque garden is almost 3.6 hectares. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.avso.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marburg, Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-2552623" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2552623.jpg"></div><h2>  Tours to Germany from Moscow </h2><p>  Today, many travel agencies of the capital offer their clients tours to various European countries, including to Germany.  They can be living in the same city.  For example, tours to Berlin, Munich, Dusseldorf for 5-8 days include accommodation in 4 * hotels and a city tour. </p><p>  Tours to Germany from Moscow are popular, including visits to several cities.  You will get the opportunity to get acquainted with certain regions of Germany and even with the whole country.  The program of such tours usually includes visits from 2 to 9 cities.  The duration of the trip ranges from 6 to 18 days.  The cost of such tours depends on a number of factors and may vary in different agencies, but on average in Moscow it is from 52 thousand rubles and above. </p>
