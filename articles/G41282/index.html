  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Beautiful coffee crafts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Some people like coffee not only for its pleasant aroma and bitter taste, but also for its beautiful oval grain structure, from which it is possible to make the most unusual and interesting coffee crafts.  The same rounded elements with a small slot in the center fit into any figures, decor of paintings or photographs, of which artists make unique paintings.  Grains for work can be used both fried and green, alternating colored parts with each other. </p><p>  Crafts made of coffee can be painted using paint from spray cans.  Combine with other natural materials - cereals, beans, cones, leaves.  You can decorate your work with satin ribbons and burlap, lace and bows, make bouquets of flowers, the center of which is lined with grains. </p><p>  In the article, we consider several original options for making hand-made coffee beans from coffee beans with step-by-step instructions.  The samples presented in the photographs will help the reader better understand what the final work should look like. </p><h2>  Kitchen decor </h2><p>  Sometimes after a festive feast, the owners of the apartment have glass bottles of an unusual shape.  It's a pity to throw out, but they don‚Äôt know where to put it.  We can give practical advice: decorate and decorate a kitchen shelf or a table in the dining room with a coffee craft.  She herself will be an interior item, however, in such an impromptu vase, you can put a bouquet of dried flowers or spikelets. </p><p>  Take a look at the pictures of such bottles.  First you need to properly treat the surface of the container so that there is no trace of the label.  Then you can act in different ways.  If the bottle is completely covered with decorative elements, then you can not even paint it, if the glass surface is even partially visible, it is better to paint it with acrylic paint on the outside or inside, using a spray can.  With internal staining, a little dye is poured inward and the bottle is turned with slow movements in all directions so that all the glass is covered with the desired color.  Such a bottle dries upside down on the stem. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The craft of coffee beans is combined with a hemp rope, which wraps the main part of the structure.  Lace fabric or burlap can be wrapped around the center.  The lush fabric flower attached to the center looks beautiful. </p><h2>  Candlestick </h2><p>  You can practice making simple crafts from coffee on a round candlestick for a small candle.  As a basis, you can purchase a foam bagel in a sewing accessories store.  The lower part is leveled with a sharp cutter so that the craft stands flat on the table.  Then a layer of PVA glue is applied and grains of roasted coffee are attached in turn.  To prevent the figure from being too dark, you can additionally dilute the brown color with light cinnamon sticks and white beads of artificial pearls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coffee bean candlestick" class="if uuid-2423274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2423274.jpg"></div><p>  In the case of the manufacture of a candlestick, safety precautions must be observed, so that the product is not coated with paint or varnish so that there is no danger of fire from a candle. </p><h2>  Fragrant Valentine </h2><p>  On Valentine's Day, which is annually celebrated in many countries of the world, there is a tradition to make a heart for your soulmate as a gift to tell your beloved or beloved about your feelings.  You can, of course, give a banal card in the shape of a heart, but it is unlikely that the girl will have to keep such a sign of attention, but if you try and make a craft from your own hands (see photo below), the memory of the unusual congratulation will be in the hearts of lovers for a long time . </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to make a heart </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Valentine's beloved" class="if uuid-2423277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2423277.jpg"></div><p>  As the base, you can choose any dense material.  It can be a piece of fiberboard cut by a jigsaw, a thick packing corrugated cardboard, a heart from a thin sheet of polystyrene foam.  The only requirement is that it must be tight and not bend in the hands.  Further, the craft is pasted with burlap on all sides.  On the title part of the heart, two strips of natural lace and a small brown satin bow made of thin ribbon are attached at an angle.  One of the corners of the Valentine is pasted over with coffee grains.  Half beads are attached to the fabric at regular intervals.  Around the perimeter, coffee crafts are glued with a grain glue gun.  If desired, an aperture for a rope or ribbon can be drilled in the recess from above so that the heart can be hung on the wall. </p><h2>  Craft "Cup of coffee" </h2><p>  There are always cups and saucers in the house that are no longer suitable for tea drinking.  These are dishes with small chips or cracks.  Such products can simply be thrown away and nothing can be obtained in return, but it‚Äôs more interesting to create an original DIY coffee craft that will decorate the interior of the dining room, kitchen or living room.  The following materials will be required to perform the work: saucer;  a cup;  roasted coffee grains;  cinnamon sticks;  hemp rope or twine;  dried lemon - 2 slices;  PVA glue and glue gun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="craft cup" class="if uuid-2423288" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2423288.jpg"></div><p>  Start work with the process of pasting the entire surface of the cup and saucer with a hemp rope.  A drop of a glue gun is applied to the ceramic product with an edge and the end of the twine is applied to this point.  Then PVA glue is already used, which is applied with a brush on a smooth surface and is immediately covered with turns of rope.  It is located tightly to thread, so that the cup itself does not peek.  Be sure to wrap the handle as well.  When all the work is finished, put the cup on the saucer so that the handle is at the top, and decorate with the rest of the details.  From the coffee beans imitate spilled liquid, supposedly flowing from a cup on a saucer.  In the same way, the bottom of the plate and the central strip of the handle are formed.  Cinnamon sticks and dried lemon or orange slices are attached to the glue gun next to the cup.  The craft will harmoniously fit into a room decorated with natural materials. </p><h2>  Coffee Bean Topiary </h2><p>  Artists learned to make an artificial tree from a variety of materials.  Look carefully at the sample in the photo below.  Probably, it was such a magic money tree that grew out of five gold coins planted by Pinocchio on the Field of Miracles in the country of Fools.  It turns out that it was only necessary to plant it in a small pot, which we will try to do now. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Money Tree" class="if uuid-2423282" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2423282.jpg"></div><p>  A master class of coffee crafts in the form of an unusual topiary read on in the article. </p><h2>  Learning to make a tree </h2><p>  In the sewing accessories shop familiar to our reader, we buy a <span>foam ball of</span> small size and metal zipper.  Also needed for work is a figured pot for the base and thick wire for the design of the stem.  To attach the elements to the future topiary, get PVA glue and a glue gun.  Decoration can be done any, if desired.  In our version, this is a pair of cinnamon sticks and burlap cloth tied to a natural hemp rope. </p><p>  Begin to do with their own hands a craft of coffee from the top ball.  Some craftsmen wrap threads on the polystyrene surface and glue it with napkins so that the ball is not so smooth.  But if you use a glue gun, then this phase of work can be omitted.  First of all, they attach the unzipped zipper, fill it with coins.  Then, the resulting elevation is leveled by winding any shreds.  The circumference of the ball is pasted over with a double layer of grains.  The first is located with a central slot down.  And the second is the opposite.  From below they push a hole along the diameter of the stem stick. </p><p>  The rod itself is wrapped with a hemp rope tightly with PVA glue.  So that the wire has a larger volume, you can additionally wrap it with a cloth or napkin.  In order for the rod to hold a rather heavy structure, it is necessary to secure its lower edge in a gypsum mixture.  Making it easy.  In a separate bowl, mix gypsum powder and cool water, achieving a consistency of thick sour cream.  Until the solution has frozen, you need to pour it into the pot, but not to the top, and insert the stem of the tree there.  After hardening, the gypsum will firmly hold the craft, and its surface can be hidden under a burlap cloth and a mound of coins and coffee beans. </p><h2>  Decorative mill </h2><p>  If you decide to comfortably equip your apartment, then you can not do without various little things pleasant to the heart.  Such a mill will look spectacular in the apartment, in the office, and in the school class, and at the exhibition of crafts the first prize is provided to the master. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mill for interior room" class="if uuid-2423291" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2423291.jpg"></div><p>  Such beauty is made from waste material.  The house is a five-liter plastic container from under the water, glued with a hemp thin rope around the perimeter.  A cardboard cone is attached to the neck.  It is then that it is necessary to paste over coffee grains.  However, the mill blades, which are made from Japanese chopsticks for sushi, are first attached. </p><p>  All the crafts put on a round-shaped pallet.  It remains to create small details - sew bags for coffee beans, glue the fence around the door, doors, you can make windows and "plant" bushes or flowers near the house. </p><h2>  Wall picture "Flower" </h2><p>  A rectangle of fiberboard or cardboard is pasted over with a background of natural material.  On the sample is burlap.  Then, grains of small beans, which act as an accent bright spot in the image, are first attached to the glue gun.  The rest of the flower is laid out from roasted coffee beans. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Painting Flower" class="if uuid-2423310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2423310.jpg"></div><p>  At the corners, small decorative elements are sewn onto the fabric, for example, bows with beads in the center or a small patch of similar fabric.  Here, every master decides at his discretion.  After production, the picture is inserted into a wooden frame and a loop is attached on the back.  To make coffee grains look shiny and bright, you need to cover them with acrylic varnish. </p><h2>  Funny hedgehog </h2><p>  A toy made from natural materials can be used for additional decor of the kitchen or dining room.  Surprise guests with a fruit dish, in which there is an unexpected guest from a fairy forest.  The body volume of the animal is created from a twisted ball of sintepon, paper, fabric or cotton wool, wound with thread from the tail to the narrow muzzle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.storenvy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorative hedgehog" class="if uuid-2423330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2423330.jpg"></div><p>  It should turn out to be a rather tight bundle, on which grains of coffee, which serve as needles, are subsequently glued.  Attach them to the end with a glue gun.  You can decorate the figure of a resident of our forests with an a star anise star, tie a bow out of a rope.  The main condition is the presence in the decor of only natural natural components. </p><h2>  Clock design </h2><p>  The work of decorating the circumference of a watch is simple, but requires separate preparation.  After all, several grains are painted with golden paint.  Arrange the elements in layers, placing them in an oblique form, first to the left, then to the right.  Try to ensure that the edges of each fit closely with the adjacent element. </p><div class="photo" data-original="br.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="watch from coffee beans" class="if uuid-2423335" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2423335.jpg"></div><p>  It will be interesting to watch in which each layer will be a different color.  For example, the first is brown grains, the second is colored, the third is green coffee. </p><p>  Imagine and put into practice the acquired knowledge! </p>
