Beautiful accessories made from leftover yarn</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  You can knit a beautiful and fashionable scarf with knitting needles or crochet.  A variety of models of this necessary accessory for walking along the street and just to decorate the outfit there is a huge amount.  <span>Knitting a scarf</span> is quick and easy.  To do this, it is not at all necessary to be able to knit well, on the contrary, knitting a scarf will help an inexperienced craftswoman acquire the necessary skills and master various patterns - openwork and embossed.  Crocheting scarves is a special kind of creativity that opens up almost limitless possibilities for a creative experiment.  And, of course, the possibilities of a hook when creating exclusive things that are subject only to him must be used at 100%. </p><p>  There are many tricks in which crocheting scarves turns into a bright creative experiment to create a real art object.  Consider the simplest of them, having mastered which, it will be possible to perform more complex fantasy work. </p><p>  <strong><span>Crocheting Scarves</span> from Leftover Yarn</strong> </p><p>  1. We knit the first scarf from separate multi-colored squares made with an openwork pattern.  The squares as they are knitted are interconnected into a multi-colored, rag-like fabric, 2 squares wide and 15 squares long (30 in total).  Each square is approximately 20x20 cm in size. Knitting patterns of openwork squares can easily be found on the Internet.  Any scheme is suitable - for a tablecloth, napkin, bedspreads.  We knit from wool five colors, no more.  You can take, for example, white, black, blue, cyan and gray;  either light and dark brown, light beige, black and brick.  There can be many options here.  The combination of both <span>contrasting colors</span> and colors of a close spectrum will be beautifully obtained.  At the end of the work, we will definitely decorate the scarf with long tassels from multi-colored yarn, collecting one thread of each color in a brush. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. The second scarf will also be knitted from individual motifs in the form of small multi-colored flowers collected in a single fabric.  This is a very good way to use the remnants of a multi-colored mohair.  Knitting scarves from mohair is the creation of warm and fluffy patterns, and small crocheted flowers from mohair yarn are especially convex and voluminous.  To knit one flower, we make a chain of three air loops, close it in a ring and tie a row of 6 single crochet columns with an intermediate air loop.  In the next row we knit two air loops, a fluffy column of 3 double crochets in a single crochet of the previous row, 2 air loops, a single crochet stitch under the air loop of the previous row and so on to the end.  We connect finished flowers to each other depending on the length and width of the scarf. </p><p>  3. A very interesting way to create a scarf from the remains of yarn in the form of a chain.  The original model of such a scarf will be incredible success with others and will become an ornament of the upper dress, as well as a business suit, a plain pullover and even a light blouse, shirt.  Crocheting scarves in this way is very easy and fast.  First we knit the first ring.  To do this, measure the thread, fold it in half and twist the ring with a diameter of about 10 cm from the thread. Without tearing the thread from the ball, we tie the ring through the crochets very tightly together.  The next two rows are also knitted with single crochet.  It is necessary to ensure that the ring is flat, for this, as necessary, add columns in the rows.  We also knit the second ring, but the thread, before closing it into the ring, we pass through the opening of the first ring, and we knit the second ring already inserted into the first.  So, we repeat knitting to the required scarf length.  The color combination of the rings can be very different, but, of course, color dissonance should be avoided.  If you want to knit a wider scarf, say, two or three rings wide, then each ring in the second and third row will need to be passed through one side and one lower ring. </p><p>  With all the described methods, from a fluffy yarn of bright bright colors, you can easily knit a scarf for a child.  Crocheting scarves for children is also a very entertaining form of creativity.  After all, using this knitting tool, you can create not only colorful flowers, but also a funny face of the animal, various colored stripes, circles and squares. </p>
