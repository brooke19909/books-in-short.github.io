  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The operating mode of Sberbank in Perm. Branch Addresses</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Savings Bank of Russia is one of the most stable financial institutions in the country.  Its units are in almost every city, including the capital of the Western Urals.  Sberbank‚Äôs working hours in Perm are not too different from those used in other regions, but it has its own characteristics, which bank customers still need to know about. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="58.00552449999999" data-lng="56.203988200000026" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/4/5/4/16454.png"></div><h2>  About financial institution </h2><p>  The Russian Sberbank is the successor of the USSR Savings Bank, therefore, it guarantees its customers deposit stability and the correctness of all monetary transactions.  Most of the salary projects are serviced by this particular financial institution, and this is precisely what determines its high prevalence in the country.  Even in the most remote corners of Russia, you can find branches and banking terminals with which you can make a payment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="properm.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="operating mode of sberbank in perm" class="if uuid-3182493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/3182493.jpg"></div><p>  Information on the operating hours of Sberbank in Perm is especially important for those who have credit loans at this financial institution.  Due to a certain mistrust of terminals and payment via Internet resources, Russians continue to visit bank branches and carry out operations with the help of specialists.  In addition, Perm is a fairly large transit city.  Several thousand people pass through it every day, who should be able to withdraw and deposit money into the account, as well as take advantage of all the offers of a credit institution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dzerzhinsky district </h2><p>  It is here that one of the oldest branches of Sberbank in Perm is located, the operating mode of which has already been established and changes quite rarely.  One of the most popular and sought after is located at ul.  Lenin, 75. A wide range of services is presented here and about 20 specialists conduct daily reception, therefore the flow of customers here is usually consistently high.  On weekdays, the department is open from 8:30 to 19:30, on Saturdays from 9 to 18 hours, on Sundays, managers do not work, but you can use the services of the terminals. </p><p>  If we talk about the part of the district located beyond Kama, then there are two branches here - on the street.  Kostycheva, 42a and Vetluzhskaya, 99. On weekdays, the first of them works from 9 to 19 hours, and the second from 9:00 to 19:30, on Saturdays the specialists of both departments receive customers from 9:30 to 16:30, Sunday - output.  Despite the fact that only two bank branches are located in the left-bank part of the city, they cope well with the load, since local residents most often work in the city, and it is easier for them to carry out all their financial operations there due to the large number of branches. </p><h2>  Leninsky district </h2><p>  This municipality covers almost the entire central part of the city, as a result of which most of the financial organizations, entertainment complexes and cinemas are located here.  Especially popular in Perm is Sberbank on Lenina 49. The opening hours of this branch are different from all the others: on weekdays it works from 9:00 to 19:30, and on Saturdays from 9 to 16 hours.  The branch is located next to the central department store, so there are usually large queues here, which must be taken into account when calculating your own time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="fs-perm.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Perm branch operation mode" class="if uuid-3182494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/3182494.jpg"></div><p>  Even if you yourself specify the addresses of ‚ÄúSberbanks‚Äù in Perm, the operating hours in the branches may change periodically, which must be taken into account when planning your day.  Least of all visitors observed in the branch on the street.  Lunacharsky, 105, which is why it works only on weekdays from 9:30 to 18:30.  This option is perfect for those who have a lot of free time during the day or work nearby and can move for a few minutes during the working day to make a payment. </p><p>  Opposite the city esplanade, at ul.  Lenin, 72a, is another branch of a financial organization that provides a full range of services.  About 30 operators work here, so the average waiting time is usually no more than 20 minutes.  As for the operating hours of Sberbank on Lenin in Perm, it is one of the most convenient: on weekdays from 9:00 to 20:00, on Saturdays - from 9:30 to 16:30, on Sundays - off. </p><h2>  Where to go in Sverdlovsk region </h2><p>  This municipality mainly consists of industrial zones, and only recently have factories and military enterprises here begun to be supplanted by residential buildings.  Most often, visitors turn to the branch on Komsomolsky prospect, 72, located on the main square of the city and working on weekdays from 9:30 to 18:30.  A large number of specialists work here, which is why customers do not have to wait long for their turn. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If for some reason you do not have time to get to this branch, you can use the nearby Sberbank branch in Perm at Heroes Hassan 8, its working hours are from 9:00 to 19:30 on weekdays, on Saturdays from 10 to 17, Sunday is a day off.  A separate plus is that in the same building with the branch there are 24-hour ATMs, which is not the case in the previous organization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="properm.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank of Hassan Heroes 8 Perm working hours" class="if uuid-3182495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/3182495.jpg"></div><p>  Residents in a remote part of the district may apply for financial advice to the office located on ul.  Soldatova, 16. In the Krokhalev microdistrict, it is one of the most popular.  On weekdays, the branch is open from 9:00 to 19:30, on Saturdays from 9:30 to 17:00, and on Sunday its employees relax.  It is worth noting that this department has a very convenient location - a stop is located nearby, through which all bus and trolleybus routes of the microdistrict run. </p><h2>  Motovilikhinsky district </h2><p>  If you find yourself in the western part of the city and you urgently need to make a financial transaction, the easiest way to do this is on one of the central streets of the district - Gagarin Boulevard.  The office in the house at number 60 receives visitors on weekdays from 9:30 to 18:30, Saturdays and Sundays are weekends.  The branch in house 65a works in a similar way, where you can also make payments and withdraw money from an ATM. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vistanews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Perm branch operation mode" class="if uuid-3182497" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/3182497.jpg"></div><p>  Residents of the Sadovy microdistrict can contact another branch of Sberbank Perm on Yursha, 100, the working hours are slightly different: on weekdays from 9:30 to 19:30, on Saturdays from 9:30 to 17 hours, Sunday is a day off.  Every day, there are about 20 operators, so there are usually no special queues, what can you use if you are in a hurry somewhere. </p><p>  The Vyshka-2 microdistrict is served by a couple of branches of a financial institution, one of them is located at 19a Gashkova, and the other is at Ivan Franko, 46. The first starts at 9:00 and ends at 19:30 on weekdays, on Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday is a day off.  The second only works from Monday to Friday from 9:30 to 18:30. </p><h2>  Farther and farther from the center ... </h2><p>  Ordzhonikidze district is one of the poorest branches of Sberbank of Russia.  There are only seven of them, three of which are located on the left bank of the Kama, the rest on the right.  Among the first three, the most popular branch is 14, Williams, which is open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays and only to 16. It is located next to the main road of the Gaiva microdistrict, which is very convenient for local residents. </p><p>  In general, the operating mode of Sberbank in Perm is almost the same: most of the branches work only on weekdays, which causes a number of inconveniences to Perm.  However, due to the remoteness of the district from the center, 5 out of 7 branches work on Saturdays until 16:00.  The exception is the branch on Karbysheva 38 (until 17:00). </p><h2>  Where to go in Zakamsk? </h2><p>  Kirovsky district, completely located on the left bank of the Kama, has in its arsenal 8 branches of the country's main financial organization.  Seven of them are located quite compactly, the eighth is located in the Crimea microdistrict, which is approximately 5 kilometers away from the main buildings of the district.  The latter operates only on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays from 9 to 19 hours, lunch - from 13:00 to 14:00. </p><p>  All the other Sberbank branches in Perm do not have such luxury; the working hours of these branches do not imply the possibility of organizing a lunch break.  In Zakamsk, most of them work 6 days a week, on Sundays it is impossible to make financial transactions, and alternative sources have to be used.  The most popular is the spacious office at 36 Admiral Ushakov, where on weekdays from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and on weekends from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. there are about 15 employees who manage to cope with the queue and quickly serve customers. </p><h2>  Industrial area </h2><p>  The address of one of the most popular Sberbank branches in Perm is Mira, 45. The branch‚Äôs operating hours are convenient for many locals: on weekdays from 9 to 19 hours, and on weekends from 10 to 17. A good location near the SEC ‚ÄúCapital‚Äù, pool "Olympia" and recreation center named.  Gagarina every day guarantees this division of the financial organization a constant influx of visitors, which it is not always possible to receive on time, so the queue here is quite common. </p><div class="photo" data-original="neutralitet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="World 45 Perm Sberbank working hours" class="if uuid-3182498" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/3182498.jpg"></div><p>  The unloading function here is performed by another Sberbank branch in Perm on Mira 11, in the operating mode of which changes periodically occur.  Most often it works only on weekdays from 9:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., but when closing to repair neighboring offices, the number of working days here increases to six, the working time and the number of operation personnel are also reviewed. </p><p>  The real salvation is in the Industrial District of Perm, ‚ÄúSberbanks‚Äù in the World, the operating mode of these branches of a financial organization is structured so that absolutely all the residents of this street can pay as soon as possible.  In 112 houses there is one of the most popular branches according to reviews, customers are very satisfied with the local service and often contact it here on weekdays from 9 to 19 hours, and on weekends from 9:00 to 16:30. </p><p>  Residents of the Nagorny microdistrict most often contact a branch located at ul.  Karpinsky, 107. Despite the fact that the department works only on weekdays from 10 to 19 hours, local operators have time to timely serve all customers and provide the highest quality service.  Local residents, unlike representatives of other microdistricts, do not have to go to the center to solve their problem, because here they can fully and completely satisfy their needs. </p><h2>  Where can I go on Saturday? </h2><p>  The operating hours of Sberbank in Perm and other major cities are such that on Saturdays the branches mostly do not work.  In the capital of the Western Urals, the services of a financial organization on this day of the week can be used only in 42 branches, most of them are located on the right bank of the Kama, only six are on the left, one of them is located on the street.  Marshal Rybalko, 90 and accepts customers from 9:30 to 17:30. </p><p>  If we talk about the right-bank branches, the most popular of them is that located on the street.  Lenin, 75, it works from 9 to 18 hours and is located near the railway station, which is very convenient for travelers.  A special role is played by the fact that Lenin Street is one of the central in the city, so the flow of customers here is always quite high.  To save time, it is best to contact in the morning hours - from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., when most of the city's residents still do not conduct money transactions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yell.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Perm Addresses Operating Mode" class="if uuid-3182496" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/3182496.jpg"></div><p>  In general, making payments on weekends with the help of bank operators is a rather complicated matter, since the lines at credit organizations are quite large, and specialists can be counted on the fingers of one hand.  But if you did not manage to complete the necessary operation on weekdays, and the deadlines are tight, contact the Sberbank branch on ul.  1st Krasnoarmeyskaya, 21. Here from 9:30 to 17:30 they can help you in resolving the issue. </p><p>  Residents of Motovilikha can go to the branch on the street.  Krupskaya, 41, which is located next to Friendship Square.  Here on Saturdays, the department works from 9:30 to 16:00, while the existing number of specialists is enough to satisfy all the needs of the population.  In the Ordzhonikidze district, you can visit the unit on the street.  Akademika Vedeneeva, 51, it works from 8:30 to 16:30, and is the only one in the right-bank part of the municipality, so the lines here are quite long. </p><h2>  Where can I accept payments on Sunday? </h2><p>  On the seventh day of the week the situation becomes even more pitiable - there is only one working branch for the whole city.  To perform the necessary operation, you need to contact Perm in Sberbank on Lenin 32, the branch‚Äôs working hours on weekdays are from 8:30 to 19:30, on Saturdays from 9:00 to 17:30, and on Sundays it works from 10 to 16 hours.  You can get to it using the tram lines Nos. 4,7,11 and 11u to the stop ‚ÄúOpera and Ballet Theater‚Äù (Main Post Office), as well as using the bus route No. 3 to the stop ‚ÄúLenina St.‚Äù. Pay special attention to that public transport runs less frequently on weekends, and waiting at a bus stop can be quite long. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenin 32 Perm Sberbank operating mode" class="if uuid-3182500" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/3182500.jpg"></div><p>  Before you run to the bank, it is best to clarify whether you really can‚Äôt perform the operation you need without the help of a specialist.  At the moment, the financial institution provides quite a wide range of opportunities for its customers using self-service services, and it is quite possible that you do not have to spend a lot of time traveling to the bank and meaningless sitting in queues for the operators. </p>
