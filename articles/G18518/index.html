Since the advent of bank cards in this area, a myriad of mobile divorce schemes has appeared.  Recently, bank customers quite often receive a variety of messages from a supposedly bank containing information that a card lock has occurred.  When you receive an SMS message: “Your card is blocked by the CBR”, the main rule is to maintain calm.  Do not succumb to panic and take hasty actions - they can lead to disastrous consequences. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneycontrol.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SMS your card is blocked by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation" class="if uuid-3139130" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3139130.jpg"></div><h2>  Fraudulent schemes </h2><p>  The fraud situation itself is a fairly simple scheme.  The deceivers first send an SMS: “Your card is blocked by the CBR.  For information, call 8-800-XXX-XX-XX. ” </p><p>  The SMS content: “Your bank card is blocked by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation” can use other terms that indicate problems with the bank account: account seizure, blocking, cancellation of the contract, freezing, the card was mistakenly frozen by the security department. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First of all, it should be noted that only its holder, the bank that issued it, and also the judicial authorities have the right to block a card.  The Central Bank of the Russian Federation does not have access to confidential customer data, moreover, the country's main financial institution does not interact with individuals in any way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.businesstoday.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SMS has arrived your card is blocked by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation" class="if uuid-3139133" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3139133.jpg"></div><h2>  Excessive emotionality of the client </h2><p>  Then the scammers rely on the fact that the bank’s client will show excessive emotionality, because in such cases, if the SMS message “Your card is blocked by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation” arrives, the logical thinking of any person starts to turn off.  An careless client tries to contact the bank by dialing the indicated number, by which a girl answers him with a pleasant voice and pretends to be a bank employee. </p><p>  After that, the fraudster offers his help in unlocking the card, but notes that this will require the details of the plastic - its number, validity period, the owner’s name indicated on it, and CVC2 / CVV2 codes.  It is not necessary to look for the indicated data for a long time - the card is usually at hand, and all the required data is indicated on it. </p><p>  After a few seconds, a person who is trapped receives a message on his number about the write-off of a certain amount of money.  A substitute bank employee informs the client that he is trying to conduct a verification transaction, the money as a result of it will not be debited from the card.  This procedure is carried out solely to identify the card.  To complete the action, the person must provide the cherished password, which will be sent to the mobile phone in the form of a short message. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.financialexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Your visa card is blocked by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation" class="if uuid-3139137" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3139137.jpg"></div><h2>  Debit </h2><p>  Usually a cheated person calls the necessary password, and then the funds are debited from the account.  Then the client hears only beeps in the handset, and attempts to call back to the specified number fail.  Only at this moment a person begins to realize that he just fell for the scammers. </p><p>  If the client manages to give the fraudster all the details of the card, but does not inform the fraudster of the password received by SMS, he is strongly recommended to contact the bank immediately after the conversation and lock the card, since it is possible to debit money from it bypassing 3D technology Secure </p><h2>  Ways to identify fraudulent activities </h2><p>  When receiving an SMS: “Your card is blocked by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation”, it is first of all important to pay attention to the fact that the number from which the message was received has no connection with the banking institution that issued the card.  If a person has SMS banking connected, all messages from the bank will come from the same number, usually a short one.  For example, Sberbank's official number is 900. </p><p>  However, this is also not an indicator, since fraudsters have recently gone quite far and know how to fake bank phone numbers using virtual exchanges.  Therefore, the message: “Your Visa card is blocked by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation” can also come from bank numbers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tatango.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Message your bank card is blocked by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation" class="if uuid-3139141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3139141.jpg"></div><h2>  When can they block a card? </h2><p>  It is worth noting that recently, banks have not notified their customers at all that their card is actually blocked.  As a rule, credit institutions block in the following cases: </p><ol><li>  The account was frozen and closed by bailiffs on the basis of a court decision. </li><li>  The validity period of the plastic card has come to an end. </li><li>  There is a strange movement in the bank account, or a large amount of money has been debited from it. </li><li>  Payment systems regularly collect data on suspicious points of sale, where the facts of the theft of card details take place.  In the case when the client performs the operation using this terminal or payment device, the bank immediately blocks the plastic. </li><li>  The funds are debited from the card abroad.  In such cases, the banking organization has every reason to suspect that the plastic was stolen, and blocks it. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.bgr.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SMS your bank card is blocked by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation" class="if uuid-3139143" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3139143.jpg"></div><h2>  Calls </h2><p>  In some cases, customers receive not messages, but calls with a notification about blocking the card.  In this case, you need to consider which number the call came from.  There is a possibility that this is a real representative of the bank.  In this case, you should not give any information - you just need to immediately check your own account in any way available at the moment. </p><p>  It is very unpleasant to receive a message: “Your card is blocked by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.  What to do in this case? </p><h2>  Priority procedure for receiving card blocking messages </h2><p>  First of all, you need to calm down and make sure that the card is working, and it is not frozen.  There are several ways to do this: </p><ol><li>  You can call the bank hotline and get the information you need.  The hotline number is always present on the back of the plastic card, as a rule, its numbers are 8 800. Sberbank has two official support numbers.  Next, you should contact the operator, who may be interested in the card number, but in no case - with other details.  If the bank representative insists that you provide additional information, you should stop talking by hanging up. </li><li>  You can log in to your personal online banking account.  A list of all banking products of the client will be presented in it.  If the card is blocked, a lock will be marked on it, it will be transparent.  In some services, under the card there is an additional inscription that the card is blocked.  Similar information can also be obtained in the official applications of the bank. </li><li>  Go to any ATM, insert the card into the card reader, try to enter the access code.  In some ATMs, in case of card blocking, a record will be displayed indicating the impossibility of subsequent use of the product.  Other ATMs are programmed in such a way that they immediately withdraw blocked cards. </li><li>  Contact any branch of the bank with a card and passport, inform the employee about the problem and get all the necessary information. <div class="photo" data-original="www.stickman.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sms your bank card" class="if uuid-3139148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3139148.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  These are scammers! </h2><p>  In approximately 99% of cases, incoming messages: "Your bank card is blocked by the CBR" is sent by scammers.  In addition, it is worth remembering that real bank employees never ask their customers about the full details of the card.  The maximum information that they may need is a card number and no more. </p><p>  If it is discovered that the card is really blocked, you can only unlock it by contacting the bank branch in person.  In this case, you should take a card, passport and head to the office located nearby. </p><h2>  Card details </h2><p>  It is worth noting separately the importance of losing card details.  As already noted, the card has several details: </p><ol><li>  Room. </li><li>  Validity. </li><li>  Owner's name. </li><li>  CV code. <div class="photo" data-original="www.mcclainbank.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="your card is blocked by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation what to do" class="if uuid-3139145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3139145.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  Using these details, you can make purchases in some online stores, withdraw funds from the card.  Unfortunately, protection technology does not always help.  It is connected to almost every plastic product, but the fact is that SMS with confirmation is sent exclusively at the initiative of the Internet service. </p><h2>  Important information </h2><p>  In some large stores, this feature is disabled.  This is due to certain losses from sending SMS confirmations.  In addition, a purchase can sometimes be made without the CV code located on the back of the card. </p><p>  That is, you can use the card even if it is not on hand, but its details are known.  In this regard, it is not recommended to send photos of cards in instant messengers and social networks. </p><p>  We examined what the message “Your card is blocked by the CBR means.” </p>
