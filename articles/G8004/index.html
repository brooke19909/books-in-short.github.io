    <p>  If you wish, you can settle at the very sea and fall asleep to the sound of the surf.  In the center of the village there is also a huge number of private mini-hotels and guest houses, where you will be welcomed as friendly people by the host family.  For those who want to be alone with nature, listen to the birds singing and enjoy the smell of pine needles, at the very foot of Mount Koshka, in the extraordinary silence of a juniper grove, cozy cottages are for rent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The hotel is a five-minute walk from the pebble beach.  You can go down to the sea along the shady park alleys, enjoying the twittering of birds. </p><p>  Within walking distance is the famous <span>cypress avenue,</span> with snow-white Apollo. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are about twenty comfortable standard class rooms with a view of the sea and mountains and two VIP rooms with a huge balcony. </p><p>  One-room double and triple rooms have a small area, but they are equipped with everything necessary. </p><p>  There are only two luxury rooms, they are located on the fifth floor, have a large area and a huge balcony, which offers panoramic views of all the <span>attractions of Simeiz.</span> </p><h2>  Pros and cons of the hotel (according to vacationers reviews) </h2><p>  A special attraction of this place, according to all reviews, is an outdoor pool with sun loungers and a huge wooden deck with a gorgeous panoramic view of the Diva rock and the azure bay. </p><p>  Tourists note the high hospitality and hard work of the staff, perfect cleanliness on site and in the rooms.  The hotel has a restaurant, whose cuisine is highly praised.  Almost every guest notes its very convenient location and magnificent views from the windows and from the deck, on which, as vacationers write, you can sit for hours, enjoying the splendor of the Crimea.  Among the minuses, hotel guests note small rooms and close proximity to entertainment venues; at night, you can hear music from night clubs on the beach and from nearby cafes; some guests did not like it. </p><h2>  Hotel "Assol" - a highlight of Simeiz </h2><p>  The hotel ‚ÄúAssol‚Äù has a high rating among the hotels of this cozy corner of the Crimea, according to the reviews of the guests of the village.  Simeiz is diverse - and housing too.  This place of rest differs in that one of the buildings of the hotel is located right by the sea.  Another building is located a little higher in the park area. </p>

    <p>  Vacationers are offered rooms of various categories, which are equipped with all amenities. </p><p>  Hotel Assol has its own beach, equipped with sun loungers and umbrellas.  The hotel is surrounded by greenery of the park, on the territory there are gazebos, benches, a place for barbecue. </p><h2>  Notes of tourists </h2><p>  According to vacationers' reviews, we can conclude that the main advantage of the hotel is the presence of its own beach, as the city beach is crowded in high season.  An undoubted attraction is the location of the hotel, the park area, the peaceful silence, the air saturated with juniper.  Guests note the courtesy and cordiality of the staff.  The rooms, in principle, are not satisfactory; all visitors are delighted with the balconies. </p><p>  Of the minuses, almost all reviews say that there is no Internet and insufficient service.  Some also note that the hotel is far away from the cypress avenue and from the market. </p><h2>  Hotel "Ligo Morskaya", Simeiz.  Reviews </h2><p>  The resort complex "Ligo Morskaya" is one of the first places in the rating of hotels in Simeiz.  It is located in an old park, on the seashore. </p><p>  Rooms of different classes are rented in the main building - an old beautiful building with magnificent architecture.  There is also a guest house, which is located right by the sea. </p>

    <p>  The hotel is located a hundred meters from the beach.  The complex has a cafe "Venice", parking, there is a billiard room. </p><p>  According to the reviews of vacationers, it can be said that hotel customers note a beautiful territory, beautiful nature, but easy neglect.  The guest house on the shore of a relatively new building, so everyone was satisfied, but the reviews about the rooms in the old building are mixed.  Many recommend overhaul in the rooms and in the building, as well as improve the level of service. </p><p>  One of the minuses is the remoteness of the hotel from the center of the village, 20-25 minutes you need to go to shops and cafes, but the advantage is its proximity to the sea. </p><h2>  Hotel Aquapark </h2><p>  So, we study the magnificent and unsurpassed Crimea, Simeiz.  The hotels of this village are located not only in the center or by the sea.  On the back of Mount Cat there is a modern water park "Blue Bay" with slides and pools.  Those wishing to relax near this attraction of Crimea can choose the hotel ‚ÄúAquapark‚Äù (Simeiz), which is located in close proximity. </p><p>  Vacationers are waiting for modern cottages, with spacious terraces, as well as the main building of the guest complex with private rooms.  On the territory of the water park there are cafes, restaurants, a pizzeria, and parking.  The sea is a hundred meters from the hotel, the beach is wide and sparsely populated. </p>

    <p>  According to vacationers, the complex is decent, the cottages are cozy, everywhere is clean and beautiful.  A huge advantage of staying at the hotel is free access to the water park.  Rather, it‚Äôs almost free ... The first time you go to the water park costs 1000 rubles (an ordinary ticket is 1400), they put a bracelet on your hand, and with this bracelet you can have fun on all slides for all subsequent times and days for free. </p><p>  Of the minuses, visitors note the remoteness from Simeiz‚Äôs civilization and the rather high price of a stay, an order of magnitude higher than in other hotels in the village. </p><p>  The rating of the hotel ‚ÄúAquapark‚Äù is not too high, perhaps this is due to the price. </p><p>  All the splendor of Crimea - the sea, picturesque mountains, paradise nature - are concentrated in the village of Simeiz.  Hotels of this cozy corner await vacationers and guarantee an unforgettable vacation on the Black Sea. </p>
