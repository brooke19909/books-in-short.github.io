But to master it, at least try to do it, is recommended to everyone.  With proper <span>planning, financial</span> problems are not terrible.  They simply will not be.

    <p>  <span>The family budget</span> refers to all financial receipts per family per month.  And planning it is a waste to be done.  Many do not know how to spend money.  Hence, when distributing the income received, certain problems arise.  What can help not get into the financial hole, not wallow in debt, live within our means, and also save some of the money for a rainy day?  There are many different tips and tricks.  The following are the best and most effective. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Analysis of past purchases </h2><p>  The first stage is an analysis of all purchases made last month.  Some are not able to distribute funds correctly.  And so they find themselves in a financial hole.  To understand what the mistake was made, you need to look at all purchases. </p><p>  It is likely that a lot of money is spent on not the most important things.  Quite often people after receiving a salary spend most of their finances on entertainment, but then they don‚Äôt have enough for what is needed.  Of course, this is not worth doing.  It is for this reason that it is necessary to analyze everything purchased.  Each person will certainly find a whole list of what one could do without.  Only the prudent will not have such a column.  But such people, and without analysis, are perfectly planning the family budget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="home accounting" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1443527.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Priorities </h2><p>  How to manage money?  The question is difficult.  After all, each person has his own income, as well as his own requests for life.  And the priorities are also different for everyone.  After analyzing the purchases, you will have to break them down into several components.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  first necessity (high priority); </li><li>  necessary; </li><li>  desired; </li><li>  unnecessary. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, everything that is not included in the first 2 columns can be excluded from future expenses.  And first of all, spend money only on the most necessary and important for life.  The balance of funds or put aside, or spend on what you want.  At first it will be difficult to determine priorities, but over time this problem will disappear. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mandatory components </h2><p>  What can I spend money on?  It has already been said - all people have their own requests for life and spending.  Nevertheless, everyone has obligatory expenses.  Usually they converge.  Funds from the family budget should primarily be spent on priority items. </p><p>  What do they relate to?  As a rule, obligatory expenses in each month include: </p><ul><li>  communal payments; </li><li>  training (in the presence of children); </li><li>  medicines; </li><li>  clothes; </li><li>  footwear; </li><li>  <span>travel / transportation expenses</span> ; </li><li>  products. </li></ul><p>  All these are necessary purchases.  Entertainment at the initial stage of budget planning is better to exclude.  Then it will become noticeable how much money remains at the end of the month.  And they can already be spent wherever you want.  Or put it off. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to manage money" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1443526.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Products </h2><p>  How to spend money on products?  Many people ask just such a question.  Practice shows that huge expenses are associated with nutrition.  That is why it is important to remember a few rules that contribute to savings. </p><p>  What to advise to people who do not know how to spend less money?  Regarding the purchase of products recommend: </p><ol><li>  Explore stocks in stores.  During them you can save a lot. </li><li>  Procure for the future.  This may include the purchase of: cereals, pasta, canned food, "freezing".  Especially when it comes to acquisitions on profitable stocks. </li><li>  Purchased at wholesale bases.  They are in every city.  This solution allows many to save very well.  Shopping for the future, and even at reduced prices - this is the key to success. </li><li>  Make a shopping list.  And, most importantly, do not retreat from it.  No extra products, even if you really want to.  It will be difficult at first, but you need to try. </li><li>  No to fast food and cafe.  While a person thinks about how to spend money, it is not recommended to eat in a cafe and fast food.  Even the most ‚Äúmodest‚Äù lunch will cost a lot.  It will be possible to return such food only after a well-developed budget planning system. </li></ol><p>  There is nothing difficult about this.  It is enough even to highlight the necessary components among the products and those that can be dispensed with.  It is recommended to cook at home to the maximum.  A good hostess will cook most of the expensive treats at home.  For example, delicious pizza.  Both inexpensive and tasty! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Collect checks </h2><p>  The next tip is to collect checks.  All purchases that have just been made must be recorded.  And checks help perfectly in this.  They contribute to the correct analysis of all acquired. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to spend less money" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1443528.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The main thing is not to forget to consider anything.  This is the key to successful budget planning.  Through checks, you can understand where and what is more expensive, what expenses can be excluded.  Actually very good advice.  But following it will be extremely difficult.  Even the bus ride will have to be fixed.  However, the presence of checks greatly simplifies the accounting of purchases.  Especially when they are entered in the corresponding table of expenses. </p><h2>  Expense table </h2><p>  Home bookkeeping is something that requires careful planning.  The correct budget allocation will help you quickly learn how to save and live within our means.  To record all purchases and then analyze them with maximum accuracy, it is proposed to maintain a table of expenses.  And including income. </p><p>  It is by this principle that home accounting is conducted.  The table may have different expenses.  But, as a rule, the most primitive summary sheet contains the following points: </p><ul><li>  income from each family member; </li><li>  products </li><li>  communal payments; </li><li>  clothes; </li><li>  travel; </li><li>  household goods; </li><li>  footwear; </li><li>  training; </li><li>  accumulation; </li><li>  products </li><li>  medicines; </li><li>  gifts; </li><li>  totals (for expenses at the end of the month, for income, differences between profit and expenses); </li><li>  other things. </li></ul><p>  Every day, based on checks, you will have to write down expenses here.  Up to a day of completed purchases or regular profits.  Some paint the item "products" separately.  In order not to deal with this problem, you can simply attach checks.  It saves time well. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="be able to spend money" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1443530.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Balance at the end of the month </h2><p>  Accordingly, all this will help to answer how to spend money.  Most likely, some amount at the end of the month will remain "free".  It can be spent on additional desires.  For example, going to a cafe with the whole family.  Or a gift for a child.  The main thing is that you can spend the "free" amount of money at your own discretion.  Or put off. </p><p>  It is recommended to distribute funds from time to time so that the balance at the end of the month increases.  Not necessarily, but it is advisable to do so.  When all the necessary purchases are made and <span>obligatory payments</span> are closed, you can give some freedom in spending. </p><h2>  How to save money </h2><p>  Some are interested in how to properly manage money and still learn how to save.  This is actually not so difficult.  Especially if you follow all the previously listed tips. </p><p>  By the way, you can save money on a monthly basis, while maintaining "free" money.  How exactly?  There is one rather interesting method.  He helps a lot. </p><p>  It is about putting aside a certain amount of all income received in an envelope or in a bank.  What has been postponed is not taken into account in family accounting.  That is, upon receipt of a salary, it is required to remove the agreed amount, thereby forming a ‚Äúsafety cushion‚Äù.  Usually people save 10% of the profits. </p><p>  What does it mean?  An example would look like this: </p><p>  A person earns 25,000 rubles.  Plus, he makes a monthly profit from renting an apartment of 5,000. Monthly income will be 30 thousand rubles.  From this amount, 10% is removed "into the envelope" immediately.  And an inviolable stock is formed.  27,000 remains for all expenses. This amount is distributed according to the compiled table of the family budget for expenses: obligatory, desired, <span>utility bills.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can you spend money on" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1443529.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A very good way to save and create savings.  Many, as already mentioned, are encouraged to open a deposit in the bank and transfer money there.  This will help not to touch the funds and save them.  In any case, the <span>‚Äúuntouchable reserve‚Äù</span> must be in a difficult access.  Only in emergency situations is it possible to spend accumulation data. </p><h2>  Plan and facts </h2><p>  How to spend money in the family?  Those who have already mastered the previously listed methods can slightly expand the table of income and expenses.  And add to it such components as the "plan" and "in fact." </p><p>  In the first column, it is necessary to prescribe in advance what expenses and for what amount are planned.  The second includes information on real costs.  Quite an interesting way to plan for "free money."  It is recommended that the column "in fact" be reduced monthly.  Just like the plan section.  Of course, given the fact that a decrease in these indicators does not harm the life and well-being of the family. </p><h2>  No to loans </h2><p>  How to spend less money?  Some people think that loans are a good way to save money.  In fact, the majority of citizens who have learned to live within their means, and also to put off well, say the opposite. </p><p>  It is not recommended to take loans when planning a budget.  But you do not need to exclude them from the pivot table if available.  Lack of loans is a positive prospect.  If a person has no debts, then the previously paid amount can be deferred for a rainy day. </p><h2>  Personal needs </h2><p>  How to spend money?  Some do not understand this.  If we are talking about one person, then there are no special problems with budget planning.  But as soon as the family appears, certain difficulties arise, as has already been said. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="family budget example" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1443524.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The thing is that everyone has personal needs.  What every person wants for himself personally.  During training in planning and conducting home bookkeeping, you need to push your desires into the background. </p><p>  By the way, it is recommended to distribute all "free" money at the end of the month between family members for personal needs.  Or enter separate columns in the table of expenses and income for this purpose.  Allocate a fixed amount of money to everyone for their desires. </p><h2>  Example </h2><p>  That's the way to keep a family budget.  The example table that follows is by no means the most advanced method.  Rather, it is suitable for beginners.  Through it, you can easily learn to distribute finances so as not to fall into a financial hole. </p><p>  An approximate table of expenses and income looks like this. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td align="center">  <em>Article</em> </td><td align="center">  <em>Plan</em> </td><td align="center">  <em>Fact</em> </td><td align="center">  <em>Difference</em> </td></tr><tr><td align="center">  Income </td><td align="center">  50,000 </td><td align="center">  50,000 </td><td align="center">  0 </td></tr><tr><td align="center">  Products </td><td align="center">  10,000 </td><td align="center">  11 500 </td><td align="center">  -1 500 </td></tr><tr><td align="center">  Communal payments </td><td align="center">  5,000 </td><td align="center">  4,500 </td><td align="center">  500 </td></tr><tr><td align="center">  Household chemicals </td><td align="center">  1,000 </td><td align="center">  0 </td><td align="center">  1,000 </td></tr><tr><td align="center">  Personal needs </td><td align="center">  5,000 </td><td align="center">  8,000 </td><td align="center">  -3,000 </td></tr><tr><td align="center">  Directions </td><td align="center">  10,000 </td><td align="center">  7,000 </td><td align="center">  3,000 </td></tr><tr><td align="center">  Total </td><td align="center">  31,000 </td><td align="center">  31,000 </td><td align="center">  0 </td></tr><tr><td align="center">  Delayed </td><td align="center">  5,000 </td><td align="center">  5,000 </td><td align="center">  0 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  This, as already mentioned, is far from the most common option for cost accounting.  But he helps at first.  In general, planning a home budget is a crucial moment.  And it is recommended to entrust this lesson to those who do it best.  A little patience and strength - and it will be possible to learn how to distribute funds without problems, as well as save well. </p>
