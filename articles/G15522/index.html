Making a loan in financial institutions makes it possible to make a bargain, find the right amount at the right time, or buy a property using a mortgage.  Many attractive offers can be found among Raiffeisenbank's <span>loan programs</span> . </p><h2>  What is a mortgage? </h2><p>  Mortgage means a <span>pledge of real estate.</span>  It can be used to buy a home on credit.  It is allowed to apply for a loan with one or several agreements (credit, mortgage).  They regulate the status of participants (the bank is the creditor, the borrower is the debtor) and the conditions for repayment of the debt.  The bank's client is obliged to repay the debt according to the schedule of payments, taking into account interest in the presence of debt.  Some organizations require a mortgagor under a mortgage agreement that will provide their housing as collateral.  A mortgage is necessarily registered in the Unified State Register of Rights to Real Estate and Transactions therewith. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calculate mortgage Raiffeisenbank [" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15256/1734935.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to choose a mortgage loan? </h2><p>  Before choosing a mortgage, the client must conduct a thorough comparative analysis of the offers of different banks.

It is necessary to have the necessary amount of the down payment, to adequately analyze your possibilities for making regular payments on the loan, to choose the most profitable and convenient way to repay the loan.  The client must independently study the mortgage agreement before signing, and clearly understand for himself the full cost of the loan, the amount of the total overpayment.  If in doubt, you should consult a lawyer.  But in most cases, the best option for all categories of customers is a mortgage (Raiffeisenbank).  Feedback on the organization‚Äôs work is mostly positive.

Raiffeisenbank makes it possible to arrange it by receiving a personal consultation online or by contacting a bank branch.  It is important to remember that registration of an insurance contract is mandatory when opening a mortgage.  Its conditions are different and depend on the type of loan program.  They may include insurance against the risk of death of the borrower, the mortgagor, permanent disability, the risk of loss, damage to the property or only the section on insurance of the risk of loss, damage. </p><p>  But in the latter case, the interest rate will be increased by 0.5-3.2%, depending on the age of the client.  If desired, the insurance company can be replaced during the term of the loan agreement, but the conditions must necessarily comply with the general requirements for insurance conditions put forward by the Raiffeisenbank - Mortgage program.  The calculator on the organization‚Äôs website will help to make rough calculations. </p><h2>  Debt repayment methods </h2><p>  The regularity of loan repayment payments ensures positive dynamics of the borrower's obligations to the bank and minimizes the risk of accumulation of penalty interest.  If necessary, the client can change, adjust the payment schedule, having reached an agreement with the administration of the bank, and simplify the payment of the mortgage.  There are several ways to pay off debt.  A person can choose any of the most comfortable and beneficial for himself: </p><ul><li>  POS-terminals, ATMs of Raiffeisenbank, MDM Bank with the Cash-in function; </li><li>  transfer from a card of another bank or wire transfer from a third-party financial institution; </li><li>  cash desk of Raiffeisenbank; </li><li>  terminals, ATMs of Binbank and Moscow Credit Bank; </li><li>  Qiwi terminals </li><li>  money transfers through the Golden Crown payment system; </li><li>  via Raiffeisen Connect (RC). </li></ul>
