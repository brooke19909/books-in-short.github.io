  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to restore a loop: expert advice</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cables are a type of wire that are used to connect various printed circuit boards and electronic elements inside the device.  They have many varieties and features of soldering.  Depending on the internal cross section of the installed contacts, the conductivity will be higher or lower.  This also applies to the type of soldering material. </p><p>  If the question arises, how to restore the loop when it is damaged on its own, then many different nuances should be taken into account.  The article will describe the basic elements and provide information on how to solder contacts on various devices. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Before you begin to consider the question of how to restore a broken cable, you should study its features.  Depending on the type of device or printed circuit board, this type of wire can be either flat or circular.  In addition, various elements in the form of technical varnish, graphite spraying or rubberized braiding can be applied over the contacts and the conductor itself. </p><p>  If the cable is damaged on the mobile modules of the device, for example, on the print head of the printer, then it is necessary to strip the contacts from the rubberized braid.  Cables on screens and phones can be applied on top of a silicon printed circuit board.  They have a flat look and are protected by graphite spraying. </p><h2>  Appointment </h2><p>  The main purpose of each loop is to transmit a short or long electrical pulse between the modules of the device.  Depending on the type and thickness, as well as the material of the conductor, the signal is transmitted at a certain speed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This is important to consider, because if you need to replace the conductive element itself, you will need a copper wire of the necessary alloy.  Otherwise, contact may not occur.  Cables are conveniently placed in compact equipment models due to their small size.  Often this type of connection is used in mobile phones, laptops or screens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": chaoticandrandom, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loop mount" class="if uuid-2945271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2945271.jpg"></div><p>  Conductors can vary in the number of wires and contacts inside.  Loops with a single conductor element are usually installed on top of silicon boards.  If you need to connect a screen or hard drive, then a multi-threaded connection type will be used.  It can have up to 40 grip points.  It is these loops that are most often susceptible to damage, since soldering occurs at all contacts.  In case of damage to at least one of them, the device will cease to function normally. </p><h2>  Damage Faults </h2><p>  To determine that the equipment is damaged due to the loop is quite simple.  If you look at the screen of a laptop or TV, then due to damage to the conductor, the matrix will blink or the image will partially disappear.  This is due to the fact that such a channel for connecting to the main board is responsible for projecting the signal.  The damaged area will be broadcast with interruptions in the image exactly in the place of soldering contacts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.openobject.org" data-author=": SCOTT, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loop break" class="if uuid-2945288" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2945288.jpg"></div><p>  In any case, you can verify that the problem is in the loop, you can only by disassembling the device itself and checking the voltage at each of its contacts.  Typically, such interruptions are visible to the naked eye. </p><p>  Of the main visual signs of damage, the following are distinguished: </p><ol><li>  Darkening in places where the loop core is located. </li><li>  Kinks and tears on the tape. </li><li>  Damaged solder contacts. </li></ol><p>  In any case, ordinary glue cannot fix such problems.  Here you will need rosin, tin, alcohol and a soldering station. </p><h2>  Which devices often need repair </h2><p>  Every time the owner of household appliances and electronics is faced with the question of how to restore the cable, he should understand that the operation of soldering or stripping contacts carries a certain risk.  Correcting the problem on the loop without the necessary tools or materials, there is a risk of damage to neighboring modules. </p><p>  Frequent customers of workshops are the owners of: </p><ol><li>  TVs, monitors, laptop screens. </li><li>  Keyboards </li><li>  Laptop and pc. </li><li>  Phones. </li></ol><p>  The problem is not in the quality of the conductors themselves, but in the risk of their damage.  If we consider a mobile phone, then the loop is mainly damaged due to contact with the liquid.  As a result, the contacts burn out at the soldering sites. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Keyboard wires wear out as a result of the frequent use of keys and switches.  This leads to the fact that the conductor itself erases with time and conductivity decreases.  If we consider laptops and personal computers, then the problem may arise due to a power surge or improper connection of the conductor itself. </p><h2>  Screens </h2><p>  The question of how to restore the display cable is rather complicated.  It all depends on the brand and model of the matrix and the boards to which such a screen is attached.  It can be a laptop, monitor, tablet, candy bar or TV.  Each of the listed devices uses its own soldering method and technology for applying binder materials. </p><p>  Damaged contacts on the clutch must be completely cleaned.  To do this, you can use a blade or scalpel.  Then you need to strip the wires to fix them in place of soldering with the board.  It is better to use a soldering iron with a small tip to prevent tin from getting on other elements.  If you need to grow the damaged area in case of breakage or bending, then you need a similar model of wire.  You can find it on the radio market or on the Internet, on thematic resources. </p><div class="photo" data-original="assemblergames.com" data-author=": Ghudda, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Screen mount" class="if uuid-2945289" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2945289.jpg"></div><p>  Considering the question of how to restore the loop on the matrix, it is necessary to test each connected element or contact before starting the repair.  This is done with a voltmeter.  It shows the voltage in each section.  This must be done in order to not only find the source of damage, but also its cause, which may be a damaged part. </p><h2>  Keyboards </h2><p>  Frequent customers of workshops with a question of how to restore a loop on the keyboard are lovers of computer games and constant correspondence.  It is a common practice when the keyboard becomes unusable after several years of active use. </p><p>  The frayed train will have to be replaced.  For these purposes, a copper wire of a suitable cross section will be required.  The contact itself is flat and is located over the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe printed circuit board, which is responsible for transmitting information after pressing a specific button on the keyboard.  You will need to strip the varnish layer and remove the frayed wire.  After that, a new one is put in its place and fixed with conductive glue.  Then technical varnish is applied. </p><p>  Recovering a keyboard cable is easy.  If the actions are performed correctly, the operation will take no more than 30-40 minutes.  The main thing is that all contacts are well treated with varnish and glue. </p><h2>  Laptops </h2><p>  There are several ways to restore a laptop cable.  The contacts and wires located on the motherboard are of a removable type.  If damage is detected, it is better to replace the wire itself.  It costs much less than the materials that will be required to restore it. </p><p>  If the components did not work out, you can replace it.  To do this, you need to choose a suitable wire for the cross section.  This method is not suitable for multi-core loops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.commentreparer.com" data-author=": chiara, "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV cable" class="if uuid-2945296" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2945296.jpg"></div><p>  Damaged conductor is removed from the contact point on the board.  After that, the braided wire is carefully threaded into the forks at the grip points.  They use latches, so you can fix them with a flat screwdriver. </p><p>  If you want to restore a multi-core loop, then you should clean the place of damage and increase the breakage with the help of a conductor composition.  Conductive glue is often used for these purposes. </p><h2>  Phones </h2><p>  Another popular question is how to restore a loop on the phone after it gets into the water.  Upon contact with it, the screen of the mobile device begins to darken.  This is a sign that the loop contacts on the matrix are damaged. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kaizerpowerelectronics.dk" data-author=": Kaizer Power Electronics, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone cable" class="if uuid-2945277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2945277.jpg"></div><p>  In order to fix this, you will need to replace the conductor.  It must be carefully cut off from the place of fixation on the main board and disconnected from the phone screen.  After acquiring a new wire, it should first be soldered to the main board exactly to the place where the old conductor was.  Next, the contacts are attached to the matrix of the smartphone. </p><h2>  What you need to know about recovery </h2><p>  If we talk about how to restore a track on a loop, then first of all, you should understand the procedure for repairing such a conductor.  The peculiarity of the tracks is their presence not in a protected casing or braid of rubber, but on the printed circuit board itself. </p><p>  The main difficulty is that the contacts are flat, and in order to remove them, it will be necessary to clean the main layer of protective varnish.  To repair the damage, they can be replaced with wires and a round copper line.  The conductor is fixed with conductive glue.  After that, varnish is applied on top. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": zqdrone, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Video loop" class="if uuid-2945275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2945275.jpg"></div><p>  When connecting a stranded conductor, it is important that each individual contact is well soldered.  You can verify the conductivity of all flows using a voltmeter. </p><h2>  What materials and tools will be required </h2><p>  Analyzing the question of how to restore a track on a loop, you need to know what is needed from materials and tools to perform this action. </p><p>  In most cases, when repairing or replacing the conductor, a soldering iron or soldering station will be needed.  When using the nozzle, it is important to install the needle as a heater, since it is precisely it that will allow you to accurately apply tin to grip all the elements. </p><p>  Technical varnish and conductive glue will also be needed when repairing the cable.  Depending on its type and shape, you will have to purchase consumables in the form of wires of the desired size and cross section.  In order to increase the adhesion accuracy of each element, it is advisable to use a magnifying glass or a microscope. </p><h2>  How is the repair carried out </h2><p>  There are several ways to restore loop contacts.  The main and simplest of them is the use of conductive glue.  It can be found in specialized equipment repair shops. </p><p>  All types of work differ depending on the model of the device and the nature of the damage.  The general recovery order is as follows: </p><ol><li>  To clean a loop in the place of damage. </li><li>  Remove damaged area. </li><li>  Apply glue or install a new conductor. </li><li>  Fix the wire at the docking point. </li><li>  Using a soldering station, apply tin for docking. </li><li>  On top of the conductor, apply a protective layer of varnish or wrap the conductor with electrical tape. </li></ol><p>  Do not immediately start the device, since the protective layer of varnish or tin may not completely harden.  It is important to be careful when applying all liquid solutions to the circuit board so as not to catch other conductive elements. </p><h2>  Precautionary measures </h2><p>  Analyzing the question of whether it is possible to restore the loop, it is important to know what problems there may be with this action.  It independently does not recommend soldering the conductor in modern smartphones.  Unlike old phone models, matrix repair will require special equipment.  At home, using a blowtorch, this will not be possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tfix.co.uk" data-author=": DJI Mavic Pro, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loopback" class="if uuid-2945283" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2945283.jpg"></div><p>  When replacing the conductor, set only identical.  If you replace it with a high- or low-conductivity, as a result of a power surge, the connected element can completely fail.  After replacement, all cleaned elements must be covered with a protective layer.  Do not leave them open, as this can lead to overheating of the conductor itself. </p><h2>  What to do if the loopback failed </h2><p>  Having figured out how to restore the loop, you can get to work.  To achieve a successful result, it is necessary to carefully perform each step and carefully apply a soldering binder.  Only after the applied mass has hardened can the device be tested.  To do this, check the voltage level on the connected element with a voltmeter. </p><p>  If there is no voltage, and the loop itself does not work, it is better to contact a specialized workshop for help.  Not all parts and cables can be glued or soldered at home. </p><p>  However, experienced specialists note that a set of tools and materials will not be enough to solder.  For this, expensive equipment and various devices are used, which it will be problematic to independently acquire.  Therefore, to avoid the risk of damage, it is best to immediately seek the help of professionals. </p>
