    <h2>  Bars and Restaurants </h2><p>  Fruits, freshly squeezed fresh juices, tasty fish - these are some of the delights associated with many Dominican people.  The Hard Rock Hotel, the description of which arouses the desire to spend your vacation right here, boasts another significant advantage over many other hotels.  And these are great restaurants with a huge selection of dishes and quality drinks. </p><p>  There are places for every taste and color.  For example, the American cafe Cafetto and the institution Pizzeto, which serves surprisingly delicious pizza cooked in a stone oven.  There is also The Market, where guests are served buffet style, as well as the Mexican restaurant Los-Gallos.  An institution called Zen will appeal to lovers of Asian cuisine, because they serve excellent sushi and arrange a spectacular teppanyaki culinary show.  The hotel also has the upscale Italian restaurant Ciao.  If you want to spend the evening there, then you need to book a table in advance. </p><p>  Delicious Brazilian grills are served at Ipanema, while Caribbean delights are served at Isla.  There is also a Toro steak house that fans of American style will enjoy.  The atmosphere there is amazing. </p><p>  And of course, the hotel has many bars.  To be more precise, there are fifteen of them.  All of them are dispersed throughout the hotel.  Several in the lobby, a certain amount in the pools, one in the casino, etc. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that guests can enjoy breakfast, dinner, lunch or a snack right in their room, without leaving its walls.  It is enough to simply call the service desk available in all apartments and make an order.  This can be done at any time of the day, at least at 4 in the morning.  Service round the clock. </p>
