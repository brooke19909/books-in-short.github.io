In Europe, this city is known for its interesting and diverse cultural life.  Every year, international film and theater festivals are held here, for example, the Altƒ±n Koza International Film Festival, which has been held since the late 60s of the last century.  Touring concerts of classic and world pop stars and various large-scale events are also frequent. </p>

    <p>  Adana is not a seaside resort, so it is often not interesting to beach lovers.  However, it is only 50 km from here to the coast.  And the guests of the city, after exploring all the sights of Adana, can go to the coast in Mersin or Tarson and enjoy the sea beauties and magnificent beach vacations.  And Adana is located on the banks of the Seyhan River, or rather, it is divided into two parts.  Most hotels in the city are located in such a way that they offer beautiful views of the river landscapes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The city of Adana (Turkey), which is the fourth largest and largest city of the Republic of Turkey, in ancient times was under the rule of the Roman, Byzantine Empire, the Kingdom of Cilicia, etc.  The city has a history of many thousands.  According to legend, it was founded by Adanus - the son of Uranus.  Hence the name of the city.  Only the last 6-7 centuries, Adana was first part of the Ottoman Empire, then the Republic of Turkey. </p><p>  Today the city is divided into two parts: the old (with mosques, noisy oriental bazaars, hotel-sheds) and modern, which is known in the world as the new Europeanized city of Adana.  Turkey (see photo in the article) is considered a European country, but if you look closely, it represents a mix of several cultures throughout its territory: Muslim and Christian, Eastern and Western, European and Asian. </p><p>  Adana, although it was conquered by the Ottomans in the 14th century, was considered an Armenian city until the beginning of the 20th century.  Ever since the time of Tigran the Great, this city was part of <span>Great Armenia,</span> the second time it passed into the hands of Armenians during the time of the Cilician kingdom.  Since then, most of the population of Adana (more than 70%) were Armenians.  In 1909, 6 years before the date of the Genocide, the Young Turks staged pogroms in the city and massacred the Armenian population of Adana.  The city was aflame, rivers of blood flowed, but some indigenous people still managed to hide from their pursuers, they soon found refuge in neighboring countries: Syria, Lebanon, Greece, Kuwait. </p>

    <p>  Today, during city tours, Turkish guides do not mention a word that the Armenians once lived here, that many of the sights of the city were created by masters of this ancient people.  In the vicinity of the city you can see the ruins of the fortresses of the Cilician kings and princes, which are unique monuments of medieval architecture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  Adana can be reached by air, rail and road.  Turkish domestic flights from Istanbul, Izmir, Antalya and the capital of Ankara fly here.  Sakirpasa Airport is located on the outskirts of the city.  From here, the center can be reached either by taxi or dolmush, which is much cheaper.  You can also get to Adana from the capital and Istanbul by train or comfortable regular buses.  Two city bus stations are located in the city center, in the immediate vicinity of the five-star Hilton Hotel and 4 km from the center.  By the way, the city has a subway, which is very convenient for exploring sights and museums. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  A mild and comfortable climate is what attracts Turkey.  Although Adana is not a sea resort, it is also located in a very favorable climatic zone.  It is never cold here, but there is also no sweltering heat.  In summer, the air temperature warms up to a maximum of 32-33 degrees.  There is not so much rainfall in the summer to spoil the vacation of visiting tourists, in the winter period it rains here, once or twice a season can snow. </p>
