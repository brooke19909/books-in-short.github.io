  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Supreme Council of the RSFSR: the history of parliament</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the Supreme Council can be divided into two periods: Soviet and post-Soviet.  From the moment of its foundation in 1937 until the collapse of the USSR, the Supreme Council of the RSFSR was the parliament of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.  It was created according to the norms of the "Stalinist constitution."  In the post-Soviet era, this body became the parliament of a new country.  Due to a conflict with the executive branch, it was dissolved and replaced by the modern State Duma. </p><h2>  Soviet period </h2><p>  Initially, the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR had legislative functions, elected the ministers of the Union Republic, had the right to organize a referendum, interpreted laws, and appointed judges.  He approved state awards, formed a budget, and supervised the implementation of the constitution. </p><p>  Powers began to change during the turbulent era of perestroika.  The old political system, based on a one-party system, was dismantled.  In the new conditions, the parliament could not remain the same.  By the way, in 1992 it was the Supreme Council of the RSFSR that approved the decision to rename the RSFSR to the Russian Federation.  Then the name of the parliament itself changed.  His last election was held in 1990.  Then, 252 people were elected to the deputies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="04varvara.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia in 1991" class="if uuid-2926481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/2926481.jpg"></div><h2>  Ruslan Khasbulatov: a supporter of Yeltsin, who became his opponent </h2><p>  In July 1991, Ruslan Imranovich Khasbulatov became chairman of the Supreme Council.  He took an active part in the main events of the transition period of national history.  At first, he supported Boris Yeltsin.  In August, he opposed the GKChP and condemned the coup.  Then, thanks to Khasbulatov‚Äôs position, the parliament ratified the agreement signed in Belovezhskaya Pushcha.  This document finally formalized the collapse of the Soviet Union. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Khasbulatov decided to abolish many of the institutions of the former state.  Subsequently, he changed his mind and admitted in public speeches or interviews that the collapse of the USSR was a political mistake. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruslan Khasbulatov" class="if uuid-2926507" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/2926507.jpg"></div><h2>  The struggle of two branches of government </h2><p>  What was the conflict between the government and parliament, which ended in the events of October 1993?  Soon after the creation of the new state, the chairman of the Supreme Council in 1991-1993.  Ruslan Imranovich Khasbulatov consistently criticized the policies of Boris Yeltsin and his ministers.  For example, he publicly denounced ‚Äúshock therapy‚Äù and called the Yeltsin government incapacitated. </p><p>  Gradually, two opposing camps took shape in the country: in one there were supporters of Yeltsin, and in the other they supported the parliament.  The only vice-president of Russia, Alexander Rutskoi, also spoke on the side of Khasbulatov.  The two "camps" could not share powers, their views on the future of the country, the correctness of economic reforms, and relations with the CIS states did not coincide. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thoughtco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Boris Yeltsin" class="if uuid-2926480" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/2926480.jpg"></div><p>  If the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR had clear powers, and its position in the system of institutions of power did not change over the years, in the new Russia the parliament was in an ambiguous position.  The post-Soviet state could take the form of a presidential or parliamentary republic (or maybe a mixed republic).  These contours have not been defined.  They could be determined either by legal means, or as a result of armed struggle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Unsuccessful White House referendum and defense </h2><p>  An attempt to overcome the constitutional crisis in a legitimate way failed.  We are talking about the famous referendum on April 25, 1993.  He received the informal name "yes-yes-no-yes" (Yeltsin‚Äôs supporters called for voting).  In a referendum, the population in particular voted for the holding of early elections of people's deputies, although subsequent events did not allow these elections to be held. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rbth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="October 1993" class="if uuid-2926479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/2926479.jpg"></div><p>  By the fall of <span>1993, the</span> conflict entered the final stage, even though the Orthodox Church in the person of the patriarch tried to reconcile the opponents.  The president signed a decree on the dissolution of parliament.  The deputies refused to comply with it and called on their supporters with arms in their hands to defend the White House where they were sitting.  The chairman of the presidium of the Supreme Council of the RSFSR (and later the Russian Federation) Khasbulatov was supported by the Constitutional Court, which recognized Yeltsin‚Äôs actions unconstitutional.  Parliament, in turn, decided to deprive Yeltsin of his post and transfer his authority to Rutskoi.  So gradually the conflict became increasingly radical, into which the executive power and the Supreme Council of the RSFSR were drawn.  1991 and 1993 destroyed the old system. </p><h2>  October events </h2><p>  On the night of October 3‚Äì4, supporters of the Supreme Council seized the Moscow City Hall and launched an assault on Ostankino, which failed.  The president introduced a state of emergency in the capital, and his opponents were surrounded in the White House and defeated.  The shootings on both sides killed several hundred people. </p><p>  Khasbulatov and other leaders of the Supreme Council were arrested.  In 1994, they were granted amnesty.  Parliament itself was abolished.  His place was taken by the State Duma, the powers of which were determined by the constitution, adopted by popular vote in December 1993. </p>
