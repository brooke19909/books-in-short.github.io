It is not only a well-deserved honor, but also an obligation to welcome its guests with great attention to their needs.  There is always something to see in North Palmyra - almost 90% of the mansions, palaces and even castles that belonged to representatives of ancient noble families, famous artists and singers, generous philanthropists and merchants of the Russian Empire were preserved.  Most of them are museums now.  During a short visit, it is impossible to inspect everything, but I really want to! </p><h2>  The need for night public transport </h2><p>  It’s very difficult to come to St. Petersburg and not look at him, not to walk along its streets, squares, embankments.  Especially on warm summer evenings, when the city is illuminated in a special way to emphasize the beauty and uniqueness of the mansions in the central part of the city. </p>

    <p>  It also captivates the view of the embankments in the evening and night light of spotlights, and, riding a boat during a night excursion along the rivers and canals of Northern Palmyra, it is easy to lose track of time.  And then, the city guests on a walk back to the place of overnight stay will be helped by night buses of St. Petersburg.  Public transport at night has been rescuing in the metropolis since July 2012 in St. Petersburg in the warm season. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Periods of night transport </h2><p>  Opening hours of night buses in St. Petersburg on routes - from 24:00 to 06:00 in the morning.  And the traffic interval is only 15 minutes, although St. Petersburg is a metropolis, and traffic jams can not be avoided here at night, especially because of the bridging. </p>

    <p>  And the subway works only until midnight, except holidays, and only from April to mid-November.  A clear schedule of night buses in St. Petersburg during the influx of tourists only helps to increase the safety of tourists and the further development of the entertainment sector. </p><h2>  Service improvement </h2><p>  And it is important that absolutely all metro stations night buses in St. Petersburg duplicate without exception.  That is, those who can only navigate on the subway map will be convenient to get to the bus stop. </p><p>  A huge plus is that through night buses, almost all areas of the city, which is growing rapidly, are connected to the center. </p><p>  There are some nuances, shortcomings, but experts are working on them, attracting residents and guests of St. Petersburg in the form of experts. </p><h2>  Trails </h2><p>  If you have already planned a walk around the night city, a thematic boat trip or gatherings with friends in a cafe or at a party, you should be puzzled in advance by the convenient route for returning home.  In order not to get confused, it is better to clarify in advance where exactly which buses, with which designation or number, pass. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Buses and routes: </p><ul><li>  “1M” - along the “red” line; </li><li>  “2M” - along the “blue” line; </li><li>  “3M” - along the “green” line; </li><li>  “4M” - along the “orange” line; </li><li>  "5M" - along the "purple" line. </li></ul><p>  During the bridging period, night buses to St. Petersburg go along shortened routes, and the letters “A” or “B” are added to the numbering.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Night buses in St. Petersburg" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2169292.jpg"></div>  Stops of night buses in St. Petersburg are located in close proximity to metro stations.  It is especially convenient if the passenger will be met, then the metro station itself will be a guideline.  There are obligatory stops at the metro stations, and at the request of a passenger, night buses in St. Petersburg stop at other public transport stops along the route.

    <h2>  Night transport in the cities of the world </h2><p>  Not all the capital cities of Europe can boast a similar service for their citizens, as well as tourists.  Not everywhere there are round-the-clock clubs, bars, entertainment centers and even shops.  But, for example, there are such buses in Warsaw. </p><p>  But if you carefully monitor these routes, you can see that this often relates to intercity transportation.  But Russian large industrial and metropolitan cities are in need of transport that will connect the areas of one city.  It was for this purpose that night bus routes to St. Petersburg were created. </p><p>  This service is comparable only with round-the-clock buses and trams in Germany and Amsterdam, but night buses stop here only at the request of the passenger.  There are night buses in Oslo, Vienna, and the famous round-the-clock omnibuses in London. </p>

    <p>  Night bus routes are also practiced in many US cities, but the public mode of transport there is not very popular due to the high crime rate. </p><h2>  The idea is great, but needs refinement </h2><p>  After surveys of residents and guests of St. Petersburg, a lot of work was done to compile new routes, to address the issue of notification of such a unique service.  The optimal bypass routes for the period of bridges are being clarified. </p><p>  Interesting solutions are proposed to increase the attractiveness of these routes, to continue the routes beyond the end stations of the subway. <br>  Also, the lack of communication between the city and Pulkovo Airport is not taken into account.  But many flights depart at a time when public transport is not working, and passengers spend large sums on taxi services. </p>

    <p>  The idea of ​​creating night bus routes is excellent, and its implementation is important in cities with over one million people.  St. Petersburg is becoming the launching pad, where a sophisticated version of the night transport is being worked out.  The growth of new areas, the layout of bridges, dead-end streets - these are the conditions that complicate the solution of the problem, but do not make it impossible. </p>
