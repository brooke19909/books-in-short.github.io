This land area combines the rich diversity of Portuguese culture and a wealth of natural resources.  As for the impressions, then rest in this place will definitely be remembered for a long time. </p><p>  So, we will consider in more detail the main features of the island of San Miguel, as well as what reviews Russian tourists leave after staying on it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.easyvoyage.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="San Miguel Island" class="if uuid-2553059" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2553059.jpg"></div><h2>  General information </h2><p>  As for the general information available about the island in question, it is quite interesting.  It should immediately be noted that Russian tourists know very little about this geographical object, but in vain.  However, those who have already managed to visit here often plan to organize their return to this truly paradise. </p><p>  Translated into Russian, the full name of the island of San Miguel sounds like the island of St. Michael.  It should be noted that a large number of geographical objects are named in honor of this saint, most of which are located in Latin America. </p><p>  The explorer of the island in question is considered the navigator Diogo Silves, who at the time of an important event was heading to another previously discovered island - Madeira.  This event occurred in 1427. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Geographic data </h2><p>  The island of San Miguel belongs to the group of the famous Azores, which are located in the Atlantic Ocean, near Portugal.  As for its importance in the mentioned archipelago, the island is the largest and most densely populated of all land areas included in the general composition.  It is located in the eastern part. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="37.780411" data-lng="-25.497046599999976" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/5/5/9/4559.png"></div><p>  The island in question has an elongated shape, the bend of which passes from west to east.  Its total length is 64 km in length, and in width - from 8 to 14 (marks differ in different regions).  Almost all of its territory is covered with greenery of tropical forests, which is why many geographic travelers call the object a "green island". </p><p>  As for the origin, the territory of the resort was formed after a major eruption of the volcano.  In this regard, a mountainous surface can be observed on the territory of the skeleton.  The highest point of San Miguel (Azores) is Mount Pico da Vara (1103 m.). Special attention to tourists who prefer to visit this region attracts an extraordinarily beautiful lake located in the inner part of the island - Lagoa do Congru.  In addition to it, on the island you can meet three more beautiful objects representing water bodies (Lagoa das Sete Cidadesh, Santiago, as well as Lagoa do Fogu). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island in question is almost 747 square meters.  km  A rather large number of the population lives on such territory - about 138,000 people (as of 2017).  The most important here is a settlement called Ponta Delgada.  This city is the capital.  About 40,000 people live here.  In the village are concentrated the main infrastructure facilities, and there is also a port. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="San Miguel Azores" class="if uuid-2553044" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2553044.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Russian tourists who wish to visit the island of San Miguel in Portugal very often ask questions about how to reach it.  As experienced tourists, as well as many operators who are representatives of travel agencies, note that the most convenient starting point when moving towards the island in question is Lisbon Airport - almost all tourists from Russia lead here.  A large number of flights depart from Lisbon to the San Miguel Airport (Portugal) every day (from 6 to 10).  This is quite convenient, as tourists do not have an urgent need to adapt to a specific time of a single departure.  As for the duration of the flight, from Lisbon to the airport of San Miguel (Azores) can be reached by air in less than 2.5 hours.  The price of a flight is relatively small - depending on the carrier and the conditions of comfort, it can vary from 40 to 200 dollars per person.  Many more experienced tourists recommend booking tickets for flights of interest in advance, as this type of vacation is very popular among the representatives of the European population, and therefore it often happens that there are simply no tickets for the desired flight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  Speaking about San Miguel, one should definitely consider what weather conditions are typical for this island.  Tourists from around the world, including Russia, talk about the fact that they are attracted to the mild climate in this resort area, in which only slight temperature differences can be observed.  In summer, the air temperature reaches 23 degrees, and in winter it can drop to 13. Regarding the temperature of the water, in spite of the air condition, it warms up very well and retains heat for quite some time.  So, the average water temperature along the coast of the island is about 17-24 degrees, depending on the season.  Travelers also note that the best months to visit San Miguel are August and July. </p><p>  One of the features of the island is the variety of weather forecasts for San Miguel.  So, if in the southern part in the east the sun almost always stands and there is no cloud cover, then in the west almost every day you need to be ready for cloud cover.  And after lunch, rain is often observed here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.passportstamps.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="San Miguel Island Portugal" class="if uuid-2553046" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2553046.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  Often, tourists who express a desire to relax on the island in question, ask questions about where they should stay.  For several years, tourists from different regions of the world have formed a kind of list of the most favorable settlements for recreation, which have excellent infrastructure, as well as leisure features that make staying at the resort more comfortable.  Some of the most popular cities include Lagoa, Ponta Delgada, and Ribeira Grande. </p><p>  First of all, of course, you should pay attention to the capital of the island - Ponta Delgado.  As already mentioned above, the main infrastructure is concentrated on its territory, and there is also a huge number of entertainment places that will appeal to all fans of active and vibrant recreation.  However, those who want to taste all the features of a pure outdoor recreation, which, incidentally, is simply beautiful on the island, are not recommended to stay here: in the city you can constantly observe traffic jams and perpetual active traffic that does not cease even at night. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitportugal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="San Miguel Azores Portugal" class="if uuid-2553069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2553069.jpg"></div><p>  Fans of a quiet and relaxing holiday can visit the small town of Lagoa, which in appearance looks more like a village.  It is here, according to most travelers, that you can truly consider all the features of the local nature and enjoy the beautiful views offered by San Miguel.  This town is always quiet and very calm, even despite the fact that there are always a lot of tourists on its territory.  From this town it will not be difficult to get to any part of the island - transport links are well developed here, in addition, it should be noted that the village is equally distant from the two ends of the geographical object.  The town also has a beautiful beach, which is often visited even by those tourists who live in other regions. </p><p>  Ribeira Grandi is a town that, like Lagoa, is located in the central part of the island.  However, in appearance it is very different from the above.  Despite the fact that Ribeira Grande is another wonderful option for a tourist vacation, a much smaller number of travelers come here than, for example, in Lagoa or Ponta Delgado.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that it is located somewhat north, in connection with which cloudy weather is often observed on the territory of the settlement. </p><h2>  Top Hotels </h2><p>  Tourists who wish to relax on the island in question will probably be interested in which hotels are recognized as the best in the region.  Immediately it should be noted that throughout the island you can find places to relax, which is very convenient.  However, of all the presented regions, the southern and eastern parts of the island are considered the most popular for accommodation - this is due to the climate.  So, which hotels in the reviews of tourists are recognized as the best and worthy of attention?  Let's consider the most popular of them further. </p><p>  Vista Do Vale is a hotel located in the quiet and picturesque village of Furnas.  Most tourists note that it is here that excellent conditions for relaxation are provided.  Based on the reviews left by travelers, the hotel has a very high rating.  The hotel offers comfortable rooms, decorated in a simple style, in a combination of neutral tones.  Here, all apartments provide excellent furniture and technical equipment, as well as work areas.  Vista Do Vale (San Miguel Island, Portugal) is located near the botanical garden, beach, and golf courses.  The daily cost of living in standard rooms costs about 5,000 rubles. </p><p>  Furnas Boutique Hotel, according to most travelers, is the best hotel on the island.  Most of the tourists leave only positive reviews about him, which is the most striking indicator of the level of service and comfortable living conditions at the resort.  The hotel offers tourists individual catering establishments, a beautiful spa area with 10 treatment rooms, swimming pools, as well as beautiful gardens right on its territory.  Here for tourists excursions to various interesting regions of the island are constantly organized.  The cost of daily living in a hotel room is about 11,000 rubles. </p><p>  In the village of Furnas there is another stunning hotel, which attracts travelers from different regions of the world with its wonderful conditions, which have a pleasant pastime.  Its name is Terra Nostra Garden Hotel.  A day's stay in this place costs about 9500 rubles, which many tourists consider to be an acceptable payment for round-the-clock high-quality service, access to the most interesting places and entertainment, as well as an amazing atmosphere created in the rooms.  The Terra Nostra Garden Hotel is surrounded by a large number of thermal springs, whose waters have healing properties.  Within walking distance from here are the famous volcanic beaches, as well as forests. </p><p>  Casual City Apartment is a hotel of San Miguel, which offers vacationers the best conditions for a better pastime.  It is located in the city of Ponte Delgada, within walking distance from the clean and picturesque coast, as well as many of the island's attractions (Nossa Senhora da Esperanza Monastery, Portas da Cidade city gate, pineapple plantations).  All apartments of this hotel offer tourists ideal living conditions and are equipped not only with all the necessary furniture and appliances, but also with kitchenettes with dishwashers and washing machines.  The cost of living in a room of such a hotel is 12,000 rubles per day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ponta-delgada.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What to see in San Miguel" class="if uuid-2553066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2553066.jpg"></div><h2>  Travel around the island </h2><p>  Some issues of tourists, as a rule, are related to the peculiarities of movement around the island.  Vehicles are in great demand here, since there are many attractions on the island of San Miguel, I want to see each of them while on vacation.  In addition, tourists are attracted by the local nature, which varies in each region.  So, what types of transport are available in this resort area and what is the best way to use it? </p><p>  It should be noted that the most popular service in San Miguel is car rental.  It is available everywhere, but most travelers recommend renting a vehicle at the airport, immediately upon arrival.  A considerable number of points where you can rent a vehicle are marked on the map of Ponta Delgada.  Instead of a car, you can also rent a scooter or bicycle, but these modes of transport are not very in demand, due to the changeable nature of the weather - most travelers notice that even at low speed it is not very pleasant to travel on them even in light rain. </p><p>  As for public transport, it is available on the island, but tourists rarely use this method of transportation.  This is due to the fact that in reality there are a small number of bus flights on the island and a large interval is observed between them.  Travelers also note that flight schedules are not always conveniently adjusted. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of tourists who relax on the island in question is visiting local attractions.  Immediately it should be noted that this can be done both independently, as by ordering an excursion tour.  One of the main excursion destinations is natural objects, the beauty of which the island is famous for.  In particular, among travelers from different regions of the world such natural sites as Lake Sete Sidadesh, Miradouro da Vista do Rei, Hot Ocean, Mosteiros Beach, as well as Lake Lagoa do Fogo are very popular.  It should be noted that it is best to plan visits to ponds and viewing platforms in clear and sunny weather, since on cloudy days most of the objects will be hidden by fog. </p><p>  Travelers' special attention is drawn to the Caldeira Velha Natural Park, located in the center of the island, near the famous Lagoa do Fogo Lake.  Its territory has the status of a conservation zone and national treasure.  The park has a paid visit mode.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis attraction of San Miguel is small - its entire territory can be examined in just half an hour. </p><p>  Cascata do Salto do Cabrito waterfall is another place that tourists from Russia have loved - the beauty of this natural object is mentioned in many comments that they left on social networks.  In many photos of the island of San Miguel it can be seen very often, since Cascata do Salto do Cabrito is one of the main natural attractions of the region.  There is a waterfall near the village of Caldeiras de Ribeira Grande, which is located in the central part of the island.  It is necessary to get to the waterfall, moving along a mountain river, on the banks of which another attraction of the island is built - an ancient hydroelectric power station. </p><p>  Fans of relaxing walks while staying in San Miguel (Portugal, the Azores) should definitely visit the Terra Nostra Park, which is located in the eastern region of the resort.  A visit to this object is also paid - the cost is 8 euros per person (about 600 rubles).  On the territory of such an attraction, you can observe a huge number of unique plants - in total, there are more than 2000 species.  Experienced travelers recommend taking a map that the employee will offer at the entrance to the park - it will be easier to navigate it.  Terra Nostra has a huge thermal spring, the waters of which have healing properties - they have a high iron content. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ponta-delgada.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="San Miguel Forecast" class="if uuid-2553076" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2553076.jpg"></div><h2>  The best beaches </h2><p>  Among tourists who prefer to relax in an exotic atmosphere, there are a considerable number of beach vacation fans.  It is they who are interested in what beaches of San Miguel are the best and most sought after.  Travelers from all over the world very often comment on such recreational sites as Praia das Milicias, Mostiros, and Praia dos Moinhos.  All these beaches have one thing in common: they are shallow, and there is no light and soft sandy coating familiar to tourists - instead of it you can observe volcanic rocks that make up the entire island.  However, as noted by many experts, the minerals contained in dark grains of sand have healing properties and are incredibly beneficial to the human body. </p><p>  The most popular among travelers vacationing on the island of San Miguel is Vila Franca Beach.  It is located right in the crater of a long extinct volcano.  The coastal part of the bottom has a mostly rocky surface, which is pleasant for many vacationers.  The peculiarity of such a beach is that in the area where it is formed, there are no waves and winds, as the resting place is surrounded on all sides by rock formations - the remains of a volcano. </p><p>  -        - ( ),       Porto Formoso.     ,         .     :         .     , ,     .      ,       .        200  ( 18500 )  . </p><p> -- -  ,    - ( , )     .            :    ,   .      ,         . </p><p> Lombo Gordo beach is located in the eastern part of San Miguel (Azores), where wonderful climatic conditions reign all year round.  The coast, strewn with dark volcanic sand, was once created artificially and ennobled by the hands of local residents.  Currently, Lombo Gordo is one of the most beloved beaches of both local residents and foreigners who prefer to relax on San Miguel (Azores).  Many tourists consider this inaccessible area to be a big disadvantage for its inaccessibility - public transport almost goes here, in connection with which only those tourists who rented vehicles at special rental points become visitors.  There are also no hotels in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beach in question - the closest of them are a couple of kilometers away. </p><p>  What to see in San Miguel?  There is one very beautiful natural object - Mostiros Beach, where you can come to relax on the ocean, while enjoying its natural beauty.  In the ocean surface here you can see sticking clumps of rocks that give a special look to the whole landscape.  They also protect the coast well from the winds, which is very pleasing to tourists.  The coastline of the beach is covered with a mixture of stones and dark, pleasant to the touch, sand.  Surrounded by the beach, there are only expensive places to relax and stay.  The cost of renting apartments in hotels ranges from 200 to 600 dollars per day (about 12,500-38,000 rubles).  Perhaps that is why prosperous foreign tourists are observed on Mostyros. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.easyvoyage.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="San Miguel Azores" class="if uuid-2553057" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2553057.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost of tours </h2><p>  Knowing what to see on San Miguel and what features are typical for this island, many tourists wish to visit this exotic resort.  A considerable number of tourists are interested in questions regarding how much a tour costs to this place?  It should be noted that the price of the package directly depends on the region in which the traveler wants to relax and what conditions he wants to be surrounded by. </p><p>  So, the cost of tours to this resort region, proposed by Russian operators, starts at $ 650 (about 37,000 rubles).  This price includes only a weekly rental of rooms in a hotel with the condition of living together.  As for the flight and transfer from the airport of San Miguel (Portugal), the transportation costs are calculated separately.  On average, for tourists who plan to make a departure from the capital's airports, the price of a flight is about 25,000 rubles (per person). </p><p>  If desired, tourists can include in their tour package tours that are organized on a fee basis.  Their price will depend on the directions, as well as on the conditions of the trip. </p>
