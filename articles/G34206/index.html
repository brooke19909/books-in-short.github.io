    <p>  The Egyptian leader was not mistaken, indicating the location of the future settlement.  The city of Sharm el-Sheikh is protected from strong winds by the island of Tirana and many bays.  Therefore, even in the season of strong winds and sea currents, the resort is quite comfortable.  In the summer, from April to September, the air temperature ranges from 22 to 38 degrees Celsius.  From October to March, in winter, the air warms up to +23.  The maximum water temperature is 26 degrees in summer and winter. </p><h2>  Location of the hotel Verginia Sharm 4 </h2>

According to climatic conditions, even during winds, namely in February-March and in November-December, it is quite comfortable here.  The bays located around are a reliable protection against strong cold currents during the ebb and flow. </p><p>  Once the area Hadaba-Umm-Sid (Hadaba Um Sid) - this is the full name of the area - belonged to a military town.  Now here in several lines are hotels, including the Verginia Sharm Hotel. </p>

    <p>  Verginia Sharm Hotel 4 features a children's pool.  For parents, it will be useful to know that there is no heating in it.  But friendly animators will always find how to entertain you, and tell you about everything that interests you about the hotel, the city of Sharm el-Sheikh and the country itself.  They will certainly be interested in children and will be occupied while parents have lunch at a restaurant, enjoy shopping or swim in the sea. </p><p>  You can come to this hotel with a child if he is already eight months old.  A baby cot is available in the room free of charge upon request.  The restaurant has special chairs where you can seat the baby. </p><h2>  Attractions Noteworthy </h2><p>  In general, the services provided to all vacationers at Verginia Sharm Hotel can be described as standard.  But there is something to choose from the offers of a rich excursion program.  In this regard, the location of the hotel is very favorable.  From here it is relatively close to Israel, in particular, to the capital - Jerusalem.  But it’s worth starting with another shrine. </p><h2>  Monastery of St. Catherine </h2><p>  For those guests who are not used to sitting in one place, Verginia Sharm Hotel offers an excursion to the monastery of St. Catherine at the foot of the <span>Sinai Mountain.</span>  It is 190 km from the hotel. </p><p>  It was erected in the VI century A.D.  by decree of the Byzantine emperor Justinian, after the foundation he received the name of the Monastery of the Transfiguration or the Monastery of the Burning Cupina (this shrine is located on its territory). </p><p>  The history of the construction of the monastery is as follows.  Hermit monks looking for the relics of one of the first saints in the highlands, Catherine of Egypt, and discovering Mount Moses, repeatedly asked the emperor to erect a temple in this place.  Justinian’s assistant, having received instructions on the construction, decided to build a thick-walled monastery not at the top of the mountain, but down into the gorge, where it was much safer to repel the raids of enemies.  Historical chronicles indicate that the assistant was executed.  However, for the entire time the monastery existed, it turned out to be the patronage of the greats of this world.  In times of war and armed conflict, this fact acted as a reliable defense of the monastery. </p><p>  In the XI century, the monastery was renamed the monastery of St. Catherine in honor of the Great Martyr, who lived from 287 to 305.  AD  According to legend, she was incredibly beautiful, intelligent, from her youth believed in Christ, converted many around to Christianity, for which she even became incapable of her own father.  Emperor Maximin executed Catherine. </p><p>  According to legend, her body was transferred by angels to the top of Sinai.  The monks who discovered the remains were identified by the ring that Jesus Christ gave to Catherine.  Since then, the relics of the saint rest in the church of the monastery and are available for worship every day. </p><p>  In 2002, the monastery was included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. </p><h2>  Excursions to Israel, to Jerusalem </h2><p>  Many will wish to go on a trip to the holy places of the world.  Verginia Sharm Hotel 4 offers tourists one-day and many-day excursions to places that every person, regardless of their faith, should visit at least to improve their cultural development. </p><p>  Of the special recommendations for tourists, one can note the style of clothing, as part of the tour according to the plan, visits to sacred places are provided, respectively, the shoulders and knees of men and women should be closed, a headdress for the fair sex is required.  It is necessary to wear comfortable shoes, the sole of which should not be slippery (the pavement in Jerusalem is paved with smooth ancient cobblestones). </p><p>  You need to take your passport, water and something to eat on the road.  Documents for obtaining a visa to cross the border and Israel are submitted three days before departure, and the border passage depends on customs officers, so there may be some temporary delays that are not dependent on the guide. </p><p>  If we consider a one-day excursion, then the procedure for its implementation is as follows.  After passing the Israeli border, the route lies along the road to the Dead Sea, which will take three hours, then there is a stop in Jerusalem for fifteen minutes to explore the old city from the height of Pancake Week.  Then, according to the plan, a visit to Bethlehem, namely, the Temple of the <span>Nativity of Christ.</span>  Tourists will also be invited to pay a visit to the manger of Jesus and the cave of Christmas. </p><p>  All excursions include the passage of Jesus on the mournful path to Calvary.  A visit to the cave, where the body of the Savior lay before his Resurrection, is certainly offered.  Finally, after a visit to the Wailing Wall, there is a road back. </p><h2>  Opinions of tourists </h2><p>  No matter what they say about the Verginia Sharm hotel, the reviews of tourists agree on one thing - the institution, of course, loses to the pompous five-star counterparts.  Nevertheless, all the conditions for a comfortable stay here are provided.  The staff is polite, the cleaning is at a high level.  Many tourists who come with the company require neighboring rooms, and not a single review contained a hint of any cash claims from the employees at the reception.  The entire hotel is surrounded by flowers and greenery.  The location of the rooms is good because the neighbors do not interfere with each other.  To go to the sea for five minutes, and tourists note the regular flights of the local shuttle to the beach.  And the beauty of the Red Sea with its inhabitants, who are already accustomed to tourists and do not show a trace of fear, has not been canceled yet. </p><p>  Some customers are complaining.  They relate to paid Wi-Fi and partly the work of staff.  Someone complained about the lack of plenty of <span>buffets,</span> but this is not a five-star hotel!  You can buy a SIM card for access to the Internet and not be dependent on Wi-Fi, but as for the staff, the human factor can manifest itself not only in Egypt. </p><p> Summing up all the above, we conclude that the hotel has excellent conditions and provides an absolutely acceptable vacation for couples with children and for those who do not like noise and a lot of people around.  This was and will be the Verginia Sharm 4 hotel, reviews of which include information about it as a budget institution with friendly staff, a beautiful beach and a beautiful sea.  Remember safety measures, do not drink and do not eat what you don’t know the origin of, do not forget the medicine at home, stock up on sun creams and enjoy the sea and leisurely flow of life! </p>
