    <h2>  Finishing Finish </h2><p>  Pre-finishing - these are the stages of repair, after which the apartment does not become suitable for living, but before that there is very little.  Bringing an apartment to this stage is not difficult, but for a long time, and this requires a large investment of effort and money.  However, its high-quality performance guarantees a comfortable life in the future and simplification of subsequent <span>cosmetic repairs.</span> </p><p>  Since the final finishing of the apartment is carried out once, it is necessary to approach every stage of it with all responsibility, regardless of what changes will be made in the future. </p><p>  Prefinishing is the basis for the ideas of the designer involved in home improvement: coating, decoration, installation of equipment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is more convenient to make repairs using the zoning principle.  First of all, you should pay attention to those places where you can make repairs on your own.  The first part of any phase is the removal of construction waste.  Proceed to it from the bottom up - from the floor screed to the ceiling. </p>

    <h2>  Floor and ceiling </h2><p>  At this stage, these surfaces do not take too much power, especially when it comes to a fairly even floor.  A variety of materials are used for its lining: linoleum, tile, cork, laminate, parquet and so on.  The list of options is so long that discussing them can take more than one day. </p><p>  If the repair of an apartment with a preliminary finish involves <span>painting / whitewashing the ceiling,</span> at this stage it is required to prepare its surface.  For this, plastering and puttying is carried out.  You should know that in rooms of high humidity (for example, a bathroom), the ceiling should be treated with special compounds that do not absorb moisture. </p>

    <h2>  Plaster </h2><p>  Plastering is suitable not only for wall work, but also for the decoration of the ceiling.  If you decide to use plaster for repairs, it is important to remember that it has an expiration date - it must be checked before purchase.  It is better to choose a Russian manufacturer - the quality of the products is no worse, while the prices are much lower.  Coarse stucco is used during roughing operations, but finer grinding will come in handy now. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To apply the layer of plaster as evenly as possible, it is necessary to put beacons with self-tapping screws, which will act as reference points for the level.  The surface is leveled with special mixtures or rough putty. </p><p>  To shrink the house does not affect the condition of the plaster, you need to make it as flexible as possible.  To do this, use a reinforced <span>stucco mesh</span> with a 2 * 2 cm cell. Put it on a carefully primed coating. </p><p>  The plaster needs to be allowed to dry.  This can take up to a week, after which you can begin the next stage of repair. </p><p>  Today, gypsum plaster is very popular, having high ductility, which, in addition, does not harm health.  If the walls of the house are brick, <span>finishing work</span> requires a special approach: </p><ul><li>  priming on the walls; </li><li>  affixing beacons; </li><li>  applying a layer of plaster; </li><li>  after drying, coat with a primer; </li><li>  putty with reinforced mesh; </li><li>  after the putty is dry, apply it twice more in turn. </li></ul><p>  The last layer should be of fine-grained plaster. </p><p>  If the plaster is applied in places of increased heating, a heat insulating layer is required.  Where it will be wet - waterproofing. </p><p>  After the final drying of all layers is necessary to check the quality.  This requires measuring and tapping the wall.  If there are no delaminations and cavities between the layers, then the sound will be voiced. </p>

    <h2>  Putty </h2><p>  This material eliminates various bumps.  The same can be done with the help of textured walls - multilevel wallpapers, decorative plaster and so on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you intend to use textured wallpaper, puttying must be done in two layers.  If the walls will be painted, putty is applied on 3-4 layers.  The most popular blends today are made in Finland.  Chalk-based mixtures are most in demand.  Thus, maximum working comfort will be achieved. </p><h2>  Drywall </h2><p>  The pre-finish finish, the photo of which can be seen in the article, may include plasterboard wall cladding.  This is a very simple, clean and fast way.  The disadvantage of this material is the high price. </p><p>  Most often, a frame made in advance is used to mount drywall.  Before applying, align the sheets of material by pressing them at the joints.  During installation, the plates should be staggered. </p>

    <h2>  Wiring </h2><p>  The pre-finishing is the installation of wiring and the heating system.  At this stage, it is recommended that you connect a specialist to the process if you are not.  This is important, for example, in order to comply with the provisions of the Housing Code.  As a result, you can not only avoid fines, but also be sure that you don‚Äôt have to redo anything.  No matter how important the savings in repairs are, at this stage you should forget about them - the wiring and heating system must be of high quality and correctly installed. </p><h2>  Doors </h2><p>  The house, finished in draft, very often does not have doors between rooms.  After completing all the stages of the finishing treatment, they should be installed.  The most obvious option is durable doors with high noise insulation qualities.  Creative natures mainly choose those that will be combined with the future interior. </p>

    <h2>  Window </h2><p>  Photos of the final finishing of the apartments prove that they are already at the disposal of the owners with the windows.  Modern builders immediately install plastic frames, but if their quality or design does not suit you, you can install those that are ideal for your needs and the rest of the home. </p><h2>  Acceptance of pre-finished apartments </h2><p>  Today's buyers are becoming more demanding, so they are increasingly refusing to take housing with a rough finish.  Therefore, when signing the acceptance certificate, you should make sure that the contents of the apartment correspond to those stated in the contract.  In order to have good reason to sign a document, it is important to know what to look for when inspecting an apartment. </p><p>  The pre-finishing, the repair of which was done by professionals, includes coating the surfaces with plaster.  The following violations are permissible here: </p><ul><li>  vertical irregularities 2 * 1 mm; </li><li>  smoothly contoured surfaces can have no more than 2 small defects per four square meters; </li><li>  a good finish is a finish - this is a coating on which there should be no cracks, chips, delaminations, traces of the tool. </li></ul><p>  Concrete screed should be free from significant defects.  Maximum permissible deviations: </p><ul><li>  irregularities not exceeding a depth / height of 2 mm; </li><li>  the floor under the tile should not have defects more than 6 mm high; </li><li>  the floor slope should not exceed 2%, and whatever the area, it should not be more than 5 cm; </li><li>  the joint of the floor and walls must be soundproofed. </li></ul><p>  Finishing is a high-quality adhesion of the plaster with the coating.  You can check it by tapping: a muffled sound indicates exfoliation - this must be introduced into the act of reception and transmission. </p>

    <p>  The installation of windows, done correctly, involves the following indicators: </p><ul><li>  the contact points of the window and the outside of the wall should be carefully spilled with mounting foam, which is fixed with a waterproof coating; </li><li>  doors and frames open effortlessly, in a closed form they fit snugly; </li><li>  frames, glass, windowsill has no defects; </li><li>  double-glazed windows have high-quality fittings; </li><li>  window sills within the same room are installed at the same level, without interfering with the exit of warm air from the heating system. </li></ul><p>  If a poorly finished pre-finish is found, <span>where to start the repair is</span> too early to think.  First you need to fix all these shortcomings on a special form attached to the act of admission.  The developer must eliminate the defect in 45 days.  If the defects are too serious, you can refuse to purchase.  In this case, he is obliged to return all the money within 1.5 months. </p><p>  In order to avoid problems arising as a result of poor-quality decoration of the premises, it is necessary to carefully choose the developer.  You can contact the owners of already rented apartments, who will tell you in what condition their premises were at the time of delivery.  Be that as it may, the main thing is to carefully inspect the apartment. </p>
