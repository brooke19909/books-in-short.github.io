    <p>  One of the favorite children's toys is a spinning top or yule.  You unwind it - it stands on one leg, only bright stripes on the sidewall merge into a solid color spot.  It would seem that the most ordinary, simple children's toy, and the basis of its behavior is such a <span>physical phenomenon</span> as the gyroscopic effect.  While such a top is motionless, it does not constitute any interest, it is simply impossible to place it vertically.  But it is worth untwisting it - here real miracles begin. </p><p>  It is the <span>rotational motion</span> that is the cause of the stability of the top.  Due to <span>the friction forces</span> at the fulcrum, the rotation slows down, and when it stops, the top falls.  The stability of the toy gives a gyroscopic effect.  It is created by <span>centrifugal force</span> arising from the rotation of the yule.  If it is well untwisted, then, even if the yule originally stood at an angle, it will become upright.  The top is always set so that the axis of rotation and the direction of gravity coincide. </p><p>  If you try to deflect the top from a vertical position, then it begins to make certain oscillations, which have a special name - precession.  The axis of the top at this phenomenon describes in the space around the vertical line a figure similar to a cone.  The stronger the spinning top, the more stable it will be.  The more massive the toy will be and the higher its speed, the greater the gyroscopic moment it can develop.  This term means the product of the <span>angular velocity of the</span> top (rotor) at the <span>moment of inertia</span> of the rotor‚Äôs own rotation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The described case is just one of the few possible examples of rotating bodies.  Their main feature is the stability of the body with respect to the <span>axis of rotation.</span>  To increase the stability of the bullet and eliminate its somersault in the air, it is forced to rotate in flight.  This is achieved by screw cutting in the barrel.  A rotating bullet retains its position and direction throughout the flight. </p><p>  It can be seen from the above example that the gyroscopic effect is used not only as a children's toy.  The stability of a rotating disk has its use in technology.  On this principle - resistance to attempts to change the position of a rotating disk, the so-called gyroscopic stabilizers are built.  They work on ships as quenching devices. </p><p>  Invented and a special device - a gyroscope.  In fact, a gyroscope is the same spinning top.  At this device, the axis is placed in a special suspension and can rotate freely in it.  The gyroscope can serve as a compass.  If you untwist it strongly, then the axis of its rotation will be directed along the earth meridian, pointing to the north.  Such a device is called a gyrocompass. </p><p>  A gyrocompass has certain advantages over a conventional magnetic compass.  So, the error of the magnetic compass is often quite large, especially in areas near the poles.  In such cases, it is best to use a gyrocompass.  There are many other instruments using the gyroscopic effect - gyrohorizont, gyrotachometers, gyrostabilizing platforms. </p><p>  Even the Earth itself is a giant spinning top, making one revolution per day.  This spinning top also has precessional vibrations.  The same giant top represents the Sun.  Apparently, everything in the universe revolves around its own axis.  And not only stars, but also nebulae and galaxies. </p><p>  Considering, as an example, a spinning top that is firmly at one point and resisting attempts to change its position, it was possible to find out that this behavior is based on a surprisingly interesting and useful phenomenon, such as a gyroscopic effect. </p>
