    <h2>  Impressions of the hotel complex and its housing stock </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, hotel rooms cannot be called large; rather, they are average in size.  However, there is enough space for everyone.  Many were pleased with the fact that there are many hangers and shelves in the cabinets, so that you can conveniently lay out and hang your things.  Rooms also include a free safe.  Judging by the reviews of the guests, the equipment is in good condition and is working properly.  On TV from Russian-language channels, there is only ‚ÄúFirst‚Äù.  On the balcony you can conveniently hang things to dry.  There is no internet in the rooms.  But Wi-Fi can be used throughout the rest of the Lti El Ksar Resort &amp; Thalasso 4 * - from the reception to the beach.  Judging by the comments of the hotel guests, those who got rooms in the bungalow were especially pleased.  According to them, it is very quiet.  Also, thanks to the trees, a shadow is created, and during the day it is not hot. </p><p>  As for the cleaning, it was carried out daily.  Bath towels were also changed every day.  The maids update their bed linen about 1 time per week. </p>

    <h2>  Opinion about nutrition and staff </h2><p>  As for food in the hotel in question, many guests praise him very much.  So, according to them, there is always a choice of a lot of well-prepared dishes (often there are seafood), a variety of side dishes, delicious desserts, fresh fruits.  During the day you can have a snack on the beach with pizza, chicken wings, pastries, etc. Also, the bar serves delicious aromatic coffee. </p><p>  In relation to the staff of Lti El Ksar Resort &amp; Thalasso 4 * (Sousse), the guests had no particular complaints.  So, according to vacationers, the hotel staff is very attentive, welcoming and quick.  Administrators at the reception always try to check in tourists immediately upon arrival, despite the fact that officially check-in should be done after two in the afternoon.  However, our compatriots advise all people planning to spend a vacation in this hotel to pay attention to the following fact.  Despite the fact that Russian-speaking tourists at the hotel are about 30% of the total mass of guests, you can explain yourself only in English or German.  Hotel workers have not yet mastered our language.  By the way, there is no animation in Russian either. </p>

    <h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  As for the private beach of the Lti El Ksar Resort &amp; Thalasso 4 * hotel (Tunisia), then most of the guests had an exceptionally positive impression about it.  So, according to them, it is large and wide, with a fine white sand.  There are plenty of sunbeds here.  But if you want to take a deck chair closer to the bar and the main entrance, then you should come early.  The way from residential buildings to the beach takes no more than three minutes.  If you wish, you can take a walk along the coastline along the beaches of other hotels.  The sea near the coast is shallow, the water is warm.  Often there are small waves on which it is pleasant to swing.  Also, due to the fact that the wind is constantly blowing, it is not very hot here.  So, many tourists, according to them, were on the beach all day from morning to evening.  Beach towels are available at the spa with a security deposit of 10 dinars.  You can change them every day from 9 am to 5 pm. </p><h2>  Comments about other activities </h2><p>  Many guests of Lti El Ksar Resort &amp; Thalasso 4 * greatly praise the thalassotherapy center available on its territory.  The prices for services are not low, but the quality is beyond praise.  Also, according to them, you can visit the sauna and hammam for free. </p><p>  Also, according to experienced travelers, if you liked this or that pool, but there are no free sunbeds near it, then you should contact the hotel staff.  They will bring and install sun loungers in any place convenient for you. </p><p>  In addition, tourists celebrate a good animation in "Lti El Ksar Resort &amp; Thalasso."  So, during the day you can do gymnastics, water aerobics, shoot archery, play darts, water polo, etc.  There are evening shows, but not in Russian.  There is also a mini-club for the youngest guests of the hotel complex. </p>
