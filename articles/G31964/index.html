Their number is growing quite quickly, and it is not always possible for the user to figure out what their differences are.  The figures indicated in the name of the phones become incomprehensible. </p><p>  You need to understand that in general, all the presented devices are practically no different.  The only nuance you need to know about is that they have two unique options or ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù in their appearance.  Inexperienced consumers think that these gadgets are identical and not universal, so they often take the first model they come across.  Nothing wrong with that.  In any case, the smartphone will have good build quality, a beautiful interface and a certain set of functions.  In the article, we consider the Xiaomi Redmi Note <span>4X 3</span> 16Gb Black. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi Redmi 4X 16GB Black reviews" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2018441.jpg" width="527"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The Xiaomi Redmi 4X 16Gb Black phone is not much different from the main models of the Redmi line.  The decor is calm, banal.  Sold in three colors: gold, black and pink.  At the moment, the latter option is not available for the Russian buyer. </p><p>  Designers have tried to make the model as suitable as possible for both men and women.  The frames are thin, the case has smooth features, 2.5D glass and, of course, metal.  This set is standard for phones of this type. </p><p>  The owners note that the smartphone has become faceless, it has no features.  If we compare the device from Meizu, whose products are considered to be a direct competitor to Xiaomi, then you need to notice an interesting detail.  This Chinese company creates phones almost the same, but adds small touches: a proprietary key or camera design.  This allows the device to look as interesting and original as possible. </p><p>  Under the screen of the model in question, you can see the touch keys.  They execute the following commands: </p><ul><li>  opening task manager; </li><li>  return to the desktop and to the previous menu. </li></ul><p>  On the instrument, made in black, gray key icons are quite difficult to consider, but there is no backlight.  All buyers talk about this in reviews of Xiaomi Redmi 4X 16Gb Black.  Previously, this manufacturer used a reflective coating, but at the moment has abandoned this idea.  Under the "Home" button you can see the indicator.  It notifies a person of missed messages in applications. </p><p>  On the left you can find a lot designed for the following set: two SIM cards or one + external drive.  On the right is a key to turn the phone on or off, as well as a ‚Äúswing‚Äù to change the volume level. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the top end is an infrared port.  You can immediately notice the microphone and the standard headphone jack.  At the bottom there are speaker grilles.  Between it and the microphone there is a connector for charging / connecting to a computer. </p><p>  The back panel of the smartphone is made of metal.  On the top and bottom, you can notice special inserts made of plastic.  On the left is the camera and flash.  Fingerprint scanner is located a little lower.  Under it is the manufacturer‚Äôs logo.  Consumers report that it almost completely merges with the black background. </p><p>  As owners note in reviews of Xiaomi Redmi 4X 16Gb Black, the smartphone is conveniently in the hand, and a high level of comfort is ensured by the absence of sharp edges.  Most consumers are satisfied with ergonomics, as the ‚Äúswing‚Äù of volume and the scanner are right under your fingers. </p><p>  The assembly of the model is made at a good level, it does not have squeaks and backlash.  The keys in it are tight, the stroke is good.  Owners note both the dignity and the scanner, since it works without errors. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  5 inch smartphone screen.  Its resolution is 1280 √ó 720. Created using a special technology called OGS.  In reviews of Xiaomi Redmi 4X 16Gb Black, many report that there is no information that tells its purpose.  This technology is characterized by the fact that it does not have an air gap.  As for a regular budget model, the screen is good.  The illumination is uniform, the black color for IPS is almost perfect, and there are almost no impurities in the white shade.  The viewing angles in the model are wonderful.  The owners note that if you significantly reject the display, you can notice a slight dimming.  This smartphone does not have Full HD quality, however, users do not consider this a strong drawback, since the cost of the device is small (about 5 thousand rubles). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The manufacturer made sure that the brightness was enough to work in direct sunlight.  Owners note with positive reviews and the established minimum level, because it is ideal for using the phone in a dark room. </p><p>  The display temperature is a variable option, so you can always adjust it in the settings.  However, many consumers report that this makes no sense - the indicator was successfully set initially. </p><p>  Many consumers are pleased with the function "support up to 10 touches at once", as well as the presence of an oleophobic coating. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone Xiaomi Redmi 4X 16GB Black" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2018426.jpg" width="360"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The smartphone has a 13 megapixel camera, PDAF support, built-in autofocus. </p><p>  This is not to say that the camera is ideal, but for a budget option is quite satisfactory.  All users are satisfied with it, despite the fact that in difficult conditions, whether it be artificial lighting or dark, the picture is not very high quality.  This is what users mention in reviews of the Xiaomi Redmi 4X 16Gb Black.  Autofocus in this model is fast and accurate, so in daylight, the photos are contrasting and clear. </p><p>  Many buyers note that the camera takes more or less good pictures in cloudy weather. </p><p>  Video is recorded with a maximum resolution of 1080 p.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äã- 30 frames per second. </p><p>  The camera of this smartphone has a good interface, convenient and simple.  There are no superfluous elements, but all the same it creates the feeling that they are all at hand.  Buyers criticize only the manual mode, in which the manufacturer allows you to adjust the white balance and ISO. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi 4x 3 16gb black" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2017252.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Many buyers do not undertake to professionally evaluate the sound, but if we speak subjectively, the reproduction is standard.  The <span>Xiaomi</span> Redmi 4X 16Gb Black <span>smartphone reviews</span> indicate that it is clean, but it has no features.  Many owners do not have enough low frequencies, but in general, we can say that everyone liked this model, regardless of what genres a person prefers to listen to. </p><p>  In addition, the smartphone has an equalizer and sound optimization for headphones.  Unfortunately, the latter option only works with proprietary options, but you will have to purchase them yourself, since headphones are not provided in the kit. </p><h2>  Wireless interfaces </h2><p>  If we talk about wireless modules, then in the model under consideration are those that are responsible for working with the Internet and bluetooth.  NFC is missing, but there is an infrared port.  Communication at an excellent level, customers have no complaints.  The Xiaomi Redmi 4X 2 / 16Gb Black reviews report that there are no distortions. </p><p>  For those who need navigation, we add that the device works with GPS, GLONASS and Chinese BeiDou.  It connects to satellites almost instantly, even during high-speed movement, the signal does not disappear. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  This smartphone is considered a "workhorse."  A review of Xiaomi Redmi 4X 16Gb Black, or rather a description of its performance and general characteristics, is not much different from the previous Redmi 4 model. It will not work on it using new applications with high graphics performance, but it will perform daily tasks with a bang. </p><p>  The device runs on a processor that has eight cores.  Each frequency is 1.4 GHz.  The graphics accelerator performs well when working.  RAM - 2/3 GB. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi Redmi 4X 16GB Black Review" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2018422.jpg" width="488"></div>

    <h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  Buyers note that battery life is considered the strength of the Xiaomi Redmi 4X 16Gb Black smartphone.  We are not talking about records, but in general, the data received from the owners is impressive.  The battery in the device is used at 4100 mAh, which speaks for itself.  The battery life is also affected by the fact that the screen resolution is small, and the operating system has a special program to optimize energy consumption. </p><p>  The manufacturer claims that in video mode the battery will last about 15 hours. When talking, it will last 36 hours. It will take about 13 hours to play applications without recharging. When the 4G network mode is on, the battery will last no more than 18 hours, and with GPS navigation - 15 h. However, the owners of these parameters give their data. </p><p>  So, when watching video on HD quality, the phone lasts 12 hours without charging. If you constantly update sites through a browser, the battery will be discharged after 8-9 hours. With games, the phone will last no more than 6-7 hours. </p><p>  With average or even passive use in the daytime and active mode at night, the smartphone performs well.  Nevertheless, it will have to be charged every day.  System optimization allows you to delay the moment you reach 0%, but buyers do not advise to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù the device every 20 minutes during the day. </p><p>  Consider the day familiar to most owners, which can be found in the reviews for Xiaomi Redmi 4X 16Gb Black: about 10 minutes of conversation per day, an hour of browsing sites via a mobile network / Wi-Fi, 60 minutes of reading with backlighting at a standard level, 1.5 hours. listening to tracks with the screen off, 30 min.  viewing updates on social networks, regular sending messages in instant messengers and checking mail, creating ten photos, 20 min.  with the Google Maps program.  At the same time, Twitter, Telegram and Mail are running in the background. </p><p>  On average, all these actions take 15 hours, after which the phone has even more than 50% charge.  But you need to understand that the screen is turned on only 4 hours.  This indicator greatly affects battery life. </p><p>  If desired, you can improve the life of the unit.  For this, you should use special programs that update the work of too demanding applications.  Also, do not forget about the power saving mode. </p><p>  The only thing customers didn‚Äôt like was that there was no quick charge function. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi 4x 2 16gb black" class="if" height="475" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2017254.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  Phone Xiaomi Redmi 4X 3 / 16Gb Black runs on the "Android".  The fact that the MIUI shell is installed on top does not distinguish it from previous models - this solution is rather considered standard.  It should be noted right away that not all beginners will like this idea.  For already experienced users, it will seem standard and simple. </p><p>  The whole problem is that the shell is very different from the pure "Android".  It combines the qualities of not only the "green robot", but also Apple's operating system - IOS.  The developers decided to create such a shell for a long time and still have not abandoned it, trying each time to make it more comfortable for users. </p><p>  It should be noted that in the model in question, the lock screen immediately after switching to the desktop erases notifications.  The status bar has a minimum of notation.  The list of notifications is structured in such a way that it is not clear whether it is all fit or if there are any other messages.  Their so-called cards are sometimes displayed singly, sometimes in blocks.  The workspace is organized strangely: there is no application menu.  The clock in the corner may disappear if you take other widgets to the desktop.  These are all trifles, but to a person who is not used to it, a purchase may seem unsuccessful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi 4x note 16gb black" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2017255.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  For a long time, Xiaomi smartphones have become standard and very popular among the budget category of such devices.  Almost the decisive role in this was played by the cost of the device.  You can buy it at a price of 6800 rubles. </p><p>  If we consider competitors, then Xiaomi Redmi 4X 3 / 16Gb Black should be called an average with strong characteristics.  Cost and quality combine perfectly, there are no significant drawbacks.  This device may seem boring, but it performs all the work and functions perfectly. </p><p>  The main rival of Xiaomi, according to buyers, should be called Meizu M3s Mini.  This smartphone is famous for its balance in work, but at the moment it is already outdated.  Moreover, his device is running the fifth version of Android, and the eighth in Xiaomi.  Meizu M5 is another good smartphone that can be recommended as an economical option. </p><p>  Those who are already tired of using Chinese models should pay attention to ASUS Zenfone 3 Max.  This is another direct competitor to the smartphone described in the article.  Its cost is slightly higher than the previous ones, it uses other technologies and a larger screen size.  Buyers note that if you compare these two models, then ASUS has the best design, good battery life and the latest version of Android. </p><p>  We have provided a detailed review of the Xiaomi Redmi 4X 16GB Black model.  To buy it or not to buy - the choice is yours. </p>
