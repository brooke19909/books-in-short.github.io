The principle of its manufacture is simple to the extreme.  This is an elementary strip of a knitted flat cloth, closed in a circular cloth.  There are several ways to knit it, each of which has its own specifics and characteristics.  A common feature of the snoods described in this article is that they are all crocheted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="snood crocheted pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1157858.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Choosing a hook </h2><p>  Knitting a knitting needles is a classic.  However, this method has several disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Long production time (even when working with thick thread, knit longer than crochet). </li><li>  When choosing a pattern that is even a little more complicated than an elastic band, a one-sided canvas is obtained. </li><li>  Knitting in general is more troublesome than similar crochet work. </li></ul><p>  In addition, a <span>snood crochet</span> (a pattern of almost any even pattern is perfect for this) turns out to be more dense and warm. </p><h2>  Which yarn to choose? </h2><p>  For crocheting a snood, any yarn of medium thickness is suitable.  When choosing a material, you should think about the final form of the finished product, as well as consider the style of its socks.  If the scarf is supposed to be worn on the head, then the fabric should be more or less soft (a thread 200-400 m / 100 gram thick).  Too hard snud will puff and cause difficulties when forming folds (thick thread 50-200 m / 100 grams). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Crochet snood (patterns and description on the network often go along with recommendations for yarn) is better from a material with a natural composition.  The optimal content is 40-60% of wool, angora or mohair.  Acrylic, cotton or bamboo can be used as an additive.  The last two materials are of plant origin, so they will not roll down when worn. </p><p>  Of course, you can use very <span>thick yarn,</span> as in the photo with a brown scarf. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="snud crochet patterns and description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1157856.jpg" width="417"></div>  However, then you need to use a large hook (from 7 and above), monitor the density of the knit and do not tighten it.  You should not look for complex patterns in order to crochet such a large snood.  The scheme will fit the simplest, up to elementary double crochets.

    <p>  You can puzzle over the choice of a pattern or a combination of several schemes if the scarf is openwork and knitted from a thin thread (400 m / 100 grams and thinner). </p><h2>  The easiest crochet pattern </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the simplest way to make a circular scarf is simple double crochet.  Here, even a circuit is not needed. </p><p>  Often, circular knitting is used to perform a snud.  This avoids the need to stitch the product after completion of work.  But knitting in circular rows has its drawbacks: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Offset the pattern with each next row a little to the side.  The same thing happens with the place of comparison of the beginning and end of the series.  It must be neat and even, this must be monitored. </li><li>  When you turn on colored threads, you should carefully draw up their introduction. </li><li>  There is a risk of gradual expansion of the canvas.  Most often this happens due to the accidental addition of loops during the transition from one row to another. </li></ul><p>  Avoiding circular knitting, you can just make an even strip and then sew it carefully.  Each craftswoman chooses for herself a way to knit a snood. </p><h2>  Openwork crochet snood: schemes and description </h2><p>  The greatest difficulties begin when you need <span>to knit a scarf</span> with an openwork pattern.  Here it is important to think over the model in advance and compare the selected yarn with the pattern.  The photographs below show simple patterns that are suitable for knitting snoods. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet pattern" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1157890.jpg" width="451"></div><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="snood crochet pattern" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1157906.jpg" width="370"></div>

    <p>  They can be used for yarn with a thickness of at least 300 m / 100 grams, otherwise the holes in the pattern will be too large, and the scarf itself will be stiff.  These patterns will give a more or less continuous canvas, it will be beautiful and warm.  The following pattern consists mainly of chains of air loops, so the scarf will turn out to be quite soft and loose, with a large number of holes. </p>

    <p>  This pattern is ideal if you plan to use angora or mohair yarn as a material.  Such a crochet snood (the scheme leaves room for emphasizing the advantages of a fleecy thread) will turn out to be soft, warm and elegant at the same time.  If desired, you can replace the double crochet in the second row of ‚Äúbushes‚Äù with air columns.  Then the pattern will become more voluminous and will stand out against the background of the grid. </p><h2>  Knitting along </h2><p>  In order for the pattern on the scarf to be located along the fabric, you should start knitting with a very long chain of air loops.  Its size is determined by counting the loops in a pre-linked sample.  This step should not be underestimated, since it avoids the blooming and fitting of the product to size. </p><p>  The sample is knitted from the selected yarn and according to the selected pattern.  Only in this way will the calculations be correct.  By counting the number of loops of the pattern per 10 cm of the canvas, you can find out how many loops you need to dial to crochet a snood.  Any pattern is suitable for such knitting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet snoody with schemes" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1157857.jpg" width="242"></div>

    <p>  The length of the row with this method of knitting will be the length of the scarf, and the height of the fabric - its width. </p><h2>  Snood tied across </h2><p>  This method is slightly simpler than the previous one, it allows you to quickly make snood crochet.  The row layout for such knitting is much shorter.  A sample is also required here.  Otherwise, you may suddenly find that the scarf is too narrow and requires tying, or vice versa - the excess width does not allow to meet the limit of yarn. </p><p>  The length of each row with this knitting will be equal to the width of the finished scarf.  And the height of the canvas - the length of the snud.  A feature of this method is the impossibility of using circular knitting. </p><h2>  Shutdown </h2><p>  Using the information on how to crochet snoods, with diagrams and recommendations regarding the process itself, do not forget about the finish stage.  After the scarf is ready, it should be washed in warm water (in no case, not hot) and dried when unfolded.  In the future, the snood will need to be washed exactly that way. </p><p>  Hot water leads to shrinkage of wool and angora fibers, and hanging can cause it to stretch unevenly. </p><p>  If you want to change the <span>size of the snood,</span> stretch or even the knit, you can steam it with a steam iron through a wet, thin cloth.  However, do not get carried away, as high temperatures can lead to shrinkage.  And if the yarn contains a high acrylic content (more than 60%), then the steamed fabric will become too soft. </p><p>  The above tips for the manufacture of snacks can only be a guide for knitters, since each product has its own specifics and needs an individual approach. </p>
