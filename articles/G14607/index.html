Moreover, not only the process of switching the multimedia center to the Global Web will be described, but also recommendations will be given regarding the reconfiguration of its software shell.  It should also be noted that the instruction will be general in nature and is not tied to a specific operating system.  All this information will allow the newfound owner of such a device to configure it independently. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.radioandtelly.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect the internet cable to the TV" class="if uuid-2359059" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2359059.jpg"></div><h2>  In what cases is it most rational to create such a connectionÔºü </h2><p>  At the moment, almost any modern TV can be connected to the Internet.  Only now it is advisable to carry out such an operation only when the device supports <span>Smart</span> TV <span>technology</span> .  In this case, you can install various applications in the memory of the multimedia center that are capable of downloading entertainment content from the Global Web and playing it.  In this case, the owner himself chooses what will be viewed and it is very convenient. </p><p>  But also on store shelves you can find still outdated solutions that lack support for the Smart TV function.  They are impractical to directly connect to the Internet for the reason that this will not give any gain in terms of functionality.  If you install a mini-PC in it, then you can already implement such a connection using the WiFi network. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="jimhansen6.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect samsung tv to the internet" class="if uuid-2359063" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2359063.jpg"></div><h2>  What is a smart tv? </h2><p>  Before you get confused with how to connect the Internet to an LG TV - or any other manufacturer - we‚Äôll deal with the Smart TV function.  Until recently, any such device was intended only to watch TV programs.  Now the functionality of TVs has improved by an order of magnitude, in fact, they have turned into multimedia centers.  A similar conversion was obtained by adding a special operating system that allows you to install additional programs.  The latter allow you to play various multimedia content at the request of the user.  At the moment, you can find platforms that include Smart TV: </p><ol><li>  LG devices are based on the WEBOS OS. </li><li>  Samsung TVs are based on the Tizen OS. </li><li>  The rest of the manufacturers use a modified version of Android. </li></ol><p>  The level of functionality of each of them is comparable, and the final choice depends largely on the personal preferences of each user. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.indiamart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect a TV to the Internet through a router" class="if uuid-2359066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2359066.jpg"></div><h2>  General switching and tuning algorithm </h2><p>  To connect the TV to the Internet, you need to follow the instructions below.  Stages are as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Unpacking the multimedia center.  Its assembly and installation in the place where it will be operated. </li><li>  The supply of all communications.  If it is planned to use a Wi-Fi network to obtain data, then we bring in a power wire and a cable with a television signal.  In the case of the implementation of switching using a twisted pair cable to the ‚Äúglobal web‚Äù, then it must be present in this list. </li><li>  Turn on the device.  Set the geographic area, current date and time. </li><li>  Search for TV shows.  Saving the received list. </li><li>  Setting connection parameters.  Software installation. </li><li>  Checking the performance of the multimedia center. </li></ol><h2>  Assembly and installation of a multimedia center.  Power and signal cable </h2><p>  The first step in setting up any modern multimedia center is to remove it from the package.  Also, it is necessary to get from it the remaining components that are part of the delivery.  As a rule, this list includes a control panel with a set of batteries, a stand, a user manual and, of course, a warranty card.  Some manufacturers supplement this list with various advertising brochures or booklets that detail the capabilities of the device. </p><p>  Next, you need to install the stand in the TV.  All necessary components (screws or screws) can also be found in the packaging box.  Then we bring the signal television cable and connect it to the antenna jack.  After that, the power cord should connect the corresponding device connector and a 220V outlet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  With how to connect the Internet cable to the TV, we will figure it out in the next paragraph. </p><div class="photo" data-original="caivision.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect a smart TV to the Internet" class="if uuid-2359068" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2359068.jpg"></div><h2>  Create a wired connection </h2><p>  Now we will figure out how to connect a SMART TV to the Internet using twisted pair cable if this less convenient way of obtaining information will be used for switching to the Global Web.  To do this, we install such a wire pressed on both sides with one connector into the free port of the router, and the second into the RJ-45 socket of the multimedia center.  Again, the computer cable must be carefully routed between the two components of a distributed computing system. </p><p>  As experience shows, in practice it is not very convenient to use a wired connection if the Wi-Fi network is an alternative to it.  It is she who is used to switch such devices most often today. </p><h2>  Initial configuration.  Wi-Fi and router switching </h2><p>  In the next step, you need to turn on the multimedia device and wait for the end of its initialization.  Then a query window will appear in which you need to set the location of the television system, as well as the current values ‚Äã‚Äãof the date and time.  The first allows you to determine the computing system with a list of available programs, and the second - to synchronize with servers. </p><p>  Next, go to the setup menu and select ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù.  Then we set the type of connection (wired or wireless).  Also in this place the addressing (static, dynamic) and network mask are set.  Also, when using Wi-Fi, specify the network name and code to establish a connection.  This is how to connect the TV to the Internet through a router using a wireless channel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.broadbandtvnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect internet to lg tv" class="if uuid-2359078" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2359078.jpg"></div><h2>  Search for channels.  Application installation </h2><p>  Next, go to the TV program search menu and start the auto search system.  The only thing that needs to be done is to indicate the type of signal received.  It can be satellite, cable or from a local antenna.  In the last two cases, you must also specify its format - analog or digital.  At the end of the search operation, you need to save the received list of TV channels. </p><p>  Then you need to go to the application store.  For the Tizen OS, this is the Samsung Store, for WEBOS the LG Store, and for Android the Play Market.  We create a new account in it and install the programs at our discretion.  It is recommended that you choose Youtube, ivi and Twigle for the reason that they have free content.  In other cases, it is necessary to issue a paid subscription. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.broadbandbuyer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="You can connect the Internet to the TV" class="if uuid-2359081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2359081.jpg"></div><h2>  Checking the performance of the multimedia system </h2><p>  Actually, we can assume that we managed to connect the TV to the Internet.  You just need to check the performance of such a <span>multimedia system.</span>  To do this, go to the broadcast and view in stages all available channels.  Then we go to any of the installed applications and run a movie or a telecast for a test.  In the future, we check the operability of each installed program.  After checking the last of them, testing is over. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The owners in their reviews indicate that connecting the Samsung TV to the Internet or the model of any other modern manufacturer is quite simple.  It is preferable to use a Wi-Fi wireless network for such switching for the reason that in this case there is no need to pull a special cable. </p><p>  For the rest, such multimedia centers radically change our lives.  Now it is possible to configure media content to the user's needs and not depend on television programs.  It was this task that faced the developers of Smart TV, and they really successfully solved it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.usa.philips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect a tv to the internet" class="if uuid-2359082" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2359082.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As part of this material, two main methods have been described that allow you to connect the TV to the Internet.  One of them is based on a wireless connection and Wi-Fi network.  It is in practice that it is most often used in practice for the reason that there is no need to specially pull a computer cable.  The second is twisted pair and wired switching.  It is used much less frequently and is not very convenient.  A universal algorithm for tuning multimedia systems is also described. </p>
