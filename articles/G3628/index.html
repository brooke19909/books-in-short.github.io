    <p>  December is a great time to spend your vacation in Sri Lanka: the rainy season is over and sunny and dry weather has set.  Your stay here will be interesting and eventful, and ticket prices, which are slightly lower than in other months of the year, will become a pleasant bonus for you.  Tours to Sri Lanka in December are becoming more popular every year.  And there are a number of reasons for this, which we will try to understand today. </p><h2>  Sri Lanka in December: weather </h2><p>  In the last month of the year, Sri Lanka comes to life after the autumn monsoons, and the temperature gradually rises.  The weather in Sri Lanka in December is comfortable for relaxing.  At the beginning of the month, the beach and bathing season begins here, and thousands of tourists from different parts of the Earth rush here in search of a comfortable rest and adventure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a rule, tourists at this time choose the southwestern coast of the island, since tourism infrastructure is best developed here.  In addition, from the beginning of December to the very end of April, the direction of the monsoons changes to the northwest.  In this regard, these areas are covered by waves of moist air coming from the Bay of Bengal. </p>

    <p>  However, the mountain range, which is located in the center, divides the island into two parts and stops the air flow, preventing them from penetrating to the west and south of the island.  The amount of precipitation is sharply reduced, monsoons become not so aggressive. </p><p>  The air temperature rises to +30 ¬∞ C at noon, and at night it drops to quite comfortable +24 ¬∞ C.  If you choose resorts such as Weligama, Galle, Hikkaduwa, Wadduwa, Bentota to relax, then bring along an umbrella that will protect you not only from the rain, but also from the scorching sun, which warms and shines here up to seven hours a day, and the air here warms up to +30 ¬∞ C. </p><h2>  Where to relax </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the island is relatively small, tourists can find many places where to relax in Sri Lanka in December.  Resorts here are distinguished by beaches, popularity, infrastructure.  Holidays in Sri Lanka in December are mainly beach, although those who wish can attend excursions to the sights of the country.  In this article we will introduce you some popular resorts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hikkaduwa </h2><p>  This is a small picturesque town and a popular, actively developing resort, which is located in the west of the island, a hundred kilometers south of the old capital of the country - Colombo. </p><p>  The beach in Hikkaduwa is well maintained, 10 kilometers long.  It is quite wide, and narrows only in some areas.  The beach line is built up with numerous hotels that overlook the coast, approaching the water more and more every year. </p>

    <p>  There is a nightlife in Hikkaduwa.  Every Friday at the Vibration Hotel there is a very noisy night disco with live music.  On other days, this resort town falls asleep early, and lovers of evening entertainment can find them only in the bars on the beach. </p><p>  Sri Lanka in December is an opportunity to take time on a sightseeing vacation.  There are practically no attractions in this resort area, but there are many of them in the immediate vicinity.  Tourists really like trips to tortoise farms, mines where precious stones are mined.  They admire the nearby National Park, as well as the temples. </p><h2>  Bentota </h2><p>  This resort city in the south-west of the island is popular with beach lovers.  The city is small - it is inhabited by only 37 thousand people, most of whom are employed in the tourism business. </p><p>  Sri Lanka in December allows you to be at the beginning of our calendar winter to be on the beaches of this country flooded with hot sun.  By the way, the beaches in Bentota are very good, especially for the territories outside the city - in the neighboring regions of Induruvu, Kosgoda. </p>

    <p>  Some beaches here reliably close the bay from the winds, so large waves are rare.  This resort is less crowded than others in the west and south of Sri Lanka. </p><h2>  Beruwela </h2><p>  Sri Lanka in December is gorgeous.  To truly appreciate its beauty, head to Beruwela, a beautiful resort town located on the west coast of the country, 55 kilometers south of Colombo and 5 kilometers north of Bentota. </p><p>  This resort stretches along the southwest coast.  He is still very young, so his infrastructure is only developing.  Gorgeous snow-white sandy beaches that stretch along the ocean, crystal clear water and gentle sun - here you can find everything you need for a beach holiday and a beautiful tan. </p><p>  Along the beaches are hotels of various levels of comfort.  On the beaches of Beruwela, the ocean is often turbulent, and very large waves rise, but at this time you can swim in the backwaters and bays.  All the traditional beach activities are presented here: water skiing, windsurfing, sailing cruises, sailing, snorkeling at the coral reefs.  Lovers of underwater fishing will not be bored here. </p><p>  In the Beruwela area there is a cemetery of sunken ships.  This is a paradise for divers.  There are well-known diving and water sports centers Confifi Marina.  This resort is unlikely to be suitable for youth companies, since there is no nightlife in Beruwell, and there are no entertainment for young people either. </p><h2>  Unawatuna </h2><p>  Sri Lanka in December - the route is popular.  But the island has not only crowded and lively resorts.  For example, Unawatuna is a small coastal town, even, rather, a village located in the south of the island.  It is located near the larger and more visited city - Galle, and is its suburb. </p><p>  More recently, it was a tiny fishing village, but now there are always more tourists here than locals.  In popularity, this resort is second only to Bentota and Hikkaduwa. </p><h2>  Galle </h2><p>  And if you prefer a sightseeing vacation, then you better go to a large port city located in the south of Sri Lanka, to the capital of the southern province - Galle.  It is 145 kilometers from Colombo Airport.  Galle is a sightseeing place, not a beach resort.  The city is located on the coast, and it even has its own beautiful city beach. </p>

    <h2>  Weligama </h2><p>  A small resort village in the south, belonging to the Matara district, is located on the shore of a sandy bay.  It is constantly inhabited by 75 thousand people.  This resort has been chosen by surf lovers.  The main part of the coastline is made up of golden sandy beaches.  The advantage of this resort is the small number of vacationers. </p>
