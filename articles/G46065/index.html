Here, vacationers are provided with changing rooms, a playground for children, and a toilet.  It is quite easy to get here, and the rest is very comfortable.  Moreover, there is picturesque nature around.  Also free of charge is a visit to the coastal part of the Olive Beach, located directly under the Andreevsky Bridge. </p><h2>  Allowed Places </h2><p>  So where can I go swimming in Moscow?  According to the conclusion of Rostpotrebnadzor, these places include: the BeechKlab complex, which is located at the address: 39 Leningradskoye Shosse;  Left-bank beach;  Big pond in Victory Park on the passage 4922;  Black Lake along the alley of the same name, 6 microdistrict.  Here, the sanitary indicators of water are normal.  During the rest, you should pay attention to the fact that during the summer period warning signs indicating that swimming is prohibited are allowed on the territory.  This is due to an increase in bacterial concentration in the pond.  To identify these indicators, regular studies are conducted. </p>
