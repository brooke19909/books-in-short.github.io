This is the second <span>castle</span> in <span>Ukraine,</span> which is incredibly popular.  Medzhibozhsky castle was called "White Swan".  The name comes from the fact that the defensive walls of the fortress were white. </p><p>  For strength, they were covered with lime mixed with brick dust.  It is for this reason that all the people who saw the fortress from afar thought it was bright white.  But unfortunately, over the years, the whiteness has gone, and the walls have become darker.  Only the sonorous name remains. </p>

    <h2>  Medzhibozh Castle: history, location </h2><p>  The first records of this castle appeared at the beginning of the formation of Kievan Rus.  Due to the fact that the city of Medzhibozh was geographically located very convenient, local merchants could conduct active trade with Poland, Kiev and Lviv.  In this castle, very often brave conquerors rested.  After long hikes, they gained strength here, rested and replenished supplies of food and water. </p><p>  To protect the region from the regular invasions of the Turks and the constant attacks of the Tatars, it was decided to build an outpost of wood.  At the beginning of 1255, the Medzhibozh Castle, Medzhibozh-grad and other surrounding villages completely destroy the Tatars.  Subsequently, for a hundred years they dominated these lands.  Only with the onset of 1362 did the Great Olger manage to return the lands and destroy the conquerors.  He returned the legal lands to both the Lutsk and Lithuanian principalities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  New fortress </h2><p>  In mid-1507, it was decided to re-establish the defenses.  But this time around the perimeter erected high and massive walls of stone.  They acted as fencing and protection.  Also, the walls were excellent positions for archers who could see from above all approaching enemies.  This allowed this fortress to become the most massive.  It was almost impossible to attack and capture. </p>

    <h2>  Voivode Sinyavsky </h2><p>  In the middle of 1540, the rights to own the castle passed to the tycoons, influential at that time, and the noble governors Sinyavsky.  This was made possible thanks to their many services to the Polish Empire.  It is Sinyavsky who decide to build additional towers in all corners of the defensive wall.  This is done in order to achieve maximum security and power in front of the advancing enemy. </p><p>  So, the idea came to build a large and beautiful Medzhibozh castle in the very center of the defensive shelter.  The description of those times says that the governors do not forget about religious principles.  Not far from the castle, builders erect a chapel of impressive size.  Everyone could pray for their sins before the Lord and ask for his blessings before a responsible battle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After two centuries, the city receives the <span>Magdeburg Law,</span> which allows you to fully conduct and develop trade.  But in the middle of 1640, this castle with a defensive fortress became the immediate shelter of <span>Bogdan Khmelnitsky himself</span> and his large detachment of brave Cossacks.  Indeed, it was in those years that they took an unbearable part in the Polish-Ukrainian war. </p><h2>  The decline of the fortress </h2><p>  In 1730, the last rightful owner of the castle, who was from the Sinyavsky clan, dies.  Thus, the Czartoryski became full owners.  But, unfortunately, the new owners do not care about security at all.  Therefore, the former defensive shelter becomes a full-fledged castle, which is decorated with numerous decorations. </p>

    <p>  Every August, a festival is held in the fortress, which is dedicated to the independence of Ukraine.  But in early January, right after Christmas, a festival called ‚ÄúWinter Tower‚Äù begins.  Each of these festivals is bright and fascinating in its own way.  Tourists are always happy to attend these events, because there will be enough positive emotions and vivid impressions for the rest of the year.  During the festival are: </p><ul><li>  Exciting fights. </li><li>  Hunting. </li><li>  Swimming in the frozen river. </li><li>  Banquets and balls. </li></ul><p>  But it should be noted that every year, the entertainment program changes.  You can become a witness or take part in the legendary competition of professional archers and crossbowmen on your own. </p><p>  The scenes of the storming of fortresses and other exciting events that will not allow visitors to get bored will be played out.  All events are held in special themed costumes.  Therefore, the local atmosphere, which reigned several centuries ago, seems to resurrect again in front of the public.  You can fully imbued with local folklore and have a wonderful time. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the Medzhibozh Castle is geographically located.  He, like the fortress, is located on a small hill.  A river flows from the northern part.  Previously, there were hunting grounds, however, with the advent of the modern benefits of civilization, the city begins to grow, so there is practically not enough space. </p><p>  In summer, the castle looks as beautiful as possible, because its defensive walls protrude from behind the trees.  It is as if they merge with natural wealth into a single whole.  In the river you can swim, fish and at the same time enjoy the beauty and grandeur of the castle. </p><p>  From the very first minutes, as soon as the walls of the castle appear, emotions are seething inside.  I would like to immediately see everything around and feel the atmosphere of ancient years.  In order to maximally consider all the surrounding beauty, it is best to climb one of the observation towers. </p>
