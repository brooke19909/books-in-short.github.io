Stencils, instructions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The main creators of the festive atmosphere in the house, in addition to the Christmas tree, are New Year decorations.  Holidays pass so quickly, and in order to enjoy the New Year mood longer, we can decorate our rooms with a variety of decorative elements.  The process of creating a paper jewelry with your own hands will bring more magic to your life, and thus you can avoid unnecessary costs.  How to make <span>paper jewelry?</span>  In fact, everything is very simple. </p><h2>  Paper </h2><p>  The main material that we will use is paper.  In this case, you may need everything: napkins, newspapers, magazines, music sheets, in general, that only comes to mind.  The general appearance of your crafts will depend on what material you choose, so see for yourself what will best fit into the design of your room.  You can use paper of various textures, for example, decorations made of corrugated paper look very interesting. </p><h2>  Materials and Tools </h2><p>  In addition to paper, you may need cardboard.  If you did not find the material of the required color on hand, then you can easily make it yourself by coloring the paper as you need.  You will also need glue, a stapler, scissors, a stationery knife and thread with a needle.  If there are various tools for decorative work with paper, such as a <span>figured hole punch</span> or scissors with an unusual blade, then it will be even better.  But, besides this, the most important tool is your desire and imagination, without which you can not do in such a responsible matter.  Of course, there are ready-made templates, but it‚Äôs much more interesting to come up with everything yourself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fairytale world on the windowsill </h2><p>  When you hear the phrase: ‚Äúdecorations on windows made of paper‚Äù, then snowflakes immediately come to mind on the windows that we all cut and glued in childhood.  There is nothing complicated in this, almost everyone did it.  But you can come up with something new, for example, create a New Year's decoration directly on the windowsill.  To translate this idea into reality, we need white, thick cardboard.  It is necessary to cut out figured images from it, such as a tree, deer, hares, and so on, and glue it so that a strip of the pattern is obtained over the entire length of the window sill.  Then you should make the second same strip, only preferably with other patterns.  Now we create a ‚Äúbox‚Äù of these strips: our material is located along the outer and inner windowsill, and cardboard is about 10-15 cm wide and of small height on the sides.  Inside this ‚Äúbox‚Äù we place a garland along the entire length of the decoration, it is best if it is white, gold and blue.  Turn it on and turn off the light.  It turns out that decorations on paper windows can easily create an atmosphere of magic and fairy tales. </p>

    <p>  In fact, carved figures can be glued anywhere, but most often there are decorations on the windows.  It really looks beautiful, although it is done very simply.  Moreover, it is available to everyone, because it will not take so much to make paper jewelry <span>with your own hands.</span>  <span>Stencils</span> can be very different.  It is especially nice to look from the room to the street when a flying deer is glued to the glass.  It may even seem for a second that he is real.  This is how a fairy tale is created in real life. </p><p>  If it seems to you that it is too simple, and you want something more complicated, then do not rush.  You can come up with a very complex magical composition with various openwork elements, turning an ordinary window into a whole magical world.  If it is not enough, then you can create another one, for example, on a glass cabinet door.  A great option is to hang the image on a string, like decoration on a Christmas tree.  A lot of interesting things can be made of paper, countless ideas, so all that remains is to pick up scissors and create. </p>

    <h2>  Symmetrical christmas tree </h2><p>  What primarily symbolizes the New Year is, of course, a Christmas tree.  In addition to the main room, which is usually located in the main room, you can arrange it in various forms, in the form of candles for example, or you can make it yourself.  There are so many different ways to craft a small Christmas tree.  You can make a Christmas tree toy from the most ordinary cardboard in order to hang it on the main green beauty. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  First of all, we draw and cut out the most primitive Christmas tree, the very one that we used to draw from childhood.  It is very simple, it is only important to observe symmetry.  Next, on another sheet, circle and cut exactly the same one more.  We bend our blanks in half vertically and simply glue them together with their centers.  You can leave the toy in the same form, but it will be much more beautiful if it is decorated: in such cases, imagination will help.  Next, make a small hole at the top and thread the thread.  The work is completed, our decoration is ready.  It is so easy to manufacture that even a child can make it. </p><h2>  Curly tree </h2><p>  This is the easiest option for such a toy.  If you want, then you can do something more complicated.  For our next Christmas tree you will need colored paper, glue, scotch tape and scissors.  The basis of this Christmas tree is a cardboard cone.  After you have made it, cut from paper a lot of strips of the same size.  Glue each strip so that it turns out something like a loop, then glue them on the adhesive tape, and then attach it (in layers) to the cone.  This jewelry is simple in execution, but looks no less spectacular. </p>

    <h2>  Christmas tree cone </h2><p>  You can also make a fairly minimalist Christmas tree.  She will look good and will be able to decorate a secluded corner.  For her, you need a large thick sheet of Whatman paper, wrapping paper, scotch tape (including double-sided), scissors, and any jewelry you like.  The first thing to do is a thick paper cone, which subsequently needs to be wrapped in decorative wrapping paper.  But if it is already solid and able to hold its shape, then this item can be skipped.  Fold the paper diagonally so that the end of the cone is sharp and securely fix the shape with tape.  Cut the bottom so that it is flat and the tree is stable.  Next, decorate the cone with wrapping paper (you need to do this carefully so that the bottom layer does not shine anywhere) and fix it.  Cut off the excess.  Attach a star on the top of the cone, so it will immediately be clear that this is a Christmas tree.  On the surface, you can stick beads that look like Christmas balls, or decorate an impromptu spruce in your own way.  Christmas tree is ready!  You can make several such jewelry of different sizes and make a very interesting and original composition from them. </p><h2>  Paper garland </h2><p>  Everyone probably knows the simplest paper jewelry with their own hands, which are often made for the New Year.  This is a garland of paper.  The process of making a paper garland is simple.  To do this, cut strips of paper and glue them together, like a chain.  Such a decoration can be created even by children.  But you can change it a bit by using <span>decorative paper</span> with an original print instead of plain colored <span>paper</span> .  Even thanks to the change of material, we get a more interesting thing.  But what if you make a garland not from simple stripes, but from openwork?  It will turn out very effectively, although it will take a considerable amount of time to cut such stripes. </p>

    <p>  In general, it is possible to experiment with such a chain in different ways, for example, to make not rings, but hearts or any other figures.  Also, as another option, consider this garland: many different shapes are cut, and holes are made in the center.  A thread connecting the figures is passed through them.  Despite the simplicity of manufacture, the product looks very impressive. </p><h2>  Alternative Christmas garland </h2><p>  You can also make a garland of family photos.  All you need is to print your favorite stories and fix them on a thread.  If you want, you should make a thematic garland dedicated to the New Year, choosing, for example, Christmas photos.  It can also be a great gift to your friends, because it is always nice to receive not just a present, but something made by yourself.  And if it is also associated with funny memories, then it is better to come up with a gift.  Many people like to make jewelry out of paper, stencils for which are not needed.  Garlands are the perfect choice. </p><h2>  Snowflakes </h2><p>  This way to decorate the house is suitable for absolutely everyone.  It is implemented simply, but remarkably brings a festive atmosphere to the house. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper jewelry patterns" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40389/1128763.jpg"></div>

    <p>  To make paper jewelry with your own hands, it‚Äôs enough to just learn how to cut snowflakes, because they can very well act as independent decorations.  A square sheet of paper is folded in half diagonally.  Then it folds, the remaining ponytails are cut off to make a triangle.  This scheme is familiar to everyone.  The further fate of the product depends only on your hands and imagination.  Making a wide variety of slots, we create an original snowflake, as shown by paper decoration patterns.  They can be very different and very interesting.  Many people like jewelry made of corrugated paper, so you can make a snowflake out of it. </p><h2>  Circle toy </h2><p>  If you do not want to buy toys in the store, then you can always make decorations for the New Year from paper.  For such a wonderful Christmas tree toy you will need colored paper, wire, stapler and glue.  Decorating is best done using paper in three different colors.  You can choose shades that are compatible with each other, or you can make a contrasting bright ball.  To begin with, we need 12 blanks of circles. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper decoration stencils" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40389/1141830.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Take a cup or glass and circle the circle on paper.  If you have 3 colors, you get 4 circles on each.  Next cut them.  Fold all the circles into a stack so that the top and bottom are the same color, and the others are identical in pairs, and bend them in half.  Flex the stack of circles and fasten them along the formed fold line with a wire or a stapler.  Spread the circles.  Now they need to be connected: the halves should be fastened with each of the neighboring ones (with one on top, with the other on the bottom).  <span>Paper Christmas tree</span> decoration ready! </p>
