    <p>  A trader who has become a manager opens a certain type of account and invests there own money.  Such investments are called manager's capital.  And then he creates an offer, and on certain conditions, willing investors can invest their money in this manager's PAMM account. </p><p>  Thus, it turns out that the manager trades not only at his own expense, but also at the money of investors who, at a certain percentage indicated in the offer (offer conditions), transferred his own funds to him for management.  As a result, the manager risks not only the funds of his investors, but also his own.  On the other hand, the manager receives a percentage of the income for completing transactions and managing the funds of investors, that is, a PAMM account.  Everyone who wants to earn, therefore, chooses for himself such a manager who suits him according to certain parameters.  The investor himself sets the selection criteria and limits his risks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  PAMM accounts as an opportunity to earn money </h2><p>  PAMM accounts: <span>is this a divorce,</span> or is there no deception about it?

    <p>  Suppose a manager opens a PAMM account with certain conditions that he offers to his investors.  Further, he conducts trade on it.  Investors observe through monitoring their work, and according to its results they determine for themselves whether it is worth trusting their funds to this manager.  The received data suits them, and they invest in the PAMM account of this manager.  And the latter continues to trade, but not only with his own funds, but also with the money of investors.  His PAMM-account is increasing due <span>to investments,</span> and trading continues.  If <span>the</span> manager‚Äôs <span>own funds</span> are 300, and investor funds (one or more) $ 200, then the total amount is already $ 500, and the manager controls this money. </p>

    <p>  So, as a result of trading on a PAMM account: </p><ol><li>  Manager: investments of 300 dollars, the result of 980 dollars.  That is, 300 is the initial contribution and plus 200% of the profit, plus the percentage of remuneration from investors, in this case - 20% of their profit. </li><li>  First investor: investments of $ 100, result 260. Two hundred dollars - profit and minus the percentage of remuneration to the manager, 20%. </li><li>  The second investor: investments of $ 60, only 156. One hundred and twenty dollars - profit and minus 20% for the manager. </li><li>  Third investor: investments of $ 40, result 104. Eighty dollars - profit and minus 20%. </li></ol><p>  As a result, everyone was satisfied and profitable.  The investment scheme is clear, and now everyone can independently decide whether PAMM accounts are really divorce or not. </p><h2>  PAMM Account Insurance </h2><p>  What are the risks, and in general - are they?  The fact is that all investors have several types of insurance.  If you consider a PAMM-account a fraud, then this is far from the case.  There are brokers who insure PAMM accounts.  This is the first type of preservation of invested funds.  And the second can be called conditional insurance.  Most likely, this minimizes losses, that is, losses.  Under the terms of the offer, the investor can limit his losses on his own.  What does it mean?  The investor determines the level or any specific amount that he agrees to lose, but no more.  For example, an investor determines that losses on his investments cannot be more than 20%.  Or a certain amount, for example, from an investment of <span>$ 100,</span> losses can not be more than $ 20. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Risks of investing in PAMM accounts </h2><p>  There are risks for the investor, and PAMM accounts, whether or not they are divorced, are to be decided independently by everyone who invests in such an account.  In the example that was given above, we considered the case when the investment brought income.  But with unsuccessful trading, all participants may receive losses.  No one is completely safe from losses, for that he is also in the financial market, which always has great risks.  Any investor can limit them, but it is completely impossible to exclude. </p>

    <p>  If we take the definition of a PAMM account, a divorce (word) in relation to it will be unjustified.  Before opening this type of investment, everyone who wants to invest is immediately warned of the risks.  In addition, it is also worth considering the following: monitoring is, of course, good; you can track the manager‚Äôs trade and choose the best one for yourself.  However, previous work on such an account does not guarantee future profitability.  Suppose a manager receives a stable income of 40% for several months, but this does not mean that in the future it will be the same.  Next month, he may receive a loss.  Such risks can only be limited, but they cannot be avoided in any way for a PAMM account.  How risky this is, each investor has to decide on his own. </p><h2>  Passive income </h2><p>  Probably any person wants to have earnings in the form of passive income.  Of course, this is convenient: you can do any business and constantly receive additional money.  Some people distribute their investments in such a way that they live only at their expense.  Someone makes money on various Internet projects, while someone invests in a bank and lives on interest.  Each in his own way decides what type of investment he should do. </p>
