    <p>  Located in the south-west of the country, Cape Town is the capital of the <span>Republic of South Africa.</span>  The city, which appeared at the end of the XVII century, is actively developing in the field of tourism.  Every year on its territory there are new hotels, restaurants and entertainment venues. </p><h2>  Weather in Cape Town </h2><p>  Tourists need to know that from the beginning of May to the end of July, the famous resort is dominated by heavy rains.  The best time to explore the main attractions of the city is October and November.  It was then that the warm spring weather reigned in Cape Town.  But the period from March to May is considered a low season, and the flow of guests is significantly reduced, and with it the prices for hotel rooms are melting.  At this time, you can save a lot on accommodation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From December to April, the average daily temperature exceeds 30 degrees, and during these months the city is too stuffy and humid.  But in the summer (June-July) is pretty cool. </p><h2>  Table mountain </h2><p>  Of course, to visit the <span>capital of South Africa</span> and not see its business card surrounding the city from all sides is simply impossible.  In the western province is located which is home to more than two thousand species of animals and plants national park.  Table Mountain (Cape Town), which gave the name to the reserve, from afar resembles a giant table, and it is from it that the visit to the colorful city begins. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cape Town Table Mountain National Park" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1706492.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 2011, the capital of South Africa participated in a worldwide competition called "Seven New Wonders of the World", and the most amazing sight of the state was included in the list of winners.  A huge flat peak with a height of 1087 meters, which for many years served as a kind of lighthouse that showed sea travelers the way to the city, is in an amazing place - where the warm and cold currents of the Indian and Atlantic oceans connect.  A unique natural phenomenon caused frequent fogs, covering the top with a dense whitish "tablecloth". </p><p>  Once the mountain was a whole island, but now it is connected by the isthmus to the mainland.  This is one of the most unusual viewing platforms in the world, from the top of which simply amazing views are opened.  The flat mountain plateau is equipped with everything necessary and equipped with a cable car.  Hiking along the slopes, where several routes of varying degrees of difficulty, including for climbers, are very popular. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Boulders beach </h2><p>  Boulders Beach, which is part of the national park, is not an ordinary place.  It pleases tourists not only with amazing views overlooking the expanses of the ocean.  One of the main attractions of South Africa is protected from strong winds and high waves by powerful stone boulders, whose age exceeds one million years.  Gigantic cobblestones are scattered all over the coast and form small miraculous pools where penguins gladly splash, delighting tourists.  The real kingdom of waterfowl living here for more than thirty years is adored by guests of the city, who rush here specially to see the pretty inhabitants of the beach and photograph them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beach boulders" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1706519.jpg" width="591"></div>

    <p>  Entrance to a corner far from civilization, where people and penguins peacefully coexist, is paid, and you can admire funny birds only from afar, from special platforms.  Cape Town, whose attractions can deliver a lot of pleasant emotions to both children and adults, is proud of the picturesque beach, which has become a popular destination among tourists. </p><h2>  Constantia valley </h2><p>  And in the south of Table Mountain is a wonderful corner, called the "cradle" of winemaking in South Africa.  Several centuries ago, it turned out that the climate of the city is extremely suitable even for capricious grape varieties, and a new era of sparkling drink has begun.  The Constance Valley, famous for its luxurious restaurants and numerous spa salons, invariably attracts the attention of travelers from around the world.  The hilly plain, comfortably located at the very foot of the peak, amazes with the incredible beauty of the landscape.  Good weather always reigns here, and even in winter the temperature does not fall below 20 degrees Celsius. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="valley constant" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1706518.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Wine tourism lovers go on a plantation tour and taste delicious wine, worthy of all praise.  Such a trip will give an unforgettable experience and will not leave disappointed guests who came to the old Cape Town, whose sights made the look of the glorious city unique. </p><h2>  Castle of good hop </h2><p>  The oldest building in South Africa appeared on the site of a historic fort built by the founder of Cape Town - Jan van Ribik - in the middle of the XVII century.  The Castle of Good Hope was a defensive structure, and since the 30s of the last century it received the status of a military museum.  Outside, the monument of the fortification architecture of Holland looks rather inconspicuous, and inside there are interesting exhibits telling about the rich history of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cape town attractions" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1706507.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kirstenbosch </h2><p>  Recently, it has been protected by UNESCO, recognized as one of the largest parks in the world, Kirstenbosch, which is famous for Cape Town.  The sights of the city are incredibly diverse and are of particular interest to all its guests.  According to local residents, to get acquainted with the inimitable flora of South Africa, you need to go to the national botanical garden, which is located on the territory of the Table Mountain Reserve.  Not only admired tourists come here, but also citizens who have fun picnics on the side of the mountain. </p><p>  Kirstenbosch is the brainchild of the botanist G. G. Pearson, who began in 1903 the work to improve the area.  In the green oasis, more than nine thousand different plant species are represented.  A luxurious natural corner is decorated with interesting sculptures imported from Zimbabwe.  A walk along the stone-lined paths of the botanical garden will bring great pleasure to everyone who is tired of the noisy metropolis and is looking for peace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in cape town" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1706504.jpg" width="600"></div>
