  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Openwork stripes with knitting needles: schemes with a description. Openwork patterns with knitting needles.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Openwork</span> of fine yarn is suitable for light summer outfits: blouses, topics, hats, scarves, t-shirts.  From cotton threads airy lace napkins, furniture paths, collars are obtained of amazing beauty.  And from thick yarn, you can knit a pullover with openwork stripes, a sweater or a cardigan.  It is only important to select the picture for the product successfully. </p><h2>  Explanation of Abbreviations </h2><p>  They will help to make openwork stripes with the needles of a scheme with a description.  All that is required of the wizard is the strict implementation of instructions.  The following signs and abbreviations are used in the schemes: </p><p>  L - facial loop.  You can knit in any convenient way. </p><p>  And - the wrong loop. </p><p>  2 l.  per lane  - the front of the two knitted together.  She is knitted, capturing both loops on the front wall.  That is, during operation, a spoke is introduced from right to left. </p><p>  2 l.  for the ass.  - the front of the two knitted together.  When knitting, two loops grab the back wall.  To do this, the needle is introduced from left to right. </p><p>  3 l.  - the front of their three loops, knitted together, is formed in several stages.  First, from the right to the left, the needle is introduced into two loops.  They are knit together.  Then the resulting loop is moved to the left knitting needle.  The next untied loop is thrown over the already received one.  She kind of puts on her.  So it turns out a neat sharp corner. </p><h2>  The principle of knitting openwork patterns with knitting needles </h2><p>  Schemes with a description of the drawings will allow even a beginner knitter to create wonderful clothes or an interior item with her own hands.  Holes arranged in a specific order create a pattern.  The thing itself, thanks to openwork, acquires airiness and relief. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="auntekristy.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The scarf connected by openwork strips" class="if uuid-3008011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3008011.jpg"></div><p>  A pattern is created in two ways. </p><h2>  The first version of knitting openwork pattern </h2><p>  It is based on crochets.  They are made two or three in front of each loop, which is knitted with a facial one.  In the wrong row, the crochets are shed, increasing the length of the loops, as a result of which holes are formed in the fabric.  The wrong side and the next two rows are knitted facial.  Then the pattern repeats. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Openwork loop pattern" class="if uuid-3008014" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3008014.jpg"></div><p>  In this way, you can get only horizontal lace stripes with knitting needles. </p><p>  A diagram with a description and a photo of the result clearly explain the sequence of actions when knitting with elongated loops of a more complex pattern - "Curls". </p><h2>  Description, photo and diagram of a pattern with elongated loops </h2><p>  The pattern "Curls" can cause difficulty in performing.  But detailed diagrams with a description of openwork stripes with knitting needles will help to understand the process.  It is important only to treat work with utmost attention. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Elongated crochets" class="if uuid-3008019" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3008019.jpg"></div><p>  An additional designation appears on the diagram - a green cross, crossing out three elongated loops at once.  Otherwise, this knitting element can be called "three out of three."  The description below explains in detail how the pattern is formed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern knitting openwork pattern &quot;Curls&quot;" class="if uuid-3008158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3008158.jpg"></div><p>  The step-by-step process is as follows: </p><ul><li>  In the front row, three double crochets are made in front of each loop.  Then she fits the front. </li><li>  In the second row, the crochets are discarded. </li><li>  Three loops are stretched to the full length and transferred to the left knitting needle. </li><li>  They need to be knitted together face crossed. </li><li>  Then it should again be transferred to the left knitting needle. </li><li>  Now we introduce the needle from left to right behind all the crochets and make a loop using the working thread. </li><li>  The previously knitted crossed front loop is transferred to the right knitting needle. </li><li>  Introducing the knitting needle from right to left in all three yarn, pull the third. </li><li>  In the third row, all the loops are facial. </li><li>  In the fourth we use the wrong side knit. </li><li>  The fifth and sixth rows are knitted with facial loops. </li><li>  Next, the pattern algorithm is repeated. </li></ul><p>  Such knitted horizontal lace stripes are used to make thin air scarves, decorate a coquette or blouse bodice. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The second way to knit openwork </h2><p>  It consists in the fact that holes are formed in place of the yarn, which in the next row are knitted as independent loops.  But in this case, the row may increase in width. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Horizontal strip zigzag" class="if uuid-3008018" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3008018.jpg"></div><p>  In order for the number of loops to remain the same, it is necessary to knit some of them (often located nearby) together.  When working, it is very important to observe the slope.  In the patterns of openwork patterns with knitting needles, it is necessary to indicate which wall you need to take the loop for when they are knit together. </p><p>  Stripes can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal. </p><h2>  Figure "Column of rhombuses" </h2><p>  This is one of the openwork patterns discussed here with knitting needles with patterns.  It is also created using crochets and knit together. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Openwork drawing &quot;Columns from rhombuses&quot;" class="if uuid-3008023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3008023.jpg"></div><p>  The result of the work is a knitted openwork strip.  A description diagram shows how to implement it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Diagram of the pattern &quot;Columns of rhombuses&quot;" class="if uuid-3020268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3020268.jpg"></div><p>  The whole pattern is formed of four rows.  Moreover, purl knit according to the picture. </p><p>  It should be noted that the strip itself is made with facial loops, between which the wrong ones pass.  This creates the effect of knitted elastic.  The drawing is somewhat pulled together in width.  It is not recommended to use it for knitting freely falling folds, for example, in skirts and flared trousers. </p><p>  But the pattern looks beautiful on blouses, cardigans, bodice dresses, sweaters and pullovers.  You can use it for cross knitting. </p><p>  If desired, using this algorithm, you can knit wide openwork stripes with needles, starting a pattern with 7 or 9 loops.  In this case, the height of each report will increase. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern of knitting wide openwork stripes" class="if uuid-3052192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3052192.jpg"></div><h2>  Pullover with openwork stripes "Columns of rhombuses" </h2><p>  The presented model consists of parts connected by lace and boucle.  Inserts on the sides and sleeves are sewn.  They can increase the size of the model if the owner is a little better. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Pullover pattern &quot;Columns of rhombuses&quot;" class="if uuid-3012544" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3012544.jpg"></div><p>  An interesting element in the design of the model is the upper part, that is, the yoke of the bodice and back, which fits together with the sleeves.  This part is solid.  As a result, the yoke pattern is transverse. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern for a pullover with a yoke turning into sleeves." class="if uuid-3020281" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3020281.jpg"></div><p>  For the manufacture of a pullover, patterns are used.  Applying finished parts to the patterns, the number of loops in a row decreases or increases.  You can use as a picture any of the openwork patterns presented in the article by knitting needles with schemes. </p><h2>  Column of Leaves Pattern </h2><p>  Knitted with needles, an openwork vertical strip, like the previous one, can have an elastic effect.  In this embodiment, between the columns of leaves from the above scheme, vertical stripes of purl stitches are knitted.  Therefore, this pattern should also be used only for certain types of products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nzbzd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Openwork drawing &quot;Columns of leaves&quot;" class="if uuid-3008012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3008012.jpg"></div><p>  The second option will be considered here.  Instead of purl vertical stripes between columns of leaves placed a narrow pigtail, knitted by the method of wrapping.  Such a pattern has no gum effect and is more prominent.  Therefore, you can use such openwork stripes for cross knitting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting pattern &quot;Columns of leaves&quot;" class="if uuid-3008024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3008024.jpg"></div><p>  It is very convenient to carry out a knitted openwork pattern according to the scheme.  The first, third and fifth rows are knitted equally.  In the diagram, this is indicated by green numbers on the right.  The second, fourth and sixth rows are identically executed. </p><h2>  Openwork stripes "Spikelets with a slope" </h2><p>  The diagonal knitted pattern looks great in cardigans and blouses, sweaters and bodice dresses.  He will decorate hats, shawls, berets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Openwork diagonal strip &quot;Spikelets&quot;" class="if uuid-3008021" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3008021.jpg"></div><p>  When knitting with openwork diagonal stripes, two methods are used.  The first is based on the displacement of the picture to the right or left.  "Spikelets with a slope" just do just that. </p><p>  Spikelet from the scheme is knitted as follows: </p><ul><li>  From under the third loop on the left needle, the facial loop is tied.  It needs to be pulled to the desired length so that the pattern does not contract.  Then they put it on the left knitting needle. </li><li>  Face the knit two together.  It is better to grab them with a knitting needle from right to left. </li><li>  The next loop is the front. </li><li>  For the subsequent yarn, two loops are knitted together front. </li></ul><p>  To obtain a dividing openwork strip perform the following sequence.  Double crochet, two stitches are sewn together on the wrong side.  This is done so that, due to subsequent yarn, the fabric does not increase in width.  Again, the yarn is made in the dividing openwork strip. </p><p>  Here is the main recurring report in the front rows.  All purl knit simply: where there is a spikelet - 3 purl knit.  Openwork dividing stripes, consisting of two yarn and loops between them - three front. </p><p>  The difficulty here lies in the process of shifting the pattern.  It is very important to remember that the crochets are made only in the indicated cases: after the spikelet, if in it 2 loops were knitted together, and in the strip itself, if the two wrong ones turned into one.  In each row, you need to shift the pattern to the right. </p><p>  For example, the beginning of knitting falls on the spikelet, and in the end it ends.  The sample will consist of 17 loops.  The first edge, 2 full reports, spikelet and edge.  The wrong side is simple.  This is edge, * 3 wrong, 3 front *, repeat report between the stars, again 3 wrong, edge. </p><p>  The next (third) row should shift.  Therefore, the loop is tied out from under the second.  Then they put it on the left knitting needle.  Now you need to knit 2 together.  Then again make the front of 2 loops.  After that, you can continue to knit according to the pattern.  At the end of the row after the spikelet, the yarn is added in front of the hem. </p><p>  The fourth row begins with 1 wrong side.  Then comes the knitting according to the drawing.  That is, 3 facial, 3 wrong ones alternate.  So they knit almost to the end of the row, until the last incomplete spikelet of 2 loops in front of the edge remains.  They are knitted with two wrong seams. </p><p>  The fifth row is still shifting.  2 loops of incomplete spikelet knit together the front.  Then draw openwork dividing strip.  It is knitted like this: yarn, 2 loops together wrong side, yarn.  This is followed by repetition of the pattern reports.  At the end of the row, yarn is made after the spikelet.  The last loop before the hem is sewn on the wrong side.  It must be remembered that the yarn is not made here, since there was no decrease in strip!  And the second yarn can be done only when in the dividing openwork diagonal two loops are knitted together on the wrong side. </p><p>  The sixth row begins with two facial, not three.  This is because the dividing strip in the previous row was incomplete.  It ends with two wrong sides. </p><p>  In the seventh row there was only 1 loop from the spikelet.  We throw it on the edge or knit them together face.  The reduction is done - you can make a crochet.  Then we knit dividing strips and spikelets according to the description.  We end with a full dividing strip. </p><p>  This is the pattern shift algorithm to the right.  Thanks to this scheme, openwork stripes are obtained with an inclination. </p><h2>  The second way to knit diagonal stripes </h2><p>  It is based on the fact that the fabric itself is knitted from the corner, in the wrong rows making the yarn about the hem. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The method of knitting diagonal openwork polyps" class="if uuid-3052195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3052195.jpg"></div><p>  As a basis for an openwork pattern, you can take any of the options you like.  It is only important that the canvas is not strongly deformed and is even.  You can dial 3-5 loops for the first row.  During operation, you should constantly apply the canvas to the pattern, so as not to go beyond the boundaries of the desired pattern. </p>
