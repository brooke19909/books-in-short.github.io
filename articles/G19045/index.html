  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Insects from beads - simple crafts with schemes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Beadwork has recently gained great popularity among handmade masters, which can be explained by a huge number of various crafts that are made from the smallest elements.  These are brooches and rings, bracelets and earrings, decorative embroidery of paintings and clothes, necklaces and beads, key rings and pendants on bags and purses.  You can list for a long time.  Crafts are performed on a plane or made voluminous. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to weave insects with beads.  These are spiders and dragonflies, wasps and butterflies.  If desired, using the schemes presented in the article, you can make yourself a striped bee or a fly, a ladybug or a shiny bronze.  They often make crafts on a strong nylon string or fishing line, but many craftsmen like to place beads on a thin wire - after all, such products can be given absolutely any shape. </p><p>  So, insects from beads can spread legs, such as a spider, to the sides.  It is interesting to lift the wings of a butterfly or dragonfly a bit, simulating a flight.  The paws of any beetle on the thread will simply be lowered down, and on the wire, they will be correctly bent in half.  Dense flaps can be made slightly ajar so that the inside of the body of the insect is visible.  It will be much easier to fantasize after learning how to work with beads. </p><h2>  Spider </h2><p>  Learning how to make bulk insects from beads will start with a cute spider.  First of all, you need to choose suitable parts for the trunk and legs.  First, the largest pebble in the frame is strung on a double folded wire, then a silver center is added and the body is finished with a blue oblong head.  The ends of the wire with pliers are turned into rings in opposite directions.  The same procedure must be repeated at the beginning of the head. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bead spider" class="if uuid-3105947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3105947.jpg"></div><p>  Further work is carried out on the paws.  They are made in pairs, stringing beads equally on both sides of the wire.  Then, in the center of the legs, the parts are shifted to one or the other side, freeing up a small space of the wire for connection to the body.  The front legs are wound between the head and a silver bead.  And the hind legs are attached between the last and largest element.  It turned out to be an excellent insect made of beads, which can be attached to the zipper of a jacket or to the ring of a bag. </p><h2>  Simple dragonfly </h2><p>  Dragonfly became one of the popular insects for crafts.  It has a peculiar shape that does not resemble any other (meaning an insect) with elongated wings and a thin tail.  It is most convenient to make such an insect from beads according to the scheme located below in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dragonfly bead according to the scheme" class="if uuid-3105967" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3105967.jpg"></div><p>  The work is carried out on two pieces of wire, highlighted in the schematic image of green and black lines.  To keep the beads on the body together, the ends of the wire are inserted in one row at the same time left and right. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The craft begins with two beads, and in the second row they add another one, and in this place the eyes stand out with black details.  In the third row, the wire is pulled out to the sides, and the required number of beads is strung on it to make the front wings.  The workpiece is bent by an arc, and the wire is inserted into the 4th row on the other side. </p><p>  The lower narrow part of the bead insect in the diagram depicts a tail.  Each row consists of only two parts.  Not many small parts are taken for the rear wings, since they are smaller.  At the end of the craft, the pliers bend the wire with ringlets.  They will not let the parts fall and hold the structure together. </p><div class="photo" data-original="littlebeader.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a dragonfly from beads" class="if uuid-3106002" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3106002.jpg"></div><p>  You can vary the shape of a dragonfly using elongated beads or alternating their colors, as in the photo in the article. </p><h2>  Butterfly </h2><p>  It‚Äôs much easier to make a butterfly out of small parts.  The body is assembled into two pieces of wire at the same time.  The antennae with one small pebble at the end is twisted in front. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ideasreciclables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a butterfly from beads" class="if uuid-3105973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3105973.jpg"></div><p>  Larger front and smaller hind wings strengthen at one point between the beads of the trunk and tail.  Wings can be made plain or different colors, leave voids in the middle or completely fill the surface. </p><h2>  Bee </h2><p>  Knowing the principle of doing crafts according to the scheme, try to make an original brooch-insect from beads.  This is a bee or wasp with a striped body of black and yellow colors.  Her wings are single and small, her head is large and has a sharp sting at the end. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bee bead" class="if uuid-3106000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3106000.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, creating with beads is very interesting. </p><p>  In the process of work, it is recommended to cover the table surface with a plain plain tablecloth, so that in case of a part falling, it is easy to find. </p><p>  Try new types of needlework, improve your skills and make original bead jewelry with your own hands!  Have a good start! </p>
