This happened back in 600 BC.  It was originally called Massaliah.  There is a legend about the creation of the city.  It is inextricably linked with the love story of the Greek Protis and Hyptida, who was the daughter of the king of the Ligurians. </p><p>  The king hoped to marry his daughter.  To this end, he ordered the organization of a magnificent feast.  Hyptida chose Protis as her suitors.  According to legend, the couple received a part of the coast as a dowry.  Here the city was founded. </p><p>  Gradually, Massalia began to turn into a large shopping center.  A lot of trading posts were based on the coast.  An independent republic has long been in alliance with Rome.  This protected her from the interference of other tribes and protected her commercial interests.  Later, during the military clashes, the city was destroyed by Roman troops.  He still maintained independence, but his influence was greatly weakened. </p><p>  The city began to revive only in the X century.  In many ways, the efforts of the dukes of Provence contributed to this.  Later, the settlement was included in the French kingdom.  At the beginning of the XVIII century there was an outbreak of a plague epidemic.  Only about ten percent of the population survived.  According to various sources, from 40 to 60 thousand people died in that period. </p><p>  During the revolution, the city supported the Republicans.  Therefore, the French anthem was called "Marseillaise".  The economy of the city was significantly undermined during the <span>continental blockade</span> imposed by Napoleon.  With the opening of the <span>Suez Canal,</span> Marseille came to life again.  In many ways, the development of the colonial activity of the state contributed to this.  During World War II, Marseille (France) was a major center of resistance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marseille city in france" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/470320.jpg" width="550"></div>
