    <p>  How to sew a New Year's costume for the baby with your own hands, and we will discuss further.  The article will discuss the main points of the cut, the assembly sequence of all parts, tips for processing seams and interesting ideas for images. </p><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  New Year's costumes for babies must be made of soft fabrics, so that the child is cozy and comfortable.  So, preference should be given to cotton-based velor, velsoft or fleece.  For a thinner suit, a cooler or interlock is suitable.  In any case, New Year's costumes for kids should be sewn from soft knitted fabrics.  The choice of fabric directly depends on the invented image. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Costume Ideas </h2><p>  It is best to make New Year's suits for babies up to a year in the form of overalls, because a child at this age is almost always on hand, and it‚Äôs not very convenient to constantly put a blouse in pants.  Even if this is an outfit for a baby, the skirt can be sewn directly onto the jumpsuit.  You can beat this foundation as you like. </p><p>  It can be a little Santa Claus, a dog, a dragon, a snowflake, a ladybug, a bunny, a teddy bear, a Snow Maiden or superheroes: Batman, Superman and Spider-Man.  The main thing is to choose the right fabric and make the appropriate accents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas costumes for kids photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1058512.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <ol><li>  Santa  Such a New Year‚Äôs costume for a baby up to one year old can consist of overalls with sewn-in white edges on the sleeves, around the neck, along the hips and trousers, with a black belt made of soft leather sewn to the base and plaques made of yellow soft felt.  The cap should be in the form of a cap with a fur pompom.  It can be made on ties so that it does not fall off the baby. For such an outfit, you need a meter of red fabric for the base, about 30 cm of white velsoft or fur with a small pile, 2 cm of leather and a piece of felt for decoration.  It is better to make a jumpsuit with a hidden zipper in front, so that it is convenient for the baby to lie in it. </li><li>  Superman.  New Year's costumes for kids are good because they do not require fine detail.  Enough basic elements to make the image recognizable.  So, for example, Batman can be made of gray fabric with black legs from the knees and sleeves from the elbows.  On the belt you can sew a yellow strip of fabric.  And on the chest make a <span>Batman badge: a</span> black bat on a yellow oval. </li><li>  Charming little Snowflake will not leave anyone indifferent.  A little white jumpsuit with a tulle tutu skirt sewn at the waist, a lace collar and cuffs, a snowflake sewn from a sequin ribbon on the chest is the best solution for the baby. </li></ol><p>  And these are just some of the ideas.  New Year's costumes for babies, photos of which are presented in the article, will be a good example and source of inspiration.  By fantasizing, you can create unique and unique outfits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY Christmas costumes for kids" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1058513.jpg" width="416"></div>

Building a jumpsuit pattern is easy.  To do this, you need to take the jumpsuit or t-shirt and pants available in the wardrobe (matching it from the waistline), lay it on paper in the inside-out form and circle it around the contour.  Then you should determine the depth of the neck in front and behind and the seams of the connection of the base with the sleeves.  Further, all the details are cut out of paper.  In this case, the part with the body must be folded in half so that the sides are symmetrical.  Then they are cut along the fold and the front shelf is made of one, deepening the neck, and the second is left for the back template. </p><h2>  Cut fabric </h2><p>  After the pattern is ready, you can start cutting.  Christmas costumes for babies require special treatment, so you need to give a good allowance for the seams, about 1.5 cm. The details can be joined with an overlock, but it is better to cut the sections with a <span>linen seam.</span>  To turn the sleeve, you should also give an allowance of about 3 cm or cut out additional stripes of fabric for the design of the cuffs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patterns of Christmas costumes for kids" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1058529.jpg" width="355"></div>

    <p>  The size of the decorative elements is determined during the work.  By attaching a piece of material to the details of the overalls, you can adjust the required size of the icons and the length of the belt.  Patterns of Christmas costumes for kids are not much different from each other.  A significant role here is played by design, which needs to be given due attention. </p><h2>  Assembly process </h2><p>  The work of combining the cut parts begins with the connection of the shoulder seams.  But here you can make a digression and first sew all the decorative elements to the details.  Fragments of a belt, skirt, edge and so on are sewn to the back and shelves.  After that you can go to the main stages of assembly.  First, close the shoulder seams and process the neck with a <span>slanting inlay</span> or a strip of fabric, then sew the zipper into the middle section of the front, then sew the gusset to the front of the overalls.  It is a small rhombus that is inserted into the bow stitch in panties.  This will allow the child to easily move his legs and give free space for the diaper. </p><p>  After proceeding to the connection of the side sections and the middle stepping seam.  At this stage, we can assume that the costume is ready. </p><p>  As you can see, making Christmas costumes for kids with their own hands is not so difficult as it might seem at first glance.  And even if there is absolutely no experience, the key to success will be desire and the right fabric. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="New Year's costume for a baby up to a year" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1058521.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Practical tips </h2><ul><li>  For inexperienced craftswomen it is best to take fleece or velor for work.  Thin pile of these materials will hide the possible flaws of tailoring. </li><li>  It is better not to smooth the product, but to rinse it after manufacturing, so as not to melt the canvas. </li><li>  For decorative elements, you should take a fabric that does not crumble.  It can be the same velor of a different color or supplex. </li><li>  If any sign is planned on the chest, then the hidden zipper can be shifted to the side or sewn in so that when fastening the elements are evenly connected. </li><li>  It is better to sew all decorative motifs with a small zigzag, this will make the seams more elastic. </li></ul><h2>  Knitted suit </h2><p>  No less interesting will be a knitted New Year's costume for the baby.  In its manufacture, you can also use a <span>pattern of overalls.</span>  It is important to choose the right thread.  They are subject to special requirements: they must be soft and natural.  To make the costume look more effective, it is better to make it layered, that is, decorative elements should be knitted separately and applied from over the base. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted christmas costume for baby" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1058541.jpg" width="238"></div>
