Naturally, they did not bypass the sphere of banking operations.  Using phones, we track balances, open deposits and order cards.  And gadgets greatly facilitate the possibility of transferring funds between bank accounts.  In your hands are useful tools that allow you to perform a large number of actions related to money.  For example, you can transfer SMS to Sberbank card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sberbank.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Appearance of Sberbank card" class="if uuid-3196793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90067/3196793.jpg"></div><h2>  Sberbank Mobile Banking </h2><p>  Sberbank is the largest financial institution in the country and Eastern Europe, which values ‚Äã‚Äãits reputation very much and tries to keep up to date.  Naturally, in order to provide its customers with the widest possible range of services, the bank acquired services such as a personal account (Sberbank Online) and SMS service, simply called ‚ÄúMobile Bank‚Äù.  We will analyze it in more detail. </p><p>  The capabilities of this service are conventionally divided into two categories: SMS-informing and quick payments.  The communication strategy depends on the Mobile Bank package you have connected.  It can be complete and economical.  A full package costs either 30 or 60 rubles, depending on the type of your card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the case of an economical package, you will receive SMS for operations on the Internet and Sberbank Online, SMS about transactions already completed, you can make SMS transfers.  Each balance request through the message system will cost you three rubles. </p><p>  If you have a complete package, in addition to the already listed, you will receive SMS about all card transactions made through any channel (Internet, ATM, retail outlets, etc.), and balance requests will be free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="akket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Mobile Banking" class="if uuid-3196808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90067/3196808.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the fact that the presence of the ‚ÄúMobile Bank‚Äù gives all the information about the card, it also provides you with the opportunity to conduct operations, which is called ‚ÄúFast Payments‚Äù.  Having a payment instrument with a Mobile Bank connected, it would be strange not to know, for example, how to transfer SMS to a Sberbank card. </p><h2>  Quick payments </h2><p>  This option is included in the Mobile Bank package for free, both full and economical.  It always acts by default, unless you specifically disable it.  To do this, you can send a special SMS command or call the contact center of the bank.  What is it for?  Well, for example, if you leave the phone unattended and are afraid that someone might take it and send yourself money.  Or are you afraid of viruses that steal money using SMS. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What does this service give us?  Through it you can pay your own or any other phone number, transfer money between Sberbank's personal cards or from your own to someone else's.  It is also possible to pay for services of some organizations. </p><p>  All payments are made by sending SMS to 900 short number. Each operation has its own team, it is important not to mix them up!  In order not to make mistakes, you must always remember how to transfer SMS to a Sberbank card or to a mobile phone account. </p><h2>  Card transfers </h2><p>  How to transfer SMS to Sberbank card, instructions below. </p><p>  We write an SMS to number 900 with the text ‚ÄúTransfer XXXX 1000‚Äù, where XXXX is the number of the Sberbank card (consists of 16 or 18 characters), and 1000 is the transfer amount.  Also, instead of the card number, you can specify the phone number connected to the mobile bank.  It is important to note that if several cards of one person are connected to the phone, then money can come to any of them, you cannot choose a specific one.  And if these are cards of different people, then transferring by phone number is generally impossible.  In both situations, you will have to transfer by card number. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sberbank-online-info.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mobile Banking Teams" class="if uuid-3196801" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90067/3196801.jpg"></div><p>  It is also possible to transfer money to a Sberbank card via telephone using the Sberbank Online mobile application. </p><h2>  Possible mistakes </h2><p>  When sending SMS, some errors may occur: </p><ul><li>  as mentioned above, you cannot transfer by phone number if Sberbank cards of different people are connected to it; </li><li>  most operators do not send SMS to 900 if the phone has a negative balance (even if they have an SMS package); </li><li>  transfers from a blocked card or to it are impossible; </li><li>  if your phone‚Äôs memory is full or you have accumulated a lot of SMS from number 900, then there may be problems sending or receiving new data. </li></ul><p>  In any case, if errors occur that you could not solve yourself, call 900 at Sberbank, contact center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yakutia.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Online application" class="if uuid-3196796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90067/3196796.jpg"></div><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  Some tips for those who have only recently learned how to transfer SMS to Sberbank cards. </p><ol><li>  Be very careful when typing the message, and also read the recipient's name in the SMS reply to make sure that you are translating the right person.  If you make a mistake during the transfer, the bank will not cancel it at your request. </li><li>  Up to eight thousand rubles can be transferred to other people's cards per day.  If you need to send more, use the Sberbank Online service. </li><li>  Between your cards you can transfer up to one hundred thousand per day.  To do this, use the request ‚ÄúTransfer   1000‚Äù, where  is the card with which the charge is being made, and KKKK is the card to be credited. </li></ol>
