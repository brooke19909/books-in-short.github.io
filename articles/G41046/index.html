The creation of its main city, Orel, was associated with the reign of Ivan the Terrible, and the formation of a province around it took place during the time of Catherine the Great. </p><p>  What was the province and its main city, you can find out from the article. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Oryol province was part of the Russian Empire, and later Soviet Russia.  It existed from 1796 to 1928.  Located in the European part of the country, it was bordered by the following provinces: </p><ul><li>  Kaluga, Tula, Kursk (north). </li><li>  Kursk (south). </li><li>  Voronezh (east). </li><li>  Smolenskaya, Chernihiv (west). </li></ul><p>  The area was more than forty-six square kilometers, and the population reached two million people.

    <p>  The history of the Oryol province is associated with the emergence of the city of Orel.  The year of its occurrence is considered to be the 1566th.  Since that time, the Oryol district has been formed.  By the eighteenth century, the Oryol province was part of the Kiev province, and later belonged to Belgorod, until eventually became the administrative-territorial unit of the empire. </p><h2>  History of the province </h2><p>  In 1778, Empress Catherine the Second issued a Decree, as a result of which the Oryol province was established.  Initially, it was divided into thirteen counties, although their number has changed throughout history.  The political, religious, cultural center became the city of Oryol. </p><p>  After 1917, the province lasted another eleven years until it was abolished.  By 1937, the Oryol region was created, which included part of the former province.  The main city in the educated area again became the Eagle. </p><h2>  Orel city </h2><p>  Oryol province, whose photos are presented in the form of <span>historical maps,</span> has always been associated with its central city.  It was founded in 1566 (as mentioned in the <span>Nikon Chronicle).</span>  At this time, by decree of Ivan the Fourth Terrible, the fortress of Oryol was founded in order to protect the southern borders of the kingdom. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Since 1577, the Cossack settlement was located here.  City Cossacks lived in it.  The settlement had its own wooden church, which was called Pokrovskaya. </p><p>  In 1605, the city was occupied by False Dmitry the First with the army.  And two years later, he became the residence of False Dmitry the Second.  A few years later the city was completely destroyed by the Poles led by A. Lisovsky.  They restored it only in 1636, since it was of particular importance in protecting the Russian lands from Tatar raids. </p><p>  Gradually, the border of the kingdom moved south.  Therefore, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, the fortress in Orel was abolished, having lost its defense significance.  The city began to specialize in the grain trade, and also became the center of the created Oryol province, which subsequently transformed into a province, and in modern times is the region of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  The city began to develop in the nineteenth century.  During this period, pavement was laid, a city professional fire department was created, telegraph communication was established, banking was developing, water supply appeared.  The paved railway and highway cover connected Oryol with the lands of Ukraine, the Volga region, the Baltic states and, of course, Moscow.  This allowed him to become a major transport center. </p><h2>  Famous people of the province </h2><p>  Description of the Oryol province would not be complete without mentioning the outstanding personalities of the region.  On the lands there were many estates of the noble families known in Russia.  The names of such writers as Turgenev I. S., Fet A. A., Prishvin M. M., Pisarev D. I. are associated with the Oryol region. </p>
