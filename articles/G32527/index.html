    <p>  For the existence of the organization to be long and the goals set for it to be achieved, it is necessary to create the right management system. </p><p>  A system is the ordering of all components and their combination into a single whole to achieve a common goal.  In other words, it is orderliness and subordination to the main task. </p><p>  Management includes functions: planning, motivation, organization and control.  With their help, the achievement of tasks is achieved. </p><p>  Management systems are ordered processes of planning, organization, motivation, control.  They are aimed at fulfilling the tasks of production and achieving the main goal of the existence of the organization. </p><h2>  Component control systems </h2><p>  The organization‚Äôs management system includes all the ongoing processes, as well as all services, subsystems, communications of the enterprise.  The team at the enterprise can be divided into two groups.  The first is managed, the second is managing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Consider them.  The managed group includes elements that are involved in the process of creating material and spiritual goods or providing services.  These are subordinates.  The management group carries out all the functions necessary to fulfill the tasks assigned to the organization, for this it must have the necessary resources: material, labor, financial.  She coordinates the work of all employees and owns all the technical means, for example, such as communications, technology, is also responsible for the work of production and the process of further improving the organization.  <span>These are the leaders.</span> </p><p>  Depending on the structure of the organization and the number of subordinates, there may be several managers, and all of them are subordinate to one main manager. </p><p>  The following stages of the control subsystem are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  planning - shows what result can be achieved; </li><li>  regulation - maintaining the optimal established mode of operation; </li><li>  marketing; </li><li>  accounting; </li><li>  the control. </li></ul><p>  Management systems are systems that combine all of these components to achieve the highest goal of the organization. </p><h2>  Subject and Object </h2><p>  Any concept has its own subject and object.  Consider what kind of personnel management system they are. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The objects include: </p><ul><li>  employees; </li><li>  employees </li><li>  groups of employees; </li><li>  labor collective. </li></ul><p>  The subject of the management system is represented by various <span>structures of management</span> personnel. </p><h2>  Types of leadership </h2><p>  Coordination of work in an organization can take place in four forms: </p><ul><li>  Linear when each subordinate leader is subordinate to a superior.  Their actions are coordinated and aimed at fulfilling specific goals.  More commonly used for lower levels of organization. </li><li>  Functional.  There are several groups of governing bodies, with each responsible for a specific type of activity.  For example, one - for planning, the other - for the technical base.  However, there are difficulties when several different tasks ‚Äúdescend‚Äù to employees and require their quick completion.  The ideal option for the existence of such a system is in combination with a linear one. </li><li>  Line staff.  When line managers are created headquarters.  Moreover, they do not make any decisions, but only advise, direct employees.  They are designed to reduce and distribute line manager responsibilities. </li><li>  Dot matrix.  Management occurs both horizontally and vertically.  Such structures are used for management at construction sites, where each complex is divided into nodes that have their own leader. </li></ul><h2>  An example of an enterprise coordination structure </h2><p>  Consider an example of a workshop control system in production. </p><p>  The workshop is one of the main links responsible for the functioning of the entire production.  To achieve the goals of the organization, it is necessary to create the right management system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The director appoints a chief and his deputies to the workshop, who should organize the implementation of tasks received from the senior manager.  At the same time, the shop manager must himself control the attitude of personnel to production resources.  A variant is possible when this function is entrusted to a specially appointed employee.  So, for example, the consumption of raw materials, compliance with safety rules and sanitary maintenance of the workshop are controlled. </p><p>  The coordination structure includes the presence of team leaders who receive tasks from the master and distribute it among the workers.  They also organize their implementation, provide professional assistance, and if necessary, help the master to exercise control. </p><h2>  Modern enterprise management </h2><p>  In the current environment, the coordination of staff requires special skill from the leader.  An unstable economic situation and competition lead to this.  Therefore, creating modern management systems, the manager must know the principles of their construction. </p><p>  For an enterprise to function and develop, its products must be competitive.  It largely depends on which management strategy will be chosen.  For the enterprise, it must be unique - this is the main sign of a successful existence. </p>

    <p>  For a company to exist for a long time and make a profit, products must withstand competition.  To improve the quality you need: </p><ul><li>  Have the necessary resources: raw materials, components. </li><li>  Improve production lines: update equipment, seeking to improve the quality of products. </li><li>  Periodically improve staff skills. </li><li>  To realize products. </li></ul><p>  The first thing a professional manager should start with is to develop management systems, analyze the enterprise, consider what elements are missing to achieve the goal, and figure out how to achieve them.  When developing a development strategy, it is necessary to take into account: </p><ul><li>  long-term goals of enterprise development; </li><li>  resources; </li><li>  technology; </li><li>  management system. </li></ul><p>  That is, in order to achieve its goals, the enterprise must have all the necessary resources, high-quality technologies that will process these resources, and a well-built management system. </p><p>  Moreover, the strategy should not be monolithic, but be able to modify depending on external and internal factors.  And the task of the management system is to control and timely amend the strategic goals of the organization. </p><p>  Thus, the effective management of a modern enterprise should be mobile and dependent on environmental factors. </p><h2>  Types of control systems </h2><p>  Management systems - these are areas of management activity that are associated with solving specific problems, aimed at the successful functioning of the enterprise. </p><p>  There are two main categories: </p><ul><li>  general - management of the company as a whole; </li><li>  functional - management of certain parts of the company. </li></ul><p>  The management system is a comprehensive collaboration of a common and functional kind to achieve the goals. </p>

This allows for improved management structure.  Coordination of the work of employees allows us to direct their activities in the right direction.  At the same time, the company interacts with the external environment: suppliers, customers, and employees. </p><p>  Types of control systems are also determined by control objects and vary in content.

    <p>  The design of management systems takes into account democratic centralism, a harmonious combination of unity of command and collegiality, responsibility, and the creative potential of employees. </p><h2>  Guidelines </h2><p>  The creation of management systems should be based on the following basic principles: </p><ul><li>  optimal separation of the organization structure into separate elements; </li><li>  hierarchical structure with the correct distribution of powers; </li><li>  organic interconnection of all levels of the organization; </li><li>  Arranging goals in order of importance </li><li>  consistency of structure links in the performance of tasks; </li><li>  Efficiency of making managerial decisions, if such a need arises; </li><li>  all stages of product life cycles, hierarchical structure, various management activities must exist in a complex; </li><li>  systematic - all management work is carried out continuously and lasts a long time; </li><li>  you need to learn from the experience of successful production of foreign companies; </li><li>  should use proven scientific methods in the management system; </li><li>  autonomy of subsystems; </li><li>  economic functions - when designing, lay down the reduction of management costs; </li><li>  development prospects; </li><li>  discussion of management decisions and choosing the best; </li><li>  stability and ability to survive in a competitive environment; </li><li>  create comfortable working conditions so that employees can give all their best at work; </li><li>  correctly allocate labor costs to perform specific production tasks; </li><li>  the adaptability of the organization system to external and internal changes; </li><li>  closed management process. </li></ul><p>  The implementation of the decision must go through all stages: planning, organization, coordination, control. </p><p>  Important: the management decision must be clear and intelligible, it is necessary to verify that the employee understood it correctly.
