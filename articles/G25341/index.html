People call these reservoirs a miracle.  Where are the <span>Blue Lakes of</span> Altai?  They are located near the village Uznezya in the Chemal district.  The name ‚Äúrecognizing‚Äù is translated from Altai as ‚Äúthe spirit of water‚Äù.  Indeed, everything in these places, surrounded by mountains with evergreen pine forests, is imbued with the spirit of magical water.  In such places, extraordinary legends are always born. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blue lakes of Altai" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1240176.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Legends </h2><p>  According to one legend, Khan Altai gave his daughter Katun an eye of extraordinary beauty so that she could see all the uniqueness of the picturesque landscapes.  In this area, the river rapidly carries its waters.  But in order to protect themselves from the burning summer sun, "eyes" look at the world only in winter and autumn.  So you can see the Blue Lakes of Altai only from the end of August until the beginning of April, and in the spring and summer they are covered with muddy waters <span>of the Katun River.</span> </p><h2>  Lakes feature </h2><p>  What are these lakes so famous for?  First of all, unusual turquoise color, crystal clarity and transparency.  The bottom is clearly visible in them.  Local residents say that the water in the lakes cures eye diseases, energizes people with extraordinary energy and strengthens the immune system, which helps the healing air and colossal energy of Altai. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where are the blue lakes of Altai" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1240174.jpg" width="600"></div>

Some come here for romance and unforgettable experiences.  Others - for health, both physical and spiritual.  No wonder Christian missionaries declared these reservoirs holy places.  It is unique that from the 19th century on the holy day of the Epiphany, rituals are performed here, using natural fonts for this.  Currently, more and more people are gathering in these places in order to plunge into the crystal clear water.  The number of people wishing to visit the Blue Lakes of Altai and spend time here is constantly growing. </p><p>  What is the best time to visit these blessed places?  Someone loves autumn, someone winter, but most importantly, the day should be sunny and clear.  This will make it possible to enjoy the stunning color of the lakes and their amazing transparency. </p><p>  A bathhouse has been built on the island that separates water bodies from the Katun River.  A staircase is built directly from it, leading directly to the lakes.  Just imagine how pleasant it will be after a hot bath to immerse yourself in pure ice water.  This not only tempers the body, but also fills it with vital forces, which are so necessary for every person. </p><h2>  Characterization of Lakes </h2><p>  The blue lakes of Altai are unique in their kind.  Their number is not accurate.  Depending on weather conditions and season, there may be two or three.  As a rule, this depends on the Katun River, and more precisely, on the water level in its channel.  In spring and summer, mountain glaciers melt.  The water in the river is rapidly arriving, which leads to the complete absorption of lakes.  And in their place rushing muddy, seething waters of Katun.  By the end of August, the flow of the river becomes calmer.  Water gradually leaves, exposing lakes in the mirror surface of which the sky is reflected.  If you look closely at the surface, you can see how white fluffy clouds float.  The water in the lakes is so clear that colorful pebbles are visible at the bottom.  These water bodies are watery.  They feed on powerful underground sources.  The water in them, even in thirty-degree degrees of frost, does not freeze, and its temperature is kept at 8 ¬∞ C. They are small in size, but there are places where the depth reaches 17 meters.  Water flows from one lake to another, and then into the river itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blue lakes of Altai how to get there" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1240172.jpg" width="600"></div>

You can also take the bus.  This type of transport is very well established here.  The distance from Biysk to water bodies is about 170 km.  The quality of the road is excellent.  In order to get to the lakes, you will need to completely nip the village in the direction downstream of the river.  After that, you will need to leave the car and go along the path.  If the car has a low landing, it is recommended to park it in with.  Askate will continue on his way on foot, enjoying the beautiful scenery.  Be sure you will get a lot of impressions from this walk. </p><p>  In winter, around mid-January, the Blue Lakes, located on the left bank of the Katun, can be reached on the ice of the river.  But we must remember that this water stream is a mountain type.  And from this it follows that the river is quite stormy and therefore freezes hard.  The ice remains thin for a long time, which makes the crossing unsafe.  In order to make the route possible, the ice thickness must be at least 80 cm. </p><h2>  Askat village </h2><p>  For those travelers who prefer to walk around the village, it will be interesting to know some facts.  The name of this settlement is translated from Altai as ‚Äústone placers‚Äù.  The village is located in a unique place - in the Askat valley.  If you believe the locals, then the local territory has a lot of energy, which gives it an underground lake and the Katun River.  The village has a special microclimate: there are no winds, warm and mild winters.  Apple trees, cherries, pears and even grapes grow.  The village of Askat was founded by the Old Believers in 1866. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blue lakes of Altai" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1240173.jpg" width="600"></div>
