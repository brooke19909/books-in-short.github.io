Self-hardening polymer clay</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today there are a lot of creative people who have chosen clay modeling as their hobby.  Moreover, great opportunities have now opened up for them, with the advent of its new types on sale.  The material has become more elastic, convenient to use.  But many needlewomen are not yet familiar with it, and they have a natural question: "Polymer clay - what is it?" </p><h2>  FIMO, Kato and others </h2><p>  Polymer clay is an elastic material that is pleasant to work with.  It is produced with different properties: one should be dried in the oven, the other is self-hardening.  There are a lot of manufacturers of polymer clay today, these are FIMO, Decoclay, Cernit, Kato and other companies.  Having experienced different types of product, you can understand the purpose of each of them.  It‚Äôs convenient to make large figures from one, small details from another. </p><p>  The most popular among craftswomen is FIMO, a polymer clay that meets all the requirements.  The company launches FIMO air Light: after drying, the products become light.  In addition, it is a harmless and environmentally friendly material.  In English, the material is called modeling clay, and in our country it is clay, plastic, polymer, polymer clay. </p>

    <h2>  The composition of polymer clay </h2><p>  Each type of polymer clay consists of a base material and a plasticizer.  The base is polyvinyl chloride or PVC, and plasticizers are phthalates.  PVC in its structure is gelatinous particles which, when heated, perfectly absorb phthalates, a fatty liquid.  The mixture heats up and the gelling process begins: the powder particles swell, tightly set together.  The result is a substance called plasticized PVC.  The plasticity of the starting material is determined by plasticizers: the more of them, the softer the mass. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The manufacture of polymer clay includes color pigments, dyes.  The composition may include chalk or talc.  The properties of plastics are such that it quickly begins to harden, and 60 degrees Celsius is enough.  When working, this complicates the manufacturing process.  To slow down the gelling of the mass, stabilizers are added to it. </p><h2>  Clay properties </h2><p>  Polymer clay is a plastic mass that resembles plasticine, but with a characteristic odor.  When heated in an oven, in a microwave oven or in cooking, 130 degrees are enough for the products from it to solidify.  They lose their plasticity, their shape can no longer be changed.  Finished parts are glued together, and then the figure is painted with acrylics, varnished.  Some types of clay are available without color pigment.  But many manufacturers add fluorescent substances to it for a glow in the dark, sparkles. </p><p>  Self-hardening polymer clay does not require heat treatment.  The finished product simply dries in the air.  This will require at least a day.  But such clay has several differences from the baked: its texture is uneven and after drying the product decreases in size, it shrinks.  This type of plastic is made from natural materials and is often used to create a larger shape than jewelry.  Small sculptures, dolls, toys are made from it.  Products can be processed: sawing, drilling. </p>

    <h2>  Baked clay </h2><p>  Baked polymer clay: <span>what is it?</span>  <span>This is the</span> exact opposite of the self-hardening composition, it is much more plastic and more reminiscent of plasticine.  It keeps its shape better and does not change it after heat treatment.  Color also remains unchanged.  If, after drying, products from hardened clay become lighter in weight, then from baked clay they remain heavy.  They are solid, dense and can not be processed.  They can only be sanded and varnished. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Manufacturers of baked clay produce it in a wide range of colors, which does not change due to heat treatment.  Therefore, finished products do not require painting.  And masters of polymer clay modeling are able to create masterpieces from it, especially in the form of jewelry.  Of course, because of its qualities, baked clay is more expensive than self-hardening.  But the choice is always left to those who use it in their work.  We must try both types and draw our own conclusions. </p>

    <h2>  Work with material </h2><p>  As mentioned above, self-hardening polymer clay does not require any heating and freezes on its own in air.  Some species can dry in a few hours, and others in a few days.  It depends on the manufacturer.  Such plastic is stored only in closed form.  For this, special containers are produced, but you can simply pack the clay in a plastic wrap or plastic bag.  One of the most popular manufacturers is FIMO.  Polymer clay is available in several types and is in great demand.  It: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  - FIMO air basic, which is environmentally friendly due to the natural substances that make up its composition.  Children can work with her. </p><p>  - Air microwave, which can even be baked in the microwave. </p><p>  - Air natural - consists of 95% cellulose, is very strong after drying and is recommended for the manufacture of figurines and dolls. </p><p>  - Air light - after drying it loses weight and becomes very light.  Small suspended objects are made from it. </p>

    <h2>  Some moments </h2><p>  If the clay dries very quickly during operation, then you should try to take a small amount of material.  The rest of the plastic should be well packed in cellophane.  To prevent drying out, it is necessary to moisten with water unfinished work details.  How is polymer clay stored?  The instruction says that it should not be left open.  After the factory sealed packaging has been opened, the plastic should be wrapped in a film and several plastic bags.  In this form, it will last longer, but not forever. </p><p>  Some <span>types of plastics,</span> for example, FIMO air, after drying are reduced in size.  All this is due to the content of water in it.  If the product has changed a lot, then these areas should be added. </p>

    <h2>  Color palette </h2><p>  In order for the products to be colorful, you need to purchase several colors of clay.  Not necessarily the entire spectrum of the rainbow, just a few basic colors, which when mixed will give the desired shades.  The main colors are five colors: blue, red, black, white and yellow.  Polymer clay for flowers, making plants, buds will require different shades.  To create a complete palette, the material is mixed in different proportions: </p><p>  - to obtain green - combine the yellow and blue material; </p><p>  - blue with red - will give a lilac hue; </p><p>  - red mixed with yellow is an orange color; </p><p>  - white and black material - will help to make the mass darker or lighter. </p>

    <p>  The amount of polymer clay of the desired color is mixed immediately, because it is very difficult to repeat the same shade. </p><h2>  Paperclay - a type of material </h2><p>  This is another clay manufacturer from the USA.  Their product range is also diverse.  One of the species is Delight.  It is an elastic and soft material that dries up to three days.  It all depends on how thick the layers are.  The weight of the product is reduced to half.  The finished form can be processed, if necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãcut, skin.  If Paperclay is diluted with water, then it can be used to glue parts.  This type of clay is suitable for the manufacture of large products. </p><p>  Creative is also the polymer clay needed for work.  What is it and why is it important?  Creative is a material that has excellent properties for the manufacture of small parts and molds.  It can be combined with wood or cardboard without glue.  This type of "polymer" does not cause allergies, has no smell.  As a result, it is a durable material that can be polished, cut, and processed. </p><p>  Pearl Paperclay - a material made from natural ingredients, non-toxic.  It is available without staining - white and is intended for use in school projects.  Ideal for children's creativity.  After drying, the clay hardens and is easily painted with felt-tip pens, paints. </p><h2>  Another competitor - EFA PLAST </h2>

    <p>  Classic material is designed for large products.  After it dries and hardens, the clay does not crack and does not decrease in size.  Recommended for puppeteers.  But everything can be made of Classic clay - this is a universal material.  Available in three colors: flesh, terracotta and white. </p><p>  Light is almost the same as Classic: due to the fact that cellulose is added to it, this clay has become lighter.  Soft, elastic, it is perfectly smoothed, and fastens well.  Petals of flowers, wings for insects are perfectly made from it.  Available in two shades: white and terracotta. </p>

    <h2>  Safety Compliance </h2><p>  Always follow the safety rules during operation: </p><p>  - Children can‚Äôt play with the raw material.  Be sure to wash your hands after sculpting. </p><p>  - Work with clay should be in gloves or wash your hands more often. </p><p>  - For baking, there should be a separate oven that is not used for food.  But if it is still a food oven, then it should be processed and ventilated. </p><p>  - When baking, the temperature regime must be maintained: it must not exceed 130 degrees.  If the material burns, then a very harmful gas will be released to the body, which causes poisoning.  Leave the room and do not enter until it is ventilated. </p><p>  - It is desirable that there is a thermometer in the stove.  But if it is not, then the door should be slightly opened.  If the product is missing, nothing to worry about. </p>
