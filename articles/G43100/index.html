    <h2>  Definition </h2><p>  <span>The tax return for the Federal Tax Service</span> is a written statement of the payer about the profit, objects of taxation, sources of income, tax base, benefits, the calculated amount of mandatory payments.  This document may contain other information necessary for the calculation and payment of tax amounts. </p><p>  In the <span>Federal Tax Service, a declaration is</span> provided by each payer for each <span>obligatory payment</span> separately. </p><h2>  Differentiation of concepts </h2><p>  Tax Code differentiates the terms "declaration" and "advance payment".  The calculation is a written statement of the payer containing the information necessary for calculating and paying advance payments to the budget.  This document is provided in cases fixed by the Tax Code in relation to a specific mandatory payment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fns declaration" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1931792.jpg" width="588"></div>

    <p>  The <span>FTS</span> provides <span>income declaration</span> form for free. </p><p>  4 paragraph 80 of the article of the Tax Code establishes the procedure for presenting a report.  The declaration in the Federal Tax Service may be provided: </p><ul><li>  Personally by the payer or his representative.  In the latter case, a person acting in the interests of an economic entity must have the appropriate authority, documented. </li><li>  In the form of a registered letter with an inventory. </li><li>  In electronic form via a telecommunication communication channel (Internet). </li></ul><h2>  Sending by mail </h2><p>  The declaration for the Federal Tax Service, drawn up on paper, is sent by letter of notification.  An inventory is drawn up for him. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The most frequent mistakes of the payer include sending a registered letter without an inventory or notice.  In such cases, the receipt issued by the post office does not relieve the entity from liability if the control body does not receive a letter.  The fact is that the receipt does not indicate the content of the attachment. </p><p>  When sending the declaration by mail, the date of sending the letter will be recognized on the day of delivery. </p><h2>  Electronic Report Form </h2><p>  It is approved by the federal executive power structure, which exercises control and supervision functions in the field of taxation.  In this case, the paper form approved by the Ministry of Finance is taken as the basis of the electronic form. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fns program declaration" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1931794.jpg" width="600"></div>
