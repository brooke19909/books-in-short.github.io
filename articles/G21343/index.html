    <p>  Parcel is a mailing of overall size, drawn up in accordance with the norms and rules of the Russian Post.  In the parcel you can put almost any objects and things related to cultural, domestic and other purposes, as well as food, with the exception of perishable species.  It is forbidden to send money, narcotic and poisonous drugs, as well as firearms and other weapons.  As packaging, branded boxes with the Russian Post logo can be used.  The population is also allowed to use their materials with the condition that there is no tape on the surface of the container, as well as traces of it.  When receiving cardboard boxes for shipment, each seam is glued with special care to avoid access to the inside of the shipped object. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can answer the question of how the parcel differs from the parcel by comparing their types. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is the parcel and package" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/1200405.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Types of parcels </h2><p>  Parcels can be of various types: </p><ol><li>  Simple.  These are mailings with a weight not exceeding 2 kg.  The contents of the box or bag should fit snugly on the packaging and not move inside it.  In this regard, such shipments send documentation and print media. </li><li>  Custom.  These are first-class parcels with a weight not exceeding 2.5 kg.  Due to the fact that such shipments are of a paid nature, it is allowed to invest in them various goods for shipment.  When you design this type, you might even think that it is better, a parcel or a parcel.  The difference is insignificant provided the weight of the item is small. </li><li>  Valuable.  This type differs from the first option in that in the event of the loss of the forwarded package, the mail without fail will compensate the sender for the damage incurred in the amount of the estimated cost of the parcel and all tariffs paid at checkout. </li></ol><h2>  Types of Parcels </h2><p>  Parcels are divided into four types, regardless of whether they are sent with a declared price or not: </p><p>  1. Standard.  The weight of packages of this type varies from 2 to 10 kg.  The overall size of the original packaging box has several standards.  The address side must be with a minimum size of 10 x 15 cm. Packaging is allowed for dispatch with a sum of three sides measuring no more than 80 cm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  3. Non-standard.  Parcels of this kind may have non-standard packaging and weigh up to 20 kg.  Maximum overall size of non-standard packaging: the sum of the three sides is no more than 300 cm. Shipping is possible in the form of a rolled up tube. </p><p>  4. Oversized.  Parcels can be accepted for shipment in the case when they do not require overload along the route.  The processes of issuing and receiving heavy and bulky parcels are carried out in specialized post offices.  This type of shipment includes cargo with a weight of 10 to 500 kg and a maximum package size of 1.9 x 1.3 x 3.5 m. </p><h2>  Difference </h2><p>  The main difference between the parcel and the package is the weight.  So, a parcel is a small-sized postal item, and the parcel is rather large.  The parcel weight can be from 100 g to 2 kg, and the parcel has restrictions on severity from 1 to 10 kg, and in some cases, when processing heavy mail, up to 20 kg.  Such large shipments are made from special post offices. </p><p>  There is a difference between the parcel and the package, and this is the value of the item.  How to arrange a cargo that has a considerable cost?  As a rule, valuable items are sent as a parcel: equipment, clothes, shoes, large valuable household or other goods, as well as long-term storage products.  And the printed matter, stationery, photographs or documents of the second degree of importance are sent in parcels, in general, those products that are not subject to damage from decay or decomposition during transportation. </p>

    <p>  According to the form of shipment, the parcel can be of two types: simple or with the declared price of the sender.  The parcel, in turn, has more types.  It happens ordinary, custom-made, with notification and with the declared price. </p><p>  So what is better - a parcel or a parcel?  The difference in size of these items affects the final selection.  Typically, the package allows you to send goods with a sufficiently large size.  But the parcels are often small packages. </p><p>  Comparing which <span>type of forwarding is</span> best done, you can pay attention to the cost of processing the mail.  Which is cheaper - a parcel or a parcel?  To do this, you need to count a little.  If necessary, send documents or important papers weighing up to 1 kg more profitable to issue a valuable parcel.  So you can save from 50 rubles to 50% of the cost for the same package weight.  With a weight category from 1 kg to 1.5 kg, prices between shipments are approximately equal.  But if you send items weighing 1.5 kg and above, then sending the package will save the lion's share of the budget.  Moreover, the higher the weight, the greater the savings compared to the design of the parcel. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Specifically, you need to choose one type of dispatch based on the forwarded cargo.  The parcel is good at registration of small-sized objects, and it can be not only printed editions or paper products.  But the package will come to the rescue when sending bulky goods with a weight of 2 kg or more.  At the same time, it is possible to draw up <span>declared value.</span>  And in case of trouble with the cargo, the postal agency will compensate all the damage caused to the client if the parcel or parcel is lost.  The difference in the amount returned is 100% of all costs for clearance. </p>
