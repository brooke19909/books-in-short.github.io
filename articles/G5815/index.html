    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  So that negative moments do not spoil your vacation, in advance learn about the shortcomings of the Dessole Coral Hotel 3 * hotel.  Reviews note the following: </p><ul><li>  near the hotel there are many unfinished buildings that noticeably spoil the view from the window; </li><li>  rather cramped rooms; </li><li>  too small a safe, where money and documents are hardly placed (equipment cannot be hidden in it); </li><li>  almost no animation and any entertainment for active tourists;  a small pool in which it is inconvenient to swim (vacationers constantly interfere with each other); </li><li>  the hotel does not have its own beach, and on the municipal deck chairs and umbrellas are paid; </li><li>  the entry into the sea is strewn with large pebbles, which painfully stabs his legs; </li><li>  there is practically no greenery at the hotel (there is no territory as such); </li><li>  there are very few sun loungers near the pool, and therefore they can be occupied only by those who are used to getting up early in the morning; </li><li>  on the way to the beach you need to overcome the busy roadway; </li><li>  if your room is located above the restaurant, noise from a working hood may interfere with you; </li><li>  in order to replenish stocks of hygienic cosmetics in the room, you have to contact the administrator every time. </li></ul><p>  This hotel is perfect for lovers of a relaxing holiday.  This option is also suitable for romantic trips. </p>
