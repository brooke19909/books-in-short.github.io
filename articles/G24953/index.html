  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mediterranean features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Mediterranean region is traditionally considered one of the best places to relax in the space of Europe.  Every year, resorts of the Mediterranean Sea are visited by millions of travelers from all over the world.  The indicated destination is also very popular among tourists from the CIS countries.  The high level of demand for offers from tour operators regarding Mediterranean resorts is due to the cultural characteristics of the region, which has always been famous for its hospitality, as well as high-quality services, which has long become a kind of calling card of these cities. <br><br>  Another interesting feature of the region is its original culture, as well as the abundance of historical places that have survived to this day in almost its original form.  So, <noindex>  <span>Cheap hotels of Halkidiki</span> </noindex>  Every year, dozens and hundreds of tourists from different parts of Europe arrive that come to this region of Greece in order to stroll along the picturesque streets of these cities, as well as visit the world famous Petralona cave.  The glory of the designated place is associated with finds made by scientists at the beginning of the twentieth century.  So in the Petralona cave, the bones of ancient people were discovered, which to this day are considered the most ancient human remains in Europe. <br><br>  It is worth noting that Greece, as well as all the territories to which the borders of Hellas once spread, are literally full of a huge number of antiquities.  So in this area you can find ancient temples that belong to the period of feudal fragmentation in Greece and date back to 5-7 centuries BC.  In particular, <noindex>  <span>side hotel reviews</span> </noindex>  , which are currently located in Turkey, often contain references to the thrilling journey to the Temple of Apollo. <br><br>  Currently, the designated temple is considered one of the oldest in southern Turkey.  In addition to the designated sanctuary, the authentic “pearl” of the region is the ancient amphitheater, which once served as an arena for bloody gladiatorial battles, and also served as a theater stage.  In this place, blood and death were strangely intertwined with the smiles of the actors and the melodies of ancient musicians, which gave their ideas in this place. <br><br>  But not only the history and culture is famous for the Mediterranean.  The main attraction that tourists are striving for is the Mediterranean Sea itself and its magnificent golden beaches. </p></div></article>
