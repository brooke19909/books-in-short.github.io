The infrastructure is well developed here, and this already has a positive effect on the economic indicators not only of Kazan, but of the whole of Tatarstan.  In turn, due to the excellent economic development, new places of public catering, hotels and similar establishments are constantly opening here.  This article will focus on just a few of these projects. </p><p>  Today we will discuss in detail such an institution as the Moskovskaya Hotel (Kazan).  The article will touch upon all your questions: the number of rooms and their categories, reviews, exact address, contact details and other useful information.  In addition, we will additionally discuss such an interesting project as the Berison Moskovskaya Hotel (Kazan), as well as several more hotels in this beautiful city, which are located in the Moskovsky District.  Well, let's get started now! </p><h2>  Hotel Moskovskaya </h2><p>  The last few years, Kazan is one of the most popular cities where tourists travel.

    <p>  When a person arrives in an unfamiliar city on business or just on vacation, he immediately begins to look for an inexpensive but good enough hotel to spend several or more days there.  In which hotel is it worth staying if you want to spend a minimum of money and at the same time get the highest quality service? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  At this stage of its development, the Moskovskaya Hotel (Kazan) offers its guests 63 excellent rooms, each of which has its own advantages.  Here you can stay in a standard room or another room, representing a slightly higher level of comfort, which offers a gorgeous view of the capital of Tatarstan. </p>

    <p>  In addition, it should be noted that in addition to this project there is a not very large hostel with a capacity of 58 beds.  The hotel itself is located in a convenient location, because from the railway station of the capital of Tatarstan, walking to the hotel is only 3-5 minutes.  By the way, you can call the reception and ask any questions to the administrator at any time of the day or night.  Also, if you cannot get to the hotel on your own, you have the opportunity to call a hotel representative and ask for an explanation of how to get to Moskovskaya. </p><h2>  Free and paid services </h2><p>  Any hotel offers its guests both paid and free services.  Some institutions do almost everything for money, but the Moskovskaya Hotel (Kazan), reviews of which are almost all positive, offers a large number of services to guests absolutely free: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  call a taxi or ambulance; </li><li>  Wi-Fi throughout; </li><li>  receiving and sending letters by e-mail; </li><li>  parking zone; </li><li>  first aid kit; </li><li>  daily morning cleaning; </li><li>  <span>ironing board</span> and iron; </li><li>  daily housekeeping; </li><li>  necessary hygiene products (provided once upon arrival); </li><li>  new towels (1 time in 3 days); </li><li>  change of bed linen (1 time in 5 days). </li></ul><p>  In turn, the list of paid hotel services includes washing clothes, tour services, as well as an additional change of bed linen.  Of course, there are other paid and free services, but listing all of them makes no sense. </p><h2>  Nearby Attractions </h2><p>  Have you already wondered why tourists come to cities of other countries for a vacation?  Of course, they are interested in local attractions.  Hotels that are located near the most important historical buildings of a particular locality are in greater demand than similar establishments located at a great distance from attractions. </p>
