Knitting toys</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Knitted toys have a special appeal, because in every loop the craftswoman puts her work, zeal, her soul.  You can tie any toy, and it will be loved for many years.  For example, a knitted bear, knitting or crocheting - it does not matter, will become a real talisman for the one to whom it is intended. </p><h2>  Choose material </h2><p>  Buying yarn in order to knit toys with knitting needles or crochet is now not a problem at all.  So much they sell it even in small sealers of goods for needlework, that you can just drown in it.  But any yarn is not suitable for knitting toys.  From the whole variety of skeins, a certain type of yarn should be chosen.  And since there are many manufacturers, and the products are often very similar, we should only talk about the composition and length of threads in a skein of a certain weight. </p><p>  Rather tight and stiff toys are made from yarn, which contains 55% cotton and 45% polyacryl, and in a 50-gram skein there will be 160 meters of thread.  A knitted teddy bear, with knitting needles, for example, will keep its shape well, since the fabric of such threads does not twist. </p><p>  Another suitable yarn for knitting toys with needles is 100% mercerized cotton.  What does mercerized mean?  The cotton processed in a special way, the thread of which after that acquired a light shine, became stronger and more resistant to shrinkage, softer and more silky in the product.  For example, knitted bears, knitting or crocheting, patterns for which are so popular, from mercerized cotton will be durable, reliable, beautiful. </p><p>  Textured yarn should be chosen only when the experience of knitting toys is already sufficient so as not to get tangled in loops in thread fluffy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Tools and accessories for knitting toys </h2><p>  In addition to yarn, knitting toys need knitting needles or a hook, stuffing material, accessories for eyes, noses, mouths, as well as hair, if necessary, and clothing.  Knitting needles and a hook for toys should be chosen a little less than with ordinary knitting.  This is done so that the canvas of a knitted toy, knitting or crocheting - does not matter, is dense enough to hold its shape.  As eyes and noses, you can use beads or buttons, as well as special parts that are either glued or fastened with special clips in place. </p>

    <h2>  Favorite Teddy Bear </h2><p>  Bears, sewn, knitted, any - the most favorite toys from childhood for many.  Why is this so?  There can be no single answer to this question.  One of the most beloved around the world is a <span>Teddy bear, a teddy bear</span> with patches and a little sad face.  A knitted teddy bear, knitting, with a description and detailed instructions, will be an exact replica of his sarcastic brother. </p><p>  For a traditional Teddy bear, you need gray-blue yarn, plus a few gray and blue threads.  Depending on the thickness of the yarn, knitting needles are chosen so that the toy is not loose.  Two beads for the eye are also needed. </p>

    <h2>  Description of Teddy Bear Knitting </h2><p>  So, knitting begins with the head of a teddy bear.  Type 6 stitches on the knitting needles.  In the 1st row add 6 loops = 12. The 2nd row and all even rows are purl loops.  In the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th and 11th rows, add 6 loops evenly, in total 42 loops will be obtained.  From 12 to 20 rows, knit the front stitch on 42 loops.  In the 21 row, evenly reduce 6 loops, then make the same reductions in the 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 rows, so that 6 loops remain on the knitting needles.  Break the thread and stretch it through the loops on the spoke, remove them and tighten. </p><p>  The teddy bear‚Äôs body fits so.  Collect 6 stitches and add 6 stitches evenly in 1 row.  In rows 3 and 5, 6 more loops = 24 loops are added.  A knitted bear, knitting, of course, like a crochet, should have a plump tummy.  Therefore, all increases are made in the center.  So, in the 7th row, the loops fit like this: 5 faces, 1 increase, 4 faces, 4 increases, 4 faces, 1 increase, 5 faces.  9 row fits: 12 facial, 6 increases, 12 facial.  11 row: * 5 facial, 1 increase *, from * to * repeat 5 more times = 42 loops. </p><p>  From 13 to 24 rows, knit with the front stitch.  Then reduce the loops like this: in the 25th row: * 5 faces., 1 decrease *, from * to * repeat 5 more times = 36 loops.  In the 27th row: 4 persons., 1 decrease, repeat 6 times.  In the 28th row, 3 purl, 1 decrease, repeat 6 times.  In the 29th row, 2 facial, 1 decrease, repeat 6 times.  In the 30th row: 1 wrong side, 1th decrease, and in the 31st row do 6 decreases, it turns out 6 loops.  Break the thread and stretch it through the loops remaining on the spoke. </p><p>  Well, what kind of knitted bear without paws?  With knitting needles we collect 20 loops - for the hind legs.  They are complex - they have feet.  And 1 row is knitted with purl loops.  In the 2nd row, this is done: 2 increases, 6 facial, 4 increases, then 6 facial and 2 increases.  3 row - purl loops.  4 row: evenly add 8 loops = 36 loops.  From 5 to 9, knit a front stitch on 36 loops. </p><p>  In the 10th row, a sock is knitted: 12 facial loops, 1 decrease, 8 facial loops, 1 decrease, turn the knitting to the wrong side and knit 10 wrong loops, turn the knitting again, now to the front, and knit further: 1 decrease, 6 facial, 1 decrease , 12 facial.  In the 11th row, 32 are purl.  12 row: 10 facial, 6 decreases, 10 facial.  13 row: 10 wrong, 3 decreases, 100 wrong.  14th row: 9 facial, 1 decrease, 1 facial, 1 decrease, 9 facial.  15 row: 21 wrong loop.  16 row: evenly reduce 6 loops = 15 loops. </p><p>  From the 17th to the 26th row, the front surface is matched with 15 loops.  In the 27th row, evenly reduce 7 loops = 8 loops.  In the 28th row, knit 8 stitches with the front, break the thread and pass it through the loops remaining on the spoke, tighten the knitting.  The second hind paw also fits.  Feet of a bear can be made of suede by laying hard cardboard under them. </p><p>  Knitted bear, knitting and crocheting, must have front legs.  On knitting needles they fit so.  Collect 5 loops, knit a number of purl.  In the 2nd row, add 5 loops = 10 loops evenly.  Knit front stitch from 3 to 19 row.  In the 20th row, add another 7 loops evenly and knit 6 rows of front stitch.  Then in each row evenly reduce 6 stitches, until 5 stitches remain on the knitting needles, pull them together on a string. </p><p>  The muzzle is knitted of white thread: dial 6 loops, 1 row - add 6 loops, 2 row - purl, add 3 loops evenly in 3 rows, knit 4-6 rows with front stitch, then close the loops.  Sew a muzzle, embroider a bear with blue threads.  The ears are knitted on 8 loops with a front stitch in 8 rows, then break the thread and knit it together.  There are 4 such details - 2 for each ear, to sew them in pairs, turning inside out. </p><p>  Sew all the edges, not forgetting to fill the Teddy bear with a synthetic winterizer.  Then sew the button eyes and collect all the details of the inter-cub together.  You can add to it patches from threads of a different color, clothes.  You can tie and sew a small tail. </p><h2>  And the other bears? </h2><p>  Knitted bear with knitting needles, crochet - this is not only a Teddy bear.  You can tie a very tiny amigurumi bear.  And sometimes a bear knitted with large knitting needles.  Then the knitting pattern needs to be reworked, but it is quite complicated.  Although there are super-threads on sale now, they are knitted either on thick knitting needles or on the hands - the most interesting and unusual way of knitting.  But this is a completely different story. </p>
