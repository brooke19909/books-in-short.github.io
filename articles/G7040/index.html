This thing not only represents the embodiment of modern fashion trends, but also gives room for the imagination of the craftswoman.  During the creation of the sweater, you can experiment with the thickness and type of thread, as well as diagrams and tools to do the work.  The product is good at crocheting and knitting.  A women's sweater is very comfortable both on a winter day and on a cool summer evening.  It is suitable for office and informal friendly party. </p><h2>  How to choose yarn </h2><p>  Before you start knitting sweaters, you need to determine the type of yarn that will be used as the basis.  For cozy winter models, it is recommended to choose woolen and half-woolen threads.  This category includes: </p><ul><li>  goat fluff; </li><li>  merino yarn; </li><li>  alpaca; </li><li>  mohair; </li><li>  mink fluff; </li><li>  Angora. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting" class="if uuid-2700788" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89230/2700788.jpg"></div><p>  Kidmoher is also great for doing the job.  It is a type of mohair yarn, has a silk or acrylic base.  You need to carefully look at the characteristics of the threads that are indicated on the label.  It says the type of twist and the length of the thread is 100 g. For knitting a sweater, samples having 200-250 m for this weight are selected. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For the summer thing, thinner cotton or acrylic yarn is suitable.  So that it is not hot in warm weather, it is recommended to choose openwork patterns for knitting a sweater with knitting needles.  Then the product will turn out weightless and practical.  Such models are especially popular this season. </p><h2>  Knitting tips </h2><p>  After the knit sweater you like is already selected, you need to carefully study the product execution order.  Be sure to consider the original size so that everything works out correctly.  If a specific type of thread is given in the description, but it is not possible to purchase it, you need to select yarn with the same thickness or knit a control sample measuring 10 by 10 cm, wash and iron it.  So calculating the number of loops and patterns in a row will be much easier. </p><p>  Other recommendations that can help you link products much faster include: </p><ol><li>  Performing a life-size pattern from paper.  If a knitting pattern for a sweater is not attached, then you can do the work by applying it to a finished thing that sits well. </li><li>  Stitching parts with a knitted seam, so the joints on the sweater will be less visible. </li><li>  Steaming the product after knitting is completed and all seams are made. </li></ol><p>  For the first time, it is recommended to take not too complex models so as not to be disappointed in this type of needlework.  For beginners, the best option would be to knit a sweater for a boy or girl made with front stitch.  If the knitter prefers a hook, then it is better to dwell on a model connected by double crochets. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fashion trends </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself things will always remain at the height of fashion.  A knitted sweater (with a photo and diagrams to make it easy) will add another original item to your wardrobe.  However, in choosing a model, you need to study current trends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cyndispivey.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fashion model" class="if uuid-2700790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89230/2700790.jpg"></div><p>  Today, things that have the following characteristics are especially relevant: </p><ul><li>  simple pattern and cut; </li><li>  natural yarn; </li><li>  An interesting way to knit (raglan or elongated back); </li><li>  for a summer thing - openwork; </li><li>  for winter products - volumetric braids; </li><li>  thread color close to natural; </li><li>  a good combination of yarn thickness and shade. </li></ul><p>  Designers pay much attention to the methods of knitting products.  Now women‚Äôs sweaters, knitting needles made in the form of pillowcases, from a square front and back, are relevant.  Also, things related to the neck do not go out of fashion using the raglan method.  Such sweaters, among other advantages, have functional features.  After all, if the product sits down or becomes small, then the sleeves and bottom can be knitted. </p><h2>  Women's Raglan Sweater </h2><p>  This model is simple, elegant.  To knit a raglan sweater, you will need the following materials: knitting needles in a circle number 4, DROPS NEPAL yarn - 6-7 skeins.  The number of threads will depend on the size.  If it is not possible to take this particular yarn, you can choose with a similar composition - 35% alpaca and 65% wool, 150 m per 100 g. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.purlsoho.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="raglan sweater" class="if uuid-2700856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89230/2700856.jpg"></div><p>  The method of knitting sweaters on top: </p><ol><li>  Dial 66 loops, connect on circular knitting needles. </li><li>  Make a separation according to the scheme - 18 loops on the back, 22 - on the front, 11 on the sleeves. </li><li>  The remaining 4 are divided by the execution of four ragged lines. </li><li>  The first two rows are knitted shawl round. </li><li>  After this, a sprout is made - 8 rows, while you need to make rotary rows in the back area, so that the front neck is lower. </li><li>  Further, you can continue knitting round, making increases on raglan lines in every second row. </li><li>  Knitting must be constantly tried on for the pattern, and when the raglan lines are completed, the loop of the sleeves is removed for additional knitting needles. </li><li>  Now the body of the sweater is knitted round.  If the pattern involves a slight expansion, then you need to make an increase, according to the scheme of knitting a sweater with knitting needles. </li><li>  Having tied the canvas to the bottom, you can close all the loops with a needle. </li><li>  After that, the knitting needles are threaded into the loops of the sleeves, which are also knitted according to the pattern.  Here, on the contrary, you need to perform small decreases downward. </li><li>  Hinges of the sleeve are also sewn with a needle. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="verena.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="raglan sweater pattern" class="if uuid-2701714" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/2701714.jpg"></div><p>  It remains only to sew, to steam the product, and it will be ready for wear. </p><h2>  Oversized wool sweater </h2><p>  Such models are very relevant at any time.  In addition, they have a definite advantage - quick knitting.  If you have the knack and experience, you can knit a thing in 2-3 days.  Thick wool is specially taken, DROPS Eskimo (50 g per 50 m), and straight knitting needles ‚Äúeight‚Äù are suitable. </p><p>  The cut is also simple, it runs a minimum of parts that have the shape of a rectangle.  It is uncharacteristic for the model to choose an openwork pattern, since thick knitting needles can not cope with it.  As a method of knitting, hosiery or garter stitching is chosen. </p><h2>  Raglan with jacquard yoke </h2><p>  Sweaters connected by a jacquard pattern look very feminine.  They will need threads of contrasting colors.  Such a model must be taken after the necessary skill is acquired.  Materials for work: DROPS AIR yarn of red and white color - 7 skeins, knitting needles No. 5. </p><div class="photo" data-original="modnoe-vjazanie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jacquard yoke sweater" class="if uuid-2700822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89230/2700822.jpg"></div><p>  How to knit a product: </p><ol><li>  First, 80 loops are typed, they are distributed in a circle and are knitted with elastic band 10-16 rows. </li><li>  Then you should knit according to the pattern of the jacquard coquette. <div class="photo" data-original="modnoe-vjazanie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater circuit" class="if uuid-2700824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89230/2700824.jpg"></div></li><li>  When the drawing is finished, you need to separate the loops for the sleeves and the body of the sweater.  To do this, the loops on the sides are laid off for additional knitting needles, and the front part is knitted to the bottom. </li><li>  At the end of the front, backs and sleeves 10 rows of 1x1 elastic bands fit. </li></ol><p>  To finish work on raglan, the lower loops are most conveniently closed with a large needle.  Then the edges of the product will not stretch much. </p><h2>  Extra Long Back Model </h2><p>  Knitting a sweater with an elongated back will help to create a product that will remain fashionable for several seasons.  To do the work you will need: DROPS AIR threads - 8 skeins, or the same yarn with a meter of 150 m by 50 g, straight knitting needles No. 4. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.1sale.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="with extended back" class="if uuid-2700800" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89230/2700800.jpg"></div><p>  To make such a model, you need to choose a smooth knit or not too artsy openwork.  First, the front and back parts are performed.  The last part of the sweater begins to knit with a small rounding so that it turns out longer than before.  A pre-compiled diagram of its own dimensions will help to carry out the product correctly.  After stitching the sleeves, the back and the front, the neck and bottom of the sweater are tied with a step with the help of hook No. 3. </p><h2>  Short sleeve sweater </h2><p>  A very interesting option is obtained if you tie cropped sleeves.  Any pattern is perfect for this model - straight knitting, lace or braids.  A knitted sweater with short sleeves can be worn as an independent item of clothing or combined with other things, for example, a turtleneck with a long sleeve. </p><div class="photo" data-original="takprosto.cc" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Short sleeve sweater" class="if uuid-2700793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89230/2700793.jpg"></div><p>  For knitting you will need: DROPS Eskimo yarn, knitting needles No. 6. First, the main parts are made - the back and the front.  After stitching these parts, loops are formed on the shoulder.  Knitting sweater sleeves is performed from top to bottom.  Next, you should knit a volumetric braid in the middle part.  Once the desired sleeve length is reached, you can close the hinges and tie the collar. </p><h2>  Flared Sweater </h2><p>  Openwork patterns are chosen for this model to emphasize an interesting cut.  Brightness will give freshness and originality to the product; sectional cotton is perfect.  If you take such a yarn, you get a smooth transition of shades.  Work is performed from the bottom.  Therefore, you need to knit a raglan sweater strictly according to the scheme.  To complete the product you need to take: threads "Alize Bella Batik", circular knitting needles No. 3. </p><p>  Working process: </p><ol><li>  Make loops for the front and back and first knit these parts. </li><li>  Run sleeves using the proposed pattern. </li><li>  Last, flared edges in the form of triangular parts are tied. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="ezhevika.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="with lace inserts" class="if uuid-2700808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89230/2700808.jpg"></div><p>  To make the model harmonious, you need to try to start knitting from the bottom with the same sectional shade.  Such a product will turn out light and airy.  In addition, it is suitable not only for slim girls, but also for ladies with full uniforms. </p><h2>  Children's high-neck sweater </h2><p>  This model is intended for those who are just mastering this type of needlework.  Knitting <span>sweaters for a boy</span> or girl 6-8 years old is much easier to complete.  In addition, less yarn is needed to make things.  For work you will need: <span>Alize lanagold yarn</span> - 2-3 skeins, circular and knitting needles No. 3. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ingugu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater for boy" class="if uuid-2700836" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89230/2700836.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting is performed according to the instructions: </p><ol><li>  Dial 65 loops, knit with an elastic band 2x2 15-16 cm to get a lapel. </li><li>  Divide the loops: on the front - 23, on the back - 18 and the sleeves - 10 each. The remaining 4 loops will be used to knit the raglan lines. </li><li>  Increases need to be done through one row, crossing the yarn over the wrong side. </li><li>  When the work is done before the armpits, the hinges of the sleeve are removed on auxiliary fishing lines, and before with the back in a circle they are knitted further until the length is as it should. </li><li>  Sleeves also need to be done in a circle on toe needles. </li><li>  2x2 elastic at the bottom of the body of the sweater and sleeves. </li></ol><h2>  How to choose a model for a figure </h2><p>  It's nice to look at the slender beautiful girls who show knitted sweaters.  But what if the figure is far from ideal?  You need to choose the right product model that is suitable for a certain type.  Stylists give the following recommendations on this subject: </p><ol><li>  Women with a figure resembling an apple shape, it is better to choose a pullover, which is made in the form of vertical braids or contrasting lines.  It is best if the product is slightly flared, starting from the armpits.  In no case should you dwell on sweater models that have volume knitting and a round neckline.  The shape of the neck should be asymmetric or triangular. </li><li>  With the hourglass shape, many models look good, so a fitted sweater with a low neckline will do.  If you decorate such a thing with large buttons, it will look even more stylish.  An extended sweater with a wide belt of the same color is also suitable. </li><li>  To the fair sex, who have a figure similar to a pear, a sweater tunic with an elongated hem is suitable.  This model will help visually reduce large hips.  You need to try so that the product does not fit snugly.  Therefore, accessories such as a belt are best excluded. </li><li>  Universal products that fit any type of figure include polo sweaters.  They are made with a collar adjacent to the throat and a fastener.  You can make a thing more fashionable with contrast buttons or a beautiful brooch. </li></ol><p>  It doesn't matter which sweater is chosen for knitting.  Most importantly, using the same scheme, you can create a fashionable image.  Things that will be done with your own hands cannot be repeated.  Therefore, the craftswoman can be sure that she is the owner of an exclusive, unique product. </p>
