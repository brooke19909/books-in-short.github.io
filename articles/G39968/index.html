Perhaps the stores did not find the right size or color, or the sewing department liked a pretty fabric, from which I wanted to sew a bed set or pillowcases for decorative pillows. </p><p>  The most popular model of pillowcases today, perhaps, with a smell.  You can also find pillowcases with Velcro and buttons.  A few years ago, pillowcases with buttons were popular, and in the old days there were pillowcases with ties.  Progress is underway, and in our time, many women prefer pillowcases with zippers, they are easy to put on and take off, even a child will cope with them. </p><p>  Sewing a simple rectangular model is easy, you just need to know how to sew a zipper into a pillowcase for a pillow correctly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftinessisnotoptional.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="zippered pillowcase" class="if uuid-2493628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86521/2493628.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to start tailoring? </h2><p>  First of all, you need to correctly calculate the required amount of tissue.  When the fabric is bought, you can start sewing pillowcases. </p><p>  First you need to cut the fabric, not forgetting the allowances.  Before you <span>sew a zipper into a pillowcase,</span> you need to decide in which place the castle will be.  It can be located on the edge of the pillowcase in the side seam or down from the back.  The location of the lock in the side seam is the most popular method.  Using tailor's chalk, it is necessary to outline the desired location of the lightning.  Here it is necessary to clarify that the allowance for fabric for zippers is 2-4 cm on both sides, depending on the type of lock - secret or ordinary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then you need to prepare the fabric.  To do this, you can manually sew with large, long, not tight stitches two halves of fabric, between which the castle will be located.  You can sew this stitch using a sewing machine by choosing a wide type of stitch, such as a zigzag.  Tie to a knot and tighten this seam tightly is not necessary, since after attaching the zipper, the threads should be removed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftinessisnotoptional.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stitching zippers in a pillowcase" class="if uuid-2493635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86521/2493635.jpg"></div><p>  The next step is to make the zipper.  This is nothing complicated, especially in modern sewing machines there is a special foot for sewing in the lock.  For those who are faced with a similar situation for the first time and do not know how to sew a zipper into a pillowcase, it will be useful to watch a video in which everything is simply and clearly described. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="EVzmxSbS0iA" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVzmxSbS0iA" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/3/5/5/8/3558.jpg"></div><h2>  How can I sew a zipper without a special foot? </h2><p>  There is a way that saves those who do not know how to sew a zipper into a pillowcase without a special foot.  We act like this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The lock needs to be unfastened.  First sew one part of the zipper to the fabric, then the second.  This method is called distance seam.  By the way, it is better to use it when the pillowcase is not yet sewn, but is only in the cutting stage. </p><p>  After the lock is in place, you can sew a pillowcase on the other sides and process the slices with a suitable line or using an overlock. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sewmamasew.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bright pillowcases with zippers" class="if uuid-2493632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86521/2493632.jpg"></div><h2>  How to sew a zipper in a pillowcase bought in a store? </h2><p>  This method also has a place to be.  A pillowcase from a store with a smell is perfect for transformation.  But before you sew a zipper into the pillowcase, you need to make sure that the pillowcase will not be small, because the size of the fabric will be slightly reduced due to the sewing on of the lock. </p><p>  So, if the pillowcase is perfect for the size of the pillow, you can not dissolve or trim anything.  You just need to manually sweep the two edges of the pillowcase (or sew with a wide stitch on a sewing machine) and sew in the zipper. </p><p>  If the pillowcase is smaller than the pillow, you can gently dissolve the edge of the pillowcase, which forms an odor.  Then process the edges and perform the same actions as described above, that is, sweep the edges and sew in the zipper. </p><h2>  Little tricks </h2><p>  It is better to stab the lightning with special needles with a bead at the end, so as not to sew it.  This will help her not to slip while sewing. </p><p>  For smooth and high-quality grinding, it is recommended to iron the seam, after having straightened the sides of the fabric. </p><p>  Before stitching the zipper, make sure that the lock is positioned correctly - face down. </p>
