In August 2012, the Japanese giant smartphone company brought to the court of consumers and experts the budget model Sony Xperia J. Of course, based on the characteristics of this phone, it‚Äôs hard to conclude whether it will be among the sales leaders, but a competitor in the budget options market mobile communicators, this model will certainly be.  Below is a review of the cell phone of a Japanese manufacturer, after which it will be possible to decide whether it is worth the money that requires it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia j" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/559150.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Key Specifications </h2><p>  The smartphone from the Japanese manufacturer was introduced in 2012.  Therefore, at the moment it no longer has outstanding technical characteristics compared to the budget options of today's market.  Android 4.0 was chosen as the operating platform for this phone.  The "filling" of the phone consists of a single-core processor with a clock frequency of 1 GHz.  Of course, the current budget models for the most part have dual-core processors, but do not forget that two years ago such models of smartphones were just entering the middle segment of the market.  The manufacturers decided to install 512 MB as RAM.  The internal memory of the phone has 4 GB, of which only 2 GB are free, which can be used as storage for small files.  But there is an opportunity to increase the total memory of the phone up to 32 GB.  The battery capacity is 1750 mAh. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the performance of the smartphone, it leaves much to be desired.  In the process of working with the phone, obvious slowdowns and freezes were noticeable.  In many respects, the reason for this is not too large RAM, and if you take into account that the Android 4.0 operating system requires a sufficiently large amount of it, then there is even less memory left for third-party programs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia j reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/559151.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  The <span>Sony Xperia</span> J smartphone reviewed in this article has a very interesting design that is similar to many other models of this company.  Moreover, you can buy this smartphone in various variations.  Fans of a more conservative style in phones can buy a black version.  People who are bored with the standard color for many smartphones can buy the white, pink or even gold model Sony Xperia J. But when choosing, remember that the color will change only for the back panel, while the entire screen and its edging will always be made in black. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia j review" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/559177.jpg" width="580"></div>

You can easily control it with one hand, while it does not seem that you have at your disposal a small phone the size of a pager.  With a width of 61 mm and a thickness of 9.2 mm, the length of the smartphone is 124 mm.  The weight of the smartphone is 124 g. </p><p>  Having carefully examined the design, several conclusions can be drawn about the Sony Xperia J. smartphone. The appearance characteristics are very interesting in that the back panel of the smartphone is made of plastic and is slightly concave, which makes it even more convenient to find it in your hand.  On the screen of the smartphone are three touch buttons: ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, ‚ÄúTask Manager‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù.  In addition, on the front of the smartphone are speakers for conversation and a <span>front camera.</span>  Turning the smartphone over, you can see that the main camera of the smartphone is located in the upper left corner.  There is also a flash.  At the bottom of the back of the smartphone is a sound speaker.  As for the control buttons, both the <span>volume control</span> and the power button are located on the right end of the smartphone.  On the left side of the Sony Xperia J is a slot for USB devices.  The headset jack is located on the top of the smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia j specifications" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/559167.jpg" width="548"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sound and communication </h2><p>  In general, the sound of a smartphone is hardly outstanding.  It is clearly inferior in this aspect to its competitors from companies such as NTS and Samsung.  In the headphones, the sound is heard at an acceptable level, but the volume may not be enough to interrupt the hum of knocking wheels.  In addition, the sound from the speakers is not optimistic.  The melodies that he publishes are somewhat flat, and the <span>low frequencies are</span> completely trimmed.  As for communications, the voice of the interlocutor is heard well.  But if you are sitting in a noisy crowd, you need to strain your hearing even if you set the maximum volume level.  The vibrating alert is also quite weak.  Therefore, if you set the silent mode using vibration, then be prepared for the fact that there may be missed calls. </p><h2>  Camera and photos </h2><p>  Japanese developers equipped their phone with a five megapixel camera.  The video management process is quite simple.  For example, if necessary, you can set the shooting both by pressing the screen of the smartphone, and using the button.  In addition, you can set the shooting sound.  It is also possible to set a timer if necessary.  At the same time, the timer can be set to 10 seconds of delay directly on the Sony Xperia J. camera. Photos that result from shooting cannot be called outstanding.  Of course, one should not expect good detail from the budget model of the objects being shot.  However, photos taken with the camera are slightly blurry.  Their detailing is also at a low level.  As a result, we can conclude that the Sony Xperia J phone has a camera, which is standard for a budget model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia j firmware" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/559168.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Are there any features that the budget model Sony Xperia J has?  The touchscreen of the phone is 4 inches diagonal, which is the normal size for a budget smartphone.  The screen resolution is 480x854.  Moreover, the latter can display up to 16 million colors.  The features of the screen of this smartphone include the fact that it is covered with specially tempered glass from <span>Gorilla Glass,</span> which is famous for its strength.  Typically, budget smartphones are installed cheaper glass options.  Viewing angles and screen brightness are at a good level even in daylight.  The only thing that raises questions is the contrast of colors.  When you look at the phone, it seems that the colors are reproduced slightly embellished. </p><h2>  Smartphone Options </h2><p>  When purchasing this model of smartphone, its owner will receive not only the phone itself, but also several additional accessories that can be useful when using the phone.  Firstly, the phone comes with a brief instruction manual that can help in the operation of the smartphone in case of questions.  Secondly, a USB cable, which can be used both in the process of connecting the phone to a computer, and when charging.  Thirdly, the charger.  Fourth, this is a proprietary headset from the Japanese company Sony in the form of headphones with a microphone, which is convenient to use when talking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia j photo" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/559156.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Prices for this model </h2><p>  Depending on where you will purchase this model of smartphone from a Japanese manufacturer of smartphones, the prices for it may be different.  In general, the price of Sony Xperia J, the firmware of which uses the Android 4.0 operating system, ranges from 150 to 200 dollars.  In addition, the cost of a smartphone is also determined by its configuration.  For example, if you purchase a phone with an additional memory capacity of 16-32 GB, then you will have to pay another 30-40 additional US dollars for the phone. </p><h2>  Sony Xperia J, customer reviews and experts </h2><p>  Since the phone was launched on the market a relatively long time, because two years is a lot for the smartphone market, today you can find a large number of reviews that describe the smartphone both on the positive and negative sides.  Moreover, if ordinary buyers used the smartphone only for practical purposes, and their reviews are appropriate, then the experts' opinion is based on a comparative analysis of this model with competitors.  As pluses, many ordinary smartphone users highlight its screen and build quality.  Indeed, if we take as an example a budget competitor represented by the NTS One V, then the Gorilla Glass coating against its background looks much more respectable.  As a minus, many people who bought a smartphone highlight low performance.  Indeed, even with a slight smartphone load, you can notice the interface freezes. </p><p>  The opinion of experts on this phone is generally positive, as they understand that for a price of $ 150 it is difficult to find a model that will not slow down and have outstanding characteristics.  However, if we consider this phone in the context of competition with such communicators as the NTS One V or Samsung Nexus S, then in some aspects the smartphone from the Japanese concern is inferior.  For example, such aspects are the sound level and quality of the photographs taken by the camera. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia j touchscreen" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/559178.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Based on the above overview, we can conclude that the phone has both positive and negative characteristics.  First of all, it should be noted the inexpensive cost of the phone, which does not exceed 200 US dollars.  This phone is a great option for stylish people, for whom the high performance capability of the Sony Xperia J st26i smartphone is not so important.  Characteristics and feedback on the design of the smartphone are its positive feature.  It should be noted that the smartphone‚Äôs <span>battery capacity is</span> quite large, which is 1750 mAh.  At first glance, this amount may seem small, but given the single-core processor, the battery lasts for one and a half days of serious workload.  On the other hand, issues that relate to the smartphone‚Äôs camera also apply.  If for the buyer it is important the quality of the photos taken, as well as their detail, then on the smartphone market there are other options with a better camera. </p>
