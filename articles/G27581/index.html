  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interesting do-it-yourself dresses</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tired of a locker with personal belongings?  You do not know what to wear on hot summer days, or did you urgently need an outfit for a celebration?  Do-it-yourself dresses are a way out of any situation.  Simple models can be made in one hour.  The most complex ones will require more time, but they will look like from an expensive boutique.  To get a new thing, it is not at all necessary to run to a fashion dress store and spend large sums of money.  <span>A simple dress</span> with your own hands will cost you inexpensively.  Consider several different options. </p><p>  Comfortable dresses with your own hands can be made from a cut of fabric and T-shirts or T-shirts.  It turns out a comfortable and original dress with a high waistline.  We put on a T-shirt and mark on it the desired height of the cut line, which will depend on the chosen style, size of the chest and the preferred length of the finished product.  We select a piece of fabric in a color scheme suitable for a T-shirt.  If you take a dense fabric, then one layer of a skirt will be enough. </p><p>  When choosing a material such as chiffon or crepe de chine, you will need two layers of fabric for the skirt.  A cut for a skirt is needed one and a half or two times more than your hips.  We measure the length of the skirt.  Cut and sew the side seam, overlay it with an overlock or a zigzag stitch.  We collect the top of the hem on a thread whose length is slightly larger than your waistline.  The hem bottom is hemmed and hemmed. </p><p>  We connect the skirt and the top of the dress, stitch it, process the seam with the help of an overlock.  We turn the finished dress on the front side.  You can sew a wide belt for such a dress or pick up a ready-made one in a suitable color scheme.  Do-it-yourself dresses can be made of <span>black T-shirts</span> and checkered fabrics or striped T-shirts and plain material.  In any case, you get a great option for a variety of summer clothes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The <span>simplest do-it-yourself dresses</span> with one open shoulder and a beveled hem are obtained from an ordinary rectangular cut of fabric or a large scarf.  Long clothes in this style look especially beautiful.  We take a flap of light material, the width is slightly larger than the hips, and the length of the desired length of the dress.  We wrap ourselves in a flap of fabric so that it passes under one arm and tie it with a knot on the opposite shoulder. </p><p>  We note the convenient depth of the sleeve and stitch the side seam, starting from this mark.  We process the hem and neck with a <span>slanting inlay,</span> lace or just hem.  Our dress is ready.  It remains only to pick up a beautiful plain belt for him.  This style looks great on a slender figure, successfully draping it and slightly opening one leg. </p><p>  For an evening out, a <span>Greek dress, made</span> with your own hands in just one hour, is perfect.  For its manufacture, we need two ribbons equal to the circumference under the chest and waist, a piece of fabric equal to two dress lengths, but not less than three meters and a little imagination.  We choose the material that fits well in the drapery and creates a flying silhouette.  Silk, viscose, chiffon, velvet or fine knitwear is perfect. </p><p>  We fold our 3 meter section in half and get only one and a half meters that correspond to the length of our future dress.  Fold tissue will replace the shoulder seams.  We are looking for the middle at the bend and, having drawn from it a perpendicular to the hem of the future dress, we cut about 15-20 centimeters.  We put on the flap over our heads.  Mark the depth of the cutout front and back.  Gently cut.  On the lateral sections, mark the waist line and sew to this mark. </p><p>  We process the hem of the dress with an overlock or hem.  Slices of fabric on the sleeves and neck are also processed.  Under the breast, on the naked body we fasten the braid.  We put on the blank of the dress and, having beautifully distributed the drapery over the chest, we pin the material to the ribbon.  If the neckline reaches the waistline, then in the same way we fix another tape and pin the drape also at the waist. </p><p>  Behind, we make the same neckline and fasten the drapery on the ribbons.  Carefully sweep the fabric in the position in which it was pinned and remove the needles.  From above, close the mark with <span>decorative tape,</span> combining it with the inner ribbon, and sew on.  The shoulder can be left deflated or picked up on the shoulder with the help of a ring sewn from the same finishing braid.  Our <span>greek style dress is</span> ready. </p>
