Malgrat de Mar Attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Malgrat de Mar is a resort town in Spain with around 18,000 inhabitants.  In the past, there was a small fishing village at this place, but in the shortest possible time this settlement turned into a popular world resort.  However, fishing is now one of the main income items of the city.  A large number of local residents are also involved in the textile industry and in the agricultural industry. </p><p>  Note that Malgrat is considered the most remote resort on the coast of Maresme and is located at the turn of the provinces of Barcelona and Girona.  This city, together with such neighboring settlements as Calella, Santa Susanna, Pineda, is a single resort area with developed infrastructure and excellent conditions for recreation. </p>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Malgrat de Mar has perfectly clean beaches.  <span>Municipal services</span> regularly clean the coastal area.  The coastline here stretches for 4.5 km.  Local beaches are equipped with everything you need: sun loungers, umbrellas, changing cabins.  There is a <span>sailing</span> school in the city where you can rent <span>pedal</span> boats and boats.  Near the beach area there is a beautiful park, and a few kilometers from Malgrat - a dolphinarium and a botanical garden. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The entire coast from this resort to Barcelona is almost completely built up with small villages, luxury villas and hotels.  The beach here is coarse sand.  It will be difficult for children to build sand castles or other shapes, but nothing will stuff into clothes and hair.  The sea is quite deep already two meters from the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="malgrat de mar attractions" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/484744.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The past of the city </h2><p>  Malgrat de Mar is conventionally divided into two districts - the Old and the New Town.  Both of these sections are connected on the central promenade - Passay-Maritim.  And Malgrat himself stretched all the way to the next resort - Santa Susanna. </p><p>  The old town has charming narrow stone streets, museums and architectural monuments.  In this area you should definitely see the Church of St. Nicholas de Bari, which was erected in the 16th century.  We also recommend visiting a watchtower of the same period, which is very well preserved.  The high quality work of the masters of that time is simply amazing.  The building where the school of music is located is also very unusual.  The world famous Town Hall is impressive.  Both of these buildings were built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the Art Nouveau style. </p><p>  In the old part of this Spanish resort town, you can also see many old Catalan bars, where people of retirement age often prefer to relax. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  New town </h2><p>  The New District presents modern and luxurious villas, hotels, trendy restaurants, shopping centers, markets and other objects of the tourism industry.  Malgrat's <span>nightlife is</span> in full swing on the promenade, where there are many discos, shops, bars. </p><p>  Dance parties in the city are held directly in the open air, and they all practically work until the morning.  For those who wish to continue the party, numerous cafes and bars, as well as closed disco clubs, open in the morning. </p><p>  Fans of outdoor activities Malgrat de Mar (Spain) can offer to go to the water park "Marineland", which is located between the city and the neighboring resort of Blanes.  It occupies a fairly impressive area - 40 thousand m <sup>2</sup> .  You can get to the water park by bus, which regularly leaves from the bus station of the town. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="malgrat de mar map" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/484751.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Luxury parks </h2><p>  We continue to closely study the amazing resort of Malgrat de Mar.  The sights of the city are not only ancient buildings and entertainment venues.  There are 2 parks in Malgrate.  One of them has the poetic name Castel, however, it is rather not a park in the classical sense of the word, but a large garden with a wide variety of unique plants.  It is located on a hill, tourists get to this place on a transparent elevator.  Its highlight is a spacious observation deck with a view of the sea coast and the city.  Here you can make amazing photos.  <span>Mountain pines,</span> fragrant flower bushes, fragrant lavender grow in the garden. </p><p>  A little further is a children's park with swings, bungees, ping-pong tables, a platform for skaters and other entertainments.  There are also amazing attractions in the form of huge colored pencils, erasers, sharpeners, donuts, cupcakes, flowers, boots, mushrooms.  Kids love to climb them. </p><p>  Francesc Macia Park is located on the territory of 40,000 m <sup>2</sup> .  Every autumn there is a famous international music festival.  During this event, the park is filled with fans of a wide variety of music styles.  In summer, families with children like to go to the park.  The smallest here will surely enjoy it: there are a lot of colorful figures of fairy-tale characters, game facilities, swings, etc. The park also has specially designated barbecue places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="malgrat de mar hotels" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/484750.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To get to Malgrat de Mar from Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãyou have to travel 66 kilometers (ticket costs about 7 euros).  Railways run along the sea here, thus separating the first line of hotels from the coast.  The most demanding tourists can rank this among the minuses of Malgrat.  However, it is worth noting that the trains are completely silent and run every 30 minutes.  From the hotel room they will be completely inaudible. </p><p>  Meanwhile, you can get to this resort not only through Barcelona.  You can get to Blanes, and then transfer by train to Girona. </p><h2>  Malgrat de Mar: hotels </h2><p>  The city is mainly represented by three- and four-star hotels.  They differ, of course, in remoteness from the beach and the range of services offered.  Hotels that are far from the coast will naturally be cheaper.  True, keep in mind that already at 700 meters from the shore there are mountain peaks.  Getting to the beach in the mountains is very difficult.  The staff of many hotels is fluent in Russian. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="malgrat de mar photo" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/484752.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Malgrat de Mar (photos of the city clearly demonstrate its amazing landscapes and architecture) is a very convenient place.  From here it is a stone's throw to the bird park and the dolphinarium.  You can also quickly get to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãGirona, Water World, the Blanes Botanical Garden.  Almost every hotel in the city has a Russian bureau where you can order any sightseeing tours in Spain, Andorra or even in the south of France. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Malgrat de Mar (the resort map is presented below) is an excellent resort where you can swim in the sea and sunbathe from April to November.
