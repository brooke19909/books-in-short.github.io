This is the state of Virginia.  The USA is an ‚Äúallsorts‚Äù country in every way.  This applies to the population, and culture, and the diversity of natural landscapes, and architecture.  In Virginia, you can see many quiet and cozy village towns, lost among green hills and meadows that resemble Irish settlements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="virginia state" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1451440.jpg" width="600"></div>

At the end of the 16th century, England began a colonial policy with respect to North America.  It was then that this territory began to be called Virginia, which is translated from Latin as "virgin" - in honor of Queen Elizabeth I of England, who was never married.  The first capital of Virginia was the city of Jamestown.  Later, at the end of the 18th century, the capital moved to Richmond.  After the Civil War, Virginia (state) became the main political center of the United States.  After the end of hostilities, industry began to develop here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="west virginia state" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1451438.jpg" width="600"></div>
