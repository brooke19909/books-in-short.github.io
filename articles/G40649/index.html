It would seem that everything has long been clear - according to the official version, it happened on April 30, 1945 in an underground bunker in Berlin.  There they found the bodies of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun, his newly-made wife.  This version has been confirmed by many people from the dictator‚Äôs inner circle, as well as experts who have identified and investigated corpses.  But is this really so?  There are several more versions, according to which the true answer to the question of how Hitler died, sounds completely different.  Already interested? </p><h4>  "South American" version </h4>

After conducting a global study of the fate of the dictator, Basti came to the conclusion that Adolf Hitler, together with his wife and closest associates, fled from besieged Berlin to South America.  According to the scientist, there the leader of the <span>Third Reich</span> died at the age of 75 in 1964.

    <p>  This version has several confirmations at once.  First, according to Hans Bauer, a German aircraft engineer, on April 30 at 4:30 p.m. (an hour after the proclaimed suicide) he saw Hitler dressed in a light gray suit in the center of Berlin, near the Junkers-52 plane.  Other documents suggest that a secret meeting on Hitler‚Äôs evacuation took place in the bunker on April 25th.  The plan was named Operation Seral, and Hans-Ulrich Rudel (pilot ace), pilotess Hannah Reich, and Hitler's personal pilot participated in its development.  5 days before, the list of passengers departing for Barcelona from Berlin was approved, among which <span>was the wife of</span> Adolf Hitler, himself and the F√ºhrer‚Äôs closest associates.  Remarkably, the names of Goebbels and his family were deleted from the list. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to this version, at the end of summer, the F√ºhrer and his retinue arrived on the Argentinean coast in submarines, which were immediately flooded for the purpose of conspiracy.  This fact is confirmed by the fact that large objects buried at the bottom, also visible from space, were found near the coast (at a depth of about 30 m).  The archives still keep testimonies of witnesses who told about the arrival of 3 submarines with the image of a swastika in the bay of Caleta de los Loros in the summer of 45. </p><h4>  Further south? </h4>

What speaks in favor of this opinion?

    <p>  Already in 1948, on the Stalin‚Äôs desk were intercepted intelligence of the States, stating that Hitler was alive and staying in New Schwabeland, erected by the Nazis in Antarctica at the beginning of the war.  Why hasn‚Äôt it been discovered before?  Against the backdrop of the <span>Great Depression</span> in America and the mass repressions in the USSR, intelligence capabilities have worsened, which means that global construction work and regular cargo deliveries to the white continent could go unnoticed. </p><p>  The SS secret archives store information about the system of caves with warm air existing off the coast of the southern continent.  13 American ships under the command of Richard Byrd, the then-famous rear admiral, exploring the shores of Antarctica in January 1947, were faced with unusual disc-shaped <span>aircraft</span> marked with Nazi symbols. </p><p>  Adherents of this version are inclined to believe that the Fuhrer died in 1971 (and according to some sources - in 1982). </p>
