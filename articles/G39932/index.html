Not far from Belek is the famous Keprylu Kanyon National Park, which is a continuation of a paradise. </p><h2>  Natural landmark of Turkey </h2><p>  The K√∂pr√ºl√º Kanyon Nature Reserve, considered one of the main miraculous sights of Turkey, occupies the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Western Taurus - the mountain system of the state.  Its total area is approximately 500 hectares.  The national park, which is a narrow valley, is located next to the rapid river that flows into the Mediterranean Sea.  She became the reason for the formation of a beautiful canyon, the depth of which reaches in some places up to a hundred meters.  High slopes descend to the banks of the Kepryuchay river.  The canopies are covered with dense forest, and rocky cliffs are dangerous for people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Keprylu Canyon" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/2019548.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As scientists note, on our planet there are only seven natural formations of a similar kind that appeared as a result of the flow of mountain waters. </p><h2>  Stormy element </h2><p>  The swift Kepryuchay, the icy waters of which have a beautiful turquoise hue, provides excellent opportunities for rafting for both beginners and true professionals.  It is filled with numerous cascades and springs oozing in the crevices of the canyon.  And if at the very beginning the river, flowing from time immemorial, does not resemble a stormy element, then with every kilometer wild foamy streams look frightening.  Alloys of various difficulty levels attract tourists vacationing on the <span>Antalya coast,</span> and extreme sportsmen who want to tickle their nerves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Keprylu Canyon National Park" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2019346.jpg" width="600"></div>

In the reserve, covered with cedar and pine forests, the air is saturated with ozone, and thousands of people rush here for medicinal purposes in order to strengthen their immunity.  A delightful aroma emanating from eucalyptus trees helps with diseases of the upper respiratory tract. </p><p>  The protected area is famous for the diversity of the Mediterranean flora.  More than 600 species of plants and trees grow here, and some can only be seen in this region.  In spring, at the peak of flowering, the air is filled with a wonderful fragrance, and forest thickets dress in bright dresses. </p><p>  Park Kepryulu canyon consider one hundred species of birds and many mammals as their home.  The giant carriage turtles listed in the Red Book are especially pleasing to children and adults.  The breeding large-headed giants living in the water feel great in the reserve. </p><h2>  Antique Oluk Bridge </h2><p>  Nature lovers will be pleasantly surprised by the fact that in the national park you can not only enjoy amazing landscapes, but also get acquainted with architectural monuments preserved from past eras.  The stone arch bridge Oluk, left over from the times of the Roman Empire and recently restored, is an excellent example of ancient culture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Keprylu canyon how to get" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2019345.jpg" width="600"></div>

Surprisingly, the invention of the ancient Romans, thanks to its robust construction, serves us to this day, withstanding significant loads. </p><h2>  The ruins of the ancient settlement of Selge </h2><p>  The remains of an ancient settlement called Selge, which appeared on the territory of the Kepryulu canyon several millennia ago, excite the imagination of tourists.  You can get to the ruins on your own along a narrow path that runs through the forest and is equipped with signs.  However, as part of an organized tour, along with a guide who will tell the curious history of the town, this is much more interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Keprylu Canyon Turkey" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/2019545.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The heyday of one of the most powerful settlements fell on the days of Greek rule.  An interesting object of Selge is the theater, which served as a place for sports and colorful performances.  There are also ancient burials and ruins of a temple dedicated to Zeus. </p><h2>  What to do in a peaceful place? </h2><p>  People come here not only to enjoy the peace and tranquility.  Fans of outdoor activities will not be disappointed: the administration of the reserve does everything to make tourists fully experience the charm of being in the wilderness. </p><p>  Here you can go mountain climbing, horseback riding, visit the mysterious underground world with stalactites of the most bizarre forms, go down on inflatable rafts along a mountainous stormy river.  In addition, numerous restaurants located in the Keprylu Canyon offer national dishes of meat and fish, as well as delicious Turkish sweets. </p><p>  Those who came to the reserve on their own are surely approached by local guides offering a boat ride.  This is a popular excursion introducing the marvelous beauties of a picturesque corner. </p><h2>  Kepryulu canyon nature reserve: how to get there? </h2><p>  From any city in Turkey it is easy to get to the national park located in the south of the country, in the province of Antalya.  You can buy a ready-made tour or go on an independent trip, so as not to depend on anyone and not to rush anywhere.  You need to go along the federal highway D400 (Antalya-Kemer), running along the Mediterranean coast, paying attention to road signs.  The reference point will be the village of Be≈ükonak, from which it is five kilometers to go to the natural miracle. </p><p>  Entrance to Keprylu Canyon (Turkey) is free, but the help of a Russian-speaking guide will cost 50 euros. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Keprylu Canyon Park" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2019350.jpg" width="600"></div>
