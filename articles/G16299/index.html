    <p>  I-16 - "donkey", "donkey".  Soviet-made monoplane fighter.  He first appeared in the 30s.  This happened at the Polikarpov Design Bureau.  The first who took off on a fighter in the air was Valery Chkalov.  It happened at the end of December 1933.  The plane took part in the civil war, which broke out in 1936 in Spain, in conflict with Japan on the Khalkhin Gol River, in the Soviet-Finnish battle.  By the beginning of World War II, the fighter was the main unit of the corresponding USSR park.  Most pilots began their careers precisely with service on the I-16. </p><h2>  Inventions of Alexander Yakovlev </h2><p>  Aviation of the Second World War included the Yak-3 aircraft.  It should be understood as a single-engine fighter, the development of which was carried out under the leadership of Alexander Yakovlev.  The plane was an excellent continuation of the Yak-1 model.  Production of the aircraft took place from 1994 to 1945.  During this time, managed to construct about 5 thousand fighters.  The aircraft was recognized as the best fighter of World War II, designed for low altitudes.  This model was in service with France. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Soviet aviation has gained a lot since the invention of the Yak-7 (UTI-26) aircraft.  This is a single-engine aircraft developed by <span>Alexander Yakovlev.</span>  Used from the perspective of a training aircraft.  Production began in 1942.  About 6 thousand of these models took to the air. </p><h2>  More perfect model </h2><p>  USSR aviation had such a fighter as the K-9.  This is the most popular model, the production of which lasted about 6 years, starting in 1942.  During this time, about 17 thousand aircraft were constructed.  Despite the fact that the model had little differences from the FK-7 aircraft, in all respects it became a more perfect continuation of the series. </p><h2>  Aircraft produced under the leadership of Petlyakov </h2><p>  Discussing such a topic as aviation of the Second World War, it should be noted an airplane called Pawn (Pe-2).  This is a dive bomber, which is the most massive in its class.  This model was actively used on the battlefield. </p>

    <p>  The aviation of the USSR of the Second World War included in its structure such an aircraft as the PE-3.  This model should be understood as a twin-engine fighter.  Its main feature was an all-metal construction.  Development was carried out in OKB-29.  The base was taken dive bomber PE-2.  The production process was led by V. Petlyakov.  The first aircraft was constructed in 1941.  From the bomber he was distinguished by the absence of a lower hatch for a rifle mount.  There were no brake grilles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  A fighter that could fly at high altitudes </h2><p>  The USSR military aircraft during the Second World War was supplemented by such a high-altitude fighter as the MIG-3.  This aircraft was used in a wide variety of options.  Among the main differences, one can single out that he could rise to a height of 12 thousand meters.  The speed reached a fairly high level.  With the help of this <span>fighter, pilots</span> successfully fought with enemy aircraft. </p><h2>  Fighters led by Lavochkin </h2><p>  Talking on a topic such as aviation of the Second World War, it is necessary to note a model called LaGG-3.  This is a monoplane fighter, which was in service with the Red Army Air Force.  It was used from the perspective of a fighter, interceptor, bomber, reconnaissance.  Production lasted from 1941 to 1944.  The designers are Lavochkin, Gorbunov, Gudkov.  Among the positive qualities should be highlighted the presence of powerful weapons, high survivability, minimal use of rare materials.  As the main source of resources for the creation of the fighter used pine and plywood. </p>

    <p>  Military aircraft had a La-5 model, the construction of which took place under the leadership of Lavochkin.  This is a monoplane fighter.  The main characteristics are the presence of only one place, a closed cabin, a wooden frame and exactly the same wing spars.  Production of this aircraft began in 1942.  At the very beginning, only automatic 20-mm guns in the amount of two pieces were used as weapons.  Their designers placed in front of the engine.  Instrumentation did not differ in variety.  There was not even a single gyroscopic device.  And if you compare such an aircraft with those aircraft that were used by Germany, America or England, it may seem that it lags behind them very much technically.  However, flight performance was at a high level.  In addition, the simple design, the absence of the need for labor-intensive maintenance, and the undemanding conditions of take-off fields made the model simply ideal for that period.  In one year, about one thousand fighter jets were developed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <span>The history of aviation of the</span> USSR keeps in itself a mention of such a model as the La-7.  This is a single-seat monoplane fighter, the design of which was engaged in Lavochkin.  The first such aircraft was released in 1944.  He took off in February.  In May, it was decided to start its mass production.  Almost all the pilots who became Heroes of the Soviet Union flew on La-7. </p><h2>  Model produced under the leadership of Polikarpov </h2><p>  The military aviation of the USSR included the U-2 (PO-2) model.  This is a multi-purpose biplane, the production of which was led by Polikarpov in 1928.  The main goal, for the achievement of which the aircraft was released, was to train pilots.  He was characterized by the presence of good aerobatic qualities.  When the Great Patriotic War began, it was decided to convert the standard models into light, night bomber aircraft.  The load reached 350 kg.  The aircraft was mass-produced until 1953.  For all the time managed to produce about 33 thousand models. </p><h2>  High speed fighter </h2><p>  Military aircraft of World War II included a machine such as the Tu-2.  This model is also known as ANT-58 and 103 Tu-2.  This is a twin-engine bomber that could develop a high flight speed.  For the entire time of its production, about 2257 models were designed.  The bomber was in service until 1950. </p><h2>  Flying tank </h2>

    <p>  No less popular is such an aircraft as the Il-2.  The attack aircraft was also nicknamed "humpbacked."  The shape of the fuselage contributed to this.  The designers called this car a flying tank.  German pilots called this model a concrete plane and a cemented bomber due to its special strength.  The production of the attack aircraft was carried out by Ilyushin. </p><h2>  What can be said about German aviation? </h2><p>  German aircraft of World War II included a model such as the Messerschmitt Bf.109.  This is a low-wing piston fighter.  He was used as an interceptor, fighter, bomber and reconnaissance.  This is the most massive aircraft in the history of World War II (33984 models).  Almost all German pilots began to fly it on this plane. </p><p>  Messerschmitt Bf.110 - a heavy strategic fighter.  Due to the fact that it could not be used for its intended purpose, the model was retrained as a bomber.  The aircraft has found wide application in different countries.  He participated in the fighting in various parts of the globe.  Good luck to such an aircraft was associated with the suddenness of its appearance.  However, if a maneuvering battle flared up, then this model almost always lost.  In this regard, such a plane was recalled from the front in 1943. </p>

    <p>  Messerschmitt Me.163 (Comet) - missile interceptor fighter.  First flew back in 1941 at the very beginning of September.  Not distinguished by mass production.  By 1944, only 44 models were produced.  The first sortie took place only in 1944.  In total, only 9 aircraft were shot down with their help, with a loss of 11. </p><p>  "Messerschmitt Me.210" - a heavy fighter, which acted as a replacement for the model Bf.110.  He made his first flight in 1939.  In its design, the model had several defects, in connection with which its combat value was severely damaged.  Everything was released about 90 models.  320 aircraft were never completed. </p><p>  Messerschmitt Me.262 - a jet fighter, which also acted as a bomber and reconnaissance.  The first <span>jet</span> in the world to take part in hostilities.  It can also be considered the world's first jet fighter.  The main weapons were 30-mm air guns, which were installed near the bow.  In this regard, heap and dense fire was provided. </p><h2>  British aircraft </h2><p>  The Hawker Hurricane is a British-made single-seat fighter released in 1939.  For the entire time of production, about 14 thousand models were released.  In connection with a variety of modifications, the machine was used as an interceptor, bomber and attack aircraft.  There were also such modifications that implied the takeoff of an aircraft from aircraft carriers.  Among the German aces, this aircraft was called a "bucket of nuts."  This is due to the fact that he was quite difficult to control and slowly gained height. </p><p>  Supermarine Spitfire is a British-made fighter that has one engine and an all-metal monoplane with a wing located quite low.  The chassis of this model could be removed.  Various modifications made it possible to use the model as a fighter, interceptor, bomber and reconnaissance.  About 20 thousand cars were produced.  Some of them were used until the 50s.  Mostly used only at the very beginning of the war. </p>

    <p>  The Hawker Typhoon is a single-seat bomber that was produced until 1945.  He was in service until 1947.  Development was carried out in order to use it from the perspective of an interceptor.  It is one of the most successful fighters.  However, there were some problems from which low rate of climb can be distinguished.  The first flight took place in 1940. </p><h2>  Japan Aviation </h2><p>  Japanese aircraft of World War II mainly copied the models of those aircraft that were used in Germany.  A large number of fighters were produced to support ground forces in hostilities.  Local air supremacy was also implied.  Quite often, planes from the Second World War were used for a raid on China.  It is worth noting that there were no strategic bombers in the Japanese aviation.  Among the main fighters are: Nakajima Ki-27, Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa, Nakajima Ki-44 Shoki, Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryu, Kawasaki Ki-61 Hien.  <span>The Japanese Air Force</span> also used transport, training, reconnaissance aircraft.  In aviation, there was a place for special-purpose models. </p>

    <h2>  American fighter jets </h2><p>  What else can be said on such a topic as aviation of the Second World War?  The USA also did not stand aside.  For quite understandable reasons, the Americans thoroughly approached the development of the fleet and aviation.  Most likely, it was just such a thoroughness that played a role in the fact that <span>American-</span> made <span>aircraft</span> were one of the most powerful not only in numbers, but also in capabilities.  By the beginning of hostilities in the US arsenal consisted of models such as the Curtiss P-40.  However, after some time, this car was replaced by the P-51 Mustang, P-47 Thunderbolt, P-38 Lightning.  As strategic bombers, aircraft of such models as the B-17 FlyingFortress and B-24 Liberator were used.  In order to be able to conduct strategic bombing in Japan, aircraft of the B-29 Superfortress model were constructed in America. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Aviation played a significant role in World War II.  Virtually not a single battle was complete without aircraft.  However, there is nothing strange in the fact that states measured their strengths not only on the ground, but also in the air.  Accordingly, each country approaches with a great deal of responsibility both the training of pilots and the creation of new aircraft.  In this review, we tried to consider those aircraft that were used (successfully and not so much) in military operations. </p>
