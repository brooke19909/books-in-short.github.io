    <h2>  Hotel Advantages </h2><p>  The rating at Sunprime C-Lounge Hotel 5 * is quite high.  This can be understood by paying attention to the reviews of guests who have ever stayed here.  Here is what they note in their comments: </p><ul><li>  The hotel is small and quiet, no children, very calm on site.  Relaxation is provided. </li><li>  Atmosphere.  Many guests, having once arrived at the hotel, leave with the intention of returning.  The alluring atmosphere is largely due to a fresh stylish repair, expensive plumbing, comfortable furniture, high-quality electronics ... At first glance, reverent attention to detail is noticeable.  Paradise for aesthetes and perfectionists, in a word. </li><li>  The adjacent territory.  There is where to relax and take a walk. </li><li>  Good free wifi.  You can ‚Äúcatch‚Äù it anywhere - in the lobby, in the room, by the pool and even on the beach. </li><li>  Staff.  All employees of the hotel are positive and smiling people who are at any moment ready to help the guest, suggest something, agree on something.  In communication, everyone is polite - from the maids to the waiters. </li><li>  Food.  Tasty, fresh, varied.  A huge number of side dishes, salads, fish, and meat - a real abundance.  And the restaurant has no lines. </li><li>  Relaxation.  Every day, after dark, evenings of live music are held with covers for popular compositions, discos.  And on Saturdays - Turkish folk show.  Very colorful and memorable. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunprime c lounge hotel 5 rating" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2081502.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  A few words are worth saying about him.  The beach here is not quite ordinary, with an adjacent terrace terrace, on which there are sun loungers and umbrellas.  Many vacationers say that swimming with him is much more convenient, the entrance to the sea will be more pleasant. </p><p>  Near the shore in the water - two stone braids, and the pier itself in the middle of the beach.  In simple terms, vacationers have a choice - either swim on the side of it, or jump immediately into the water from it.  It is safe, as the bottom is visible - the water is so clean and transparent. </p><p>  By the way, the beach, like the pier, is never clogged.  Even in the midst of the swimming season there is no crowding.  For two reasons.  The first is that it is closed, only hotel guests are allowed there.  The second, which has already been mentioned, there are no fussy children and parents who are forced to monitor them and constantly run in order to ensure control. </p><h2>  Travel tips </h2><p>  A lot of reviews were left about the Sunprime C-Lounge Hotel 5 * hotel, and in many of them you can notice useful recommendations.  So, here's what you should take into account for people who are just about to go here: </p><ul><li>  Be sure to paraglide and go down in the Nemo submarine.  The second is for those who want to see bright fish, but do not want to dive. </li><li>  It is worth going for Alanya branded ice cream, which is sold in all central cafes. </li><li>  Peeling with fish is also a way to get an unforgettable experience and vivid sensations. </li><li>  It is recommended to climb the hill to the castle in Alanya. </li><li>  At the same time, you do not need to go to Cleopatra Beach.  It smells dirty, smells bad, and at the bottom - stoves. </li></ul><p>  And one more recommendation, but regarding the hotel.  It is best to book a room on the sixth floor, and so that it faces east.  From there, an amazing view of the mountains opens, and the sounds of music from the pool are not heard at all. </p>
