    <h2>  Banks </h2><p>  Fifteen new buildings in Moscow, of which seven have already been commissioned, put the financial and construction corporation Leader at the highest levels of ratings in many respects.  The overall rating among metropolitan developers is 4.8 points out of 5 possible.  This is a very high mark.  The company acts in transactions as an investor in the sale of apartments in new buildings, as well as as a management company in construction. </p><p>  The financial and construction corporation "Leader" has unquestioned credibility in the real estate market, and therefore its customers are eagerly supported by mortgage banks.  These are VTB Bank (Moscow), Absolut Bank, VTB24, Gazprombank, Vozrozhdenie, Globex, Metallinvestbank, Delta Credit, Raiffeisenbank, Promsvyazbank, SMP Bank "," Rosselkhozbank "," Svyaz-Bank ", Sberbank," Surgutneftegazbank "," Uralsib "," Transcapitalbank ", FC" Discovery ". </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  One of the most successful and dynamically developing companies is considered FGC "Leader".  Moscow is well aware of its activities in the field of residential real estate, in the construction of business and economy class housing, where the company performs all the work of any kind.  The corporation is engaged in both the integrated development of new housing estates and the construction of residential facilities for individual projects.  Construction is carried out both on borrowed funds and on company-owned assets when Leader acts as an investor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In this article, only those objects that are located in Moscow or near Moscow suburbs will be considered, since there is too much information on the activities of FGC Leader.  Izmailovo, for example, or Tushino will already require enough detailed stories, since the construction of truly remarkable residential complexes is underway.  Despite the huge number of Moscow new buildings, among which there are practically no up-to-date or frankly unpresentable ones, the facilities that FGC Leader is engaged in are favorably different from all. </p>

    <h2>  Investments </h2><p>  For many years of successful activity, the company thoroughly studied all the details relating to such an unstable area as real estate in Moscow.  The financial and construction corporation has rightfully earned the reputation that accompanies it in all endeavors.  This is a serious and reliable investor.  It organically combines managerial flexibility, ingenuity in finding solutions and a thorough approach to work.  All funds invested in real estate always bring a stable and considerable income. </p><p>  Work with FSK "Leader" becomes a reliable basis for mutually beneficial and long-term cooperation.  The company's specialists are responsible and highly professional to all their obligations, and therefore the trust of partners and customers is always and at the proper level.  The employees here are chosen very carefully, and therefore there are very few open-access vacancies - only twenty-six people are currently required for a huge corporation. </p><h2>  Ratings </h2><p>  In 2016, the company FGC Leader was in the top ten rating of housing developers in the country (national association).  The RBC-500 rating put Leader Corporation in third place among the most successful developers in Russia.  A year earlier, it was the twentieth place (the rating of the fifty fastest growing companies in the Russian Federation, and everything was considered here - not just the real estate field). </p><p>  In 2016, the volume of ongoing construction that the company is conducting has allowed it to occupy the thirteenth position in Russia among the two hundred largest developers.  This rating was compiled by RASK.  Forbes Magazine, which publishes data on company income and investments, has added FGC Leader to the list of the two hundred largest private corporations in Russia, where 60% of the proceeds go to general contracts and 38% to investments, but it is indicated that the turnover in investment activity is growing very quickly (the peak was in 2012 - 71%). </p>

    <h2>  Head of corporation </h2><p>  Even in reviews, there is often a question that may seem insufficiently correct.  They ask what kind of person the president of the company is and how he managed to start and develop such a successful activity.  In fact, this question is important, both ordinary customers and especially partners have the right to receive an answer. </p><p>  The president of the company is <span>Vladimir Voronin.</span>  This is the son of a famous construction official and owner of the Glavmosstroy company.  If Oleg Deripaska had not acquired this company in 2005, perhaps no Leader would have formed.  Glavmosstroy was absorbed by the <span>Nafta Moscow</span> structure <span>,</span> and it was absorbed unfriendly, but this is a completely different story. </p>

    <h2>  Necessary story </h2><p>  For some time after the formation, the “Leader” was looking for what is called his face, the sphere of application of his talents and the bridgehead for the take-off of professional activity.  In 2006, the Leader-South company, which was engaged in construction in Gelendzhik and Sochi, and the trading house Partner were formed as part of the FSK.  It was a good undertaking.  Holding projects were successfully implemented.  In 2007, another company was created - "Leader Development", which is already carrying out construction projects from start to finish - from site selection to turnkey status. </p><p>  Construction begins in the Mytishchi district of Moscow.  Many saw this cottage <span>village Vita</span> Verde fifteen kilometers from Moscow along the Dmitrov highway - like little Italy.  Business-class housing and the first truly great fortune.  In 2008 <span>, the Zodiac LCD</span> was introduced to the market <span>,</span> and this work of the company has already become a landmark product.  And therefore it is necessary to say more about it. </p>

    <h2>  "Zodiac" </h2><p>  In <span>the</span> business class <span>residential complex there</span> are not only panoramic views of the river, canal and forest park, not only the services provided by the highest level, household enterprises and shopping and entertainment.  Here, even for Moscow, apartments are exceptional in comfort.  FSK "Leader" was able to surprise even the capital, which saw all kinds of architectural wonders.  The "zodiac" is orderliness itself, wholeness itself directed toward the sky. </p><p>  The complex is located directly in the forest zone between the Moskva River and the Moscow Canal.  There is not a single noisy track, but the city center is within easy reach.  The area of ​​the apartments is very different, with recreational areas, conservatories.  The territory is abundantly landscaped, landscaped.  The infrastructure is comprehensive: its own kindergarten, parking, fitness center, pharmacy, shops, dry cleaning and much more.  Federal Grid Company has provided customers with a full set of permits, design and title documents. </p><h2>  "New Izmailovo" </h2><p>  FSK "Leader" has implemented the Balashikha-City project.  In this microdistrict, construction by the Novaya Ploshchad company that had already begun was suspended in 2007, and many equity holders were deceived.  Now more than seven hundred families are provided with housing.  (More than four hundred equity holders, deceived by the Manny company, received consolation in the form of apartments in the 20th Parkovaya microdistrict, which the Leader also managed to implement.) </p><p>  In Balashikha, in the district of "New Izmailovo", FSK is still working.  There are several lines with monolithic houses from twelve to twenty-five floors.  The total area is three hundred thousand square meters.  Apartments are almost all free planning - from thirty-five to one hundred and ten square meters.  But some of them - under the fine finish in the avant-garde, modern, classical styles, even there is art deco.  And one-room apartments are not offended, because many have bay windows and panoramic views. </p><h2>  "New Tushino" </h2><p>  FSK "Leader" began this work in 2013.  In 2017, construction is planned to be completed.  There are six monolithic buildings from seventeen to twenty-two floors.  The buildings are beautiful: a unique color scheme and texture on the facades (porcelain stoneware facing), stained-glass windows of loggias and balconies and fully panoramic glazing of the last two floors.  Engineering meets the latest international standards. </p><p>  High school, several kindergartens, a medical center, shops, underground parking and guest car parks.  Safe playgrounds, bike paths and pedestrian, sports facilities and special grounds for walking pets - all this is provided.  The LCD is located in a good place - one and a half kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road, with access to Putilkovskoye Shosse. </p>

    <h2>  Performance and Awards </h2><p>  Financial performance is growing steadily.  Turnover grows per year from one and a half to two times.  Already in 2014, it amounted to sixty-two billion rubles.  At work - and awards.  In 2012, FGC Leader received the annual Urban Awards in the Developer of the Year category, and the Vita Verde settlement mentioned above won the Best Business Class Village nomination and provided the creators with the PRO Realty Award. </p><p>  In 2013, the West Kuntsevo quarter won the Buyer Choice nomination; Vladimir Voronin received the award and the title Person of the Year.  The national RREF AWARDS award in several categories was received, which was provided by the M-House housing complex, the FGC Leader team and personally Vladimir Voronin.  In 2014, three prestigious prizes were received, in 2015, five.  The year 2016 turned out to be especially successful in this respect - the Leader Corporation received as many as seven prizes, and all - one other is better.  2017 will certainly not lose to its predecessors. </p>
