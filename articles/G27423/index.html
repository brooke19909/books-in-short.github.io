  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who invented the Internet? Some interesting facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is impossible to imagine our life without the Internet today.  It is there that we draw any necessary information, communicate with friends and spend our leisure time.  No other source can give such a volume of knowledge.  The young generation spends every free minute on the endless expanses of the World Wide Web.  For some, this is a place of rest, but for others it is a field of activity.  And far from all users think about who invented the Internet, it has become so familiar to us. </p><p>  Let's talk a little about the history of the creation of the <span>World Wide Web.</span>  Its founder is Timothy John Berners-Lee.  He is considered the one who created the Internet.  We owe him free communication with a computer and unhindered access to a vast sea of â€‹â€‹information. </p><p>  Timothy Berners-Lee was born in England.  His parents were mathematicians and were developing the first computers.  Naturally, this was the beginning for the future choice of a profession.  Of course, it cannot be said that the development of the Internet belongs to only one person.  Its previous history should be sought back at the time of the invention of the telegraph.  Mankind for many years tried to find different <span>ways to transmit information.</span>  Many scientists have worked on this problem.  Step by step, people were approaching this discovery. Speaking about who invented the Internet, they mean the ability to <span>transfer information</span> from one computer to another.  Even before the birth of Timothy Berners-Lee, the idea arose of combining the entire flow of information and transmitting it through <span>cross-references.</span>  The author of this invention is <span>Ted Nelson.</span>  This was one of the steps to creating the World Wide Web. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Timothy Berners-Lee, while studying at school, was accused (along with several other students) of attempting to hack the system, and they were denied access to school computers.  Then it occurred to him to assemble his own car.  To do this, we used an old TV (turned into a monitor) and a calculator keyboard. </p><p>  After graduating from Oxford with a <span>degree in physics, the</span> scientist began to develop software for printers.  At this moment, he created an operating system that was capable of performing many tasks at once.  These developments and later allowed him to become the one who invented the Internet. </p><p>  Then Timothy Berners-Lee went to work in the laboratory for the creation of <span>nuclear weapons.</span>  Here he created a program, the principle of which became random associations, reminiscent of the principle of the World Wide Web.  Research in this area continued during further work at CERN, where he developed systems for collecting information.  These discoveries have become the basis for the modern Internet.  That's why when they talk about who invented the Internet, they mention the name Timothy Berners-Lee. </p><p>  His discoveries simplified the procedure for collecting, storing and processing information.  Initially, the network operated only within CERN.  It resembled a huge archive, access to which was open from any computer organization.  Further, for two years, research was conducted in this area.  In 1991, the first site was opened.  It contained information about the Internet system and how to connect to it. </p><p>  From that moment, the Internet began to firmly enter our lives.  Timothy Berners-Lee - the one who invented the Internet - became the head of the 3Com founders department.  She deals with many problems of the World Wide Web, including the development of standards for her. </p><p>  The development of science and achievements in this field gradually led mankind to the creation of the World Wide Web.  It was natural.  The significance of the Internet in people's lives today cannot be overestimated.  On the basis of this invention, new systems are being developed, the life of people and the work of many organizations are improving, including socially significant ones. </p>
