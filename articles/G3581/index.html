The imagination of local hoteliers is not very rich.  They call their hotels either “Wave”, “Sea”, “Sail”, or the name of some flower.  And so it happened that there are a lot of hotels under the Lavender sign in Sochi.  There is such a hotel on Alleynaya street, Uritsky, and Popov.  And this is not Big Sochi, but only Adler!  Guest house "Lavender" (ul. Izvestinskaya, 6) will be the topic of our article.  This hotel has opened recently, and there are still few reviews.  But the owners of “Lavender” used to keep the guest house “AiST” and won praise for their service and concern for the guests.  This mini-hotel is working now.  AiST is also located in the Kurortny Gorodok area, like Lavanda, only the other street is 74, Medovaya.

This is one building on five floors.  Near the building there is a patio under constant observation, parking, pool.  The territory of the guest house is small, but well equipped.  Between the building and a high stone fence near the pool there is a row of sunbeds where you can sunbathe.  There are also barbecue facilities and tables under umbrellas.  The words "shared kitchen" cause nervous tremors in vacationers.  But you should not imagine a queue for a single four-burner stove and a war for a free pan.  Each room, even the simplest, has an electric kettle and a microwave.  And on all floors of the building there is a common kitchen with a large set of kitchen utensils and a stove.  So the rooms in the guest house "Lavender" can be described as apartments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adler guest house lavender 6 ul.
