    <p>  Many decorators use design elements such as sofa cushions in their work.  They allow you to bring to the room a sense of completeness and a subtle touch of sophistication.  Most often, such products are square or rectangular in shape, but pillows in the shape of a heart or a circle can be found.  You can also go in this direction and update the interior of your apartment.  You can find a large number of finished products on sale, but it will be difficult to choose exactly what you need by color and shape.  If you still have a desire to update the look of the room, you can make sofa cushions with your own hands.  To do this, it is enough to have the most basic skills of some needlework. </p><p>  The fastest and easiest way is to stitch.  For this, it is worth choosing two types of fabric: one for filling (coarse calico is suitable), and the second for a cover.  For the latter, it is better to purchase decorative material that you can buy in a variety of colors.  As printed, you can purchase special material designed for pillows.  As a rule, it is packaged in 1 kg.  This amount is enough for several finished products.  Now you need to cut the fabric for filling, sew and fill with the purchased material.  You can make pillows on the sofa with your own hands in the shape of animals.  Such products will especially please young children, since, being an element of decor, they will look like real toys.  A cover or pillowcase that exactly follows the shape of the pillow must be sewn separately.  It can then be removed and washed as needed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  DIY pillows can also be made by knitting.  The basics of the pillow are better to sew as described in the previous method.  But you can stuff directly knitted cover.  For the manufacture of pillows for sofas, it is better to choose either woolen or cotton yarn.  Such products will keep their shape perfectly, even if knitting needles were used in their manufacture.  The pattern can be very diverse if monophonic threads are used for knitting.  You can also knit various favorite cartoon characters if the pillow is designed for a children's room.  Or any fantasy pattern, if it is planned that the finished product will take pride of place on the sofa in the living room.  If you crochet, then it is worth picking up threads that are contrasting in color to the material of the bulk.  Such a pillow will have a unique appearance and can become the ‚Äúcolor spot‚Äù that many famous decorators often resort to.  The main thing here is your imagination and desire to update the interior. </p><p>  You can also embroider sofa cushions with your own hands.  This is perhaps the most time-consuming <span>method of manufacturing</span> such products.  Very often you can find pillows that were made by embroidering "cross" woolen threads on burlap.  If desired, you can find a large number of schemes for this method.  And then a picture of some famous artist or a portrait of a beloved man will be embroidered on your finished product.  It is enough to have skills, perseverance and a desire to achieve the goal. </p><p>  In addition to embroidery, do-it-yourself sofa cushions can be made using macram√©.  To do this, it is worth choosing the appropriate cords that will not only save the nodes, but also give the pillow a beautiful look.  The finished product is best used as a pillowcase. </p><p>  Thus, there are a large number of ways to make sofa cushions yourself.  All you need is a creative approach and the possession of the most basic skills of at least some needlework.  And then your house will be transformed, playing with new unusual colors. </p>
