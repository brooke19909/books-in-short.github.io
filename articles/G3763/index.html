    <h2>  How was <span>Central Park formed</span> in Stavropol? </h2><p>  The place was formed more than 150 years ago.  This name was given to the park because of its location - it is located in the central part of the old city.  Sometimes it is also called Old Park - because of age. </p><p>  Once upon a time, all this territory was called the Black Forest.  The thicket was located in a beam.  Since the trees grew close enough to each other, it was an impassable terrain in which animals lived.  Then, the construction of the fortress began on the territory of the forest.  Most of the centuries-old trees were mercilessly destroyed.  From the forest there was only a grove bought by Matvey Babin, in connection with which she received his name. </p><p>  In the future, a plan was developed to improve the territory, which is now occupied by the Central Park in Stavropol.  In 1805, an alley and several paths were laid in Babin Grove.  Then they sold it again, this time to the merchant Tarasov. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For nearly half a century, the grove was abandoned.  Only in 1847, Tarasov donated it to the male gymnasium (Gymnasium), and after only a year she was again renamed and modified.  Prince Vorontsov-Dashkov ordered to transform it into an urban grove, after which they organized a nursery of fruit and ornamental trees, planted grapes and set up an area for public outings. </p><p>  Gradually, the Vorontsov Garden grew and developed.  The best gardeners worked here, carefully planting trees and flower beds.  For example, Nechmirov planted chestnuts on the central alley, which you can admire today, and Novak created such ensembles of beds that many modern masters of landscape design would envy.  It was his floral arrangements in honor of the legendary Varyag and Koreets that took first place in the All-Russian competition in 1904, and then were discussed for a long time around the world. </p>
