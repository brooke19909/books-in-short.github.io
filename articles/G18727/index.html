Reviews of tourists and vacationers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Near Gelendzhik is the famous resort village of Kabardinka.  The beaches, the reviews of which we summarize below, are generally very good in this area.  They stretched along the <span>Tsemess bay.</span>  The resort itself is located in a beautiful valley, smoothly descending to the sea waters.  The descent into the water here is quite gentle, not very deep.  Therefore, this area is very good for families who decide to relax with their children.  Now let's see what they say about this resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kabardinka beaches reviews" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/320779.jpg" width="313"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Kabardinka: beaches.</span>  Reviews about the rest in general </h2><p>  The local coast is not suitable for those who can not imagine themselves resting without lying on the sand.  The beaches in Kabardinka are mostly pebbles.  True, sometimes it is fine, like <span>coarse sand.</span>  Therefore, you should think carefully about which beach in Kabardinka to choose.  Of course, the most comfortable plot is located in the center of the village.  However, there are always people here, and especially in the midst of summer, there are extremely many.  Tourists who prefer privacy are offered to go to farther beaches.  There are many beautiful and almost uninhabited places that the Kabardinka region has.  The beaches whose reviews are most interesting in this regard are Victoria and the recreation area on Cape Doob.  In addition, those who wish to throw off everything in the literal and figurative sense, experienced holiday-makers advise the nudist coast.  It is as famous as the naturist <span>beaches of Koktebel.</span>  This is a very beautiful place, located among pine trees and juniper, and it is located to the left of Cape Doob, if you stand facing the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What beach in kabardinka" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/320773.jpg" width="313"></div>

Accessibility Reviews </h2><p>  Mostly bathing and sunbathing areas in this area are divided into so-called ‚Äúwild‚Äù belonging to various camps, boarding houses and bases.  Most tourists, regardless of whether they prefer proximity to nature or civilization, believe that the left the beach lies from the village, the cleaner the water and surroundings.  However, these places also have their own specifics - in the center of Kabardinka you can almost find sand, and pebbles at more distant places become larger and larger, until they turn into stones that can be scratched.  Therefore, if you are going there with children, know that you will have to choose between crowding and a good entrance to the water for the child or privacy, but discomfort for the baby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kabardinka vacation 2013 beaches" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/320781.jpg" width="313"></div>

    <h2>  What they say about cleanliness, infrastructure and entertainment </h2><p>  First of all, tourists claim that almost all the beaches of camps and pensions can be accessed freely and for free.  Of course, the closer the recreation area to the village, and the more people, the sea can be dirtier.  It also depends on the weather and storms.  <span>Kabardinka</span> was also popular last year <span>.</span>  <span>Rest-2013,</span> beaches and the sea were remembered by many travelers who left their reviews about it.  People write that even the central bathing area is very well-maintained, there are no mountains of garbage, and the village is beautiful and good for vacationers.  Here, right on the beach, you can not only have fun with various sports or have a cold drink, but also book all kinds of excursions: jeep safaris, ATV rides, visits to the cable car and so on.  In addition, there is always clean air, even in close proximity to the town.  And you can also have a snack mainly in the center - you have to take food with you to distant beaches.  In general, we can say that Kabardinka is somewhat reminiscent of Turkish resorts and does not at all resemble either Sochi or Anapa.  Its beaches are surrounded by pine trees, and while relaxing on the sea, you will experience a unique ‚Äúcocktail‚Äù of coniferous aromas and salty breezes. </p>
