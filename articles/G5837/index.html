    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists choose for themselves Star Beach Resort 2 *.  Reviews about it may contain the following positive points: </p><ul><li>  the linen is very clean and fresh (although, from constant washing, it turned a little gray); </li><li>  the beach is fairly close; </li><li>  paying 10 dollars, you can not wait for the checkout time, but immediately check into your room; </li><li>  the territory is quite clean and pleasant, with a garden and even an improvised tennis court; </li><li>  There are two swimming pools with clean water - it's nice to swim in them. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  A number of negative impressions are caused by guests at the Star Beach Resort 2 * hotel.  Reviews note the following points: </p><ul><li>  in all rooms of the hotel (and in rooms including) there is a persistent smell of poison for insects; </li><li>  at night, local tourists constantly make noise and debauchery in the hotel restaurant, and the employees do not react to it in any way; </li><li>  from early morning until late evening, a construction site is working near the hotel, which not only spoils the view and is a source of numerous garbage, but also creates noise, which prevents guests from resting; </li><li>  in spite of the fact that advertisements stated the presence of a refrigerator in the rooms, in most apartments it is faulty, but somewhere it doesn‚Äôt exist at all (you have to eat in a restaurant or take canned food that does not spoil); </li><li>  very modest breakfasts, moreover, they serve the same thing every day; </li><li>  for the entire period of stay in the room, bed linen has never been changed; </li><li>  almost all the sockets in the room are European, and the standard is only one, and even then a TV is connected to it; </li><li>  for using the safe you need to pay 1 dollar every day, in addition, you also need to independently acquire a lock to it; </li><li>  it‚Äôs very inconvenient that for cleaners you need to leave your key at the reception. </li></ul><p>  The main advantage of this resort hotel is its rather low price at its very favorable location.  Some 200 meters away is the beautiful Colva Beach, which is considered one of the most beautiful in all of Goa.  If you come to swim enough in the sea and get acquainted with local traditions, then the modest atmosphere of the hotel is unlikely to confuse you. </p>
