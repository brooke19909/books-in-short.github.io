Interesting ideas, sights and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Judging by Asian standards, Seoul is far from a province or a village, as many mistakenly believe.  This city is 600 years old.  During this time, a huge number of amazing sights were built in it, to which millions of tourists from around the world come to stare today. </p><p>  So what to see in Seoul?  There are a lot of options for building a route, so a beginner tourist who has arrived in Asia just has his eyes widened.  Fortunately, the Web has collected a large number of reviews about objects that will be of interest to adults and children.  Based on these data, you can make an approximate list of interesting places and attractions, where you need to go to Seoul. </p><h2>  Gyeongbokgung Palace </h2><p>  This castle is located in one of the park complexes of the city, which once belonged to one of the Korean rulers.  Entrance to the park will be about 3-4 dollars.  Finding a palace is easy.  It is located on a small island in the middle of a picturesque lake. </p><div class="photo" data-original="english.visitseoul.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gyeongbokgung Palace" class="if uuid-2542975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14550/2542975.jpg"></div><p>  Beautiful ceremonies are constantly held in front of the castle, during which the changing of the guard of Kenbokkun takes place.  As usual, the guards, dressed in the amazing beauty of their robes, are absolutely unperturbed and keep their cool.  Despite this, they are not against photographs with them.  Therefore, when deciding where to go in Seoul, you should definitely include a visit to this place in your schedule. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  National Museum </h2><p>  It consists of two buildings (a library and the museum itself), which are connected by a beautiful passage.  This is a huge building made of marble, so it looks rich and unusually beautiful.  Entrance to the museum is completely free.  Here you can study the history of Korea and the customs of this people.  If you are interested in this topic, then you should definitely visit this place, especially if this is your first time in the camp. </p><p>  Where to go in Seoul in order to dispel boredom later?  Indeed, many fear that an excursion in such a museum will be rather tedious.  This is only possible if you do not find an English-speaking guide.  In Korean, information will be quite difficult to perceive, even if a tourist knows it in the least. </p><h2>  Skyscraper 63 </h2><p>  Speaking about where to go in Seoul and what to see so that then there are amazing memories, you should definitely pay attention to this object.  This skyscraper has a height of about 250 meters, the Koreans consider it their calling card.  From the side it seems that this building is completely covered with gold.  Inside the skyscraper are numerous cinemas, restaurants, small shops.  It is also worth a visit to the observation deck.  This pleasure will cost $ 10. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.urbancapture.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Skyscraper 63" class="if uuid-2542978" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14550/2542978.jpg"></div><p>  In their reviews, many say that this is too high a fee for such entertainment.  The fact is that the observation deck is glazed, and the windows are often not quite clean.  Because of this, the impression of the panorama of the city may get a little spoiled.  Therefore, in order to get good pictures, it is better to go to the Seoul TV tower. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tv tower </h2><p>  This is the same attraction where you must go to Seoul.  She is the highest point in the city.  The TV tower is located on Namsan Hill.  Fortunately for tourists, you don‚Äôt have to climb the mountain yourself, since the funicular works in this place.  However, the cost of admission is also $ 10. </p><p>  Although this observation deck is also glazed, the ‚Äúimage quality‚Äù here is much better than from Skyscraper 63. Tourists can see the whole city and take great photos.  On the ground floor of the TV tower it is worth visiting a museum dedicated to teddy bears, it will be interesting to children.  Going down from the tower is necessary on foot. </p><h2>  Lotte world </h2><p>  When deciding where to go with children in Seoul, you should definitely pay attention to this amusement park.  The complex consists of two parts.  In the first of them is a huge enclosed area with numerous children's attractions.  There is also an ice rink, cafes and eateries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.habkorea.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lotte world" class="if uuid-2541525" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2541525.jpg"></div><p>  Another part of the complex is a recreated fairy tale in the open.  This sight will appeal not only to children, but also to adults.  There is a cartoon castle, and numerous doll houses, attractions and much more.  However, you need to be prepared for the fact that a ticket for visiting the entertainment complex will cost $ 40.  However, in this place you can spend the whole day.  However, this is not the only place to go with children in Seoul. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Everland </h2><p>  This amusement park is called Disneyland Korea.  It is open throughout almost the whole year.  All visitors are immersed in an unusual fairytale atmosphere.  However, in their reviews, many tourists note not only amazing entertainment, but also long lines for the most interesting attractions.  But if you come to the park on weekdays in the early morning, then this trouble can be avoided. </p><p>  The amusement park constantly hosts interesting and colorful shows.  Here you can find a huge number of restaurants with delicious food, small cafes and much more.  Parents are also invited to rent strollers for children, which can be found even in shopping malls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.11street.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Everland Park" class="if uuid-2541529" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2541529.jpg"></div><p>  When asked about where to go in Seoul, almost all tourists recommend paying attention to Korean Disneyland, which can be reached from any bus station.  Transportation to the amusement park takes about 1 hour. </p><h2>  Hangan </h2><p>  This is a city park located on the banks of the river of the same name, the length of which is more than 30 km.  However, most of all city residents and tourists love this place because there are absolutely no cars in it, there are only paths for cyclists and pedestrians.  So where to go in Seoul for adults and children?  You can have a great picnic on the banks of the Hangan River. </p><p>  Lawns in the park are carefully monitored.  In addition, tourists will be able to enjoy the amazingly beautiful landscape, and the children will play enough on numerous playgrounds.  In summer, the park has an outdoor pool with a capacity of 1200 people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="magazine.seoulselection.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hangan Park" class="if uuid-2541531" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2541531.jpg"></div><h2>  Promenade </h2><p>  It offers a beautiful view of the whole city.  It is interesting to walk along the promenade in the daytime, but with the onset of darkness it is completely transformed.  Therefore, if you still do not know where to go in Seoul in the evening, then you should definitely look here. </p><p>  In the evening, the promenade is filled with a huge number of tourists and residents.  Everywhere you can enjoy singing with a guitar and drink something strong.  However, no fights or inappropriate behavior are out of the question.  All visitors to the embankment are very polite, and respect others. </p><h2>  City Hall </h2><p>  Despite the administrative purpose of this building, anyone can visit it.  This building was built in a futuristic style and does not look like any other familiar structure of this type.  City Hall is built using numerous metal pipes and glass.  Inside, all of its rooms are entwined with living plants. </p><p>  In the city hall you can find a huge amount of interesting things.  For example, tourists will like interactive rooms, toilets have toilet bowls with remote controls.  Koreans are very creative, so they even prefer to use toilet paper using modern technology. </p><p>  If we talk about where to go in Seoul, then you should definitely look here.  At the city hall, literally everything is saturated with the technologies of the future.  This is the only place that can rightfully be called the construction of the 22nd century. </p><h2>  Kidzania </h2><p>  This is another amazing place for those traveling with children.  This is not just an entertainment complex, but the whole city, which has its own gas station and even an airport.  In "Kidzania" children can try any profession.  For example, work as a doctor, policeman or steward on an airplane.  If a child tries himself in the role of a firefighter, then he goes to a fictional fire in a real rescue vehicle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="worldtraveland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Kidzania" class="if uuid-2541533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2541533.jpg"></div><p>  For work, children are paid special money.  This currency acts on the territory of the city, so the baby will be able to buy something for himself on the received "salary".  If the child wishes, then he can put part of the money in the bank. </p><p>  However, you need to be prepared for the fact that in one day this fascinating place can not be avoided.  The queues will have to stand about 40 minutes, but it's worth it. </p><h2>  Deokpyeong Dinosaur Arboretum </h2><p>  Those who love dinosaurs should definitely look here.  This park will appeal to not only children, but also adults who are keen on ancient reptiles.  This complex is truly huge.  It presents life-size dinosaurs, so visitors can appreciate the greatness of the animals that inhabited our planet many millions of years ago.  Children will be delighted with photos with very realistic dinosaurs. </p><p>  In addition to stunning exhibits, the park has a large number of places where you can have a picnic.  Therefore, it is best to visit this park in spring or summer.  At this time, the most picturesque views open here. </p><p>  There are 2 indoor pavilions in the park, which show the full-length moving dinosaur models.  The exhibits not only move their limbs, but also make frightening sounds.  This looks very realistic and will appeal to children.  Too impressionable kids should be more careful, but usually even those little ones who are at first afraid of giant monsters, then cannot take their eyes off them and do not want to leave the park. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ggtour.or.kr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deokpyeong Dinosaur Arboretum" class="if uuid-2541550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2541550.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to dinosaurs, you can find exhibits of huge insects, predators, herbivores, snakes, birds and many other animals that, according to scientists, inhabited the Earth. </p><p>  The second pavilion is more fun.  A large number of living palm trees and tangerine trees are planted here, on which eggs of a model of smaller, flying dinosaurs hatch.  There are a lot of other entertainments in the park.  Here you can find many interactive models.  For example, one of the dinosaurs looks directly at people and watches their movements.  However, you need to be prepared for the fact that the park is almost 2 hours drive from the center of Seoul.  Therefore, it is worth taking everything necessary for the child on the road.  But this long journey is worth the emotions that tourists will receive in the amusement park.  If you don‚Äôt want to go far, you can find Kintex much closer to the city center.  This is another park with dinosaurs, but the models are much smaller in size, and the institution itself is not so exciting. </p><h2>  Minseokcheon </h2><p>  This is a small exhibition of the village-museum of ethnography, in which you can get acquainted with the traditions of Koreans.  In the reconstructed village more than 250 buildings of various purposes are presented.  In addition, thematic shows and entertainment programs await tourists, demonstrating how Koreans lived during the Joseon Dynasty. </p><p>  Minsokcheon is located at some distance from the center of Seoul, or rather in the nearby town of Yongin.  However, the village is very easy to find and reach by public transport, as it is very close to the Everland theme park.  The museum has an audio guide that speaks different languages, including English.  The most interesting thing is to visit the museum in small groups of 20 people.  In this case, there are more chances to participate in the entertainment programs offered to tourists. </p><p>  The question of where to go in Seoul (Korea) is very quickly decided by tourists.  Indeed, in this city there are a huge number of monuments, entertainment centers and much more.  There is something to do not only for adults, but also for children.  However, you need to understand that this unusual city and all its beauties will be difficult to get around in just one day. </p>
