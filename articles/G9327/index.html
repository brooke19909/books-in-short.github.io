    <h2>  The Culture of Ancient Egypt: Briefly about the Ancient Kingdom </h2><p>  This era is for Egypt a period of true prosperity - a golden age for the development of culture.  The greatest development is achieved by architecture, which is characterized by the features of monumentalism.  Most of the buildings are associated with a funeral cult.  The ancient Egyptians denied death.  They believed that the <span>soul of man</span> would certainly return to him.  Therefore, tombs were created, and the deceased were mummified.  Together with architecture, sculpture developed in the Ancient Kingdom.  She was inherent in some special techniques of the "Egyptian style", which are the main features of the culture of Ancient Egypt.  So, the hallmark of the sculptures was that they were created on tiles, which were covered on both sides with relief images of people.  In this case, the face and shoulders were depicted in front, and the legs and head in profile.  Famous plate of Pharaoh Narmer.  Its height is 64 meters.  On it, in addition to relief pictures, there are hieroglyphic inscriptions telling about the personality of the one whose image is carved on the stove.  By the way, in the era of the Old Kingdom, writing was finally formed, a sheet of papyrus was invented, and an account system was created.  Writing in Egypt was mainly taught by priests and scribes, who kept an account on the household, and sculptors.  Another feature is the perfect symmetry of the figures shown. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="art and culture of ancient egypt" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/315093.jpg" width="473"></div>

In this era begins the construction of temples for the <span>Egyptian gods,</span> who are depicted either in the form of people, or half-animals, half-humans.  The temples not only served religious purposes, but were also considered administrative institutions, which only priests - priests had access to.  The supreme god is Ra - the god of the sun, and Pharaoh was considered the son of the sun.  If before that funeral structures were mainly built, then in the Middle Kingdom sacred temples were created along with them, decorated with giant columns, obelisks, and chic decor elements.  The most grandiose was the temple of Amenemkhet III, which was later called the Greek Labyrinth.  The architecture of this period includes the legendary <span>pyramid of Cheops, the</span> Sphinx and others. The art and culture of Ancient Egypt in this era also developed in other directions.  For example, there is a flowering of fiction.  Perhaps the first novel in the world was written - ‚ÄúThe History of Sinukhet‚Äù, and the story ‚ÄúConversation of the Disappointed with His Soul‚Äù is a real philosophical treatise on pessimism, disappointment and faith.  Here it is such a mysterious and amazing culture of Ancient Egypt. </p>

    <h2>  Briefly about the New Kingdom </h2><p>  During this period, the art of relief improved.  On the walls of temples using this technique depicts the whole history of Egypt.  Hatshepsut Temple, located in Deir al-Bahri, has survived to this day.  The relief images adorning the walls of the temple are so realistic that they unwittingly plunge into the past.  The most valuable examples of sculptures of this period that have come down to us are the works of the sculptor Tutmes - portraits of the pharaoh Akhenaten and his legendary wife Nefertiti.  As for literature, in the New Kingdom it becomes multi-genre.  The Book of the Dead, belonging to this period, is considered the religious encyclopedia of the time.  Among the "masterpieces" of secular literature, one can name the fairy tale "On Two Brothers", as well as works related to love lyrics - "songs for the delight of hearts." </p>
