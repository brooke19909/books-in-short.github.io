    <p>  There are several modes of using such a device: </p><ul><li>  When a tag search is always carried out. </li><li>  For a one-time tag search when disarming for the first time.  No more tag searches will be performed. </li><li>  Service mode, when even during the repair process in the service center it will not be noticeable that a mobilizer is installed. </li></ul><p>  In addition to the mobilizer, you can install the hood lock from Starline.  Such an electromechanical device works in parallel with the mobilizer, preventing the lock from unlocking without the permission of the owner. </p><p>  A full security complex consists of: </p><ul><li>  security system; </li><li>  mobilizer; </li><li>  hood lock. </li></ul><p>  You can also use search beacons M15 and M17 from Starline.  The M15 is an autonomous beacon, a search device that helps locate a missing vehicle.  It is used to monitor to track the speed and direction of the car on the map. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to set autostart on starline" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2000710.jpg"></div>

    <p>  After a short press, the cursor moves to the desired icon. </p><h2>  Autostart features </h2><p>  The list of programmable functions: </p><ul><li>  A mode that allows you to autostart from the alarm clock. </li><li>  By timer - a type of periodic start-up with an interval of 2 to 24 hours, depending on the need for choice. </li><li>  By temperature - if the engine begins to exceed the set threshold in temperature indicators.  Then it will warm up in automatic mode. </li><li>  Anti-theft mode. </li><li>  Turbo - to maintain engine performance for a certain period of time after the ignition is turned off.  Suitable for the car in which the turbine is installed. </li><li>  Auto - automatic security activation 10 seconds after all doors are closed. </li><li>  Mobilizer mode - blocking after turning off the ignition. </li></ul><h2>  Key Fob Button Sequence </h2><p>  With a long press on the unit and short on the deuce, the silent protection mode starts. </p><p>  Pressing buttons 1-3 will enable autorun.  If you press 3 again, you can extend the time. </p><p>  How to enable autostart on "Starline"?  By simultaneously pressing the buttons 1 and 2, the ‚ÄúAnti-robbery‚Äù mode is activated </p><p>  If you simultaneously press buttons 1 and 3, the key fob itself is blocked, and after pressing buttons 2 and 3 this function is disabled.  After a long press on button 3, you can set the time on the alarm, activate or deactivate the timer. </p><h2>  We program key rings </h2><p>  How to configure autostart on the Starline alarm?  A new keychain must be programmed.  On one car, you can get no more than 4 trinkets.  Locate the protrusion of the service button in the vehicle interior and press it seven times when the ignition is off. </p><p>  After turning it on, a seven-time signal will sound.  Using the key fob, press buttons 2 and 3 while holding them, and this device will be programmed.  If it is lost and you need to activate the security mode when the ignition is on and the door is open, press the protrusion of the service button 3 times, turning off the ignition.  Alarm will beep. </p><p>  After you close the door, the system will lock after 20 seconds.  This is a very useful feature in the event of a keyring loss.  Knowing how to enable autorun on Starline A91, you can program several key fobs. </p><h2>  How to program security and service functions </h2><p>  There are standard tables - instructions on how to set autorun to Starline.  For example, function 9 allows you to turn off the alarm without a key fob.  This is an algorithm that allows you to learn how to disable autorun on Starline in an emergency way without a personal code, with a one-digit, two-digit and four-digit code.  When choosing options with a set of personal code on the key fob, the inscription "Pin-code" is displayed. </p><p>  To enter the programming menu 1, you need to press the service button for 5 times, then the ignition is turned on.  Wait for a five-time signal.  Press 9 times.  This will be a hint on how to enable autostart so that the Starline A91 alarm starts working.  After 10 seconds, you will need to press button 3. This will read the result on the display.  A two-digit pin code is now activated. </p><p>  You can discard all factory settings by pressing the button responsible for the service nine times, turning on the ignition and waiting for 9 siren signals.  After pressing button 1, all factory settings will be reset. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  When the cold weather comes, many drivers are interested in turning on a system such as remote engine startup or starting in accordance with temperature indicators. </p><p>  Starline alarms can cope with this function provided that such a system is correctly installed and configured. </p><p>  For many motorists, information is not available regarding the inclusion and configuration of the autostart of their vehicle.  There are several reasons for this - a new or rented car. </p><p>  After reading the article, you can easily ensure that the engine starts automatically using the Starline alarm system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ak enable autostart on alarm starline a91" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60199/2000484.jpg" width="600"></div>
