  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Most Unusual Hotels of the World</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Brazilian Ariau Amazon Towers Lodge is hardly worth recommending to people who are afraid of heights.  The thing is that this high-rise building, located on the banks of the Amazon, is somehow incomprehensibly sandwiched between the crowns of huge trees.  It‚Äôs better not to look down, because there are several tens of meters to the ground. <br><br>  Clients reach their rooms by swinging ladders and mounted bridges, holding onto the handrails tightly.  To encourage certain daredevils, the administration issues officially confirmed documents to them, indicating the number of ascents and descents.  For example, <noindex>  <span>Prague hotels</span> </noindex>  do not own such information.  The hotel consists of several towers.  Well-known politicians (including heads of state), stars of show business and oligarchs often stop at this magnificent hotel. <br>  Of course, they are not at all afraid of serious prices.  Service is quite adequate prices.  The interiors are made in ethnic style.  The staff is fluent in several European languages.  A varied cuisine, there are swimming pools and Internet cafes, which also soar over the great South American river. <br><br>  And now we will direct our stops to the underground hotel in Australia.  About 20 years ago, the Desert Cave Hotel opened in the town of Coober Pedy.  He is still considered a bold innovation.  True, it is designed for lovers.  And yet, in the 40-degree heat, anyone will be happy to feel the pleasant coolness in such underground apartments.  19 rooms provide an opportunity for people tired of the heat to sleep and relax.  And then you can eat and drink, read or sit on the Internet.  In general, we have before us something like a sanatorium, in which the schedule is not very strict. <br><br>  The Japanese Benesse House Museum Hotel is designed for aesthetes who want to immerse themselves in harmony and silence.  Designing this oasis, designers have surpassed themselves.  There is a noble combination of steel, concrete, glass and stone.  The vast territory is decorated with stylish sculptural compositions, examples of landscape architecture in the style of minimalism.  Tired workaholics who are fed up <noindex>  <span>Phuket hotels</span> </noindex>  , the hotel has all the conditions for a comfortable stay alone.  Customers do not see almost any of the staff, because the perfect service seems to be provided by itself.  For leisurely walks, they are offered secluded routes.  Therefore, the relaxation is wonderful. </p></div></article>
