  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dimensions iPhone 6. iPhone 6: specifications, prices, photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The head of the multi-billion dollar Apple company Timothy Cook has finally introduced the world to his new brainchild, the name of which is iPhone 6. Contrary to criticism of ill-wishers, the product turned out to be impressive from any point of view.  In evidence of this, we can cite a number of main characteristics of the iPhone 6. </p><h2>  Case Dimensions </h2><p>  At the time of Steve Jobs, <span>Apple phones</span> were available with a diagonal of not more than 3.5 inches.  The old staff of engineers considered such dimensions optimal.  However, with the advent of Tim Cook, design trends have changed.  Last year, the iPhone 5S series received a diagonal case 4 inches.  This was a surprise to all fans of the product.  Numerous thankful reviews immediately followed, but there were also dissatisfied users who believed that Apple was losing its identity in this way.  The dimensions of the iPhone 6 surprised the public even more.  The new brainchild of Apple received a diagonal of 4.7 inches.  The ratio of width and length is standard - almost 1 to 2 (67 by 138 mm).  However, the thickness was only 6.9 mm with a net weight of 129 g. Despite the notoriously impressive dimensions, the iPhone 6 turned out to be quite compact and convenient to use with one hand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-656220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/656220.jpg?1539788575"></div><p>  The case design has not undergone significant changes.  The main difference from older models was the upper frame.  She even with the naked eye seems superfluous.  As you know, the Apple engineering team prefers symmetry.  It‚Äôs good that at least the side frames were slightly reduced.  In any case, there is a potential for narrowing the model in height and width.  In appearance, the new model is very similar to the <span>iPod Touch</span> due to the rounding of the edges of the case and volume keys.  The power button is moved to the right side.  The material of which the case is made is solid metal and high-strength plastic.  Externally, the phone looks rustic, and the camera lens is uncomfortably pushed forward.  There is no announced dust and water protection.  But the new model passed all the tests of independent experts for flexibility and strength. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Screen specifications </h2><p>  Compared with previous models, the new phone has a beautiful stylish display with a protective glass and <span>an oleophobic coating.</span>  When creating, an IPS matrix was used, which allows you to display an image with additional brightness and natural color reproduction.  It is worth noting the maximum viewing angle of the iPhone 6. <span>The</span> diagonal <span>screen size</span> is 12 cm (4.7 inches).  Available resolution (pix) - 1334 x 750. We must pay tribute to the engineers and the quality of the display.  Previously, iPhones had up to 300 pixels per inch, now this figure is 326. The display even got its name - RetinaHD.  On the other hand, the iPhone 6 has the same screen size as the LG G3, but the latter has a much better display depth (up to 534 ppi versus 326). </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-656221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/656221.jpg?1539788575"></div><p>  In defense of the phone, we can say that according to the general characteristics, the display of the new iPhone is confidently in second place after the G3.  In addition, scientists calculated that at a distance of more than 25 cm, the human eye is not able to perceive an increase in the number of pixels greater than 300 per inch. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The iPhone 6 specifications can not but rejoice.  The phone‚Äôs hardware arsenal includes a 64-bit A8 series processor with two peer-to-peer cores that operate at a frequency of 1.4 GHz.  Also, the sixth iPhone contains a universal accelerator.  The coprocessor of motion of the M8 series acts as it.  As for RAM, by default it is only 1 GB.  Despite the obviously modest characteristics, the phone is high-performance.  This result is achieved due to the distribution of processor power on a separate functional.  Thanks to this, the iPhone 6 is comparable in speed of solving problems with the latest 4-core models of the brands LG and Samsung.  It will not be superfluous to highlight the PowerVR GX6450 series graphics processor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Memory features </h2><p>  According to this indicator, the phone can be divided into budget and advanced options.  In the economy version of the iPhone 6, the memory characteristics are much lower.  The maximum capacity is only 16 GB.  The rest of the device will please fans with internal memory from 64 to 128 GB.  It is worth noting that there is no option with 32 GB.  Manufacturers decided to abandon it for the sake of more expensive versions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-656222" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/656222.jpg?1539788575"></div><p>  Unfortunately, the new iPhone also does not have a microSD slot.  So you don‚Äôt have to dream of an additional memory card.  Therefore, before buying, you need to decide for yourself which version of the phone to give preference to.  The hit of sales was the iPhone 6 with a memory capacity of 64 GB. </p><h2>  Camera features </h2><p>  Before the release of the new model, Apple representatives warned that users should not expect an increase in the number of megapixels.  The phone has an 8 MP camera.  Like previous versions, the iPhone 6 has a dual LED backlight.  It is worth noting the lack of an optical system responsible for image stabilization.  Despite the fact that the dimensions of the iPhone 6 are quite impressive, the only camera looks stylish and capacious, albeit a little advanced.  It allows you to get a video picture with a resolution of up to FullHD at a recording speed of 60 frames / sec.  Sound is received in mono mode. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-656223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/656223.jpg?1539788575"></div><p>  Experts say that one of the main advantages of the iPhone 6 is high-definition photo and video.  The camera allows you to record stream up to 240 frames / sec.  in 720p format.  There is a slow motion mode.  As for the <span>front camera,</span> it has only 1.2 MP. </p><h2>  Interfaces &amp; Multimedia </h2><p>  Apple's new product supports not only Bluetooth, GPS and 2-band Wi-Fi, but also an NFC wireless network.  In fact, the phone is able to interact with any interface, including A2DP and Voice-over-LTE.  In addition, the iPhone 6 supports Nano-SIM cards.  As for the NFC system, so far it is used only for payments, but improvements are expected in the near future.  As in previous models, the iOS 6 is embedded in the sixth iPhone. Its engine is focused on integration with the iTunes service.  Therefore, playback of multimedia material taken from a computer may cause problems.  The developers of the phone expect that its users will abruptly begin to buy all the music and movies from iTunes. </p><h2>  Internet features </h2><p>  The iPhone 6 has a dedicated browser.  Its advantages include speed and ease of use.  A reading mode is integrated in the browser, in which all kinds of menus, banners and advertisements are hidden, and only text with pictures remains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-656224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/656224.jpg?1539788575"></div><p>  On the other hand, manufacturers did not try to do multiple page scaling.  If the text is manually greatly enlarged, it will go beyond the display on the sides.  The browser only supports a fixed page size, under which it sets the text.  But the device has a 3D graphics accelerator and synchronization with Safari and iCloud. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The weakest point of the phone is its battery.  In terms of battery life, it is significantly inferior to its main competitors.  <span>The battery capacity</span> is only 1810 mAh, despite the increased diagonal size.  iPhone 6 in call and idle mode lasts about 55 hours.  At maximum load, the charge lasts only 400 minutes.  Battery life also depends on the brightness of the display and the gadgets turned on.  The average battery life of the device is up to 45 hours. </p><h2>  Cost of iPhone 6 </h2><p>  The price of the device depends on its version.  The budget option costs about 54 thousand rubles.  In addition to the phone itself, the package includes a USB cable, <span>a</span> 5 W <span>power adapter</span> and Apple EarPods branded headphones with a built-in microphone and remote control.  The standard version of the device is estimated at 62 thousand rubles.  Options are similar to the budget option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-656225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/656225.jpg?1539788575"></div><p>  The above prices apply only to the iPhone 6 with integrated memory of 16 GB.  If you wish, you can purchase a device with chips for 64 and 128 GB, but they will have to pay more for 8 and 16 thousand rubles, respectively.  Of the additional accessories, book covers can be distinguished.  The most popular of them is the Puro Booklet Case, whose cost is 990 rubles.  The price of the protective film depends on the strength and coating.  Bestseller - glossy film Deppa.  Its cost is about 300 rubles. </p><p>  Read more at <noindex>  <span>Mob-os.ru</span> </noindex>  . </p>
