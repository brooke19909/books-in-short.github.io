    <h2>  A look into the past </h2><p>  The plan, on which streets were marked, which were soon to appear in the village of Novo-Nikolaevsk, was developed back in 1896.  This avenue was already present on this plan.  In the same year, a clearing was cut for the construction of the street.  Until the 20th year of the last century, the main street of Novosibirsk was called not Red, but Nikolaevsky Avenue.  Renamed it after the revolution.  On the one hand, red is the color of the revolution, and on the other hand, the  red ‚Äôhas long been synonymous with the adjective  beautiful‚Äô.  This avenue begins from the embankment of the Ob, and then literally passes through the whole city - from south to north.  The length of the Red Avenue is almost seven kilometers!  Many are interested in the question of in which <span>area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNovosibirsk</span> Krasny Prospekt.  He immediately stretched to two areas of the city - Central and Zaeltsovsky. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  In addition to the large number of stops of trolleybuses, buses and minibuses, there are four metro stations on Krasniy Prospekt of Novosibirsk at once: the station of the same name with the avenue, Zaeltsovskaya, Gagarinskaya, and Ploshchad Lenina.  It is important to note that freight traffic is prohibited on this avenue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Attractions on the main street of Novosibirsk </h2><p>  For good reason, the avenue is called a huge open-air museum.  There are many monuments, buildings that can tell the story of the city.  This is the building where the art museum is located today, and previously the revolutionary committee of Siberia was located, and the stock-apartment building, known to many.  It is on Red Avenue that the city opera and ballet theater, medical university, Alexander Nevsky Cathedral are located.  We offer to go on a virtual trip along the avenue and get acquainted with its sights! </p><h2>  Apartment house </h2><p>  In the 30s of the last millennium, the construction of the most comfortable house was planned on the main street of Novosibirsk.  The apartments in it were supposed to belong to officials.  The development of the elite house project was entrusted to the ardent admirer of French neoclassicism Andrei Kryachkov.  Maslennikov became an assistant architect.  There are still rumors among historians and architects that Kryachkov prepared three versions of the new building in the Siberian capital at once.  Joseph Stalin got acquainted with the work of the architect, but forgot to specify which of the three projects he liked more.  Since no one dared to clarify this detail, the house combined all the best solutions from the projects.  Is this true or just an urban legend?  There is no answer to this question.  But there is an amazing house, the only object of historical and architectural heritage in this region.  At the same time, people live in this house today! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  To erect this house on the Red Avenue of the city of Novosibirsk, the architect had to literally redraw the entire area, to demolish many structures built before the revolution.  By the standards of that harsh time, the house turned out to be truly chic.  The apartments even provided rooms for servants! </p><p>  An interesting fact - in fact, there are not 100 apartments in the house, but 110. True, today 10 apartments are occupied by a kindergarten, the rest are residential. </p><h2>  Chapel of St. Nicholas </h2><p>  In July 1914, construction began on a chapel in the name of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker in Novosibirsk.  It was erected in honor of the centenary of the Romanov Dynasty, which was widely celebrated in 1913.  A petition for the construction of the chapel was made by the charitable society "Nursery" headed by the chairman (and at the same time archpriest of the Intercession Church) Diomid Chernyavsky and the head of the shelter "Nursery" Vostokova.  Permission was obtained in October 1913.  The author of the apartment building Andrei Dmitrievich Kryachkov worked on the project, by the way, completely free of charge.  Finances for the construction were allocated by the city authorities, responded to the call to help the church and the townspeople.  The construction was completed in 1914.  In December, the solemn consecration of this chapel on the Red Avenue in Novosibirsk took place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Initially, the chapel was assigned to the church of Alexander Nevsky, but soon became an independent parish.  The subsequent history of the sanctuary is very sad - the revolution, a new ideology, the declaration of religion as an opium for the people ... In 1929, residents of the city turned to the Novosibirsk district executive committee with a request to demolish the stronghold of religious dope.  Of course, the new authorities satisfied the petition of the townspeople.  The chapel was demolished, and all church utensils and jewelry were borrowed - "for the needs of the revolution."  At the site of the destroyed chapel, a monument to the Komsomol member appeared, and then a <span>monument to Stalin.</span> </p><p>  But everything returns to its place.  In September 1991, a religious procession and the laying of the first stone in the base of the restored chapel took place in the city.  They did not begin to build a chapel in the same place, they chose a new one - the center of Krasny Prospekt.  The construction was completed in 1993.  Today here are the relics of St. Panteleimon and, of course, Nicholas the Wonderworker. </p>

    <h2>  Alexander Nevsky Cathedral </h2><p>  Another shrine is located on the main street of Novosibirsk - Alexander Nevsky Cathedral.  It was built in honor of Emperor Alexander III.  Construction began in 1897, completed in 1899.  To this day, information has not reached who was the author of the cathedral project.  Someone is inclined to the fact that it was designed by the architect K. Lygin, who at that time held the position of architect in the management of the Central Siberian Railway.  Someone claims that the author of the project is N. Solovyov.  And to someone it seems that the architects Prussak and Kosyakov were involved in this.  Despite the differences, everyone is convinced that the St. Petersburg Church of the Mother of God was taken as the basis.  Enormous help in the construction of the temple was provided by the royal family - the diocese was given a plot for free, members of the royal family donated icons, vestments of the priest and deacon, various church utensils, donated funds for the construction of the iconostasis. </p>

    <p>  Consecrated the cathedral in late 1899.  And already in 1915 this temple received the status of a cathedral.  But hard times came for the cathedral too - in 1938 it was closed, then the bell tower was destroyed.  At different times, the design institute and newsreel studio found refuge in the building located on the main street of Novosibirsk.  The Russian Orthodox Church was returned to the building only in 1989.  The nineties were marked by large-scale work - the restoration began here.  Workers and artists managed to return the cathedral to its original appearance! </p><h2>  The sculpture "Happiness is under construction" </h2><p>  On Red Avenue is a sculptural composition called "Happiness is under construction."  It was opened in the summer of 2006.  What is an art object?  This is a pair of nesting storks.  According to popular beliefs, storks bring not only children, but also great happiness.  Therefore, in Russia everyone sought to attract these large and beautiful birds to their home.  In August 2006, the storks flew to Krasniy Prospekt Novosibirsk not by accident: this year was dedicated to the family.  Since then, newlyweds and lovers are constantly gathering at the touching monument.  By the way, there is a legend in the city that is associated with the composition.  According to her, it is necessary to throw a coin in the bird's nest.  If she lingers at least briefly, one can prepare for replenishment in the family. </p>

    <h2>  The building of the government of the Novosibirsk region and the administration of the governor </h2><p>  This building appeared in the city in 1932.  Andrei Kryachkov, already familiar to you, took part in creating the project.  For the building, a style such as constructivism was chosen, which can be described in just three words - conciseness, solidity, rigor.  The fact is that the new post-revolutionary system distanced itself from everything that was before, including architecture.  In order to increase the role of architecture, the constructivists decided to abandon the excessive amount of decorative elements.  They looked for expressiveness in the dynamics of simple structures, the functionality of the structure. </p>

    <h2>  Opera and Ballet Theatre </h2><p>  Among the symbols of Novosibirsk located on Krasniy Prospekt are the Opera and Ballet Theater.  It was opened in 1945.  The construction of this unique architectural complex lasted for 14 years!  The theater building is simply amazing with its incredible scale - its area exceeds 11 thousand square meters.  The peculiarity of the structure is its huge dome, magnificent construction without trusses and buttresses. </p><p>  In 2005, the reconstruction of the theater was completed.  Today it is considered the most modernly equipped theater in the Russian Federation.  The large hall can accommodate 1,174 people, the concert hall - 375, and the small - 130 spectators.  Over the entire history of the Novosibirsk Theater, more than three and a half hundred ballet and opera performances have been staged on its stage.  In his troupe - national and honored artists, diplomats and laureates of various competitions and festivals (both Russian and international). </p>

    <h2>  Monument to the Heroes of Peace </h2><p>  In the summer of 2015, a new monument dedicated to those who save people appeared on the Red Avenue and Derzhavin Street in Novosibirsk.  The monument was timed to coincide with the Day of Fire Protection of the region, the 70th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War and the 25th anniversary of the Ministry of Emergencies.  The author of the monument is Salavat Shcherbakov, the national artist of Russia. </p><p>  The sculpture is a fireman figure made of bronze.  Firefighter makes in the arms of a child.  Tongues of flame covering the monument are made of red granite.  By the way, flowers often lie at this monument - residents and visitors of Novosibirsk come here to pay tribute to the heroes of peacetime. </p>

    <h2>  Commemorative Tram Sign </h2><p>  November 26, 1934 in the capital of Siberia was launched the movement of trams.  The very first route ran from the railway station to the center of Novosibirsk.  The length of the line was a little over four kilometers.  75 years later, in November 2006, on the Red Avenue (on Lenin Square) in the place where tram tracks once passed, a memorial sign was opened. </p>

    <p>  This sign is difficult to notice from afar, because it is a small stretch of road lined with paving stones.  A section of old rails is mounted in the paving stones.  There is also a cast-iron stove on which information about this place is located.  By the way, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating this unique commemorative sign belongs to the Novosibirsk organizations Siblitmash and Gorelektrotransport.  Local authorities also took part in the creation of the facility.  It is worth noting that tram traffic is still an important part of the entire transport infrastructure of the city. </p>
