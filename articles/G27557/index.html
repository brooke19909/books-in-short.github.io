The founders of the Roman Empire and the Eternal City itself are two brothers, whose fate is very unusual.  From the course of school history, we know that a city on seven hills was laid by some Romulus and Remus, the boys whom they wanted to kill in their infancy.  However, the gods intervened in the game of human passions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="who were brought up by Romulus and Remus" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/307381.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <p>  Who was brought up by Romulus and Remus?  Who are they?  These are the descendants of the legendary king Askania from the Aeneas dynasty, who founded the city of Alba Long.  Traditions say that one ruler, Prokas, had two sons - Numitor and Amulius.  The throne was supposed to go to Numitor, but his brother, having envied, treacherously overthrew him from the throne.  Soon, the daughter of the deposed sovereign, vestal Ray Sylvia, gave birth to twins.  This was unheard of and the woman was punished, because for breaking the vow of chastity she was sentenced to death.  The father of Romulus and Remus proclaimed the god of Mars, but this did not save the unfortunate from the persecution of Amulius.  The girl was starved to death, and the children were thrown into <span>the Tiber River.</span> </p><p>  The story of Romulus and Remus was supposed to end there, but they were not in vain divine babies.  Water carried the basket with the children under the Palatine Hill, where it caught on a <span>fig tree.</span>  A wolf came to the cry of hungry boys, and she fed them with her milk.  However, the she-wolf was not the only animal by whom Romulus and Remus were raised.  When the wolf cubs drank all the milk, the <span>woodpecker, a bird</span> dedicated to Mars, helped the children.  He brought wild berries and fruits, which helped them to avoid starvation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="who brought up Romulus and Remus" class="if" height="463" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/307380.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Once a royal shepherd named Favstool saw how animals feed their children in the thicket.  After waiting for the departure of the she-wolf and woodpecker, he took the twins home, because he did not have children with his wife.  Therefore, the question of who raised Romulus and Remus, we can safely answer that they grew up in a simple family.  Both youths, having matured, proved to be leaders, but nobody knew about their origin.  During a fight between the shepherds Numitor and Amulius, the brothers were seized and brought to their grandfather.  Hearing the story that the twins heard from Faustulus, he recognized their grandchildren in them.  Together, they developed a plan to overthrow Amulius and put it into practice.  But after the throne was taken by their grandfather, the brothers did not want to stay in the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the story of Romulus and Remus" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/307379.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In fact, it is not so important who Romulus and Remus were brought up with, how it matters what they did next.  Returning to where they ate the milk of the she-wolf, the brothers founded the city.  The name was given to him by Rome, by the name of one of them to whom the sign of the gods was sent from above.  Romulus plowed one furrow around the Palatine, outlining the borders of the village.  To attract settlers, the ruler declares the capitol grove a refuge for all.  This attracted runaway slaves, robbers and other criminals, the city grew and became powerful.  Romulus wisely ruled his city, cleverly lured women here, expanded its borders.  According to legend, the king disappeared during one holiday: the gods took him to him. </p><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear who brought up Romulus and Remus, the founders of the greatest city in the history of the world. </p>
