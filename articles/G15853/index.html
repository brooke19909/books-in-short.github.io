Once upon a time, summer residences were built here by members of the royal family and even personally ruling monarchs, as well as their close and simply noble and wealthy people.  Many parks and palaces have survived to this day.  Sights of Pushkin annually attract a large number of tourists.  What exactly is worth seeing in this city in the first place? </p><h2>  Catherine Park and the Palace </h2>

The real gem of the complex is the Grand Catherine Palace and the adjacent <span>green zone.</span>  The construction of the residence was started in 1717, it was supposed to be a gift for the wife of Peter I Ekaterina Alekseevna.  The palace took on a modern look after perestroika under the guidance of the famous architect F. B. Rastrelli.  The mistress of the renewed residence was Empress Elizabeth Petrovna.  In the future, the palace remained loved by all subsequent generations of the royal family.  Pushkin <span>(Leningrad Region)</span> has a variety of <span>attractions</span> .  But it is the Catherine Palace that is the most luxurious and interesting of them.  Today, here you can see the restored interiors, including the famous Amber Room, as well as genuine personal items and household items of the royal people.  Around the palace there is a park with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 100 hectares.  On its territory you can see exquisite sculptures, pavilions and other buildings.

The exposition is located in the one-story house of A.K. Kitaeva, the widow of the court valet.  Here Pushkin spent the whole summer with his wife Natalya Nikolaevna in 1813.  Tourists interested in the life and work of the Sun of Russian poetry can visit the memorial Lyceum Museum.  In the educational institution founded by Alexander I, A.S. Pushkin spent the whole 6 years.  Other Pushkin sights associated with the poet who gave the city its name: the historical and literary museum and the monument to Alexander Sergeyevich.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pushkin St. Petersburg sights" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1102896.jpg"></div>  Pushkin is a city of parks and palaces.  The Catherine Palace and Park Ensemble is adjoined by another, once luxurious Babolovsky Garden, which once housed the original Gothic palace built for G. A. Potemkin.  To date, only the ruins of the chic residence of His Serene Highness Prince of Tauride have remained.  But even in this form, the palace deserves attention.  In its central hall, the King Bath was installed - a huge bathhouse carved from a single granite monolith.  It is said that this thicket has been perfectly preserved to this day.  The Tsar-bath is unique in its size and manufacturing method, only the city of Pushkin can be proud of such a rarity.  The sights of Babolovsky Park are also some miraculously preserved buildings on its territory.  The very territory of the green zone today looks neglected and resembles a mixed forest.

    <h2>  Other sights of the city </h2><p>  If you come to Pushkin for a few days, you will probably want to see something else, except for the most important, iconic sights.  Visit the ‚ÄúTsarskoye Selo collection‚Äù - the art museum, the House-Museum of P. P. Chistyakov.  Not so long ago, an exhibition dedicated to Anna Akhmatova appeared in the city.  The city of Pushkin (St. Petersburg) has sights not only of a cultural and secular type.  There is also an old church, today restored and functioning.  This is the temple of the Icon of the Mother of God ‚ÄúSign‚Äù, founded in 1734 and originally consecrated in 1747. </p><h2>  City Pushkino (Moscow region) </h2>

And the number of streets and thoroughfares named after the great poet simply cannot be counted.  Probably they are in all cities.  In the suburbs there is also a settlement with a similar name - Pushkino.  It is a small and cozy green city.  Interestingly, here, as well as in St. Petersburg Pushkin, tourists regularly come.  The sights of Pushkino in the Moscow region are mainly summer houses of famous writers.  Here Tyutchev, Mayakovsky, Stanislavsky, Demyan Poor rested and worked.  Many estates today are restored and accept tourists as house museums.  The Museum of Local Lore, the sculptures of Krylov, Pushkin and Mayakovsky, as well as the Memorial to the soldiers who died during the Second World War, are also of interest.
