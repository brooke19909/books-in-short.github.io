Its final formation took place during the reign of Klisfen.  It was he who struck at the dominant tribal nobility.  He actually redid <span>the</span> Athenian <span>government</span> .  As a result of his transformations, a democratic society was formed.  Solon also made a significant contribution to the structure of the political system.

    <h2>  The situation at the beginning of the VI century BC.  e. </h2><p>  She was quite complicated.  The free population was gradually stratified.  This process was due to the development of commodity-money circulation.  In a free environment, contradictions began to arise between the impoverished and wealthy eupatriates.  The former still held power.  The stratum of the rich from artisans, traders and landowners stood out.  They sought power, using the discontent of small and medium-sized owners, as well as representatives of the poor.  To mitigate the contradictions and unite all the free into one dominant layer, radical transformations were required.  Their beginning was laid by Solon, an archon, who was elected in 594 BC.  e.  The main goal of his transformations was to reconcile the interests of the existing warring associations of the free.  Thanks to his activities, Athenian land cleared of debt obligations.  From the previous constitution, he retained only a certain part of the provisions.  And everything else was canceled. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Solon paid special attention to law.  So, citizenship was granted to foreigners who settled in Attica with property and families.  The entire population as a whole was divided into 4 classes.  Inequality was compensated by the distribution of taxes.  The last class was completely exempted from payments.  Representatives of the remaining classes held the respective posts and paid to file according to their condition.  The rights of citizens corresponded to their rank.  Solon also proclaimed an amnesty.  Farewell to all but the murderers and traitors.  By his actions, he tried to combine justice and power.  Reigning democracy has existed for three centuries.  And during this time, I never had to repeat what Solon did.  However, this does not mean that there was no need for transformations.  Over the years, there have been new changes in Attica's life.  Klisfen's reforms were of great importance for the political and social system. </p>

    <h2>  Change of power </h2><p>  The history of <span>Ancient Athens is</span> very eventful.  After the death of Pisistratus, power passed to his sons: Hipparchus and Hippus.  However, the first devoted himself to art and literature.  Hippias was engaged in state affairs.  The regime under Pisistratus became stern.  In 514 BC  a conspiracy arose in Athenian aristocratic society.  His goal was to eliminate tyranny.  Two conspirators - Aristogiton and Garmdiy - an attempt was made to crack down on the rulers at the festival.  However, they managed to kill only Hipparchus.  Hippus, the survivor, brought down cruel repressions on opponents.  At that time, many Athenians had to leave their homeland.  The memory of Aristogiton and Harmody was long revered by the Democrats. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Foreign policy situation </h2><p>  The position occupied by Hippias was rather complicated.  It was accompanied by foreign policy difficulties.  By the year 519 BC  e.  Plathea, a Boeotian border town, was attached to Athens.  The result was a break with the Thebans.  At the same time, Argos, a longtime ally of Pisistratus, was greatly weakened.  But the hostile Sparta, on the contrary, strengthened and strengthened its position.  Among other things, Athens lost control of the straits that passed into the possession of the Achaemenids. </p><h2>  Complication of the situation </h2><p>  The leaders of the trade and craft societies and the clan nobility resisted the power of the Pisistratids.  The opponents of the brothers had the support of the aristocratic circles of Sparta, as well as the <span>Delphic oracles,</span> who had a great influence.  In 510 BC  the Spartans broke into the city and drove out Hippus. </p>

    <h2>  Power struggle </h2><p>  After the expulsion of Hippia, a confrontation began between paralyzes and eupatriades.  At the head of the nobility was Isagor.  It was he who was supported by Cleomenes, the Spartan king.  As a result of the confrontation, Klisfen was expelled from the city.  He belonged to the Alkmeonids, which back in the 7th century BC.  were cursed.  The reason was the struggle of representatives of the clan with the usurper Cylon, during which sacrilege was committed in relation to the sacred temple.  With Klisfen, another 700 families of his supporters were forced to leave the city.  Having placed Isagoras at the head of the board, the Spartans wanted to restore the power of the clan nobility.  However, the population of Attica showed discontent.  Athens quickly enough filled with peasants, who, together with city dwellers, locked both the Spartans and their local supporters on the Acropolis.  As a result, the Eupatrides had to surrender, and Cleomen was forced to leave the city.  Klisfen returned and was elected, as in his time, Solon, the first archon.  This event occurred in the 508th (507th) BC.  e.  At that time, his age was about 60 years. </p>

    <h2>  Conversions from 508 BC  e .: administrative division </h2><p>  These Cleisthen reforms are considered the most important of all.  All citizens of Attica were divided into new fila.  Before that, there were only 4. Each phylum included 3 phratries.  At the head of the latter were representatives of a noble family.  They were in charge of the cult affairs of the phratries.  Ordinary members were obliged to obey the political and religious authority of the nobility and provide support to it in the ongoing enterprises.  Reforms of Klisfen completely destroyed the old device.  He divided the territory into three districts.  Attica now included a city, a coastal strip, and a plain site.  Each district had its own division.  Now its territory included ten smaller areas.  They were called trittias.  Then ten fil.  Each of them included one trittium from the district.  The unification of fil took place only at the time of voting.  50 people were nominated in the boulevard (now it was, respectively, the Council 500), one at a time to the College of 10 strategists (each of whom in turn carried out the tasks of the chief commander).  Three units were also formed for the army: horsemen, foot soldiers and sailors.  These administrative reforms of Klisfen, as Aristotle put it, contributed to the "confusion" of the people.  The main direction of transformation was the suppression of eupatrides.  For the old clan fila only religious functions were assigned.  Such was, in general, the political system of Athens. </p>

    <h2>  Dem </h2><p>  It was the main administrative, political and economic unit.  Demos were about a hundred.  These were self-governing communities that had their own meeting, treasury, and court.  There was in them an elected headman - the demarch.  He had a fairly broad police and administrative powers.  Demarch was in charge of collecting taxes, followed the lists of those born, the mobilization of young representatives.  The determination of the members <span>of the jury</span> went by lot <span>.</span>  A separate place was occupied by the law of Ancient Athens.  When compiling demo lists, a large number of tags were included.  These were the descendants of the immigrants, limited in rights, and freedmen.  This, in turn, contributed to an increase in population.  The fact is that those on the deme lists were vested with civil rights. </p>

    <h2>  Ostracism </h2><p>  The law of Ancient Athens has also undergone changes.  During the transformations, the role of the jury, bule and the National Assembly was restored.  Through these institutions it was possible to assert their rights.  And every citizen could do this if necessary.  Klisfen's laws were mainly directed against tyranny.  One of these was the act of ostracism.  As this law of Chrisfen stated, every year the National Assembly needed to resolve a crucial issue.  Its essence was to identify a person in the city, distinguished by his authority so much that he could well seize power in his own hands.  If the first meeting considered that such a citizen is in the city, then the second was convened.  The procedure of ostarkism was carried out on it ("ostrakon" - a shard).  The Athenians present at the meeting could write on the shard the name of the most dangerous person.  They could become a successful commander, a famous politician, and so on.  I must say that it could well be an ordinary worthy citizen who did not stain himself.  Nevertheless, the National Assembly could consider it dangerous for the city.  Such a citizen was expelled from the policy for ten years.  His family and property remained in the city.  After his return, he immediately regained his rights.  These were Klisfen's main reforms briefly. </p>

    <h2>  The triumph of democracy </h2><p>  Reforms of Klisfen in Athens caused discontent among the coalition of Greek countries.  In these territories, the authorities held in their hands to know, which, of course, was afraid of a "bad example" for its inhabitants.  The coalition consisted of Aegina, Sparta, Thebes and Chalcis.  Alkmeonides tried to get support from the Persians.  They were even ready to agree to the recognition of the supreme power of their king.  But the population of Attica was categorically against ratification of the agreement.  As a result, in 506 BC  coalition forces invaded Athenian territories.  However, they suffered a crushing defeat.  The Athenians not only managed to repulse the attack, but also crossed to Euboea and captured Chalkida.  As a result, democracy triumphed. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  These are the reforms of Solon and Klisfen briefly.  These two people lived at different times.  However, the activities of both of them were of great importance to Attica.  <span>Reforms of Solon</span> and Klisfen helped streamline the political, social and administrative structure. </p>
