The list of various gadgets is very impressive, and more and more new devices are constantly appearing on the market.  Some of them fall into the category of unnecessary luxury, while others become a necessity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dnamag.mx" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="woman with fitness bracelet" class="if uuid-2970884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2970884.jpg"></div><p>  One of the useful gadgets that really can improve the quality of life is a fitness bracelet.  It is also sometimes called a smart watch based on capabilities and functionality.  The device serves as an indispensable assistant, the task of which is to maintain human health through the organization of his physical activity and rest. </p><h2>  Main functions </h2><p>  Fitness bracelet is a rather complicated device.  That is why it is simply impossible to list all its functions.  Consider the basic features of a smart gadget.  All devices have them, regardless of brand and price.  These are the functions: </p><ul><li>  step measurement; </li><li>  ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù alarm clock; </li><li>  heart rate control; </li><li>  sleep monitoring; </li><li>  accounting for calories burned. </li></ul><h2>  Do I need a fitness bracelet? </h2><p>  The first prototypes of such gadgets were heart rate monitors.  A little later, the functions of the device expanded, which made it possible to measure the steps of a person and the calories spent by him.  But at the same time, they began to call fitness bracelets only after the appearance of full integration with a PC and mobile operating systems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="wallpapershome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="man runs along the promenade with a fitness bracelet on his arm" class="if uuid-2970886" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2970886.jpg"></div><p>  Is there a need to purchase such a device?  Based on its properties, you should buy a gadget for several reasons.  After all, he is capable of the following: </p><ul><li>  encourages his master to move more; </li><li>  controls pressure and pulse, and also measures the phases of sleep; </li><li>  Helps reduce weight by sending valuable advice to its owner </li><li>  improves sleep efficiency by controlling it; </li><li>  sometimes equipped with a built-in watch, which allows you to save on their purchase. </li></ul><p>  Sometimes in the instructions for the fitness bracelet you can find such additional functions: </p><ul><li>  monitoring the frequency of medication; </li><li>  control the balance of water in the body; </li><li>  the ability to enter reminders; </li><li>  remote control over the health of relatives; </li><li>  setting goals and tracking their achievement; </li><li>  sending health data to a doctor or trainer. </li></ul><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  As you can see, fitness bracelets have a lot of advantages.  How do they work? </p><p>  Outside, manufacturers make such gadgets such that they give the owner a minimum of discomfort.  The inside of the fitness bracelet is a small electronic board with various sensors attached to it.  All elements are enclosed in a plastic, often waterproof case. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Accelerometer </h2><p>  One of the sensors located in the fitness bracelet is an element in the form of two small electric boards with a counterweight between them and the electric discharge.  At a time when a person is at rest, the accelerometer is not working.  But from the moment when the owner of the fitness bracelet is physically active, the counterweight, which is located in the middle between the boards, begins to contact them.  This allows the gadget to create a spatial picture of ongoing movements. </p><p>  Those who are wondering what is the best fitness bracelet to buy for themselves should look into the gadget's instructions.  In some modern models of such devices, triaxial accelerometers are installed.  Unlike standard sensors, they are able to track the movement of its owner and its acceleration relative to three coordinate axes at once. </p><h2>  Heart rate monitor </h2><p>  It is very important for a person to monitor the frequency of his heartbeat.  This allows you to most effectively apply physical activity.  By controlling our <span>pulse zones,</span> we are also able to significantly improve the body's response to the manifestation of activity.  For example, if the main goal of morning runs is losing weight, then the heart should beat with an approximate frequency of 130 beats per minute.  With a slower or faster heart rate, fat burning will be ineffective. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techradar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fitness bracelet workout" class="if uuid-2970891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2970891.jpg"></div><p>  The principle of operation of such a sensor is based on reading the readings of two electrodes.  With their help, the potential difference during heart beats is recorded.  The received data, as well as during the operation of the accelerometer, is received wirelessly by the smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Which fitness bracelet with heart rate monitor is better?  The following parameters directly affect the accuracy of the readings of this gadget: </p><ul><li>  good contact with the skin (the bracelet should fit snugly on it, that is, have a curved shape and small size); </li><li>  device height (it is desirable that the sensor stands out a little from the bracelet and is not buried in it); </li><li>  the ability to rotate the heart rate monitor to the back of the wrist (this parameter is important for obtaining the most accurate readings). </li></ul><h2>  Sleep Phase Tracking </h2><p>  This is one of the most important features.  The device collects statistics of time and quality of rest.  By tracking the phases of sleep, a person can avoid his lack or excess, and also wake up at the moment that is optimal in time.  All this is the merit of a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù alarm clock, which manufacturers supply almost all models of fitness trackers with.  Thanks to this function, the gadget will wake up its owner not at a time specified in advance, but when it will be most useful for the body.  Sleep phases are determined using data from the accelerometer and heart rate monitor. </p><h2>  Calorie Counting </h2><p>  A large number of people watch their figure not only in order to be healthy.  They strive to have a spectacular appearance.  And in this they will help another important function of the fitness bracelet, helping to control calories burned.  It allows the owner of the gadget not to suffer about every eaten candy.  Having such a device, he will know the amount of calories that he spent all day.  The data obtained will allow a simple calculation, determining an individual norm that allows you to always stay in shape. </p><p>  A heart rate monitor is used to obtain data on calories burned.  This sensor, based on the activity of the heart, calculates the desired indicator.  In addition, the gadget is also equipped with special software that allows the user to ‚Äúdrive‚Äù into the program the number of calories contained in the products included in the menu of the day.  Knowing the calorie intake and taking the expense away from it, you can get the most accurate result. </p><p>  Judging by user reviews, this function sometimes does not work correctly.  That is why modern manufacturers, listening to customer complaints, are constantly improving it. </p><h2>  Gadget use </h2><p>  Fitness bracelet is quite simple to use.  The gadget owner just puts it on his hand and turns it on.  Many models have their own small display.  All key indicators are displayed on its screen.  However, the most complete information about the state of the body can be obtained by connecting a fitness bracelet to a smartphone or tablet.  Suitable for this and any external device. </p><p>  How to connect a fitness bracelet, for example, to the phone?  To do this, you need to take a smartphone and install the application from the corresponding manufacturer on it.  After that, you can bind the device to it.  For this, it is likely that you will need to create an account. </p><p>  After completing the binding, the owner can use the bracelet and read the outgoing data on the smartphone.  Sometimes gadgets synchronize with each other using Bluetooth. </p><p>  What is the best program for a fitness bracelet when it is tied to Android?  In this case, it is recommended to install version no lower than 4.4. </p><p>  What is the best fitness bracelet app when installed on other gadgets?  The owner can always use the standard program.  However, it‚Äôs better to download the latest application development to your smartphone or tablet.  They will significantly expand the functionality of bracelets.  Some of these programs, for example, will allow the tracker to simultaneously become also a remote control for the smartphone‚Äôs camera. </p><p>  How to choose a fitness bracelet?  Which is better?  When buying a gadget, you should pay attention to the availability of a Russified version of the program.  You should also choose for yourself a model that will synchronize with the operating system installed on an external device (for example, Windows).  The possibility of full use of the bracelet will directly depend on this. </p><p>  After installing the application, you need to enter your age, weight, height and other indicators into it.  This will allow you to get the most accurate analytical data. </p><p>  Which fitness bracelet is better?  Judging by the reviews of many users, they preferred the purchase of a gadget, in the appendix to which there was a function of monitoring the health of loved ones at a distance.  The main thing is that this information is in the public domain.  This control function also allows the bracelet owner to share his sporting achievements with colleagues and friends. </p><h2>  Pressure measurement </h2><p>  Which fitness bracelet is best for older people and hypertensives?  Judging by the feedback from users, the smart gadget is most suitable for them, allowing you to measure not only the pulse, but also blood pressure.  In this case, the acquisition will not only be an attractive sports accessory.  Fitness bracelet with pressure measurement is also a medical device that will allow you to monitor the state of the body in real mode.  The use of such devices is also recommended for athletes and those who seek a healthy lifestyle.  You can apply it in the gym, conducting cardio workouts.  In this case, a fitness bracelet with pressure measurement will help to control the intensity of the received physical loads, adjusting them based on the capabilities and needs of the body. </p><p>  Can we talk about the accuracy of the readings of the tonometers installed on such gadgets?  If we consider the principle of operation of fitness bracelets, then their measurement of pressure is somewhat different from that which takes place in classical medical devices.  Smart device sensors detect the speed of the pulse wave.  In this case, the heartbeat frequency is measured, and the received information is subject to analysis.  It corresponds to the truth in 80% of cases.  At the same time, there is also a certain error of results, ranging from 10 to 15 millimeters of mercury.  Thus, the accuracy of the obtained pressure data using a fitness bracelet is lower than with the same measurements performed using a medical device.  But all this is fully compensated by the ease of use and the ability to check pressure without outside help. </p><h2>  How to wear a gadget? </h2><p>  The straps for fitness bracelets are mainly made of hypoallergenic silicone.  This allows you to not remove them within 24 hours a day.  These elements in all models have only two lengths.  Namely, 19 and 24 cm. At the same time, they are equipped with numerous fixing holes, allowing you to grasp the wrist of any size. </p><p>  Which arm is best for wearing a fitness bracelet?  Righties should wear it on their left wrist, and lefties on their right.  In this case, the obtained data on the state of the body will be as accurate as possible. </p><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  Which fitness bracelet is better?  When choosing a model, it is worth remembering that such gadgets are designed for regular wear and active use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.samsung.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="swimmer with fitness bracelet" class="if uuid-2970892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2970892.jpg"></div><p>  That is why it is worth paying attention to the fact that their internal elements are reliably protected from the external environment.  Judging by user reviews, the best in this regard are fitness bracelets, the case of which is insulated according to the standard, starting from IP-67 and above.  In this case, the owner of the bracelet can even swim in the water without removing it from his hand. </p><h2>  "Smart watch </h2><p>  Relying on customer reviews, which is the best fitness bracelet to purchase?  Modern manufacturers offer gadget models equipped with a screen.  In them, as a rule, the smart watch function is provided.  With its help, you can not only determine the time, but also answer calls and view notifications.  But it is worth keeping in mind that such opportunities affect the increase in the price of the bracelet.  In addition, they reduce its battery life.  That is why it is worth stopping your choice on such devices only if you have the appropriate budget and available needs. </p><h2>  Mount </h2><p>  Despite its name, some models of fitness bracelets are made in a different design.  They cannot be placed on the arm.  After all, such gadgets are made in the form of a clip, which is attached to clothes, or in the form of a pendant. </p><p>  Which fitness bracelet is better?  This is for the user to decide based on his own preferences. </p><h2>  Strap features </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the material for this part of the fitness bracelet is silicone.  It is hypoallergenic and strong enough. </p><p>  However, in models of premium fitness bracelets, sometimes there is a strap made of leather.

It is up to the buyer.  However, judging by the reviews of many users, it is advisable to choose for themselves a model in which the replacement of the strap is possible.  But to do this in the case of buying a multifunctional device is impossible, because in such models the straps are equipped with additional sensors and cannot be replaced. </p><h2>  Brand selection </h2><p>  According to users, the best manufacturers of fitness bracelets are the following: </p><ul><li>  Xiaomi offers devices ideal for its price segment. </li><li>  Withing, Misfit, Fitbil - produce gadgets related to the middle price segment. </li><li>  Jawbone is a pioneer company, among which there are both successful and failed options. </li><li>  Huawei - offer devices with a smart watch. </li><li>  Microsoft Garmin - release fitness bracelets for professionals. </li><li>  Bong, THL, Teciast - Chinese manufacturers selling gadgets with low price and good performance. </li></ul><p>  Consider the most popular models of fitness bracelets. </p><h2>  Mi Band 1s Pulse Xiaomi </h2><p>  The presented fitness bracelet, as well as other models of similar gadgets from the Xiaomi company, is made in a laconic design.
