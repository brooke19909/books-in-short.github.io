Today, you can get high-quality banking services not only by personally contacting a bank branch or office, but also online thanks to the Internet banking system.  Each operation carried out in the system is considered official, is recorded and is accompanied by a full package of documents (checks, contracts, etc.). </p><h2>  What is Belarusbank Internet banking? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="betanews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Online Banking" class="if uuid-2980588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2980588.jpg"></div><p>  Internet banking is an online financial management service through the Internet.  To use the system without problems, the client must have a laptop computer or laptop with a browser that supports 256-bit encryption. </p><h2>  Internet banking options of Belarusbank </h2><p>  Today, the Internet Bank offers users a lot of opportunities.  At any time and from anywhere in the world, the client has the opportunity not only to control accounts, but also to perform various financial transactions: </p><ol><li>  Replenish deposit and current accounts with a plastic card. </li><li>  Make money transfers. </li><li>  Make payments (including utility bills via the ERIP system). </li><li>  Pay loan agreements. </li><li>  Receive up-to-date information on exchange rates and bank news. </li></ol><p>  In addition to all of the above, the online management system allows you to open deposit accounts, order bank payment cards, draw up credit agreements and overdrafts without visiting a bank office.  This is convenient, eliminates the need to spend your time standing in lines. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Connecting Belarusbank Internet Banking </h2><div class="photo" data-original="probonoaustralia.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Internet banking services" class="if uuid-2980593" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2980593.jpg"></div><p>  Any client of Belarusbank who has a bank payment or credit card can activate the Internet banking service.  The card can be opened in any branch and belong to any payment system: Visa, Mastercard, Maestro or Belkart. </p><p>  There are two ways to register in the Internet banking system: in the bank‚Äôs office, use the online registration service. </p><p>  To connect to Internet banking in a branch, you must contact the branch where the payment card was issued.  You must have: </p><ol><li>  ID document. </li><li>  Bank card. </li></ol><p>  After the operator fills in the documents, the client must sign a statement - a questionnaire for banking services via the Internet.  After that, the client receives a login, initial password for entering the system, a card of session codes of Belarusbank.  The password issued by the bank employee can be changed at the first login.  It should consist of a combination of Latin letters and numbers. </p><p>  Online registration in the system is carried out on the official website of Belarusbank.  The customer fills out an online customer service application form online.  In this case, there is only one way to get a session card - delivery by Belpochta courier.  They promise to deliver the card within 10 business days. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In both the first and second cases, you need to activate the Belarusbank Internet banking code card.  How to do it? </p><p>  Please note that you can register in the Internet banking system only once.  If the client does not use the system for a year, his account may be blocked by decision of the bank, and then liquidated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kp.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Personal Account Interface" class="if uuid-2980566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2980566.jpg"></div><h2>  Is it possible to arrange Internet banking for Belarusbank if the client does not have a bank payment card </h2><p>  The online banking online registration system provides such an opportunity even for those customers who do not have a bank payment card.  But you still have to get it, because you won‚Äôt be able to activate the Belarusbank Internet banking code card without it.  When a client first logs into his account, the system will automatically offer him to issue a bank payment card.  It will be possible to pick it up at any nearest department that the client will indicate in the application. </p><h2>  What does a code card look like? </h2><p>  A code card is issued to each client who is registered in the online financial management system.  It is a plastic card with 40 four-digit codes written on it. </p><p>  Card size does not exceed standard.  It is convenient to carry it in a wallet, card holder, case with bank or discount cards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mybelbank.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Code card &quot;Belarusbank&quot;" class="if uuid-2980470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2980470.jpg"></div><h2>  What is a code card and why is it needed </h2><p>  The Belarusbank Internet banking system is accessed using a code card.  After the client enters the username and password, the system requests one of the 40 passwords printed on the card.  Each code card is unique.  They are assigned a unique number that is tied to the user's personal account of the system.  So that the codes are known only to the cardholder and do not fall into the hands of third parties, they are covered with a special silver layer.  If any of the layers is damaged, the card can be replaced by the operator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="znaemdengi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Login using card codes" class="if uuid-2980479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2980479.jpg"></div><p>  As a rule, banks use SMS passwords to enter the system.  But, in the event that the gadget is discharged, broken, lost, such an identification system can be problematic. </p><h2>  How to activate the Belarusbank Internet banking code card? </h2><p>  In order to start using the Internet banking code card, it must go through the activation procedure.  During this activation, the card is ‚Äúattached‚Äù to the user's personal account.  How to activate the Belarusbank Internet banking code card? </p><p>  The activation procedure is carried out using an infokiosk.  Here is a step-by-step instruction: </p><ol><li>  Insert the card into the info kiosk and enter the pin code. </li><li>  Select "Service operations". </li><li>  Click on the "Card Activation" button. </li><li>  Enter the code card number (it is located at the top on the back). </li><li>  Duplicate the card number. </li><li>  Confirm the operation (the information kiosk issues a check that confirms the operation). </li><li>  Pick up a bank card. </li></ol><p>  The on-site consultant on duty can help activate the code card in the information kiosk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ganc-chas.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Activating a code card through the info kiosk" class="if uuid-2980572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2980572.jpg"></div><h2>  Security </h2><p>  Since the Internet banking system allows complete control of finances, it is necessary to adhere to the rules for safe use of the system: </p><ol><li>  Do not transfer the code card to third parties.  Including bank employees.  If you need to enter your personal account in a bank branch, enter the password and verification code yourself. </li><li>  If you lose your code card, contact the bank or inform the bank support service. </li><li>  Carefully enter the login, password and access code to your personal account.  Otherwise, the account will be blocked.  The lock can be removed by calling the bank support service. </li></ol><h2>  What to do if the code card is lost </h2><p>  If the client has lost the code card, then the first thing he should do is contact the bank or inform about it by phone.  This is done in order to prevent the possibility of third parties entering the personal account of Internet banking.  After that, a new code card is issued, which is attached to your personal account.  The old code card is canceled.  The new code card must also go through the activation procedure. </p><h2>  Can I log in without a code card? </h2><p>  How to use the Belarusbank Internet banking code card, we figured out.  But the question remains, is it possible to use the system without a session code card?  The possibility of entering Belarusbank internet banking without a code card really exists.  This can be done using SMS code.  To do this, select the item "One-time SMS code" in the "Login" menu.  But pay attention to the fact that the current phone number must be "tied" to the account.  If the phone number has changed, you need to contact the bank to make changes.  This can be done by contacting a branch whose client is a citizen or by telephone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="banking-belarusbank.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Login" class="if uuid-2980507" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2980507.jpg"></div><p>  Using the Internet banking system from Belarusbank is extremely simple.  The simple, intuitive interface of your personal account makes the work easy even for inexperienced users.  In addition, the bank's security system in the form of additional use of session codes minimizes the likelihood of third parties accessing customer accounts.  This system is perfect for those who do not like to spend time in lines. </p>
