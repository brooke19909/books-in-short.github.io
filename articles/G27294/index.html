  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tie a dress and create yourself a good mood for a long time</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Hobbies are a great thing.  It raises the mood, increases efficiency, adds vitality.  If a person is passionate about something that he likes, then he never runs the risk of falling under the burden of depression.  And no matter what the direction of his hobby: fishing or needlework, gliding or design development.  It is important that he always strives to quickly pick up his beloved work, bring it to the end, and then contemplate with satisfaction how others admire his creation. </p><p>  One of the most popular hobbies for women is knitting.  Many craftswomen create such masterpieces with their own hands that you marvel at these exclusive miracles created by human hands.  But one does not need to think that only zeal and desire to create a knitted masterpiece are enough.  As in genius, and in a hobby - without the application of effort, the development of boring basics and overcoming difficulties, beautiful results cannot be achieved.  In order to knit a dress, you must, at a minimum, distinguish between the front and back loops if it is knitting, and know how the crocheted and crochet posts fit if you want to crochet the dress.  Maybe everything we said here sounds a little corny, but this is the truth. </p><p>  The main thing that the researchers noticed: those women who are fond of knitting of any kind differ from others in their optimism, good mood and good mood.  So, if you are still thinking about knitting a dress that isn‚Äôt in nature, you need to get down to business faster.  In any case, you will find yourself in a winning situation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to tie a dress, you need to decide on his model.  It is important that the finished product sits on the figure as cast.  It may be worth starting with knitting a smaller dress, for example, for a daughter or relative?  This option will be true for those who, for the first time, undertake such an interesting business, but they have little experience. </p><p>  The next important point is the choice of a knitting tool and the type of yarn.  To knit a dress with knitting need yarns with a less loose composition, because compared with the crochet technique, work done with knitting needles is softer and can lose shape over time.  The composition of the threads for such a dress, in addition to acrylic, must necessarily be cotton.  Then your product will not lose its charm and will delight you or your loved ones with its originality for quite some time. </p><p>  If you decide <span>to crochet the dress,</span> then the choice of yarn can be wider.  Woolen threads are also suitable, but a <span>dress crocheted</span> from cotton yarn looks best. </p><p>  Today there is a lot of literature describing models of knitted dresses, with proposals for patterns, with color options.  The same information is available in large quantities on websites on the Internet.  So knitting a dress with knitting needles or crochet will not be very difficult if you have free time and a lot of desire and interest.  Step-by-step instructions turn novice knitters into professional-class craftswomen.  From under their hands are masterpieces dresses that, with their appearance, give rise to joy and positive emotions.  You can associate the dress with a symmetrical and asymmetric pattern, in a classic style or in a fashionable, modern direction. </p><p>  Anyone who knits such dresses and gives it to their loved ones receives no less pleasure than from the process when he wears knitted clothes by himself. In addition, such a hobby of adult women in the family also teaches small women to needlework.  From an early age they will receive lessons in perseverance and the ability to show attention to their loved ones, giving them the joy of gifts made by themselves. </p>
