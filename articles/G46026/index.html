    <p>  The above options are offered to the borrower by the banks in the case when the latter applies to a financial institution with a notice of inability to repay the debt on time and in full due to certain life circumstances (lowering wages, job loss, etc.). </p><p>  In such a difficult situation, the help and support of specialists who thoroughly know the law and who are ready to provide qualified legal protection to a person in difficult financial circumstances is important. </p><p>  The Vitakon company is able to take on the problems of resolving the financial issue, because each lawyer of this organization is a professional, who has behind him a unique baggage of practical knowledge and experience that is used in the interests of his clients. </p><h2>  What do the reviews say about the law firm Vitacon? </h2><p>  This is an organization that can help a person living anywhere in Russia.  The company has offices in 24 regions of our country.  Specialists conduct receptions in 24 cities, including Yekaterinburg, Volgograd, Kazan, Kirov, Omsk, Krasnoyarsk, Penza and others.  Initial consultations and conclusion of contracts are carried out by managers in the branches.  Directly, the client‚Äôs business is transferred to the main office located in Chelyabinsk.  In places where there are no representative offices, work is carried out remotely. </p>

    <p>  Remote way of work implies failure to appear in court at the place of trial of company representatives <noindex>  <span>Vitacon</span> </noindex>  .  Customers should not worry about this, because such an activity does not provide for the presence of parties in court: neither from the defendant, nor from the bank. </p><p>  The main activity of the Vitacon company is the financial protection of the population, namely, helping people who have lost the opportunity to pay loans for some reason. </p><p>  Let us return to the question of the impossibility of repaying a loan by an individual.  There is another way to resolve this situation, which banks are silent about.  This is a lawsuit.  That is, the bank may sue the defaulter in order to resolve the issue of repaying the loan.  However, a financial institution deliberately delays the process of filing a statement of claim so that the borrower accumulates as many fines and penalties as possible, on which this institution, accordingly, will earn.  At this time, the financial situation of a person who is not able to pay off a loan is catastrophically worsening.  Moreover, he and loved ones are constantly harassed by collectors, trying to ‚Äúknock out‚Äù funds.  What are Vitacon employees doing in this case? </p><p>  Feedback from customers who have used the services of this organization indicate a professional approach to solving a credit issue.  The lawyers of the company take all legal methods to influence the creditor in order to push him to sue the debtor.  It is in the courtroom that a decision is made to reduce the amount of debt by canceling illegal commissions, inflated penalties and penalties.  And then the borrower does not pay the fabulous monthly amount, but not more than 50% of the official income, through bailiffs.  If there are several creditors, this rate is distributed in total to all.  If the borrower is entrusted with the maintenance of dependents, or there are diseases requiring expensive treatment, this rate can be reduced to 25-30% of official income, and in some cases even lower.  During loan repayments, no fines and penalties are charged, and the debt repayment period is extended until the borrower can repay the full amount of the loan with his 50 percent salary.  At the same time, the collectors finally leave the debtor alone: ‚Äã‚Äãthey do not write or call. </p><p>  Based on the foregoing, it becomes clear that in a difficult financial situation it is worth contacting the Vitacon company.  Reviews from grateful clients who managed to save huge amounts of money thanks to the professional work of lawyers confirm this. </p><h2>  The company "Vitacon" conducts bankruptcy proceedings for individuals </h2><p>  If: </p><ul><li>  there is a debt of more than 300,000 rubles, </li><li>  delay in payment of more than three months, </li><li>  there is no ability to pay off creditors, </li></ul><p>  that individual has the legal right to declare bankruptcy.  What does it give?  There is an opportunity to write off unpaid debts or restructure them for up to three years.  That is, bona fide debtors at the legislative level are given the opportunity to free themselves from the overwhelming financial burden that arose due to life circumstances. </p>

    <p>  The bankruptcy procedure is quite complex and consists of several stages, the execution of which, including the appointment of a financial manager (the key person in this procedure, on which the judge‚Äôs decision to write off debt obligations depends), rests with the specialists of Vitacon. </p><p>  In customer reviews, there is sometimes a mention of the excessive length of the process, but a period of 4 to 12 months is quite justified.  After all, it is worth taking into account the features of the Russian judicial system, repeated meetings.  Plus, preliminary preparation: collecting and organizing information on the non-payer, execution and collection of necessary documents.  Of course, many clients complain that the case can be transferred from one lawyer to another.  But here, as in any enterprise, there is a human factor: sick leave, maternity leave, and layoffs.  After all, as was already said above, the conduct of one case takes a rather long time, therefore, such changes take place.  This does not affect the quality of work and the final result.  All employees of the company are qualified specialists with vast experience working behind them. </p><p>  What ultimately does the Vitacon customer receive?  The reviews and court decisions confirm: complete cancellation of debts on the basis of a court decision to exempt a citizen from fulfilling the requirements of a creditor.  So, during 2017, more than 30 customers of the company wrote off their debts after going through bankruptcy proceedings; in 2016, the number of successfully written off their debt under the bankruptcy proceedings exceeded 300 debtors. </p><p>  What threatens the debtor with bankruptcy?  The consequences are not so frightening: </p><ul><li>  the inability to register a company and hold a managerial position within 3 years (to be the general or executive director at LLC, OJSC and other legal forms), </li><li>  within 5 years from the date of completion of the procedure, the former lender will be required to notify the lender before taking a loan that he went through bankruptcy proceedings. </li></ul><p>  What awaits the debtor if he does not dare to go through bankruptcy proceedings: </p><ul><li>  the bank will sell debt to collectors, and pressure (including on relatives) will begin with renewed vigor; </li><li>  monthly accrual of interest and late payment interest will continue. </li></ul><p>  In addition, if the bankruptcy procedure is initiated by the bank, the choice of the arbitration manager will be his.  Consequently, the authorized person will act in the interests of the financial institution that appointed him, which threatens the borrower with recognition of it as unfair.  If the bank accepts the arguments of the bankruptcy trustee, the debtor will lose the opportunity to get rid of the debt, and his property will be sold.  For an unscrupulous borrower, this also threatens to evict from the apartment, acting as a pledge under a mortgage agreement, without providing other housing. </p><p>  What else can be said about Vitacon?  Customer reviews positively characterize the consultations that are held for free.  During the first meeting with the client, lawyers: </p>
