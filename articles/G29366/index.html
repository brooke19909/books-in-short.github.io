The first phase has even been commissioned. </p><p>  St. Petersburg, without exaggeration, is the most beautiful city in Europe.  Its only drawback is the built-up of literally every free span.  So they began to actively introduce innovation here - to reclaim additional territory.  This "eats" the Gulf of Finland, but it makes it possible to build housing almost in the city center, and even on the seashore. </p><p>  Regarding such technologies, as well as about the “I Am Romantic” complex itself, the reviews of Petersburgers are very restrained.  There are a lot of questions about the reliability of high-rise buildings on unstable soils, and about the extraordinary generosity of a builder who sells LCD apartments at incredibly low prices, and to the builder himself, who behaves, frankly, unconventionally.  To clarify the situation, mystery shoppers visited the complex several times.  In our article, we will not give ratings to "Romance", just to summarize: what has been done for today and what to expect from this LCD. </p><h2>  Location, transportation facilities </h2><p>  Such massive advertising was conducted and is being conducted on the construction of housing in the Gulf of Finland that there is hardly a Petersburger who has not heard anything about him.  The full name of the new complex is "The Bright World" I am Romantic "."  Every word here is chosen not just for beauty, but with meaning.  The developer in every possible way promotes to potential and real interest-holders the brightest and best world, in which only romantics should live. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The complex began to be built on Vasilievsky Island, however, not in the central part, but on its outskirts, more precisely on a piece of land that was reclaimed from the Gulf of Finland by alluvial technology.  But with the opening of the CPA, its outskirts are no longer a disadvantage, but a virtue. </p><p>  The long-awaited track connecting the island with the mainland, is located in close proximity to the new complex, so getting to any important facility is no longer a problem for residents of the residential complex “I Am Romantic”.  His address is Vasilievsky Island, <span>V. Shefner</span> Street <span>.</span>  Now the arrangement of the latter is at the completion stage, and official numbers have already been assigned to the commissioned facilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="I am romantic reviews" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1594295.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  While using public transport, the location “I Am Romantic” is not very impressive, as it is about 3 km to walk to the nearest metro station (Primorskaya).  Tentatively in 2020, it is planned to introduce a new station with the beautiful name “Marine Facade”.  Now you can get to Primorskaya by minibuses and buses (13 routes in total), even by trolleybus No. 11. </p><p>  So far, the area where “I am a romantic” is being built is unattractive.  Optimism gives only the expanse of the Gulf of Finland, to which a few meters.  The uninhabited, albeit unfinished, box of the Captain Nemo house still stands a little to the side, they are going to erect the Arthur Gray residential complex a little further, and the Magellan residential complex on the opposite side, so romantics will not be bored. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Who is the developer </h2><p>  The residential complex “I Am Romantic” on Vasilievsky is being built by the little-known but already very well-proven development company Seven Suns, led by Andrey Bolshakov.  But the company was founded not by him, but by the Ryzhkov family - Pyotr Alekseevich and his son Alexei Petrovich.  They are sovereign owners. </p><p>  The year of foundation is indicated both 2010 and 2013, but the correct date is 2014.  In St. Petersburg, “I am a romantic” is the first project of the company, therefore it is not a miracle that they reacted to it as wary as possible.  Seven Suns, which means "Seven Suns", takes its origins in Vologda, and operates on the example of the construction company Gorstroyzakazchik, known since 1965, where Peter Ryzhkov once worked.  In the Vologda Territory, she handed over about 50% of all housing there. </p><p>  The new young Seven Suns, entering the real estate construction market in St. Petersburg, immediately made an unprecedented marketing move in Russia.  Starting to build the residential complex “I Am Romantic”, the developer organized unprecedented meetings with interest holders, which he called “Days of Open Hearts”.  Their highlight is tables served with dishes and drinks, performances by artists, speeches of company representatives in which they teach future residents <span>what it means to live</span> with love for their neighbors and their home.  Of these, even a team of builders of a new bright world was recruited, which could be entered after submitting an application. </p><p>  Another innovation was the rule according to which it was strictly forbidden to enter the construction site, except at these meetings.  To say that equity holders were shocked at first was to say nothing.  But little by little the passions subsided, and everyone got used to the unusual rules of the builder and understood why the full name of their residential complex is "The Bright World" I Am Romantic "." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In an interview, CEO A. Bolshakov explained that the company's goal is not only to give people square meters of housing, but also to teach them how to live with an open mind and love their LCD.  This will give an impetus (and possibly another rule) to the fact that the residents of the complex will create all the infrastructure created by the personal funds, take care of its condition on their own, but will use it for free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD I'm a romantic" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1594296.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Successes and mistakes of the company </h2><p>  Not surprisingly, equity holders are closely monitoring the activities of Seven Suns.  So, it turned out that in Vologda they handed over three such residential complexes, but they did not work there themselves, but in collaboration with 02 Development.  According to the reviews of local residents, the complexes are not bad, but there are complaints about the quality of work.  And today, SK is building in such a city as St. Petersburg, “I am a romantic,” and in addition, the residential complex “O Youth”!  and LCD "Bright World Inside." </p><p>  With the last project, a hitch came out, since it is being built in the territory occupied by the Dunes sanatorium.  A. Bolshakov explained that the company only builds apartments there, that is, untimely hotel rooms that are no different from sanatoriums, so there are no violations.  In addition, the Seven Suns is equipped at its own expense with bike paths, a beach, a fitness club and a health center.  That's what a magical company it is. </p><p>  With the LCD “I Am Romantic”, problems arose already at the initial stages, since for a long time it was not possible to get the go-ahead for the connection of all communications at the expense of the city treasury.  For the same reason, the Capitan Nemo neighbor house has not yet been commissioned.  In “Romance” it was forbidden to sell future housing, but the company made a move with a horse and began to sell the reservation at a price of 50 thousand per unit.  Passions boiled serious.  People then booked, then refused and took the money. </p><p>  Finally, the "Seven Suns" decided to leave the treasury alone and themselves paid all the costs of connecting communications.  After that, the work began to boil.  Immediately, information appeared in the press that the company was suing advertisers and some suppliers for non-payment of due fees to them in the amount of several tens of millions of rubles, which it simply had nowhere to take.  And again, interest holders began sleepless nights.  But now everything is behind us, since it is possible to evaluate the work at the facility only by results.  And they are just great. </p><h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  <span>Without a doubt, it</span> will become an exemplary LCD “I am a romantic”.  It is difficult to surprise St. Petersburg with residential neighborhoods, but the Seven Suns company succeeded.  On the territory of 7.7 hectares they will erect 11 houses on 6-18 floors, build two kindergartens (for 140 and 115 children), a school (they are going to transfer it to the city), the Life Theater, a gym, a House of Creativity with dance sections, the Center for Harmony “Bright Music”, IFC, the Center for Cleansing the Body and Soul, own police buildings, administrations, cafes and even an observatory on the roof of one of the houses. </p><p>  The entire complex will be divided into public and residential areas and fenced around the perimeter.  Pass to its territory will be on special access control cards.  In the residential zone of this magical mini-city, houses and children's institutions will be built, and in the public - all other infrastructure objects, including a large shopping center with several floors. </p><p>  The border between the zones will be the walking pedestrian street "Promenade of the Romantics."  The whole territory, according to the designers, will be decorated with flowers and all kinds of green spaces, among which pave alleys, establish benches and nice architectural forms of wood and clay.  Playgrounds with swings and roundabouts will be built for kids, and a football field, a court, volleyball courts, and bicycle paths will be created for athletes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="I am a romantic housing estate" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1594317.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The presence of parking is equally important for equity holders of the residential complex "I am Romantic."  Testimonials from people show that this issue is also normal.  It is planned to create several underground parking lots, but in which buildings it is not yet clear.  Estimated price of parking spaces in them - from 800 thousand rubles.  In the administrative zone, the company promises to build two giant nine-story parking lots that can accommodate 2,000 cars.  The price for a parking place here is approximately 400 thousand rubles.  Outdoor parking in the complex will be prohibited, as will cars not enter its territory.  It is planned to equip separate gates for iron horses.  Only emergency vehicles can enter the residential area. </p><h2>  Complex design </h2><p>  LCD "I am a romantic" (St. Petersburg) originally had the appearance of a place from a fairy tale, beautiful and unusual.  It was planned to make all the buildings there colorful, and in very cheerful colors, which is often not superfluous for the often gloomy Petersburg sky. </p><p>  The Seven Suns company, obviously, to give even more a complex of romanticism, each house came up with sonorous names.  Among them is the “Ship Honesty” - he is the first in the line of delivery.  It has three 18-story sections and one 8-story, as well as parking.  The second is the "Ship" Courage "", it will be identical to the first.  The third will be the “Kindness Ship”.  It is planned to build four 18-story sections in it, plus an additional parking lot.  The fourth “ship” will be small, from just one section of 6 floors and without parking.  For some reason they called it “Dream”.  The fifth building will also be built in one section and also without parking, but the floors in it will be as many as 18. The name of the house is “Ship“ Gratitude ””.  Finally, the sixth building is planned to be made of two 13-story sections and one 18-story.  It will be the “Knowledge Ship.”  Parking in it is not planned.  The rest of the houses are nameless.  All sections are built with a separate entrance, with a spacious foyer, decorated in a theme with the name of the building, with one or two elevators. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bright world I'm a romantic" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1594311.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <h2>  Construction technology </h2><p>  Taking into account the peculiarities of the region, the residential complex “I Am Romantic” is being built.  Residents' comments note worries about the frequent and powerful winds in the Gulf of Finland and the occurrence of possible flooding in the mud because of the proximity of the water's edge.  Builders, in order to eliminate problems associated with alluvial soils, scored piles 28 meters long under the foundation (with the current norm of 25 meters), and the foundation plates themselves were laid with a thickness of 700 mm.  Therefore, the houses of the complex “I am romantic” should be centuries old. </p><p>  For those who doubt, it is possible, as an argument, to cite examples of the fact that on Vasilievsky Island they have been washing soil and building buildings on them for a long time, and so far not a single house has been destroyed.  They are erected in monolithic, as well as bearing 200 mm walls.  External walls are made of aerated concrete.  Their thickness is also 200 mm.  Interroom walls in the project are 130 mm thick, therefore, sound insulation should be good.  And only interior partitions are made of concrete panels 70 mm thick. </p><p>  It is planned to insulate the facades in the buildings with a special 150-mm layer of insulation, decorate with decorative tiles, and the facade of the "Dreams" will be completely lined with wood. </p><h2>  Layout and design of apartments </h2><p>  The unusual appearance of the complex is not the only thing that decided to surprise Seven Suns.  Apartments “I - Romantic” will be rented not only with a full finish, but also with a set of electrical equipment, plus furnished with some furniture.  It is difficult to imagine that the builder will simply give all these benefits to his shareholders.  He builds apartments in this residential complex only with straight walls and corners, which, of course, pleases.  But the ceilings will be only 2.6 m. The balconies are also not very large, plus a few "pressed" into the rooms, and even then not in every apartment.  But the residents of the first floors will be very pleased with the architectural delights, since it is planned to make spacious terraces like French in their apartments, the entrance to which will be from the loggia.  Types of apartments offered in the residential complex "I am romantic": </p><p>  - studios (total area rounded from 22 to 34 m <sup>2</sup> ); </p><p>  - one-room (from 21 to 40 m <sup>2</sup> ); </p><p>  - two-room (from 48 to 61 m <sup>2</sup> ); </p><p>  - three rooms (from 63 to 81 m <sup>2</sup> ). </p><p>  There will also be apartments of other types: </p><p>  - two-room euros (from 36 to 53 m <sup>2</sup> ); </p><p>  - three-room euros (from 62 to 74 m <sup>2</sup> ). </p><p>  In the second stage, the following options are supposedly: </p><p>  - studios (from 22 to 28 m <sup>2</sup> ); </p><p>  - one-room (from 31 to 33 m <sup>2</sup> ); </p><p>  - two-room (from 40 to 60 m <sup>2</sup> ). </p><p>  You can choose the decoration of your apartment when you visit the "show room", designed by the company specifically to demonstrate design options for equity holders of I-Romantic.  Reviews about them are restrained, but, as they say, they don’t look into the gift horse in the mouth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD I'm a romantic deadline" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1594305.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is offered:

Prices are unstable and have already changed several times, but those who managed to get the DDU in the first stage, we can say, were lucky.  At the first stage, the studio could be borrowed for 1,400,000 rubles, and one-room studio - for 1,800,000 rubles.  The rest of the apartments were incredibly cheap.  It is not surprising that in the “Ship of Honesty”, and in the remaining buildings of the first stage, all housing was dismantled.  The developer announced this officially. </p><p>  Today, the cost of one square of housing in the residential complex "I Romantic" varies from 88,000 rubles.  per square meter in studios and up to 151,317 rubles.  in the "three rubles".  Also, while in the price list there are several apartments where a square meter costs only 80,000 rubles.  As you can see, each apartment has its own price, which depends on the layout, floor, location of the balcony and many more reasons.  You can find out the true price only from sales managers, and having come directly to the office.  Many potential buyers report that it is difficult to obtain normal advice and comprehensive information by telephone. </p><p>  The sales office is located right there, on Vasilievsky Island, plot number 28. </p><p>  Interest holders "I am a romantic" are required to sign a DDU.  You can make a purchase by paying the full amount immediately or by taking the installments plan valid until the completion of construction.  At the same time, 18% per annum will be withheld on the balance of payment. </p><p>  Another way is to take a mortgage.  At first, it was formalized only by Promsvyazbank.  Now you can turn to others, such as Bank Saint Petersburg, Sberbank, AHML, TransCapitalBank.  The conditions are different everywhere, but on average lending is from 20 to 30 years, the first installment is 20%, the rate is from 10.6 to 12%. </p><h2>  Deadline </h2><p>  About the fact that Seven Suns will not build houses on time, they wrote a lot.  They even said that the customer specifically filters people’s reviews on the Internet, and doesn’t let anyone in to the construction site to hide the truth.  According to the plan in the residential complex “I am romantic”, the deadline for completion of the first stage was set for 2016, the third quarter.  It included five buildings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="I'm a romantic builder" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1594349.jpg" width="307"></div>

    <p>  According to the latest data, the deadline for completion of the second stage is 2017, quarter IV.  This will include 6 buildings and one kindergarten, which, according to the builder, the city authorities did not allow for a long time to begin construction. </p><p>  Stage III will be completed in 2018, in the first quarter (IFC, the remaining buildings).  All infrastructure should be built no later than the third quarter of 2018. </p><p>  “I am a romantic” is a residential complex growing before our eyes.  What do we see today? </p><p>  The first turn was delivered on time, but they will give keys to people in six to seven months, according to the builder, no later than April 2017.  The constructed buildings were connected to all necessary networks - water and electricity, heat, television, the Internet.  The houses are glazed, all elevators are installed, finishing work is underway. </p><p>  Open housing sales in the second stage. </p><p>  Enclosures were built by approximately 85%, with two of them already installed 50% of the internal partitions and 90% of the external panels.
