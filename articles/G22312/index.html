When buying, the consumer receives the device itself, a special replaceable battery, two cables for connection: the first with an output for a USB port, the second - a standard ‚Äúmini-jack‚Äù.  The Supra PAS-3909 did not include a charger, but customers say that you can replace it with any modern telephone cable, so this fact upset a few.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer decided to get rid of the cover, which pleased most buyers. </p><p>  The device is delivered in two colors - blue or white. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="supra pas 3909" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1640917.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The input and output are represented by standard 3.5 mm ports, better known as a ‚Äúmini-jack".  The channel is of the mono type.  The power of the device is 3 watts.  The case is made of plastic.  The Supra PAS-3909 display received a blue backlight.  Device size: 11.7 √ó 6.7 √ó 3.3 cm. The total weight (including battery) is 0.13 kg.  It can be connected to a computer as speakers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Unlike previous models, the described Supra PAS-3909 system received a smaller size, which was a big advantage.  All settings and the general menu have not changed at all.  The same can be said about sound functionality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="supra pas 3909 reviews" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1640920.jpg" width="513"></div>

    <h2>  Highlights </h2><p>  The device is quite convenient to use.  Maximum comfort is ensured by the fact that the manufacturer refused to use the usual five-position joystick, which was the previous model.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Supra PAS-3909 device is reminiscent of <span>Soviet radios,</span> because they work, surprisingly, almost on the same principle.  The difference is that the modern device has modern advanced details and improved sound. </p><p>  The instructions that come with the set describe in detail the purpose of each button on the device.  It should be noted that this time the telescopic antenna received a non-removable design. </p><p>  The display is standard for this manufacturer.  Due to the fact that the company decided to remove the watch, the presence of a timer and an alarm clock became impossible.  But instead, they had a built-in auto-shutdown. </p><p>  In the event that the consumer needs to have its text broadcast on the screen during the song being played, you just need to place it on the media with the same name as the track itself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Playback of melodies starts automatically as soon as you turn it on.  Built-in function that is responsible for the continuation of the sound after the interruption.  The device is able to read the characters of the Russian alphabet, which is considered an undoubted plus.  The device has only one speaker, the sound is as bright, loud and easily perceived by the human ear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="supra pas 3909 review" class="if" height="462" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1640922.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Consumers consider the main advantage to be sound quality, although many change the device to a more expensive one after a year of use.  This is due to the plastic case, which is fragile and rather short-lived. </p><p>  Among the advantages, consumers note a stylish design, an adequate price category, reliability, because the software is unrealistic rarely gives errors or crashes.  Of course, due to the reputation of the manufacturer, many people prefer these devices.  Indeed, the equipment from "Supra" has long been popular. </p><p>  Of the negative sides of the device, buyers noted, as already mentioned, a plastic case, a rather fragile antenna, and a rather weak signal transmittance outside the city. </p><p>  Even if there are minuses, consumers still advise this model to buy, since the quality without exaggeration corresponds to the price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="supra pas 3909 instruction" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1640923.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The Supra PAS-3909 device, reviews of which can be read above, turned out to be very successful and proved to be excellent in operation.  The device will easily give you unforgettable emotions from listening to books or ordinary music tracks.  The device is reliable, autonomous (which deserves special praise), capable of creating a clean and unique sound of good volume.  Portable audio system easily works with any sources, can be paired with a flash card or other external drives. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the design turned out to be non-ergonomic, it is difficult to place the model as comfortably as possible, but it is easy to put it in your pocket and carry it with you.  The price not exceeding 1,000 rubles allows you to justify all the shortcomings.  By the way, consumers also say that the Supra PAS-3909 device, the instructions for which describe all the settings perfectly, did not receive a bluetooth module. </p><p>  In general, all customers are satisfied with their purchase.  No one has yet regretted regretting the money spent. </p>
