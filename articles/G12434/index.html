  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Title sentences</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There is such an expressive stylistic device in fiction and poetry as the use of single-component sentences in the text. </p><p>  <em>1. It‚Äôs getting light ... 2. It's cool.</em>  <em>3. Morning.</em>  <em>4. And here are the guests to us!</em> </p><p>  <span>One-part sentences</span> can be with the main term, expressed in the verb form (1) or adverb (2).  But one-part noun sentences are distinguished by the fact that they consist only of the main member, reminiscent of the subject in form (3, 4). </p><p>  Most often, this member is expressed by a noun in the nominative case or a noun with dependent words.  For instance: <em> </em></p><p>  <em>1. The war.</em>  <em>2. Year 1941. 3. Burned villages.</em>  <em>4. Destruction and desolation.</em>  <em>5. Disconsolate mothers crying over the bodies of children.</em> </p><p>  The examples presented show <strong> </strong>  what <strong> </strong>  pronounced sentences can consist of a single-word main term (1, 4), but also the main term sometimes carries dependent words.  (2, 3, 5) Although often personal pronouns can also act as the main member. </p><p>  <em>1. And here he is!</em>  <em>2. Our good Santa Claus!</em> </p><ol></ol><p>  We also conclude from the example that the use of the word ‚Äúhere‚Äù in a title sentence does not change its classification at all. </p><p>  Nickname sentences suggest the existence of some phenomena at the present time.  There are four main categories of them: existential, indicative, evaluative-existential and desirable-existential. </p><p>  The existential noun sentences are most often narrative, which simply name existing objects or phenomena, stating the fact of their existence.  The subject is present in such sentences in the nominative case.  For instance: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <em>1. Five twenty in the evening.</em>  <em>2. Unsuccessful experiment.</em> </p><p>  Indicative title sentences contain in their composition the <span>indicative particles</span> "here," "here," "out," "out and." </p><p>  <em>1. Here are the winds.</em>  <em>2. And here is the house.</em>  <em>3. There‚Äôs a sauna nearby.</em>  <em>4. And get out and stack.</em> </p><p>  Appraisal-sentence sentences are usually pronounced with exclamatory or interrogative intonation, which is indicated by the corresponding <span>punctuation marks</span> and expressive-emotional particles ‚Äúwhat‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat‚Äù, ‚Äúwell,‚Äù.  Examples include the following sentences: </p><p>  <em>1. What a beautiful day!</em>  <em>2. Well, what a meeting!</em>  <em>3. What about the secret?</em>  <em>4. Well, let the secret!</em> </p><p>  Sentences expressing a strong desire or dream, in addition to the nominal subject, located in the nominative case, often include particles ‚Äúif only‚Äù, ‚Äúif only‚Äù, ‚Äúif‚Äù.  These are the so-called desirable existential noun sentences.  Examples: </p><p>  <em>1. Ah, just one call!</em>  <em>2. Only her voice ringing!</em> </p><p>  Very often, nominative sentences are used in everyday speech and, as a result, in direct speech of <span>literary texts</span> or in scripts of dramatic works. </p><p>  <em>1. <span>‚ÄúA house with a red roof,</span> ‚Äù said the girl, pointing her hand to the side.</em>  <em>2. "A lady in a hat with a bouquet sitting near a tub with ficus," the man nodded in response.</em> </p><p>  Containing only one detail, a fragment of the general, these sentences, meanwhile, are extremely rich, capacious, vivid and expressive.  In addition to the descriptive context, monosyllabic nominative sentences are often used in remarks of dramatic works.  For instance: </p><p>  <em>1. The curtain.</em>  <em>2. A long, long spiral staircase extending to the very ceiling.</em>  <em>3. Background: rock, lonely pine on it.</em> </p><p>  Some linguists also include names of literary, musical and visual works, books, magazines, films, television shows, signage and the like to nasal sentences.  But in this case, the opinions of linguists differ. </p><p>  <em>1. The Elusive Avengers.</em>  <em>2. "Girl with Peaches."</em>  <em>3. Entrance to the third floor.</em>  <em>4. The Blue Light.</em> </p><p>  Some works, most often poetic, are original, consisting solely of nominal sentences.  The peculiarity of such a presentation is fundamental, a stop in action.  Indeed, without the predicates, it is rather difficult to show the development of the plot, the movement. </p>
