    <h2>  How tourists characterize this hotel </h2><p>  The guests are very impressed with the territory, services and luxury of the Radisson Blu Resort 5. Sharm El Sheikh is an expensive resort in itself, and mainly wealthy people come here.  But the local beauties and well-trained staff amaze even seasoned travelers.  People like the design and decoration of rooms, and artificial lakes, geysers, waterfalls and grottoes.  Tropical flowers fragrant as if you are somewhere in Thailand, and not in the middle of the desert. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many flattering reviews on excursions organized by the hotel, especially to the Ras Mohammed Nature Reserve.  Guests note as a bonus free Wi-Fi in the lobby of the hotel for all that can not boast, perhaps not a single hotel in Sharm.  The food is so good that guests mention only special delicacies, such as hanging two-meter tuna for individual preparation in portions.  The presence of a large number of fish, crabs, squids is also noted.  There is a good entry into the water on the beach, and after lunch there is the opportunity to swim with a mask on the pontoon and watch the fantastic fish in fantastic colors.  The staff at your request will put you in a room with a sea view without any extra money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Radisson blu fujairah resort 5" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/455372.jpg" width="600"></div>
