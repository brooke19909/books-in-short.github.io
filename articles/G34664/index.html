    <p>  Geographically, the city belongs to the southern federal district, the population of Yeysk for 2014 is about 86,000 people.  The city is inextricably linked with the water element, and even the coat of arms of this settlement shows off a water resident - a sterlet fish. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  So where is Yeysk located?  The city is located in the northernmost part of the wonderful Krasnodar Territory, to be more precise, 250 kilometers from the city of Krasnodar, at the end of the Yeysk Peninsula, between the Gulf of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov (called Taganrog) on ‚Äã‚Äãthe west side and the Yeysk estuary on the east.  Yeisk estuary, by the way, is the largest in the North Caucasus. </p><h2>  Climate and air temperature </h2><p>  The location of the city in the <span>Southern Federal District</span> determines that it is favorable for recreation.  Resort rest is, first of all, the sea and the beach.  In this city, you can go to the sea from almost all sides, which means that Yeysk is perfect for a good time.  The more famous Russian health resorts are Sochi, Anapa, Gelendzhik.  They are called resorts of the Krasnodar Territory, or resorts of the Kuban. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Not everyone knows where the city of Yeysk is located; it is known much less than other <span>resorts of the Kuban.</span>  Although its northernmost location suggests that the Kuban begins with this city.  The slogan of Yeysk and Yeysk region sounds like this: "Kuban begins with Yeysk." </p><p>  The climate of this region is temperate continental: warm mild summers and short winters; snow does not fall earlier than the middle of the first month of winter. </p>

    <p>  The average temperature in summer, for example, in July is about +24 degrees Celsius.  In the same latitudes where the city of Yeysk is located, there are such cities as Odessa, Budapest, Tiraspol, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.  By the way, the climate of the aforementioned settlement (with regard to the average annual temperature) is similar to the climate of New York, only it is milder, and in the Russian city there are no such sharp changes in temperature and prolonged precipitation, as in the American metropolis. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  So, we found out where Yeisk is located.  Rest in this place will be wonderful.  We will share information with you on this topic.  Where this wonderful city is built and thrives, there is everything for a family holiday.  On the territory of Yeysk and the district, many water parks, modern beaches, and a dolphinarium have been built.  Now family vacations are gaining more and more popularity. And it is in such a wonderful place that any family member will find many ways to relax and have fun.  Separately, I would like to note that in the territory of the city and the district, children's camps also function successfully.  Vouchers for them are bought long before the start of the summer season. </p>

    <p>  Beach holidays are one of the standard and universal options for spending holidays or weekends.  Almost every peninsula has its own port.  So the peninsula, where Yeysk is located, was no exception.  South of the marina there is a beach called Kamenka.  The coastal zone of sand with shells gradually changes to pebbles, constant <span>tides</span> form small islands in the sea.  A beach holiday in the city is also good because swimming in a shallow sea is possible in May. </p><h2>  Healing springs </h2><p>  80 kilometers from the place where Yeysk is located, there is a wonderful lake called Khan.  It is a source of healing mud and water.  These waters are used in the eponymous sanatorium "Yeysk" with the city.  This living water has a healing effect on the human body, removes excess salts, heavy metals, radionuclides from the body, has an anti-inflammatory effect, and also improves metabolism.  One would like to say: where Yeysk is located - there is your health. </p>

    <p>  Healing mud, life-giving water and warm sunny beaches - this is not the whole city.  Yeysk is more multifaceted than it seems at first glance.  This city hosts windsurfing and water skiing competitions.  In addition, tourism, hiking, parachuting are actively developed.  Therefore, even fans of extreme sports will not be disappointed after visiting this marvelous place. </p><h2>  Beauty </h2><p>  The administration of Yeisk monitors the grooming of this port city, and therefore it is considered the greenest in the Kuban.  Moreover, the city‚Äôs architecture is actually divided into three time periods - the tsarist era, Soviet and 90s architecture.  Each of them is unique and attractive in its own way.  Around the district there are many cultural and historical monuments, so in this place there is not only where to go, but also what to pay attention to. </p><h2>  Yeisk - Hero City </h2><p>  Where is the city of Yeysk, we have already learned.  But now we recall the facts from history and find out why this village is a real hero.  During the Great Patriotic War, the city was constantly subjected to bombing from the air by German air forces.  These attacks began in April 1942.  The occupation of the city lasted until February 1943.  This time was very difficult, many people died, including 214 children in the orphanage.  Mass repressions destroyed not only human destinies, but also their small homeland.  Where Yeysk is located, there still live the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of real heroes who laid down their lives in the struggle for freedom.  This once again proves the versatility of the city.  The small town absorbed both modern blessings and the cultural heritage of their ancestors. </p><p>  The title of the resort town of Yeisk was awarded relatively recently, only in 2008.  And to this day, he does not cease to amaze us with his spiritual kindness.  This resort, in comparison with the cities of <span>Sochi, Gelendzhik,</span> Anapa and others, is the most economical in terms of spending on vacation.  In Yeisk, food and accommodation are much cheaper, although in terms of comfort this small, friendly town is in no way inferior to the more famous Kuban resorts. </p><p>  Now you know what the Yeysk settlement is, where it is located.  You can see a photo of him in our article. </p>
