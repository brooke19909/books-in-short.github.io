They develop imagination, allow you to plunge into the unique atmosphere of a real adventure.  The article lists five projects of different plans that different people will like.  Everyone can find something for themselves. </p><h2>  "Dominion" </h2><p>  Among board games for two, where games last up to 90 minutes, the Dominion should be noted.  The essence of this project is to collect a unique deck of cards that will lead the player to victory.  At the start, users have the same decks, but during the adventure they change a lot.  There are three types of cards - victory points, treasures and kingdoms.  They all have their own purpose, and it is important to maintain a balance between classes.  According to the rules, a kingdom card is played for each move and one unknown variation from the deck is bought.  It is worth noting that their properties differ even in one type, which allows you to build a wide variety of combinations.  There are many options for action, and any tactics can be built. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="board games for two" class="if uuid-2274790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2274790.jpg"></div><h2>  "Seasons" </h2><p>  In this list, the Seasons project lasts about 90 minutes.  This board game for two with dice, which indicate the seasons, can captivate for a long time.  It all starts with the analysis of the deck of nine cards each, they are taken in turn.  Next, players must divide them into three variations with an equal amount.  One of them is taken at the start of the party, and the rest can be added in the process.  There should be three dice for two players, and they allow you to move the chips forward.  The fate of the player depends on the fall of various combinations.  It is the <span>dice that</span> are responsible for the selection of new cards, the accumulation of energy and its crystallization.  The party is divided into seasons, each season has its own unique set of dice.  Victory points are awarded for the number of cards played in the process, as well as the crystals that remained at the time the competition ended.  The leader in this indicator is in first place.  A project from the list of board games for two can captivate for a long time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="arstechnica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="board games for two adults" class="if uuid-2274794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2274794.jpg"></div><h2>  "Hive" </h2><p>  If users are interested in masterpieces with shorter batches, then you should pay attention to the "Hive".  Similar board games for two adults are also suitable for children.  There is no battlefield here, and any level plane can be used as it.  Users are given eleven hexagonal figures, which are divided by color into white and black, as well as by class.  Depending on the type of insect, they can move in a special way.  White pieces go first, and a pioneer is placed on the field.  Next in turn, users must place their subordinates so that at least one face between the two of them is in contact.  A "hive" forms, and the last on the battlefield is a bee figure.  Further insects can be moved, but one face must necessarily touch the structure.  The main goal is to surround the bee of his rival.  The first one to do this is considered the winner.  Despite the difficulties in the strategy, the parties last no more than 40 minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best board games for two" class="if uuid-2274796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2274796.jpg"></div><h2>  "Lost cities" </h2><p>  Board games for two bribe people with their simplicity.  Initially, the developers wanted to do everything in the style of adventure that the audience saw on the screens in the films "The Mummy" or "Indiana Jones."  It turned out a little differently, but no less exciting.  The main goal of the desktop project is to achieve five different cities that are scattered in inaccessible places on Earth.  Routes are indicated in different colors, and the same maps are needed to advance along them.  They have their own ranks, and to advance along their path it is necessary that each time the step be higher for the previous card.  The user can conduct different expeditions at the same time, it is allowed even to five cities at once, but at the time of the end of the game penal points are awarded for an unsuccessful attempt.  After choosing a card, you can discard it, then the opponent has the right to pick.  The dynamics and sense of true adventure are guaranteed to every player. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gmtgames.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="board game for two with a cube" class="if uuid-2274800" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2274800.jpg"></div><h2>  The Twilight Fight </h2><p>  If among the best board games for two players is interested in something as complex as possible, then Twilight Fight will be the best choice.  This project models the events of the Cold War between the USA and the USSR.  The two most powerful powers of those times should establish relations with other states, find allies for themselves and at the same time prevent the start of the use of nuclear weapons.  The field is a map with different powers and a description of their features.  At the top there is a line of points, where ‚Äú-20‚Äù is the victory for the USSR, and ‚Äú20‚Äù is the USA.  The game involves 103 cards, each of which can be used in two ways: either as an event, or as a source of operation points.  They are also designed to enhance credibility in other countries on the map.  Colored tokens denote areas where it is possible to gain a foothold with one of their superpowers.  It starts with eight cards and lasts for ten rounds.  The Cold War can entice any person for a long time. </p>
