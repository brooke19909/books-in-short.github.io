This appeal arose a long time ago.

    <h2>  Tales of the origin of the name </h2><p>  There are several options for the origin of the name of this river.  Once upon a time, in the village, on the shore of an unnamed rivulet, lived a guy Vet and a girl Luga, who wanted to get married.  However, the girl‚Äôs father was categorically against their marriage.  Then Vet was going to swim for gold to prove - he is an enviable groom.  During his absence, Luga came to the riverbank daily and sat waiting for her lover.  But one night a terrible storm broke out, as a result of which the ship Veta threw herself on the rocks, and the young man drowned.  Learning about this, heartbroken Luga threw herself into the stream and drowned, as she could not live without her beloved.  Since then Vetluga is a river named in memory of that distant story of unhappy feelings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, another version of why the pond is called that way is not so romantic.  The fact is that there were dense willow thickets on the banks of the river, and the ‚Äúwinds‚Äù were a variety of these trees.  Also, there is a translation of the word Vetluga from the ancient Mari: ‚Äúyuga‚Äù is a river, and ‚Äúveteli‚Äù is a gull, more precisely, ‚ÄúRiver of gulls‚Äù.  Most likely, during the time of the Mari settlers over the water surface, one could observe countless seagulls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation facilities on the Vetluga River" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1126874.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <h2>  River features </h2><p>  Vetluga is a river that has a slow course, which makes it accessible to all comers.  It is worth noting that the reservoir is navigable 700 km from the mouth.  The banks of the stream are mostly high, some reach 63 m, and at the source - as much as 147 m! </p><p>  The river freezes from the beginning of November to April, and replenishes the water reserves with melting snow.  The average speed of Vetluga is about 7 km / h, and in some places the width reaches 50 m. On the total length of the coast, for the most part, it is overgrown with coniferous forest: fir, pine and spruce.  The water stream is meandering, but there are few islands.  Its bottom is predominantly silty, but near the tributary of the Paozer it becomes shallow and rocky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="river Vetluga fishing" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1126873.jpg" width="600"></div>

An amazing panorama of the Vetluzhsky open spaces opens from this village.  Many settlements are located on the coastal line of the river: Krasny Yar, Podlysikha, Karasikha, Kladovka, Spasskoye and the village named after Mikheev, in which tourists rafting along Vetluga can stay for the night. </p><h2>  The value of the river and points located on its banks </h2><p>  Vetluga is a river that flows into the <span>Cheboksary reservoir,</span> and the city of Sharya stands on its shore.  It has a logging plant, and countless logs are transported along rafts along the riverbed.  It is worth highlighting the village of <span>Red Baks,</span> also located on the banks of Vetluga.  It produces devices for aviation radio communications and medical equipment. </p><h2>  Vetluga River: fishing </h2><p>  We should also talk about the living creatures that inhabit the river basin.  Just a huge number of fish: pike, zander, perch, asp, catfish, burbot.  I must say that sterlet is also found, which, of course, indicates the purity of river water.  Well caught on a spinning ide.  This area is a paradise for fishermen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vetluga river photo" class="if" height="465" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1126871.jpg" width="600"></div>
