A similar concept in our country is not yet very common.  In fact, this is a small hotel category "economy".  Today, this type of accommodation on vacation is gradually becoming a worthy alternative to large hotels that have become familiar to tourists, in which the cost of a room can range from fifty to one hundred dollars per day.  Such accommodation, especially in times of crisis, is far from acceptable to everyone.  The prices at the ecotel are significantly lower, and they are provided due to the most rational service and the availability of a smaller staff. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ecotel Snegirek" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1242944.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  In addition to low cost, residents have the opportunity to appreciate the home-like atmosphere, as well as an individual approach to each tourist, which is a rarity in a large hotel.  Moreover, not everyone loves a hotel, restaurant, casino or night club.  And in such cases, the most optimal solution becomes the choice of a small ecotel, isolated from noise and fuss.  I must say that this vacation is perfect for families with young children or the elderly.  To summarize all of the above, the following conclusion can be made: Ecotel is an excellent choice for those who first of all appreciate the level of hotel service and home comfort, as well as for those who, wanting to save money, seek to get maximum comfort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The services provided here, as a rule, do not qualify for stardom.  However, in terms of service and comfort, almost all existing ecotels meet generally recognized hotel standards, and in some cases even surpass them.  As a rule, the housing stock in them does not exceed fifty - seventy rooms.  And the comfort and service of such establishments are comparable only with the format of 4 or 5 stars.  The Ecotel Snegirek, located in the Moscow Region, has all these indisputable advantages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ecotel Snegirek reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1243571.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  A wonderful complex consisting of a hotel and sports and entertainment facilities is an excellent solution for those who travel outside the city for several days.  In an ecologically clean natural corner of the Moscow Region, the Snegirek Ecotel (Istra) is located.  Once upon a time, this area was covered by dense pine and spruce forests.  For many, this "European taiga" becomes a zone of relaxation and carefree enjoyment.  Ecotel ‚ÄúSnegirek‚Äù, whose photo is a complete confirmation of what was said, has recently become very popular among vacationers.  It is believed that the local climate is very favorable not only for recreation, but also for treatment.  The surroundings of the complex are one of the most picturesque in the suburbs.  <span>The beautiful river Istra</span> flows only four kilometers south. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The cultural and sports complex - Ecotel Snegirek - is located twenty-five kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road.  You can get to it along the <span>Volokolamsk highway.</span>  The holiday home is located near the railway station under the similar name Snegiri.  On its green territory several residential buildings were built.  You can come here not only by private car, but also by public transport: from the Tushinskaya metro station, take the 372 bus and get off at the third stop in the Snegiri village. </p><p>  Those who ride their car should move along the Volokolamsk direction through Krasnogorsk, then along the Novo-Riga highway, find a turn to Istra and turn off.  Then go straight to the village.  An electric train also goes there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ecotel Snegirek photo" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1242949.jpg" width="600"></div>

There is a dance floor, in the evenings - live music.  The beautiful design in the form of open terraces and in the style of traditional Russian estates, creating a festive mood, contributed to the fact that weddings and banquets are often held here.

Ecotel ‚ÄúSnegirek‚Äù, reviews of which is mostly positive, suits guests not only by its number of rooms, but also by its excellent territory and food.  Many people hold collective events here, since there are many types of halls in the restaurant for every taste and budget. </p><p>  For regular customers at the ecotel there is a system of discounts.  Among the minuses, guests note the poor illumination of the territory around the second building and the lack of disposable sheets in the speleological chamber.  And the rest I liked the Ecotel, many plan to return here more than once. </p>
