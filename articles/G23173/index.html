    <p>  National policy has always been part of the activities of any state.  It must regulate any <span>international relations of</span> society.  Its directions and goals directly depend on the orientation of state policy.  Some countries specifically incite <span>ethnic conflicts.</span>  This approach is characteristic of fascist (nationalist) regimes. </p><p>  National policy in developed democracies, on the contrary, is based on the principles of respect for all people, regardless of their origin.  The state policy in them is aimed at the formation of tolerance, cooperation and close rapprochement of nations.  The main value in democratic countries is the life of a person, as well as his freedom and rights, regardless of his nationality.  The meaning of a democratic and humanistic policy is the maximum coordination of the interests of different peoples, their implementation on the principles of respect for each person.  National policy is a system of measures of state influence, designed to create favorable conditions for each individual and all peoples. </p><p>  An important task is the prevention of possible conflicts on the basis of national hostility.  The national policy of Russia has very complex and important tasks for resolving emerging problems in a <span>multinational country.</span>  For this, it is necessary to carry out clearly thought-out actions, on the one hand aimed at preserving and developing the identity of all peoples, and on the other hand, at maintaining the integrity of the state.  Russian national policy, as in other <span>democratic countries, is</span> based on the documents that define this policy.  Such documents include the Constitution of the Russian Federation and the "Concept of the National Policy of the Russian Federation."  Their main principles are as follows: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - equality of freedoms and rights regardless of race and nationality; </p><p>  - the prohibition of restricting the rights of citizens; </p><p>  - equal rights; </p><p>  - guarantee of all rights; </p><p>  - promoting the development of languages ‚Äã‚Äãand cultures. </p><p>  The consistent implementation of these <span>constitutional principles</span> meets the vital interests of all peoples living in the country. </p><p>  The national policy of different states can change its character from ethnic cleansing and national terror, artificial assimilation, to partially political or full cultural autonomy of different peoples.  In essence, it reflects the policy of the multinational state in relation to the peoples living in it. </p><p>  In Russia, this policy is aimed at the evolutionary development of the full national life of all peoples within the federation and at creating equal relations between them, the formation of mechanisms for resolving any conflicts.  Any, even a small people living in the country, are granted all rights (up to the granting of territories for state national formations).  It is believed that such a national policy of the Russian government really allows you to maintain a very precarious international balance.  Recently, there have been outlined the main trends in national life, its likely prospects, allowing to formulate proposals for the international consolidation of Russian citizens and to strengthen its unity and statehood: </p><p>  - it is necessary to develop a scientific theory of harmonization of interethnic relations and the vital programs of our society corresponding to it; </p><p>  - creating a program of action based on practical and legal compliance with regional and national all subjects of the Federation; </p><p>  - the revival of a great and strong power with a developed economy and democratic orders. </p>
