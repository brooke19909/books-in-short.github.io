Facts say that our ancestral home was Africa.  <span>The first people</span> on Earth appeared about 165 thousand years ago.  Approximately this age, the sites of <span>an ancient man</span> were found <span>.</span>  The first people could do nothing more than gather food that the ocean supplied in abundance.  They hardly adapted to the conditions of the jungle, armed themselves and gradually moved deeper into the continent.  But if almost every stage of the development of civilization has already been studied, then the place where the first people appeared has not yet been officially found. </p>

    <p>  A thorough analysis by American scientists concluded that South Africa had become the cradle of humanity.  It was the ‚Äúblack‚Äù continent that became the place where the first people appeared.  Pinekle Point caves proudly above the ocean were inhabited by our ancestors.  To this day, the Kung-san tribe lives there, its inhabitants are the oldest group that could survive in the modern world.  From the moment the first people appeared at the Pinekl Point caves, to this day, the Kung-san tribe has remained at the first stage of development.  People of this tribe are still engaged in hunting and gathering seafood, feed on shellfish and algae. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many scientists argue that mankind came out of Africa precisely for the reason that only there could survive after the onset of the ice age.  There is an opinion that every 20-30 thousand years on the planet there is a sharp cooling.  The planet is covered with a crust of ice, many areas become unsuitable for life.  The coast of Africa is able to feed a small group of people.  Moreover, you do not need to make any efforts to get food. </p>

Evidence of this is the stories of Herodotus and records in the Indian Vedas, which tell of the existence in the distant past of several highly developed civilizations.  The ruins found in India prove that the city was destroyed by a nuclear strike.  There is a lot of evidence of the existence of highly developed civilizations in the past.  It is believed that a conflict occurred between them, resulting in a <span>nuclear war.</span>  Perhaps the surviving Atlanteans or Lemurians settled with the ancient Egyptians.  They became gods whom they began to worship and offer sacrifices.

    <p>  The indirect evidence that ancient civilizations sought refuge in non-radiation-contaminated areas is Machu Picchu.  Many scholars claim that it was built by the Incas, but not one of them can clearly answer one question: ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù. </p>

It has the right smooth streets, houses of nobility and even a palace.  Why it is unknown to the tribes that had a <span>mass of land to</span> build a shelter in the mountains.  There is an opinion that the city was built by an extraterrestrial civilization, but it is quite possible that they were residents of the fallen Atlantis or Lemuria.

    <p>  <span>The origin of man</span> is shrouded in mystery behind seven seals.  People of science cannot understand the history of their states, and the origin of civilization is completely full of huge white spots.  Be that as it may, scientists bit by bit manage to restore the events of bygone years. </p>
