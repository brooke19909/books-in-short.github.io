Victims of war, political repression</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sometimes, looking through the historical chronicles of many centuries, one can draw one simple but extremely unpleasant conclusion - no events will probably ever teach mankind to value its clan and clan.  Unfortunately, we are constantly destroying each other.  Even in the modern world, filled with the latest technology, there is always a place for those injured at the hands of the like.  Victims are like marks of certain milestones in the history of mankind, because it so happened - every significant event carries victims. </p><h2>  Fascism </h2><p>  Probably no one has ever mocked people in the entire history of the formation of the world, as the Nazis did during the Second World War.  Perhaps someone’s knowledge of those troubled times was replenished with the stories of grandfathers and grandmothers, but let's recall what the Nazis loved so cruelly and heartlessly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Victims of Fascism" border="0" class="if" height="222" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26834/591621.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <p>  The struggle for the purity of the nation, the extermination of Soviet women and <span>children, the Holocaust, the</span> blockade - all these sad historical events brought the victims of fascism in the summer.  The Nazi troops did not stand on ceremony for a long time: they entered tanks in the cities, burned cattle, raped women, took their children to minions.  Nobody argues, the Germans are ashamed of their ancestors - and this is perhaps one of the few examples of when people thought better of it and realized their mistakes years later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the days of fascism, several million innocent people died.  And I really want to believe that such a thing will never happen again on our planet.  Otherwise, why do we live if we don’t learn anything ?! </p><h2>  The terrible fall of 2004: a chronicle of events </h2><p>  Do you remember what happened in the fall of 2004?  The whole world was shocked by terrible news: in the small town of Beslan, in North Ossetia, the terrorists seized school No. 1, without waiting for the end of the solemn line in honor of the start of the school year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Victims of Beslan" border="0" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26834/596078.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Literally in the first hours of the terrible event, the attackers mined the gym and organized a fire with law enforcement agencies.  Three passers-by were injured - these were the first victims of Beslan.  Well, then everything was like in a nightmare: terrorists demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya and the release of the raiders captured a week earlier in Ingushetia. </p><p>  Attackers could not be persuaded to accept the ransom and release the hostages.  And only on the second day of the nightmare rescuers were able to get the withdrawal of two and a half dozen mothers with babies. </p><p>  The nightmare ended on the third day.  The assault lasted until midnight, few hostages managed to survive, and only one terrorist, who is now serving a life sentence in one of the colonies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dirty reckoning the cleanest on earth </h2><p>  Perhaps the victims of Beslan became the final result in demonstrative terrorist acts, which often happened on the territory of the Russian Federation in the early 2000s.  It is still unclear why, on that September day, the dirty games of military commanders chose innocent children as retribution.  It is terrible to admit, but in this case, the victims are little angels who have just begun their lives. </p><p>  More than fifty families of the city lost someone in this terrible and dishonest game.  The bodies of the dead are buried in the memorial cemetery in Beslan called “City of Angels”, in the center of which a monument to victims and rescuers is erected.  At the moment, this little town in North Ossetia is rather a living memory of those sad events of 2004, and, unfortunately, this bad name will remain forever.  All of Russia annually honors the memory of those accidentally killed in a school that has long been a living relic. </p>

    <h2>  Victims of repression: those responsible for their civic duty </h2><p>  Politics will always remain one of the main reasons for the appearance of ever new victims in world history.  It is hard to look at how children suffer, but no less frost on the skin when people are punished for their political views.  Victims of <span>political repression</span> are some of the saddest evidence of the blatant absurdity and injustice of the post-Soviet government. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Any self-respecting person remembers from the school history textbooks about the terrible events of the 30s of the last century, when Comrade Stalin at one of the meetings of the Central Committee of the CPSU announced his decision to radically fight the followers of democratic trends in the USSR. </p><p>  I don’t want to remember how many innocent people were branded “Trotskyist”.  It is amazing that even suspicious individuals, and even those who supported the activities of Comrade Stalin, were punished. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Victims of Political Repression" border="0" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26834/591640.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Victims of political repressions of that time were divided into two categories: the first were sent to exile for decades, and those assigned to the second category were shot on the spot. </p><p>  The wives of the convicts had to follow their loved ones throughout the country in order to preserve their families, some left broken families, orphans, and all this is very undeserved - just the circumstances were not in their favor. </p><p>  Many committed suicide, not sustaining the injustice of the regime.  It is scary to think that we all live on a planet filled with blood and undeserved suffering, but, alas, this is our story. </p><h2>  The war today: why haven’t we learned anything? </h2><p>  If we talk about victims, then unpleasant images of those circumstances that led to the fratricidal wars caused by the cruelty of people immediately come to mind.  Yes, people are cruel at all times and there is nothing to be done about it.  We are not taught historical facts marked by sad bloody events. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Victims are ..." border="0" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26834/596081.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  Sometimes it seems that sacrifices are an integral part of life, and that nothing will change tomorrow.  And that revaluation of values ​​will not happen even after a millennium.  It turns out that in the world of nanotechnology and scientific progress, people are still interested in sharing power and territory, and while this interest will be present in the intentions of people, there will be victims in dirty political games.  The victims will be children, women and the elderly, innocent.  This is life, this is our story.  But do not we create it like that? </p><p>  The victims of war are scary, they are bloody, they are not shooting at all and they are not exile.  In war, a painful death occurs much more often than painless and quick.  During the war, you can lose not only your own life and health, but also shelter, loved ones and relatives. </p><h2>  Sad today </h2><p>  The whole world, with bated breath, is following the sad events taking place in eastern Ukraine, which are also commonly called <span>anti-terrorist operations.</span>  But let's admit at least to ourselves: no matter what they are called, civilians on both sides of the barricades suffer the most. </p><p>  It is hard to imagine, but today, perhaps even at that very moment, someone’s house is being destroyed by a shell, thereby destroying everything that an ordinary, innocent person has equipped for years throughout his life.  It’s scary to think, but every day some mother loses her son, and even more terrible to think that this son is a schoolboy who was killed by an accidental fragment in the street. </p><p>  Victims are our acquaintances, perhaps even someone’s friends and relatives.  But why, realizing all the horror of the situation, we can not stop this?  Cruelty is in our hearts, and, believe me, not a single telecast or newspaper can convey all the pain that everyone has to experience today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="war victims" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/598387.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to honor memory today </h2><p>  Let us hold a special opinion - the memory of the dead must be honored unambiguously, but the memory of the victims of innocent people must also be given credit.  In every civilized country, there is a practice of minutes of silence, days of mourning and lowered flags. </p><p>  Walking through an unfamiliar city, especially in those places where sad events happened, each of you can stumble upon the monuments and monuments to the victims of various repressions, wars and terrorist acts. </p><p>  If it’s not difficult, lay flowers to those who suffered for our future, light a candle.  Each of us must be responsible for what happened and try to do everything possible to prevent sacrifice in the future. </p>

    <p>  Any accidental death should be respected - do not neglect the minutes of silence.  We must learn to learn the right lessons from history and not make the mistakes our ancestors made.  No politics costs human lives, not a single kilometer of the conquered territory can be exchanged for someone’s destroyed house, not a single government will succeed if it was established through pain and suffering.  Let’s get better - it’s only from us and from no one else what will happen tomorrow and in decades.  And sometimes the one who sacrifices people can become the victim itself. </p>
