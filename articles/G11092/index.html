  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The sound disappears on the tablet: what to do, how to configure it?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Problems with tablets, as with smartphones, happen quite often.  Moreover, this happens both in budget models and in more expensive ones.  They can be caused by unfair assembly, cheap materials, improper operation and system failures.  It often happens that the sound disappears on the tablet, and not everyone knows what to do with it. </p><h2>  Problem </h2><p>  If before the tablet was a tool for work, now it is often purchased as a gadget for entertainment.  And despite the increased size of smartphones and their powerful performance, the tablet market is still afloat. </p><p>  When the sound disappears on the tablet, many begin to think about poor assembly and poor-quality materials.  And some may indeed be right.  But more often than not, a similar problem may lie in a regular system failure. </p><p>  Having figured out the issue, everyone can easily fix the problem on their own.  In this case, you will not need to carry the tablet for repair and spend money on the service. </p><h2>  Causes of the problem </h2><p>  If there is no sound on the tablet or it has become quieter, you need to understand the reasons for this.  The most common configuration problems are: </p><ul><li>  random mute; </li><li>  use of "silent" mode; </li><li>  selection of a specific sound profile; </li><li>  hardware failure. </li></ul><p>  All these problems are solved by a simple setup at the initial diagnosis.  But there are more complex reasons - mechanical failure.  In this case, the sound module, audio jack, and speakers may fail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The sound disappears" class="if uuid-3017174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3017174.jpg"></div><p>  There are also more complex software crashes.  It‚Äôs more difficult to cope with them.  It is sometimes much easier to reset to factory settings to get rid of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mechanical breakdown </h2><p>  So, the most unpleasant option is a mechanical breakdown.  If the sound disappears on the tablet because of it, then you will have to contact the service center.  We can talk about factory marriage.  In this case, the problem is determined in the first hours after the purchase, so it is enough to return the device to the store. </p><p>  The problem may be due to the failure of the sound chipset, speaker or connector.  If you have a guarantee for a tablet, then you should immediately bring it to a service center.  But you need to understand if the reason is careless operation, you will have to pay for repairs. </p><p>  Also, many note that the sound comes from the speakers, but it is not in the headphones.  Here the obvious problem is in the headset.  Just connect it to any other device. </p><p>  The situation is the opposite: there is sound in the headphones, but not in the speakers.  Most often, the switch is located in the connector itself.  It may oxidize, and a similar situation will occur.  There may be a temporary glitch that will pass in a few minutes, or it may be necessary to carry the tablet for repair to replace this switch. </p><p>  Of course, you can try to fix the tablet with a mechanical breakdown yourself.  But you should understand that in this case you are at risk.  In the process of self-repair, you can accidentally damage the contacts or break some part. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.learningmultipleintelligence.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Speaker issues" class="if uuid-3017180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3017180.jpg"></div><h2>  Device setup </h2><p>  If you are still sure that the sound does not disappear on the tablet due to mechanical breakdowns, you should start the diagnosis with the settings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As mentioned earlier, the most common mistake is incorrect configuration.  Sometimes the user can independently turn off the sound.  This happens if you adjust the volume to a minimum.  Some models turn on the silent mode. </p><p>  If this happens, a crossed-out speaker will appear in the status bar.  You need to lower the curtain and select a mode.  You can do this from the settings menu.  Passing to the section with sound, you can configure the desired mode. </p><p>  By the way, it's worth it to see the profiles here.  You may have configured them incorrectly.  It happens that the entire profile is configured for a loud call and notification signals, but one of the sliders was accidentally twisted to a minimum.  After saving the profile, messages can come with sound, and all other processes occur without it. </p><h2>  Tablet volume </h2><p>  How to increase the sound on the tablet?  Firstly, for this there is a volume rocker on the side of the device.  Thanks to her, you can do it quieter or louder.  Secondly, you can go to the settings.  Sometimes the overall volume of all sounds can be screwed on.  Just set the slider to the desired value. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The sound is quiet" class="if uuid-3017176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3017176.jpg"></div><p>  Thirdly, the problem may be in the media player.  Suppose you download a movie and turn it on.  But you do not understand why the tablet has a quiet sound.  This may be due to the fact that the player itself is set to minimum volume.  Also, the cause may be the program itself for playback.  It is worth trying to reinstall it or find an analogue. </p><h2>  Software crashes </h2><p>  Most often they happen with cheap devices.  For example, the Window tablet, which was apparently released in order for many to think that it is on the Windows operating system, is a budget model. </p><p>  This option is usually purchased for children and their games.  The system in it is weak, and the hardware is poor in performance.  Therefore, software crashes happen here often. </p><p>  If you have a more or less expensive tablet in your hands, then similar problems can occur with it.  Most often they are associated with Android, which is already underdeveloped. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sound setting" class="if uuid-3017178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3017178.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes a sound may appear immediately after a reboot.  But it is best to do a complete diagnosis.  After rebooting, you can install an antivirus program.  Sometimes viruses can cause a decrease in sound volume.  Although it is not always possible to deal with them in this way. </p><p>  It is worth mentioning about different programs that could reconfigure the sound.  For example, some optimizer utilities may not work correctly.  More precisely, they carry out their work conscientiously, but sometimes they harm the system itself.  In pursuit of speeding up the OS, they complete some of the processes that were actually important. </p><p>  It is also worth looking at special applications to improve sound.  Some users believe that such utilities can further increase the volume of signals and improve quality.  But in fact, such programs practically do not exist.  More often they harm than help. </p><h2>  Cardinal method </h2><p>  If all else fails, there is the last option - reset to factory settings.  This is a command that allows you to delete everything that is on the tablet in order to return to its original state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tablet repair" class="if uuid-3017179" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3017179.jpg"></div><p>  Depending on the tablet model, there are several ways to reset.  The easiest way is to go to the settings and find the corresponding menu.  Sometimes the option is in the ‚ÄúAbout phone‚Äù or ‚ÄúMemory and backups‚Äù section. </p><p>  If for some reason you did not find this function in the settings, you can start it using the device keys.  You need to turn off the tablet, hold down the volume up and power button, wait for the launch of a special menu.  In the list you need to find the line Hard Reset or Wipe Data / Factory Reset. </p><p>  After rebooting the tablet, if the reason was precisely in a software failure, a sound will appear.  If this does not help, then you will have to contact the service center. </p>
