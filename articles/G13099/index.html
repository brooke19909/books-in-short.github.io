Reviews of its performance are of a different nature, but it is known for certain that the smartphone has a 4.7-inch screen as well as unambiguous advantages, as well as support for LTE technology.  The filling is rated as quite powerful, and we will also deal with it in one of the paragraphs of this article.  The smartphone will be able to please its user with high-quality sound reproduction.  Well, of course, it could not do without a financial factor.  Many people who have already purchased HTC Desire 510 also talk about it. <span>Reviews are reviews,</span> but our business is to sort them all out so that it becomes clear how relevant the purchase of this device can be. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  This device is made of plastic.  At the first <span>tactile contact,</span> you can feel the roughness of the material.  However, do not think that this is a minus.  Rather, the opposite.  Such a roughness of the material will benefit the smartphone only. </p><p>  Users who have experience with several HTC smartphones will immediately note the fact that the design is quite typical for this model range of devices.  The same can be noticed by just lovers of the company.  Typicality is manifested in recognizable at first glance geometric shapes and rounded corners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we talk about the strength of the smartphone, about the quality of its assembly, then out of 5 points you can put a solid 4. But not at all lower.  The fact is that the metal used in the manufacture of other HTC models will, of course, be stronger.  However, even though the HTC Desire 510, whose reviews are positive, was made of plastic, the design did not lose stability.  In general, the model has good build quality, the design is very, very reliable. </p><p>  Considering the dimensions, it is worth touching the thickness of the device.  She is a little less than a centimeter.  And to be more precise, it is 9.99 millimeters.  But even with such an indicator, adding HTC Desire 510 smartphone to the list of thin devices will not work.  Considering the fact that now <span>thin models are</span> generally considered to be models that have a thickness of about 6-7 millimeters, talking about this factor in the case of the Desire 510 does not make sense. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  Nothing supernatural can be found in the box.  The set includes documentation and instructions, a charging unit, a USB-type cable for it, a smartphone, a battery for it, as well as a wired headset.  It is worth noting that if you are a lover of quality music, then this headset is clearly not necessary to use. </p><p>  In the store you can purchase other accessories for the model.  These are spare batteries, and headsets that work on the principle of Bluetooth wireless technology, and cases that will protect the phone from quick wear, and so on. </p><h2>  Communications </h2>

    <p>  In the model you can find two connectors.  One port is allocated for connecting a charger and has a MicroUSB interface, and the second involves connecting a wired headset standard 3.5 mm.  The phone supports the integration of memory cards, the maximum amount of which can reach 128 GB.  The type of memory card is MicroSD.  In the case of HTC Desire 510, reviews say that without a memory card, they will not be used for a long time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In terms of communication technologies, the customer model will not please anything special and extravagant, however, the communication standards that are in the phone work, which is said to be glorious. </p><p>  Wireless capabilities include the operation of Glonass and GPS, as well as Bluetooth version 4.0.  Since we are already talking about wireless networks, it is worth mentioning that Wi-Fi works with the standards "b", "g" and "n".  Reception of a signal from wireless connection distributors is quite high quality.  Cellular networks operate in GSM, LTE, 3G and EDGE modes. </p><p>  Talking on the phone, you will not notice any extraneous noise.  The sound from the speaker is of high quality, the interlocutor‚Äôs speech is quite legible.  HTC users were a little surprised by this, since they did not expect such quality from the model. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  If you evaluate the camera according to modern standards, it will look very modest compared to other models.  The resolution of the main camera is 4 MP.  The front camera is 0.3 MP.  When shooting from the main camera, the images have a resolution of 2560 by 1440 pixels, and when shooting with an additional - 640 by 480 pixels. </p><p>  Of course, if you compare the mobile phone HTC Desire 510 with models similar in price, then its photosensors significantly benefit.  But against the background of the so-called camera phones, which, for example, include the iPhone 5s, the device does not even look faded - it does not look at all. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is unlikely that it will be possible to get sharpness and natural colors from pictures.  How the focus in the model is arranged is incomprehensible even to specialists.  Shooting in poor light will produce even more illegible results, and you can forget about shooting in the dark. </p><p>  Even though the video from the camera is recorded in HD, it also has problems with display and clarity.  The frames are blurry, and the entire video fragment is somewhat intermittent. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  One of the factors that the device can please the people who bought it is the screen of HTC Desire 510. The review allows us to conclude that the screen, in principle, is averaged in quality.  So to say, the perfect example of the ratio "price - quality". </p><p>  The screen diagonal of the model is relatively large.  It is, as mentioned earlier, 4.7 inches, which, in principle, is very good.  <span>The touch screen</span> can respond to 5 simultaneous touches.  If you place the screen close enough to your eyes, you can clearly see the pixels.  However, this does not interfere with the use of a smartphone. </p><p>  That's what was really unfinished in the device, so these are the viewing angles.  They are very small, and when you turn the device in different planes, you can perfectly observe the aberrations on the screen.  The brightness depending on the rotation can disappear, then appear, and sometimes color distortion is observed. </p><p>  It may be that not so much money was saved in the manufacture of the HTC screens, but nevertheless they did.  Before buying a device, think a few times about whether you will be pleased to deal with such images of not the best quality.  If you like to watch videos on smartphones, then this model is clearly not created for you. </p><h2>  HTC Desire 510: performance review </h2>

    <p>  The device is based on Qualcomm <span>Snapdragon 410.</span> Adreno 306 acts as a graphics accelerator. The performance due to this combination is average.  The processor supports 64-bit type calculations, that‚Äôs what is important. </p><p>  It contains 4 cores that operate at a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  In principle, this is not so much, but for the average user it is quite enough.  It is worth noting that special tests were conducted, the purpose of which was to identify the level of performance.  The HTC Desire 510 phone in them has established itself as a completely reliable device. </p><p>  Modern games for the Android operating system are launched without any problems on this smartphone, and there are no ‚Äúlags‚Äù or ‚Äúglitches‚Äù.  If the device is turned off, you can fully activate it in a quarter of a minute.  Surprisingly, the operating system functions quite vigorously.  The phone will please the buyer of HTC Desire 510 with its work. Characteristics show that there should not be any freezes in the operation of the operating system.  In practice, this is confirmed. </p><h2>  Memory </h2>

    <p>  HTC Desire 510 White, like models of a different color, has in its design 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB long-term.  As mentioned earlier, the purchase of a flash drive will become a necessity rather than a luxury, since only 4 GB of available memory is available to the user for personal use. </p><p>  The situation is even worse with the RAM: out of 1 GB, only a third is available.  To run multiple applications at the same time, this is not enough, but the stability of one running game will be at the level, that's for sure. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>

    <p>  The battery of the device is quite capacious - 8 Wh.  Energy consumption, according to the manufacturer, has been optimized.  If this is true, then it was optimization that played a role in improving the energy efficiency of the HTC Desire 510 White smartphone. </p><p>  Active users who can‚Äôt imagine the device‚Äôs work without being constantly on the world‚Äôs network will be delighted to learn that the smartphone‚Äôs battery is designed for almost 10 hours of continuous surfing.  About 7 hours you can continuously watch various films and videos.  Ordinary users with this phone with autonomous power will be able to use the whole day. </p><h2>  HTC Desire 510: price and relevance </h2><p>  In conclusion, we summarize some of the results.  Smartphone HTC Desire 510 and more expensive phones are clearly not competitors.  The point here is not one criterion, but the whole list.  Just recall the camera of the device, this in some cases may already be enough. </p><p>  No one argues that the screen is impressive in size.  However, the quality of its display so far leaves much to be desired.  At the same time, HTC Desire 510 has many positive aspects. Features, for example.  Its processor provides good performance, the cores can solve even complex problems, and communications provide uninterrupted communication. </p><p>  In the case of this model, another positive criterion that allows you to make a choice in favor of HTC Desire 510 is the price.  She is a little less than 11 thousand rubles. </p><p>  If we talk about the relevance of the purchase, then it can be done by people who need a phone only to talk and exchange text messages, and active users who prefer to use a smartphone as a means of surfing.  You can buy a device for a child, performance is quite enough for various games. </p><p>  HTC Desire 510 will not be a good choice for lovers of photo and video, high-quality images and watching movies due to the relatively poor quality of color display. </p>
