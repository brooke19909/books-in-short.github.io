    <p>  It is very convenient that there is a children's room where qualified carers look after the kids.  There is no need to additionally buy food or dine in the restaurant, as the food is excellent.  Even economy rooms are fully equipped with everything you need.  Another advantage is the wide coastline, so hundreds of vacationers on the beach do not interfere with each other. </p>
