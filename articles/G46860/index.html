Not only girls want to look good in photographs, especially those shared on social networks, but men too.  It is widely believed among professional photographers that there are no non-photogenic people in the world.  You just need to set the light correctly, find a suitable angle, think over the background and, of course, prepare for the shooting of the person himself. </p><h2>  How to prepare? </h2><p>  In how to take photos beautifully, some preparatory moments are important, without which neither studio shooting nor a phone selfie in the fitting room of the store will succeed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="An example of a failed selfie result" class="if uuid-2407636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71663/2407636.jpg"></div><p>  What you should pay attention to: </p><ul><li>  clothes; </li><li>  makeup and the face itself; </li><li>  hairstyle; </li><li>  body; </li><li>  postures. </li></ul><p>  Each of these points is important for the final result in the picture.  Without attention to them, only random photographs are successfully obtained when the model does not realize that they are taking it. </p><h2>  clothing </h2><p>  A person who is intentionally going to be photographed needs to be dressed in something.  Or, on the contrary, undress.  In how to take photos beautifully, clothes play no less role than facial expressions.  It is things that half create the notorious photogenicity or its absence.  The best option is plain clothes that contrast with the overall background of the picture.  By choosing things of soft light tones for shooting on a white background, the effect of tenderness, youth, defenselessness and fragility is achieved.  Choosing saturated dark colors for photography on a black background, you can get the opposite effect - power, ‚Äúvamp‚Äù, brutality, a demonstration of power and a hard character. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For erotic images, do not completely undress or stay in underwear.  A rare person can boast an impeccable beautiful body, of course, if he does not deal with himself purposefully.  A win-win option for a girl is a man‚Äôs large shirt, and for a man, an unbuttoned shirt, jeans on his hips or a bath towel.  Underwear on photosets often looks vulgar or looks like an advertisement.  It distracts from the model and destroys the image.  This is important to consider not only when taking photos, but also when taking pictures of yourself on the phone. </p><h2>  Face and makeup </h2><p>  Not for nothing all over the world make-up artists work before any shootings with models.  Makeup for a photo shoot is fundamentally different from everyday.  On the question of how to take a beautiful photo, the correction of facial contours is important.  That is, highlighting some areas with light and dimming others. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avto.goodfon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The camera loves bright makeup." class="if uuid-2407663" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71663/2407663.jpg"></div><p>  Makeup is applied after the correction of contours.  It can be anything, but it should be combined with the general style of shooting and fit the model.  Makeup for photography has one rule - there is never much makeup.  This is true, the camera "loves" rich, bright, contrasting types of makeup.  However, a reasonable approach is also necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãdo not paint the eyelids with pink or light green shades, if you do not plan a thematic photoset for the carnival. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hairstyle </h2><p>  Paradoxical as it may seem, but in how beautifully you take a photo, the hairstyle plays a secondary role.  The main thing is that it is combined with the general image of the model, there are no other requirements for hair.  Of course, if you need to hide any defects, for example, deep wrinkles on the forehead or a large birthmark, then you need to select a specific hairstyle, in other cases it is not important. </p><h2>  Body </h2><p>  When planning to be photographed, you need to carefully examine yourself.  Attention should be paid to such parts of the body: </p><ul><li>  hands (hands, palms, nails, fingers); </li><li>  elbows </li><li>  caviar; </li><li>  knees; </li><li>  forearm </li><li>  neckline area; </li><li>  neck. </li></ul><p>  In principle, everything that gets into the frame deserves attention.  Of course, pink female forearms covered with dark hairs can be processed in Photoshop and other programs.  There you can also tighten the sagging male neck.  However, it is much easier to eliminate these disabilities or to mask them. </p><h2>  Poses </h2><p>  There are certain classic poses for photographs, both full-length and portrait.  Some of them are placed as an example in the photo in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.pinterest.com/daxadevda/pose/?e_t=3a6c92151b494d5a96f434b08fc7bfc4"><img itemprop="image" alt="There are a lot of beautiful poses" class="if uuid-2409534" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71663/2409534.jpg"></div><p>  As for the portraits, the ‚Äúposes‚Äù of the face are extremely important not only for selfies, but also for full-length photoshoots.  Not every photographer will tell the model that her / his face expression is unsuccessful.  Therefore, you need to study yourself in front of the mirror and remember the most winning expressions and angles. </p><h2>  Best and simple photoset ideas </h2><p>  If there is a person nearby with a camera, the sun is shining on the street, and the eyes are glowing from the inside, then it's time to take beautiful pictures. </p><p>  It is always natural and beautiful to get summer and autumn pictures in the sunshine: </p><ul><li>  with balls - they need a lot, different; </li><li>  among leaves or coniferous branches - the model looks at such frames because of them; </li><li>  with flowers - for a photo you can ask for a bouquet, and not purchase it on purpose; </li><li>  on the steps; </li><li>  because of the columns; </li><li>  near the water; </li><li>  behind a water bus, against the sky and gulls catching a ship; </li><li>  under the bridge, in the lumen of two canvases; </li><li>  on a motorcycle; </li><li>  on the hood or roof of the car; </li><li>  on the grass; </li><li>  among burdocks or dandelions; </li><li>  on the line of sand by the river, from the back; </li><li>  on the dark "fresh" asphalt; </li><li>  in a store or market, amid an abundance of fruit; </li><li>  on the roofs; </li><li>  among pigeons - these birds are in almost all areas; </li><li>  in contact zoos. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="wallhere.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://wallhere.com/en/wallpaper/69705"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shot on the pavement" class="if uuid-2407657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71663/2407657.jpg"></div><p>  The main thing in implementing any of these ideas is shooting a model, not the surrounding landscape.  Everyone knows the ‚Äúsoviet‚Äù photographs from the ‚ÄúI and the Landmark‚Äù series, in which neither a person is visible, nor the one against which the shooting was.  So you can‚Äôt take pictures. </p><h2>  Simple ideas for a winter photoset </h2><p>  Many people think about how to take a beautiful photo in winter.  Indeed, in a country where winter is so beautiful, you just can't help but arrange a street photoset.  The only thing that prevents beautiful winter photographs and, in fact, what distinguishes them from photographs in magazines is outerwear. </p><p>  If you have a car, you can take a beautiful picture in the countryside among snowy forest firs or endless fields, but in the absence of a car you will have to confine yourself to your own yard, apartment or cafeteria with display windows. </p><p>  Shots are always excellent in sunny clear weather with no fur coats and jackets, but with heavy thick warm sweaters, mittens, fluffy ‚Äúears‚Äù or hats. </p><div class="photo" data-original="superwall.us" data-author=": " data-source="http://superwall.us/woman-blonde_snow_knit_abstract_photography-zVRt/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Winter is the time for photo shoots" class="if uuid-2407690" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71663/2407690.jpg"></div><p>  You can shoot: </p><ul><li>  in the snow, drawing an angel; </li><li>  on the steps of an ice slide with a cup from which steam comes; </li><li>  in a snowdrift, holding out a snowball with both hands in a frame; </li><li>  for making snowmen with carrots; </li><li>  at a table by a glass window with a glass of mulled wine (such photos are especially good in bad weather on the street); </li><li>  on a rug or skin by the fireplace; </li><li>  with Christmas tinsel, toys; </li><li>  at the window with a mug of tea or a glass of wine in 3/4 angle; </li><li>  at the hole; </li><li>  on the rink; </li><li>  on the banks of a frozen river stretching into the distance. </li></ul><p>  In winter, very bright sunsets.  This can be taken into account and take advantage of the natural feature by making beautiful pictures.  Winter is the best time for a close-up selfie.  Eyes are burning, cheeks are covered with blush, and the nose can be covered with a fluffy mitt. </p><h2>  How beautifully photographed at home and on ava? </h2><p>  There‚Äôs nothing complicated about taking a beautiful photo at home.  On the contrary, at home there is no limit to experimenting with your own image. </p><p>  Pictures with the use of a single-color white or black background are always successful and beautiful, occupying the entire frame, that is, extending to the floor.  It is not necessary to purchase bars with backgrounds, as in studios, you can glue part of the wall and floor or decorate with fabric.  Such a corner will give the opportunity to be photographed in the same way as in the studio, at any time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.trojmiasto.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="White background for photo" class="if uuid-2407698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71663/2407698.jpg"></div><p>  How beautifully you take a photo on your ava is no different from the rules of selfies and portraits.  However, there is a nuance.  On avatars, pictures by smartphones are always better than cameras.  Taking a selfie for an avatar is not difficult.  The unsuccessful avu is not made by the frame, but by its further processing by filters and correctors in mobile applications.  The less artwork, the more beautiful the avatar icon with the photograph looks. </p>
