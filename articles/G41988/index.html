Most often, users are wondering why the mobile Internet does not work on the iPhone.  This may be due to various reasons.  One of the most common is incorrect settings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imalayalee.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why the internet stopped working on the iphone" class="if uuid-2948363" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2948363.jpg"></div><p>  However, more serious damage is often found.  Following simple instructions, you can independently identify and fix the problem.  In the article, we will consider the answer to the question why the Internet does not work on the iPhone. </p><h2>  We determine the problem </h2><p>  The problem with the mobile Internet is quite easy to identify, unlike other problems.  It is determined by the following signs: </p><ol><li>  Access to mobile Internet is limited via LTE, 3G or Wi-Fi. </li><li>  The modem mode is not activated, or the iPhone does not function as an access point. </li><li>  The Internet works intermittently or the page does not appear when the connection icon is on the phone screen. </li></ol><p>  Sometimes users ask themselves why the Internet stopped working on the iPhone.  It often happens that the cause is a system failure.  In this case, it is enough to restart the phone or turn on airplane mode for one or two seconds.  If after these steps the malfunction is not eliminated, the problem must be sought in the settings or software. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  LTE does not turn on </h2><p>  When using an iPhone, various errors may appear that lead to problems with the Internet. </p><p>  The most common causes include: </p><ul><li>  3G connection error or in wireless settings; </li><li>  iOS system issues </li><li>  damage to the mobile device itself; </li><li>  malfunctioning SIM card. </li></ul><p>  Usually, when it comes to problems caused by software failures, you can fix them yourself.  To do this, either reboot the device or download new software. </p><h2>  Data Transfer Issues </h2><p>  The reason why the Internet does not work well on the iPhone may be an error in the LTE connection.  In most cases, it depends on the mobile operator.  Typically, such a problem occurs after a total reboot of the phone or reset.  Even with excellent network coverage, the Internet may not work.  It is easy to determine this problem - the antenna of the <span>mobile network is</span> displayed on the device‚Äôs screen <span>,</span> but there is no icon or it disappears. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mobikin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why doesn‚Äôt mobile internet work on an iPhone" class="if uuid-2948342" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2948342.jpg"></div><p>  The situation can be corrected as follows: </p><ul><li>  open iPhone settings; </li><li>  select the "Cellular Network" section; </li><li>  Find the tab "Data Transfer"; </li><li>  enter the APN and username (it must be clarified with the mobile operator). </li></ul><p>  Before proceeding to the described actions, you need to make sure that the tariff plan has been paid, the package has not been used up, there is network coverage, and the operator provides this service.  If the Internet crashes frequently, contact your mobile operator‚Äôs support service.  In some cases, when problems arise systematically in order to eliminate the arising problems, they change the mobile communications company. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, the question of why the Internet does not work on the iPhone 5s may arise when the network is disconnected during the transmission of cellular data.  In such a situation, you need to open the control panel of the mobile and phone and make sure that the corresponding icon is in the status bar.  If it is absent, do the following: </p><ul><li>  go to settings, tab "Connections"; </li><li>  in the "Cellular" and 3G items, the slider should be in the on state; </li><li>  if this is not the case, the slider is set to active. </li></ul><p>  Even if mobile communications worked well, coverage is not the same everywhere.  For this reason, the phone does not always receive a signal.  A mobile operator cannot provide high-quality cellular reception in all parts of the city.  Therefore, if the 4G icon changes to H + or E, this is not a malfunction. </p><h2>  3G icon disappears </h2><p>  If the status bar has a 3G icon, but the browser does not open the page, the question also arises as to why the Internet does not work on the iPhone.  First of all, it is necessary to eliminate the error in the software.  The easiest way is to update the browser or remove it, and then reinstall it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="englishwww.makeupguides.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Internet on a mobile phone does not work" class="if uuid-2948418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2948418.jpg"></div><p>  When using a standard application, you can try to take the following steps: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  turn off Javascript in the browser; </li><li>  reboot the device; </li><li>  close the software, and then remove it from the latest open programs. </li></ul><p>  Many users of iPhones who updated their operating system to version 9.3 complained about the slow loading of pages and clicks on links.  Updating iOS to the next version will help get rid of problems. </p><h2>  Modem mode does not work </h2><p>  It happens that the mobile Internet in the phone is not available in modem mode or the device does not connect to the network through the access point.  This may also be the reason why the Internet does not work on iPhone 5. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.auchan.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why the internet doesn't work at all on an iPhone" class="if uuid-2948347" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2948347.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, you need to make sure that the corresponding function is enabled: </p><ul><li>  open the settings menu; </li><li>  activate the item ‚ÄúModem mode‚Äù or ‚ÄúCellular data‚Äù, and then - ‚ÄúModem mode‚Äù; </li><li>  check the settings and enter the password if necessary, which will open access to the mobile device. </li></ul><p>  If ‚ÄúModem Mode‚Äù is active, the phone is rebooted.  As a rule, after this, this function is reactivated.  Why is the Internet slowly working on the iPhone or does not load at all?  Perhaps the matter is in the settings.  Then there is another, longer way - to reset to factory settings, and then manually restore the settings. </p><p>  If the methods described above do not help (the phone still does not accept cellular communications, Internet access is impossible), then most likely the problem lies in the hardware of the phone.  In this case, the device should be taken to a service center or entrusted to a master. </p><h2>  Reboot device, network, Wi-Fi, 3G </h2><p>  It happens that restarting the network helps to start the Internet.  You can do it yourself by following the instructions: </p><ul><li>  go to the settings, select the "Cellular Data" tab and turn off the data transfer; </li><li>  after a minute they turn on the data transfer again. </li></ul><p>  If after these steps the answer to the question why the Internet does not work on the iPhone is still not found, you can try another, more complex method: </p><ul><li>  find the ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù tab in the settings; </li><li>  then select the "Cellular data" section and reset the network settings; </li><li>  after that they call the technical support service of the mobile operator, indicate the phone model and receive new settings. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.unlockboot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why the internet doesn‚Äôt work well on an iPhone" class="if uuid-2948305" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2948305.jpg"></div><p>  To access via Wi-Fi, you must do the following: </p><ul><li>  turn on the router and wait until it is fully loaded; </li><li>  enter the code 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1 in the search bar of the browser, press the "Enter" key, specify the login and password; </li><li>  enter the data received from the provider, save it, and then change the username and password to your identifiers, connect via Wi-Fi. </li></ul><p>  Before setting up 3G or 4G, it is important to verify the positive balance in the account, and then take the following steps: </p><ul><li>  go into the network settings and select "Data Transfer"; </li><li>  enable the 3G function, if it is disabled, and enter in the APN line the login and password received from the operator. </li></ul><p>  Sometimes resetting and re-entering helps. </p><h2>  Communication with the operator </h2><p>  If the above methods are ineffective and the question of why the Internet does not work on the iPhone is still relevant, it makes sense to call the support service of the mobile operator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="telecombulletin.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flashing the phone" class="if uuid-2948430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2948430.jpg"></div><p>  It is recommended that you prepare a passport in advance so that the call center specialist checks the balance and identify the problem.  If the error is caused by a technical failure, after communication with the operator, it will be resolved in the near future. </p><h2>  Reboot FaceTime </h2><p>  Another way to fix a broken Internet is to reboot FaceTime.  To do this, you must: </p><ol><li>  Go to the "Settings" menu of the phone. </li><li>  Then select the ‚ÄúLimitations‚Äù tab and move the slider to the off position. </li><li>  As a result, FaceTime appears in the application tab, you must enable it.  It is likely that after this there will be a connection to the network. </li></ol><h2>  Firmware update </h2><p>  In the case when none of the described methods helped, you need to update the firmware.  To do this, an iPhone is connected to a computer with Internet access using a charging cable.  The latest version of iTunes opens on your PC.  If it is not, the application is downloaded using your account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why is the internet slowly working on an iphone" class="if uuid-2948375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2948375.jpg"></div><p>  After switching on, the program should determine the phone.  On the upper right will be a proposal to update the firmware of the iPhone.  Before you take this step, you must create a backup copy of all the data available in the device.  To do this, click on the tab "This computer", and then in the window that appears - "Create a copy now."  After saving the information, press the Update button, the installation of a new firmware for the iPhone starts. </p><p>  Then they again return to the ‚ÄúThis computer‚Äù tab and select ‚ÄúRestore from copy‚Äù in the window that appears, after which all the saved data will be transferred to the phone.  After that, Internet access should be open. </p>
