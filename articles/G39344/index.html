    <h2>  Types of loops </h2><p>  To figure out <span>how to knit a</span> garter stitch, you first need to remember the main types of loops.  They are distinguished by 2 - facial and wrong.  These names are conditional, since the canvases connected by these loops can be equally the front side and the bottom of the future product. </p><p>  And the very concept of "front-wrong" is not always correct.  The fact is that, by knitting the front loop, the master simultaneously does the wrong side, but on the other hand, knitting, and vice versa. </p><p>  Accordingly, in order to get an even and beautiful product, it is necessary to alternate these types of loops depending on the series performed.  Based on this principle, different patterns and types of paintings are built.  Knitting with needles, a scheme, the description of which will be further, is built a little differently. </p><h2>  Handkerchief Characteristics </h2><p>  It is not known exactly when this pattern appeared.  Perhaps he was one of the first, because it is as simple as possible to perform.  It is called so because it was in this way that downy scarves were knitted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pattern" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/703283.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The usual <span>shawl knitting, the</span> photo of which is presented in the article, is quite resistant to stretching and deformation of the canvas.  She holds the shape of the product well, at the same time adding a small volume to it. </p><p>  In finished products, handkerchief knitting, a pattern whose description is quite common, is used mainly as a background to emphasize the beauty of the main pattern.  It looks great on both openwork patterns and <span>hosiery</span> insert with jacquard. </p><p>  At the same time, this pattern is so simple and understandable that it can be reproduced by all novice craftswomen who only learned to knit one type of buttonhole. </p><p>  At the same time, it doesn‚Äôt matter at all whether these are purl loops or front ones.  The result is always the same. </p><h2>  How to knit shawl knitting? </h2><p>  Consider a simple training example.  To get started, we will collect 20 loops in any convenient way.  Next, we knit as shown in the diagram. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit shawl knitting" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/703285.jpg" width="295"></div>  Remove the first loop.  It will be edging.  This ensures a trim edge.  Next, we knit the front loop, stretching the needle into the loop in the front and pulling the working thread from the back.  We do this until the end of the row.  We knit the last loop with the wrong loop: the needle passes behind the loop and captures the working thread in front of the canvas.

This is the whole garter knitting, the scheme described above is given. </p><p>  You can finish the test sample either by training to close the hinges or by loosening it.  Of course, it is better not to use training yarn in the main products, since it significantly loses its <span>appearance.</span> </p><h2>  Wrong garter stitch </h2><p>  The previous example shows how to knit a garter stitch using knitting needles.  But this is not the only way.  The purl loops knitted in each row give the same effect. </p><p>  It‚Äôs just traditionally that the craftswomen prefer to use facial loops, since they are considered the first to be mastered, wanting to learn how to knit. </p><p>  At the same time, you cannot tell by the appearance of the product; it was connected with the front or wrong loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit a garter stitch" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/703286.jpg" width="465"></div>  When knitting a shawl, it is worth starting from which loops the master turns out more evenly and is not elongated.  If this is purl, then it is better to knit the product with them, because on the scarf knitting defects and irregularities associated with stretching or tightening the loops are clearly visible.

    <h2>  Garter stitch in a circle </h2><p>  More experienced craftsmen may have a question about how to perform garter stitching in circles.  Indeed, with ordinary knitting it is enough only to turn the fabric over.  In fact, there is nothing complicated, but there are some nuances. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="handkerchief photo" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/703284.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  As with any other knit in a circle, the master will encounter twisted loops.  To get a product with a classic look, you will need to knit them so that the base of the loop does not twist.  This is achieved by inserting the knitting needle into the loop on the opposite side, as if unwinding it. </p><p>  Next, you need to choose an inconspicuous seam location.  It can be either a side seam, or any other place that will be hidden from the eyes of people.  The thing is that the place of transition from one row to another will be slightly noticeable. </p><p>  And most importantly, knitting shawl in a circle requires the master to alternate the front and back rows of loops, since there is no way to turn the fabric over, and all work takes place on the front side of the product. </p><h2>  Knitting direction </h2><p>  It is worth remembering that the pattern of knitting a scarf knit provides for the presence on the surface of longitudinal grooves that are formed by the tops of the purl stitches.  Therefore, the decorative effect depends on the direction of knitting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="purl" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/703287.jpg" width="257"></div>

    <p>  In scarves and hats, it is better to use the transverse knitting method.  It is simpler and lighter, and the products are beautiful and compact, with a small margin of extension in length. </p><p>  But in sweaters and sweaters, you can try to combine longitudinal and transverse knitting.  But for wide products, long knitting needles are required, without which the work will turn into real hard labor. </p><p>  To make the pattern slim, you can knit the whole sweater or <span>dress with a</span> longitudinal garter stitch.  You can add lightness and delicacy by using knitting needles for several larger numbers than the number of yarn requires.  This effect is actively used in downy shawls.  Here you can also find the most difficult knitting option - diagonal.  It requires the master maximum attention and extensive experience in knitting. </p><h2>  Little tricks </h2><p>  Knitting needles are often found in various handicraft guides.  The scheme, the description of which is included in the product description, is quite simple, but does not always contain some nuances. </p><p>  Firstly, it is almost impossible to repeat the described product.  There are several reasons for this: the yarn does not match the description and the master‚Äôs, different knitting numbers, knitting style (tendency to tighten or fluff loops).  Therefore, you should never blindly go for the finished scheme.  There is always room for improvisation, making the product more unique. </p><p>  Secondly, getting down to garter stitching, learn to knit loops perfectly.  The elongated and tightened loops standing nearby create the effect of a sloppy handicraft. </p><p>  Third, train on soft, fluffy yarn.  It shows errors better.  At the same time, the first full-fledged products are best made from fluffy threads.  They will hide small flaws and will look more neat. </p>
