Where is it and how to get there?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The German bridge in Stavropol is a legendary pre-revolutionary building, especially popular among lovers of beautiful photographs, climbers and climbers.  This is a real attraction of the <span>Stavropol Upland,</span> which is constantly visited by local residents and guests of the regional center, and the most daring tourists stay overnight in a tent - there is a place nearby suitable for camping. </p><h2>  The history of the appearance of the German bridge in Stavropol </h2><p>  In 1943, the City of the Cross was a major railway junction, which included 2 stations, freight stations and a railway (Tuapse), laid in three directions: </p><ul><li>  to the west - Armavir; </li><li>  to the north - Caucasian; </li><li>  to the east - Petrovskoe (now Svetlograd). </li></ul><p>  German engineers were engaged in the design, in fact, which is why the German bridge in Stavropol got its name.  Construction of roads, as historians say, was carried out by Austrian and German prisoners of war.  But this did not happen during the Great Patriotic War, as most people think, but much earlier - from 1909 to 1917.  However, even during the Civil War, a good part of the railways was destroyed.  The rest was broken by the Germans themselves, however, not all sites were able to reach.  So the German bridge remained in Stavropol - for history. </p>

    <h2>  The German bridge today </h2><p>  The design of the railways and the construction of the bridges necessary for it were performed at the highest level.  Looking at the architectural structure, you cannot say that it is already more than a century old - the attraction is well preserved.  It seems that the bridge will stand still for several centuries - it looks so ‚Äúfresh‚Äù, despite the unfavorable relief of the Stavropol Upland.  It was built from local shell stone without the use of concrete. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The German bridge in Stavropol is held by five huge supports, with a diameter of 20 meters.  The height of the structure is 18 m, width - 6 m, and length - 85 m. </p><p>  Given the size of the bridge and its excellent safety, the construction is very popular with experienced climbers and climbers who regularly organize competitions here.  Also, the attraction is visited by tourists and photography enthusiasts - against the background of a bridge located in the forest, very beautiful and unusual photos are obtained. </p>

    <h2>  Is it true that there are several such bridges? </h2><p>  The Tuapse railway has spread over an impressive territory, therefore the German bridge discussed in this article <strong> </strong>  is far from the only surviving object.  Some of them are already almost completely or partially destroyed, others are still functioning.  They are located in different areas of Stavropol and the region. </p><p>  How many of them are left is unknown, and no one counted.  Although the most famous ones have different names, there is still confusion.  Most often, the German bridge is confused with the New Caucasus.  This is not surprising.  The large Novokavkazsky bridge is also German, as it was built by the Germans and at the same time.  But it is located in a completely different place - at the exit of the Verkhneegorlyksky farm.  There is also a Small New Caucasus Bridge located here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On "Chapaevka" (Stavropol region) is an abandoned Tashlyansky bridge, which locals call "Turkish".  But few people visit it because of the unremarkable territory around. </p><p>  Until now, centuries-old buildings have benefited the Stavropolites, serving faithfully.  For example, existing bridges in the village of Tatarka and on Zavodskaya street.  The most accessible for inspection is the Small German Bridge on the banks of the Elagin Pond. </p>

    <h2>  Where is the German bridge in Stavropol and how to get to it? </h2><p>  Located in the Mamaisky Forest, the German bridge is very beautiful at any time of the year.  To visit the viaduct, you must go along Kuibyshev Street, then, without turning anywhere, down Michurin, to the house of Andrei Razin (built of red brick and looks like a castle).  At this intersection, turn right onto the Volodarsky passage.  Then go along the main one.  Upon reaching the Elagin pond, go around it on the left side and climb up, towards the forest.  Summer cottage cooperatives begin here, followed by the Deutsche Bridge bridge.  From the most dachas, home-made signs lead to it, so it will be difficult to get lost. </p>

    <p>  The destruction of the Tuapse railway made Stavropol a dead end city, completely depriving it of the opportunity to develop in terms of food exports.  On the other hand, the German bridge and other sections were disabled mainly due to the risk of landslides occurring on the Stavropol Upland.  Nevertheless, it is already impossible to return anything, but there remains an important attraction, the age of which has already exceeded 100 years. </p>
