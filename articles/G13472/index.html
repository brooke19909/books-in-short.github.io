But this statement is nothing more than a myth.  There are also cheap hotels in the Maldives.  And one of them is Fun Island Resort &amp; Spa 3 *.  The rating of this hotel, despite its modest status, is 6.8 out of ten possible according to the "Booking" classification.  And the authoritative site ‚ÄúTripadvisor‚Äù awards this hotel a ‚Äúfour‚Äù on a five-point scale. </p><p>  Dreaming of an atoll hotel, with a beautiful coral reef, among the turquoise lagoon?  You can relax in this for relatively little money.  Tourists recommend not contacting agencies, but buying plane tickets and booking a hotel room on their own.  Let us now get acquainted with the conditions in the hotel Fun Island Resort &amp; Spa 3 *.  Photos of the territory and rooms, real reviews of tourists about the hotel you will find below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fun Island Resort Spa 3 *: - Maldives" class="if uuid-3231150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3231150.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  The most popular region in the Maldives is the South Male Atoll.  In fact, it is a whole placer of islands, islets and nameless rocks.  Holidays in the Maldives are often characterized by the fact that the hotel occupies the whole piece of land in the ocean.  Fan Island Resort &amp; Spa is no exception.  But he owns two islands: one, Baud Finolg, on which the hotel itself is located, and the other, nameless and uninhabited, where once a day they are taken to the beach by free transfer.  If you want and a decent physical preparation, you can swim there yourself - there is no current there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To be precise, the hotel islets are located in the eastern part of the South Male Atoll.  Guests are greeted by Hulule International Airport.  If you take a ticket from a tour operator, a transfer to the hotel is included in the price.  If not, paid upon arrival at the hotel.  Sail from the airport to the hotel by speed boat for about 40 minutes.  The islands belonging to the hotel are surrounded by an incomparable ‚Äúhome‚Äù (that is, adjacent to land) coral reef.  Therefore, the main category of vacationers in the hotel are snorkelers and divers.  But on the other hand, the entry into the sea is very smooth.  Therefore, the hotel is suitable for families with children. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="3.858896" data-lng="73.45648800000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/7/8/8/17788.png"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Upon check-in, guests are given a map of the island.  It is small, but not to say that it is tiny: 700 meters long and 168 meters wide. From photographs taken from the air, it is clear that the pier leading to the island is longer than this piece of land.  The territory of the Fun Island Resort &amp; Spa 3 * hotel is very landscaped, everywhere there is a shadow.  The hotel was built in 1988.  Then it closed for a long overhaul.  The hotel began to receive guests again in 2009.  He is a member of the international chain Villa Hotels.  Thus, it immediately becomes clear that you will not see a tall building spoiling the landscape on the island. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel consists of a placer of one-story villas hiding in lush tropical greenery.  There are also two restaurants on the island, a spa and a bar. But this three-star paradise has its drawbacks.  So, tourists say that under their feet - one sand.  It is small, velvet, but you can‚Äôt resemble heels.  On the other hand, why in the Maldives are there any shoes other than flip flops?  Sand makes the hotel atmospheric.  Tourists feel like Robinsons here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stayislands.mv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fun Island Resort Spa 3 - Territory" class="if uuid-3231158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3231158.jpg"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The hotel Fun Island Resort &amp; Spa 3 * only 75 rooms for guests.  They fall into two categories: standard beach front rooms and deluxe suites.  There is a difference in them, and quite noticeable.  It should immediately be stated that all these villas are located on the very shore or almost by the sea.  But the standards are grouped into blocks of 2-4 numbers in each.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãbeach front rooms is small, only 21 square meters.  But these rooms are comfortable and full of amenities. </p><p>  They include air conditioning and a minibar.  Each room has a private terrace.  It has a comfortable lounger with a mattress and a shower to wash the salt water after swimming in the ocean.  In deluxe rooms there is a full range of services offered in the standards, and plus additional services: a hairdryer, a plasma TV with satellite channels, and free Wi-Fi.  The bathroom in these rooms is spacious and partially located in the open air.  The deluxe area is 60 square meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fun Island Resort Spa 3 * - room description" class="if uuid-3231151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3231151.jpg"></div><h2>  Room Facilities </h2><p>  Comfort in the guest rooms of Fun Island Resort &amp; Spa 3 * is felt in the little things.  The standard room has two entrances: one goes directly to the beach (via the terrace), and the second leads to the block's patio.  Since there are no stone-coated paths, a foot shower is installed near the entrance to the rooms so as not to put sand in the rooms.  Deluxe has its own little garden.  Upon request, they will bring you an iron and an ironing board. </p><p>  All rooms have a kettle with tea bags, an umbrella, beach and bath towels.  Every morning, the maids clean up, put a half-liter bottle of water for one person.  Room service is available for a fee.  Energy-saving light bulbs are installed in the luminaires in the rooms, since electricity is very expensive in the Maldives.  Tourists claim that you do not need to carry the adapter from the house: the sockets here are adapted for plugs of European devices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gites.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fun Island Resort Spa 3 Reviews" class="if uuid-3231155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3231155.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  There are two restaurants in the Fun Island Resort &amp; Spa 3 * hotel.  Three main buffets are served at Farivalha, and Envasi works like a la carte (lunch and dinner).  Tourists say that if you take any of the paid services, you can do without cash: just put a signature under the check and pay for the entire amount with a credit card upon eviction.  In addition to restaurants, on the territory of the island hotel there are bars: in the lobby and on the beach.  The hall of the main institution is spacious, but there are not enough tables, as visitors notice.  If the hotel is 100 percent full, you have to wait until space is available. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fr.hotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fun Island Resort Spa 3 *: - restaurant" class="if uuid-3231161" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3231161.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews of tourists about food </h2><p>  Guests are not in vain called the Hotel Fun Island Resort &amp; Spa 3 * (Maldives) a three-star paradise.  The food here is fresh, tasty and delicious.  Guests are offered a wide selection of dishes - both pan-European cuisine and local, exotic.  Tourists claim that there is a bakery on the island - all the confectionery is freshest.  For breakfast, the selection of dishes is more modest: eggs in different forms, sausages, vegetables and fruits.  Sweet tooth with nostalgia recall fragrant pastries and desserts. </p><p>  All tourists recommend having a holiday and visiting the a la carte restaurant.  It is located right on the shore, and the entourage of serving dishes itself is worth the money spent.  Tourists note that the time for meals is long: one and a half to two hours.  If there are many guests, there is still enough food for everyone.  Quick waiters quickly change their empty food trays to full ones.  Many praise the range of drinks and snacks in bars.  They make wonderful cocktails on the shore, and the lobby restaurant specializes in a wide variety of wines. </p><h2>  Fun Island Resort &amp; Spa 3 *: beach description </h2><p>  Many tourists have chosen this hotel only because of its beautiful home reef.  So the handset and mask must be taken.  Beaches on two islets are everywhere.  Firstly, every morning at 10.00 a boat leaves for an uninhabited island.  Back vacationers pick up at noon.  The boat needs to be booked at the reception, but many tourists get there by swimming, and during low tide - and wade.  The best snorkeling is on the outside of the reef.  You need to go along the pier, to which the ship approaches, and go down into the water through special ladders. </p><p>  It is best to bathe children on a spit on the left side of the island (there are outbuildings and houses where staff live).  Romantic sunsets and just sunbathing almost alone can be found on the side that overlooks the ocean.  But the entry into the sea there is steep.  Most tourists rest to the left and right of the pier.  The sand there is shallow, but the sea sometimes takes out garbage and debris of coral.  For a romantic selfie, tourists move to an unnamed islet (Robinson Beach).  At 16.00 the hotel clerk feeds the mant from the pier.  You can watch this spectacle for free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fun Island Resort Spa 3 * - beach" class="if uuid-3231148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3231148.jpg"></div><h2>  Services </h2><p>  There is no pool at the Fun Island Resort &amp; Spa 3 * hotel (Male).  He also cannot boast of a vast territory.  Since this is a "three" and not a "five", guests are invited to entertain themselves.  Animation is not provided here, but in the a la carte restaurant, live music is played in the evenings, and in the evenings there is a show ‚ÄúI take the boggle‚Äù. </p><p>  Guests can enjoy free Wi-Fi in the lobby, play beach volleyball, table tennis, badminton and billiards.  At the hotel‚Äôs spa, clients can relax under the skillful fingers of masseuses and visit the baths.  An airport shuttle is available around the clock.  Valuables can be deposited in the safe at the reception. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.maldivesbuy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fun Island Resort Spa 3 * Male" class="if uuid-3231163" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3231163.jpg"></div><h2>  Fun Island Resort &amp; Spa 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  If you want a vacation a la Ibiza or Pattaya - you are clearly not here.  So say the tourists.  It stops either a quiet audience, or avid snorkelers and divers.  There are very few Russian tourists here.  The main contingent is Europeans, Americans, Chinese Indians. </p><p>  A deposit at the settlement is not charged, but a welcome cocktail is handed.  A tourist who is obsessed with excursions may be bored here.  As for the service, there were no complaints about the staff.  The cleaning was the most thorough, everywhere clean and tidy.  From wishes: tourists most often call the administration to build a playground. </p>
