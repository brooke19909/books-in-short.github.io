Typically, tourists coming to rest in Sicily, visit Montreal to enjoy the beauty of this ancient city with stunning architecture.  There are not many monuments here, but they are all unique. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="37.9228387" data-lng="13.243263200000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/7/6/4/4764.png"></div><h2>  Monreale Attractions (Sicily) - Cathedral of Santa Maria Nuova </h2><p>  This is undoubtedly the main attraction of the city.  A magnificent example of Norman-Arab architecture was laid during the reign of King William II the Good.  This monarch reigned peacefully, there was enough money in the treasury, because the construction of the cathedral, founded in 1174, was completed in 1183. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral of Santa Maria Nuova" class="if uuid-2569505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2569505.jpg"></div><p>  Over the next six years, interior decoration of the cathedral in Montreal in Sicily was carried out.  Mosaics used in the design of the temple deserve special attention.  We will talk about them a little later.  Cathedral of Montreal in Sicily belongs to a special group of monuments of the island, characterized by a mixture of different <span>cultures: local,</span> which has its history from ancient times, and Arabic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The incredibly beautiful and majestic temple combines two main trends of southern Italian architecture - festive splendor and severe power.  Bronze doors adorn the facade of the Cathedral of Montreal in Sicily.  They depict scenes from the New and Old Testament.  They are opened today only on major church holidays, and on other days you can enter the cathedral through the side door. </p><div class="photo" data-original="se.dreamstime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral" class="if uuid-2569520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2569520.jpg"></div><p>  In the structure of the Cathedral, its plan and decoration, combinations of Byzantine, Arabic and Norman-French styles are clearly visible.  Outwardly, the cathedral resembles the Catholic Church, which seems to be connected with the Orthodox religious building. </p><p>  The same combination of styles is observed in the interiors of the beautiful temple and its unique mosaic. </p><h2>  Mosaic </h2><p>  The Cathedral of Montreal in Sicily is decorated with the most impressive set of Byzantine mosaics in Italy - 6.5 thousand square meters.  m. Unfortunately, today the names of their authors are lost. </p><p>  Tiny images of glass mosaics in bright colors on a golden background adorn the entire interior of the temple.  In the center of tourists' attention is attracted by the huge image of Christ sitting with the Virgin Mary, occupying half the dome.  In addition, here you can see the faces of Saints Peter and Paul.  No less beautiful are the pictures depicted along the nave. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mosaics of the cathedral in Montreal" class="if uuid-2569630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2569630.jpg"></div><p>  The figures of saints and prophets, skillfully made of <span>mosaics, adorn</span> almost all the walls of the Cathedral of Montreal in Sicily, which today is protected by UNESCO as a unique architectural and historical monument. </p><h2>  Benedektinsky monastery </h2><p>  Another significant attraction of Montreal in Sicily.  The monastery began to be built at the same time as the Cathedral (1174).  In March 1176, the first monks who arrived from the monastery of La Cava (Salerno) settled in the monastery. </p><p>  I must say that in Sicily quite often there was a change of royal dynasties, but despite <span>this the monastery</span> in Montreal has always flourished.  By the 17th century, it became one of the richest monasteries in Italy.  The pearl of the beautiful monastery complex is the square courtyard of Kjostro, adjacent to the south side of the Cathedral.  It is surrounded by elegant arcades and columns, decorated with mosaics and decorated with sculptural compositions.  In the corner of the courtyard is a small but very beautiful fountain in the Arabic style, which is an exact copy of the fountain in the Alhambra Palace (Spain). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wondersofsicily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Benedictine Monastery" class="if uuid-2569541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2569541.jpg"></div><h2>  City garden </h2><p>  If you are interested in where to take a walk in Montreal in Sicily, we recommend that you go to the City Garden.  This is a wonderful place where you can wander along the beautiful shady alleys, admire the scenic panorama of Sicily, the Conca d'Oro valley, the Palermo mountains, the turquoise waters of the Tyrrhenian Sea, original plant sculptures from the observation platforms equipped here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City garden" class="if uuid-2569547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2569547.jpg"></div><h2>  Castellachio Castle </h2><p>  The magnificent building is located five kilometers from the city, on top of Mount Caputo.  This ancient defensive structure (XII century) is often called the Big Castle.  This is the only castle in the district of Palermo, which has been preserved in its original form - it has never been rebuilt or reconstructed. </p><p>  The castle was built to protect and monitor the approaches to Montreal by land and sea.  You can get to the inner territories of the castle only at the peak of the tourist season, taking part in a guided tour organized by a Sicilian alpine club. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Castellachio Castle" class="if uuid-2569557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2569557.jpg"></div><h2>  San Martino Abbey </h2><p>  The structure was built on this land in 600, during the reign of Gregory the Great, but in 829 it burned out completely during the attack of the Arab troops.  In such a destroyed state, the monastery stood until 1346, when it was not rebuilt.  From then until now, the abbey has been operational. </p><p>  The masterpieces of world art are preserved here: ‚ÄúSaint Martin and the Pauper‚Äù - a painting by Ignazio Marabitti, which is dedicated to the heavenly patron of the abbey in Montreal, the amazing marble staircase by Venanzio Marvulia (XVIII), the work of Pietro Novelli ‚ÄúDaniel in the Lion's Den‚Äù (XVI). </p><p>  The church choirs made of walnut are decorated with magnificent carvings.  Tourists from many countries purposefully travel to the abbey to see a stunning collection of medieval art, as well as hear the performance of the monk's choir. </p><h2>  Where to live? </h2><p>  Monreale is a small town, but problems with living here never arise.  Local hotels and hotels easily cope with the influx of vacationers, even in high season. </p><h2>  Locanda re rugerger </h2><p>  The hotel is opposite the Cathedral, in the old center of the picturesque town, on the slope of Mount Caputo.  Guests are offered to settle in rooms with individual decor, designed in soothing colors, equipped with necessary appliances and hygiene items. </p><p>  Vacationers can eat in the hotel restaurant, where they are offered delicious Italian cuisine, or in the city‚Äôs many restaurants.  A nearby caf√© serves breakfast upon request. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monreale Hotels" class="if uuid-2569558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2569558.jpg"></div><h2>  B&amp;B HootelDuomoMonreale </h2><p>  The hotel is 150 meters from the cathedral.  It offers modern, stylishly decorated rooms.  All rooms overlook the cathedral; the interior uses 19th-century furniture and paintings by Sicilian artists. </p><p>  <span>An Italian breakfast</span> (sweet) can be enjoyed at the bar next door.  The voucher for it applies to juice, hot drink and croissants. </p><h2>  GuglielmoII </h2><p>  A wonderful hotel located on the outskirts of Montreal.  It has a pool overlooking Palermo Bay, sun terraces, a bar and free private parking.  The cozy rooms of Guglielmo II are modernly decorated.  All include air conditioning, satellite TV, a safe and a minibar. </p><p>  It offers views of the sea or the picturesque valley of Conca D'Oro.  A complimentary continental breakfast is served daily. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  The small but very interesting city of Montreal is the pride of Sicily.  Tourists in their reviews especially note the unique historical and cultural attractions, mild comfortable climate.  Even if you are relaxing in another Italian resort, take the time to visit Montreal.  Experienced tourists claim that the trip will not disappoint you. </p>
