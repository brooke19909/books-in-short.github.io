In this, of course, an essential role is played by the wardrobe of the fair sex.  Buying fashionable, stylish, and creative models is not necessary if you know how to use knitting needles.  Knitting vests for a woman is a simple task that every beginner needlewoman can handle. </p><p>  There are many models that differ from each other not only in pattern, complexity, composition of the thread, but also in style.  Consider a few of them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Simple knitwear" class="if uuid-2546813" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53349/2546813.jpg"></div><h2>  Low neck vest </h2><p>  Many women who have complexes regarding their figure are afraid to wear knitwear.  Many believe that they are fat.  However, this is not always the case!  You just need to choose the right style of the product.  Sometimes it‚Äôs quite difficult to find the perfect option for yourself in stores.  <span>Knitting vests with</span> needles for women with their own hands allows you to independently make the perfect warm thing in your wardrobe! </p><p>  In fact, creating such a thing is not difficult.  A lot of work scares many, but this is not worth fearing.  The main thing is to start the process, and then everything will go as it should.  Beginner needlewomen should choose a light pattern.  Such a model will look attractive, and it will be worn much longer than the process of its manufacture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A deep-cut waistcoat is ideal for full ladies.  She visually lengthens the silhouette.  The figure becomes more slender.  It is also worth noting that such a model opens the neckline, which smooths out many of the shortcomings.  In addition, neat stylists recommend to place long or large jewelry, an attractive bright shawl in the place of the cut. </p><div class="photo" data-original="intheloopknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vest for everyday wear" class="if uuid-2546441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49181/2546441.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of size, manufacturing </h2><p>  The presented model will look spectacular on women who wear clothes of any size - about 44 to 56. </p><p>  <span>Knitting vests with needles</span> for women does not require special use of tools.  You can use both circular and straight knitting needles.  The size of the tool must be selected, taking into account the thickness of the selected thread.  Often, such sleeveless jackets are made for the cool season, so the threads are chosen natural, warm, thick, with a high content of wool in the composition. </p><p>  For the manufacture of sleeveless products, it is necessary to prepare about 500 g of high-quality warm yarn and knitting needle No. 6.  The pattern is simple.  Begin knitting with 1 x 1 gum. Alternately knit 1 front loop, 1 wrong loop. </p><p>  The canvas pattern may be different.  Today, there are often knitted things with a scarf pattern.  To do this, it is enough to knit only the front loops in both the wrong side and the front row. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="intheloopknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="delicate, original vest" class="if uuid-2546438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49181/2546438.jpg"></div><p>  But the front and back surface are also very popular.  They look spectacular and attractive.  Experienced needlewomen recommend choosing novice knitters either the wrong side of the surface or garter stitch.  These patterns are simple, thread tension errors on them are practically invisible. </p><p>  The product can include tying braids or harnesses.  They are quite simple in their execution. </p><h2>  Product back </h2><p>  Knitting vests for women consists of making shelves and backs. </p><p>  Before you start knitting a model, you need to knit a sample of threads, wash it and dry well.  Then calculate the required number of loops and measure its width in order to correctly calculate how many pieces will be needed for the whole canvas.  This method will help to understand how many loops you need to dial to make a shelf or back.  This is a mandatory step in the implementation of any knitted thing. </p><p>  We collect a certain number of loops.  For example, we consider that for the manufacture of sleeveless jackets for size 44, you need to dial 98 loops, and for 54 - 110 loops.  After knitting about 12 cm with a gum pattern of 1 x 1. At this stage, you can begin to distribute the loops.  Include braids in the work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Knitting a vest with knitting needles for women with a description allows you to quickly and accurately make your favorite knitted thing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="White, simple sleeveless product" class="if uuid-2546450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49181/2546450.jpg"></div><p>  Before knitting, you should also decide on a long product.  In our example, the product is slightly elongated.  Therefore, knitting 60 cm from the end of the elastic, it is necessary to close the middle 44 loops (for example, there were 100 loops on the knitting needles).  These loops are the neck.  The remaining loops are knitted separately.  Remember that in every second row you need to cut 2 loops from the neck.  So the neckline will be smooth, rounded.  After 3 cm, all the loops must be closed. </p><h2>  Before product </h2><p>  The front of the product must be knitted in the same way.  But remember that the neckline must be V-shaped.  For its manufacture, it is necessary to knit 12.5 cm of the product from the elastic and close 10 middle loops.  Both parties need to be individually tied.  To make a bevel, loops should be reduced from the level of the waist in each 4 rows.  So repeat 16 times.  Then 6 times perform decreases in each 6 row. </p><p>  Remember that the reduction must be done in 2 and 3 loops before or after the edge. </p><p>  Today, many again remember about knitting.  Knitting needles for women vests and sleeveless jackets can be made using schemes and solutions from fashion magazines.  Often needlewomen knit hats, socks, dresses and cardigans.  Such things are not only economical to manufacture, but also unique.  In addition, they are warm, because you yourself choose the composition of the yarn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="original stylish sleeveless jacket" class="if uuid-2546453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49181/2546453.jpg"></div><h2>  Vest assembly </h2><p>  Product assembly is an important part of manufacturing.  First of all, the shoulders are sutured, after - the sides.  On top of the sides you need to leave about 25 cm for the armhole.  It is tied on circular knitting needles, gaining loops around the edge of the product (about 80).  After about 6 cm, knit with an elastic band 1 x 1. </p><p>  The neck strap must be tied back and forward loops.  To do this, gain about 160 loops.  After knitting about 6 cm with an elastic band. </p><h2>  Goose Feet Vest </h2><p>  There are many patterns for knitting a vest for women.  This vest is perfect for everyday wear.  It not only looks attractive, but also perfectly warms in the cold season.  Such a thing is very comfortable to wear.  If you add this sleeveless jacket with a white shirt and bright accessories, then this is ideal for a daily work day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="faryingit.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Goose Feet Pattern" class="if uuid-2546463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49181/2546463.jpg"></div><h2>  Necessary for work </h2><p>  For product size 40-42, it is necessary to prepare a thread of 2 colors.  We suggest using silver and blue yarn.  Each of them will need about 250 gr.  You can use the number 4.5 needles.  Prepare also the hook.  Knitting a fashionable vest with knitting needles for women requires a little attention, time and effort. </p><p>  The product begins by knitting the gum 1 x 1. We knit in this way about 10-12 cm. To make the gum, use knitting needles one size smaller, that is, 4.0 mm. </p><p>  The main fabric is knitted on knitting needles No. 4,5 mm.  The pattern is the front surface.  This means that only the wrong loops must be knitted from the wrong side. </p><h2>  Pattern </h2><p>  The pattern of ‚Äúcrow's feet‚Äù is attractive and pretty.  His scheme is simple.  Tie it according to the scheme of the front surface.  At the same time, make sure that the non-working thread is drawn on the wrong side.  And the edge loops are knitted immediately with two threads. </p><p>  The density of the knit should be 10 x 10 cm 25 loops and 27 side by side. </p><h2>  Back fabrication </h2><p>  The back is knitted on the needles of 4.0 mm.  They collect 128 loops with blue threads, knit an elastic band and switch to a <span>two-color pattern.</span>  Thus knit 36 ‚Äã‚Äãcm of canvas in length.  At this stage, the formation of the armhole begins.  First cut 4 loops on each side, after 3 and 2 loops through a row. </p><p>  In this case, from the beginning of the product to its edge should be 61 cm, and a width of 94 loops. </p><h2>  In front of the vest </h2><p>  The front of the vest is tied in the same way as the back.  In this case, the neck should be V-shaped.  Such a cutout is made in this way: after 31 cm from the edge, the fabric is divided in half and 2 parts are knitted separately.  Cut the loops from the wrong side through a row. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Variety of bright sleeveless jackets" class="if uuid-2546448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49181/2546448.jpg"></div><p>  At first, they cut 1 loop each, and then - 2. As a result, 25 loops should remain, which after they cut. </p><p>  Stitch the parts first in the shoulders, then on the sides.  After the neck and armholes can be crocheted or elastic. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Knitting fashionable vest models with knitting needles for women is an easy way to create the perfect option for you.  The main thing is to choose the right tools and yarn.  And everything else is a desire, a good mood and a love of needlework.  And rest assured, you will succeed! </p>
