At first glance, this is understandable.  The price depends on the date of manufacture of the banknote, and on how worn it is. </p><h2>  What affects the value of a coin? </h2><p>  There are also parameters that can give the coin a fabulous price. </p><p>  The price of a coin depends on the following characteristics: </p><ol><li>  The larger the coin was issued, the lower its price. </li><li>  The value of a banknote is determined by how often it was in use.  Those of the coins that were not present in circulation were called sack coins and have a maximum price. </li><li>  There is such a thing as numismatic value.  Collectors are willing to pay it, if this particular coin is not enough in the collection. </li></ol><p>  Numismatics is probably the only area where production defects are encouraged.  Money with a marriage allowed during minting is considered rare, and this attracts collectors to it. </p><h2>  Monetary Reform and Coins of 1961 </h2><p>  The next reform of money after 1947 was carried out in order to give greater weight to the <span>money of the USSR.</span>  As a result, 1961 coins appeared.  The coin was exchanged for at least three months.  At that time, <span>paper money was</span> changing in the equivalent of 1:10, that is, for ten old banknotes they gave only one new one.  Small coins changed at the rate of one to one. </p><h2>  Interesting </h2><p>  Kopeks with the inscription 1, 2, 3, 5 kopeks had a weight corresponding to its value.  The amount of money could be determined by weighing small coins of 1961.  The coin was sometimes used as the equivalent of mass. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Features of the coins of 1961 </h2><p>  During the reform, it was suggested that it was necessary to introduce such a monetary value as half a penny.  On this occasion, one batch was minted for testing.  The cost of coins turned out to be higher than the cost of its production, so half a penny was not allowed into circulation.  Currently, there are about 10 such coins. Their value is from 180 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Characteristics of some 1961 coins </h2><p>  The most common coin with a face value of 5 k. The coin is made of bronze and has a corresponding color - yellow.  It is distinguished by its large size: 25 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in thickness.  Its design is usual for Soviet coins. </p><p>  In the year of reform, a lot of coins were issued and the cost of almost all was low.  What positions are included in 1961 coins?  Coin, which, first of all, is consistent in design.  In 1966 and 1970, five kopecks were issued, which are already estimated at 1 thousand and 5 thousand rubles, respectively.  Their cost is higher because they were made in small batches.  Ten kopecks of 1961 were minted often and did not have much value. </p>

    <p>  But among these there are copies made erroneously on brass blanks that were intended for two cents.  These coins are found in 1988 and 1989 of manufacture, and their price reaches 10 thousand rubles.  There are copies of 1991, having a size smaller than the required size, and now their price starts from 1 thousand rubles. </p><p>  A sharp jump in prices lowered the relevance of the 1961 coin.  The coin of this design since 1991 has gradually become obsolete.  Currently, they are of interest to numismatists and cause nostalgia for the older generation who grew up during the Soviet Union. </p>
