  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is electronic record keeping</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What 10 years ago seemed an exception to the rule today is becoming the norm.  This applies to so many areas of human life, especially the business sphere. </p><p>  After all, no matter the pace of progress, documents were and remain a very important, perhaps even the most important part of economic and commercial activity, both of a large enterprise and of a private entrepreneur that does not even have employees. <noindex>  <span>Electronic records management</span> </noindex>  - A term that is increasingly used in all areas of activity and no longer surprises anyone. </p><p>  Why?  Because the documents literally step by step fix the entire process of activity, the entire amount of information necessary for effective work. </p><p>  Working with documents, especially with their large volumes, has long become a kind of stumbling block and an occasion for jokes, both funny and not so. </p><p>  Loss of documents, hitch and mistakes in their design have become a kind of sad tradition.  In order to maximally avoid the above problems and speed up the process of document creation, the bulk of large and medium-sized enterprises have recently been actively moving to electronic document management and electronic office work in general. </p><p>  These two concepts, although derived from one another, but still, are not one and the same.  Paperwork is a process of direct creation of a document and organization of work with it: further search, storage and control of movement. </p><p>  Namely, the process of movement is what is commonly called a document flow: from the moment a document is created or received to the end of work with it. </p><p>  This very work, as it were, is controlled by the process called paperwork. </p><p>  Officially, this terminology sounds a little scary, but at large enterprises the abundance of paper documentation looks exactly like that, pulling up a lot of problems, both large and small.  And this is precisely what makes even the most conservative-minded leaders transfer their paperwork to electronic rails, covering the entire process ‚Äúfrom and to‚Äù. </p><p>  But it turned out that this is not so easy in the post-Soviet countries!  For a long time, electronic paperwork on the one hand - was welcomed, on the other - it did not have sufficient legal force.  The situation was greatly facilitated by the introduction of an electronic signature, which became a guarantor of the authenticity and correctness of the design of the document. </p><p>  There are still a lot of technical difficulties.  Starting from software flaws and ending with the internal policies of various (especially private) enterprises.  Indeed, for the correct exchange of documents in electronic form, both counterparties should work in this way, which in practice does not always happen. </p><p>  Because of this, and also because of the conservative desire to ‚Äúplay safe‚Äù, often electronic documents settle on the shelves in the form of their paper copies.  But still, they are becoming noticeably smaller.  And this, along with automating the creation of the document and facilitating the control of its movement, makes the entire process of office work noticeably faster, which means effective.  In addition, it significantly saves space in the room. </p></div></article>
