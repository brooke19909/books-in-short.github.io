They are attracted by relatively low prices, high quality service, wonderful beaches, as well as the opportunity to visit the most ancient architectural monuments that this North African country is rich in.  The most popular of the Egyptian resorts is Sharm El Sheikh.  Here are concentrated a lot of fashionable hotels of various categories, of which five-star hotels, for example, Maritim Jolie Ville Royal Peninsula Resort 5 *, are especially in demand.  It is here that you can meet a magnificent combination of quality services and prices.  However, before proceeding with the description of this hotel, it will not be out of place to talk a little about the resort itself, about the climate of these places and about the beach area. </p><h2>  Sharm El Sheikh - the best resort on the Red Sea </h2><p>  The popularity of this resort is due to its location.  It is surrounded on all sides by national parks: on the south-west side - Ras Mohammed, and on the north-east - Nabcom.  In addition, it is protected from the northwest by the majestic Sinai Mountains.  Sharm el-Sheikh in its structure is a completely European resort, although it is located in North Africa.  Its coast stretches for 35 km.  About 200 hotels of different categories are located along several lines along it.  By the way, here it is absolutely not necessary that the five-star hotel is located on the first coastline.  So, Maritim Jolie Ville Royal Peninsula Hotel Resort 5 * is on the third lane, but this does not detract from its merits in the eyes of tourists.  The resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSharm el-Sheikh consists of several beaches that seem to border the main bays formed by the Red Sea off the coast of Egypt.  All of them are interconnected by a single main street of the resort - Peace Road.  The most popular beaches among tourists are Naama Bay, Sharm El Maya, Sharks Bay, in which the aforementioned Maritim Jolie Ville Royal 5 * hotel is located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sharks Bay Beach </h2><p>  The name of this coast is translated from English as "shark bay."  Sharks off the coast of Egypt are rare.  According to information provided by the resort authorities, they have not been seen here since 2010.  Despite its name, the beach is a great attraction for guests of the country, as it is located close (5 km) from the main airport.  In addition, the beach attracts fans of snorkeling and diving.  Indeed, right next to the shore there are coral gardens, in which numerous marine inhabitants live.  By the way, here in a matter of days you can take a diving course and under the supervision of an experienced instructor make your first sea dive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maritim jolie ville royal 5" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/499769.jpg" width="454"></div>  If you have long dreamed of taking an underwater excursion, then you cannot find a better place than Sharks Bay.  Buy tours to one of the upscale hotels in this resort, for example, to the hotel complex Maritim Jolie Ville Royal Peninsula Resort 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh), and your dreams will come true.

    <h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  Resorts of Egypt, located on the shores of the Red Sea (Red Sea), are located in a tropical climate zone, however, the proximity of the desert leaves its mark on the weather conditions of these places.  This is due to the small amount of annual precipitation, or rather, their complete absence.  The minimum temperature that has ever been recorded on the coast is +10 degrees.  However, this is extremely rare here, and only in January or February nights.  The temperature of the sea never drops below +20 degrees.  It is especially hot here in the summer, when the thermometer rises to the mark of +40 degrees and above, and the water temperature rises to +30.  However, a high percentage of moisture off the coast makes the heat less noticeable than in the desert.  Based on the foregoing, it should be understood that the most successful period for relaxing in these Egyptian resorts is the off-season (spring and autumn months), although it is also very cool here during the New Year and Christmas holidays. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maritim jolie ville royal peninsula resort 5 egypt" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/499768.jpg" width="500"></div>
