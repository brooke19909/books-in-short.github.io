    <p>  How to make <span>paper crafts with your own hands?</span>  First of all, it is worth stocking up with patience, desire and, of course, the necessary tools.  In addition to paper of various colors (square, 10 by 10 cm in size), you need to take scissors, glue, you can pick up long dry branches - if the composition was intended to resemble a bush or tree - and a vase (so that there were places to put the finished flowers).  Colored paper should be thick enough, preferably double-sided, plain or corrugated, with or without drawings. </p><p>  So, how to make a rose out of paper with your own hands?  We take a square sheet of thick paper of the selected color, for example, yellow.  Now on it you need to draw a smooth and neat oval maze (or spiral).  There is nothing complicated in this, the main thing is to do everything without blots and carefully.  Such a spiral is drawn on each sheet, depending on how many roses you want to make.  Then it is necessary to carefully and carefully cut out this spiral with scissors along the drawn lines.  Everything, the workpiece is ready, you can create the flower itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a rose from paper do it yourself" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10666/210394.jpg" width="448"></div>  We take up the outer edge of the spiral and begin to twist it - tight enough, but at the same time leaving a small distance between the layers so that they do not closely adjoin each other from one edge, creating the effect of rose petals.  The resulting roll should be tightened to the end.  The edge sticks (that's why we needed glue).  Actually, the flower is ready.  To it, you need to cut a small and neat leaf out of green paper.  Using glue we connect the elements.  Or you can do it in another way - do not use glue at all and fasten the rose and the leaf in another way: a notch is carefully made at the base of the leaf, then the leaf is planted on one of the taken dry branches.  A rose is also attached to it.  Everything, one flower is ready.  Thus, the question <span>"How to make a rose from paper</span> with your own hands?"  ceased to be closed to you.

    <p>  The next stage is the assembly of the bouquet.  All branches with flowers can simply be put in a vase, or you can create an unusual composition at all: put several roses of the same or different sizes on different branches, put branches in a vase and decorate with beads, tinsel or toys.  It all depends on the imagination and purpose, which the craft will serve.  Now, knowing how to make a rose out of paper with your own hands, you can teach this to a child.  And together, build a <span>gorgeous bouquet</span> as a gift to your grandmother, say, on March 8th. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a star out of paper with your own hands" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10666/210410.jpg" width="576"></div>
