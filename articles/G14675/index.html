How to decorate a bottle with your own hands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any housewife can give a special look to her house.  To do this, you need to decorate the interior with original things made by yourself.  And as a rule, everything you need is at hand: an old <span>coffee table,</span> shreds of fabric, seashells, the remains of ceiling tiles ... But you never know what objects that in skillful hands will become a work of art.  A little imagination, and the idea comes to life.  And now you become the owners of things that bring originality to your interior. </p><h2>  Decoupage </h2><p>  Decoupage is translated from French as "an item that is carved."  In needlework, this word was originally called the method of applying elements cut from paper on some object.  For greater strength, these glued elements were subsequently varnished, and the surface took the form of a painting.  So the poor peasants in China decorated the furniture, and from here this technology of making decor items with their own hands went.  This article will discuss how to make a decoupage of a glass bottle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage bottles of toilet paper.

    <h2>  Different ideas: what happens </h2><p>  For such crafts, a bottle of unusual shape is usually taken.  Most often, this is a container from under expensive branded alcohol.  It is interesting in itself, and after decorating it generally turns out to be a real masterpiece, but only on the condition that the decoupage is done qualitatively. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are many ways to give a new look to a bottle.  Having appeared at the end of the seventeenth century, this technique of decorating objects is being improved.  Today, such types of decoupage are widely represented in needlework. </p><ol><li>  Volumetric (creation of 3D-images from improvised materials). </li><li>  Classic (drawing a picture directly on the subject). </li><li>  Artistic (creating a single full-fledged canvas using different effects). </li><li>  Reverse <span>(glass decoration</span> on the back). </li><li>  Dekopatch (work using the patchwork style). </li></ol><p>  Today, there are several ways to <span>decorate a bottle</span> with your own hands.  This is decoration with toilet paper, tights, napkins, semolina, paper of various kinds. </p><h2>  Method 1: toilet paper </h2><p>  A common way of decorating is decoupage of a bottle with toilet paper.  The master class offers step-by-step instructions for making such a craft. </p><p>  You will need toilet paper, paints, paste, brush, pencil for decoration. </p><p>  At the first stage, we make the basis.  To do this, apply glue to the bottle and glue the paper, forming small arbitrary folds. </p><p>  At the second stage, when the base dries, we make a drawing (for example, a tree).  Better to start with a simple outline with large details.  When this technique is mastered, you can subsequently proceed to more complex compositions. </p><p>  We continue the decoupage of the bottle with toilet paper.  The master class offers the third stage of work.  Now glue the paper according to the drawing, forming individual parts of the tree.  This is done like this: we tear off a piece of paper, twist the flagellum from it, dip it in glue and apply it to the drawing.  The trunk and branches of the tree are made of flagella of different thicknesses.  You can also make stones, water, weed.  Upon completion, it must be thoroughly dried. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to decorate a bottle with your own hands" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1079569.jpg" width="214"></div>

This is done with paints and a brush.  We apply paints in a thick layer to give volume.  Your imagination will tell you how best to make a decoupage bottle with toilet paper, a master class on the manufacture of which we have considered. </p><h2>  Method 2: tights </h2><p>  Now let's see how the decoupage of <span>bottles</span> is done with <span>tights.</span>  <span>Take the</span> most ordinary <span>bottle of</span> vodka.  This craft is called "Grape Bunch".  Step-by-step work on this craft will demonstrate one more way how to decorate a bottle with your own hands. </p><p>  First, wash and degrease the bottle. </p><p>  At the next stage, we wet the nylon stocking in PVA glue diluted with water in a ratio of 1: 1.  Now we put the capron on the bottle, fix it on the neck and gently press it against the walls of the bottle, forming arbitrary folds.  Leave to dry.  When dry, the wrinkles will tighten a little. </p><p>  At the next stage, we cover with acrylic paint of the desired color, then with varnish, again dry for 24 hours. </p><p>  After that, using a regular sponge, we tint to emphasize the folds.  This will give a special effect to our product. </p><p>  Now take the pebbles and form a bunch of grapes.  We make leaves out of paper, and antennae out of wire.  We make a brush, tint.  And our wonderful bottle is ready.  Other drawings are possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage bottles of tights" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1079581.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <h2>  other methods </h2><p>  This art is amazing - decoupage.  Creative ideas make wonderful models. </p><p>  Let's see how you can use napkins to decorate bottles.  To do this, on a clean bottle, we first make the basis: we use acrylic paints, we decorate the bottle with them, choosing a color suitable for the shade of the main paper motifs.  Glue a pattern cut from a napkin using decoupage glue onto dried paint.  Let‚Äôs dry, then draw lines along the outline of the picture with <span>gold paints</span> to shade the application.  In addition, it will give a volumetric effect.  Further, at your discretion, you can decorate the neck of the bottle and finally cover the picture with varnish.  This method is simpler to perform than decoupage of a bottle with toilet paper, a master class on the manufacture of which was presented above. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage Glass Bottle" class="if" height="261" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1079588.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  And here is the decoupage of the bottle with paper.  We take the newspaper as the basis for the decor.  You will also need acrylic paints, PVA glue and varnish.  Wash the bottle and dry well, the label can not be removed.  We put glue on the bottle, we tear off pieces of paper from the newspaper, crush and glue the bottle.  Press the paper tight so that there is no air left under it.  Folds are formed in random order.  When dry, paint with paints and varnish.  You can make another option.  Before applying paints from newspaper flagella we lay out an improvised frame on the bottle.  Then, when everything is covered with paints and varnish, here you can add a picture or photo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage paper bottles" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1079662.jpg" width="541"></div>
