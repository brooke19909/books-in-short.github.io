  <section class="page js-page"><h1>War in korea</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After the end of World War <span>II, the northern</span> territory of Korea (north of the 38th parallel) was occupied by the Soviet Union.  The southern territory (south of the 38th parallel) is occupied by the United States.  The USSR and the United States failed to agree peacefully on the <span>unification of Korea</span> into one country.  This, in turn, provoked the formation of two government organizations in 1948. </p><p>  With United Nations support, the United States held elections in the south that replaced the interim government with an anti-communist one.  Lee Son Man became the head. </p><p>  In the Northern Territory, the <span>Soviet Union</span> transferred power to the communist government, whose head was Kim Il Sung. </p><p>  The war in Korea (1950-1953) was a conflict between the southern and northern territories.  However, very often these military operations are seen as an indirect confrontation between the allied forces of the USSR and the PRC and the United States and their allies. </p><p>  The war in Korea began with the offensive of the Northern Coalition in June-August 1950.  On June 5, North Korean troops (DPRK army), covering themselves with artillery, invaded southern territory.  About 90% of all South Korean land was occupied. </p><p>  It should be noted that this attack came as a surprise to both the United States and other Western countries. </p><p>  In New York, <span>the United Nations</span> Security Council convenes on June 25 <span>.</span>  The main issue on the agenda was the war in Korea. </p><p>  The Western powers supported the United States by providing them with military assistance.  Allied forces went to South Korea.  However, despite the reinforcements, the South Korean army could not get out of the encirclement (Busan perimeter).  The military only managed to stabilize the situation on the front line near the Naktong River. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It seemed that the DPRK troops could occupy the entire territory of the peninsula.  However, soon the South Korean forces with the forces of the allies managed to go on the offensive. </p><p>  The most important in the first months of hostilities was the Daejeon offensive operation (from July 3 to July 25, 1950), the Naktong operation (from July 26 to August 20). </p><p>  On September 15, a counterattack was launched, as a result of which the North Korean troops began to lose.  The Allied forces had little before the capture of the northern territories. </p><p>  The war in Korea after October 8 continued with the participation of China.  Chairman of the Chinese side Mao ordered the Chinese troops to prepare to force the Yalu River.  The USSR provided air support.  At the same time, the air war in Korea took place under the condition that <span>Soviet aircraft</span> (MiG-15) should not be closer to the front line closer than 100 kilometers. </p><p>  Outdated American F-80 aircraft were defeated by the new Soviet Union <span>jet aircraft</span> .  Soon, more modern F-86s appeared in Korea. </p><p>  The first aerial victory was won in 1950 on November 1.  On September 12 of the following year, eighty Soviet aircraft were intercepted by one hundred and fifty American F-80s, which were engaged in assault flights between Pyongyang and Anju. </p><p>  The issue of the entry of the Chinese army into the conflict was resolved in mid-October 1950 and agreed with Moscow. </p><p>  North Korean forces along with the Chinese army captured Seoul in 1951, January 4.  In the same year, April 22, the DPRK troops launched a counterattack.  The attack on May 16 was stopped on May 21.  After that, UN forces launched large-scale military operations on the entire front.  The North Korean army was thrown for 38 parallel. </p><p>  The war in Korea in June 1951 reached a critical point.  Despite the rather large losses, each side had an almost millionth army. </p><p>  At the end of hostilities, the front line changed slightly.  Long negotiations began.  At the same time, the fighting continued. </p><p>  In 1952, on November 4, Eisenhower <span>(US President)</span> visited Korea.  The purpose of his visit was to clarify the circumstances in which it is possible to end hostilities.  The turning point was the death of Stalin (1953, March 5).  Soon after, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU (B.) Voted to end the war. </p>
