The young man received his education at the Komissarovsky technical school, and later at the State Technical University of Moscow. </p><p>  Klimov began working in 1917.  The main posts that he held: </p><ul><li>  Design Engineer at <span>Kolomensky Zavod</span> ; </li><li>  worked in the Council of the national economy, dealing with aircraft engines; </li><li>  headed the commissions that procured licenses for foreign engines in Paris and Berlin; </li><li>  taught at MVTU, Lomonosov University, Academy of the Air Fleet; </li><li>  He headed the department at the Moscow Aviation Institute for the design of aircraft engines. </li></ul><p>  In addition, he participated in the development of various engines, such as M-12, M-13, M-23, M-100, M-105, VK-107, VK-108 and others.  The engines he developed were installed on bombers who successfully fought in World War II. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Contribution to the victory over Hitler </h2>

    <p>  With the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, the plant where Vladimir Klimov worked was evacuated to Ufa.  He began to lead the Ufa Motor Plant No. 28.  The scientist not only established the mass production of already proven engines, but also improved them.  After each combat sortie of a military aircraft, the scientist had the opportunity to check the operation of the engine in practice and to eliminate the occurring shortcomings.  About 90% of military aircraft flew on the engines of Vladimir Klimov. </p><p>  During the war years, he invested in the construction of military aircraft more than seventy thousand rubles from personal savings.  He informed Stalin of this in a letter and received approval in response. </p><h2>  Jet engine </h2><p>  After the war, a new stage began in the life of Vladimir Klimov.  He set about creating jet aircraft engines.  The first prototypes were created in the late forties of the twentieth century. </p>

    <p>  By 1951, the VK-1F was designed by scientists.  This name was one of the first in the world market of turbojet engines.  The invention had a number of features: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  a closed liquid cooling method has been introduced; </li><li>  two-speed air supercharger; </li><li>  improved gas distribution system; </li><li>  improved power system. </li></ul><p>  Jet engines, which were developed by the scientist Vladimir Klimov, were used for MiG series fighters.  The pilots who fought on them gave positive feedback.  It was with this engine that on board the MiG-17 fighter for the first time they were able to achieve supersonic speed in flight. </p><h2>  Last years </h2><p>  In 1956, Vladimir Klimov was appointed General Designer for aircraft engines in the Union.  He also remained the director of plant No. 117.  In addition to design, he was engaged in research activities, for example, studied the theory of lubrication. </p><p>  In 1960, he went on a well-deserved rest.  The last years of his life he lived in Moscow.  The outstanding scientist of 09/09/1962 did not become.  He was buried in his hometown at the Novodevichy cemetery next to his wife.  The head of a scientist is carved on a tombstone.  On it he is depicted in his youth. </p><h2>  Perpetuating memory </h2>

    <p>  After the death of the scientist, his inventions and scientific works remained.  They are still used.  The memory of his merits is preserved in our days: </p><ul><li>  In 2002, in the Ukrainian city of Zaporozhye, the street was named after a scientist.  It is located in the Shevchenko district.  In the same city there is a park named after the academician. </li><li>  The name of the designer is the Scientific and Production Association.  A <span>memorial plaque is</span> placed on the factory building <span>.</span>  Opened it in 2002. </li><li>  In honor of the scientist named the square in St. Petersburg. </li><li>  In Moscow, a bust of Klimov Vladimir.  The photo with the designer has not survived so much.  There is a bust at the intersection of Aviamotornaya and Soldatskaya Streets, opposite the building of the Central Institute of Aviation Motors.  The monument was opened in 1976.  The sculptor was Philippov, the architect was Skokan. </li></ul><p>  Klimov was part of a great era in the development of air.  People were able not only to rise above the ground, but were able to fly at great speed.  A significant contribution to this was made by Vladimir Yakovlevich.  The engines that he created allowed Russia to keep up with other countries in the aircraft industry and helped to win the war.  Thanks to such people, the Soviet state declared itself to the world. </p>
