Now you can pay a little attention to the sights, for the sake of which, by the way, many people stay at this hotel - it is very convenient to get from them. </p><p>  The Temple of Apollo (the patron saint of beauty and art) was erected in the 2nd century A.D.  The antique building was badly damaged during the earthquake and today there are only a few columns of white marble and picturesque ruins.  According to legend, the temple was erected by order of the military commander Anthony in honor of the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra.  This place is a symbol of the city and one of the most romantic attractions of the country. </p><p>  The Temple of Athena is located to the right of the Temple of Apollo and is a ruin, as if raised from the seabed.  It offers stunning views of the sea, against which great pictures will be obtained. </p><p>  The open-air amphitheater is one of the largest antique buildings with a capacity of 18,000 spectators.  Sea battles, battles of gladiators with predators were organized here, and in the V-VI century the theater was used as a church. </p><p>  The famous <span>Manavgat waterfall</span> is located near Side, and in fact is the threshold of the river, where observation platforms are installed at different levels.  Crowds of tourists gather in this picturesque place to take amazing and spectacular photographs. </p><p>  The ancient Roman aqueduct stretches along the northwest side of the city.  At one time, it was used to transport water to the city from the Manavgat River.  The aqueduct is built surprisingly even on a complex system in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãa mountain landscape.  Some time ago, this building was restored with the money of a married couple living in Side. </p><p>  Well, a summary.  Holidays in Side will certainly be remembered for its clean beaches, interesting sights dating back to the antiquity, local flavor and traditional cuisine.  And the Sentido Turan Prince hotel will be the best choice for a comfortable stay with 5-star service. </p>
