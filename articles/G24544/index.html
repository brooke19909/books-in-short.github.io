    <h2>  The first mystery.  Childhood </h2><p>  If we talk about the early years of this personality, then you involuntarily come to the conclusion that there are more riddles and uncertainties in her biography than genuine information.  Her exact place of origin and nationality is still unknown - more than 300 years after her birth, historians cannot give an exact answer. </p><p>  According to one version, Ekaterina Alekseevna was born on April 5, 1684 in the family of a Lithuanian (or maybe Latvian) peasant in the vicinity of Kegums, which was located in the historical region of Vidzeme.  Then these territories were part of the most powerful Swedish state. </p><p>  Another version testifies to its Estonian roots.  It is narrated that she was supposedly born in the modern city of Tartu, which was called Derpt at the end of the 17th century.  But it is also indicated that it was not of high descent, but left the peasantry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In recent years, another version has appeared.  Catherine's father was Samuel Skavronsky, who served Casimir Jan Sapieha.  Once he fled to Livonia, settled in the Marienburg area, where he started a family. </p><p>  Here is another nuance.  Ekaterina Alekseevna - the Russian princess - did not have the name by which she went down in history.  Her real name is Skavronskaya, named by Martha, who was the daughter of Samuel.  But it is not worth a woman with that name to occupy the Russian throne, so she received new "passport details" and became Mikhailova Ekaterina Alekseevna. </p>

    <h2>  The second mystery.  Adolescence </h2><p>  In Europe, in those early years, the plague was still dangerous.  And her family could not avoid this danger.  As a result, in the year Martha was born, her parents died from a "black death".  There was only an uncle who could not assume the responsibilities of a parent, so he gave the girl to the family of Ernst Gluck, who was a Lutheran pastor.  By the way, he is famous for translating the Bible into Latvian.  In 1700, the Northern War began, in which Sweden and Russia were the main opposing forces.  In 1702, the Russian army stormed the impregnable fortress of Marienburg.  Then Ernst Gluck and Martha were sent to Moscow as prisoners.  After some time, under the receipt of the pastor Fagetsy settled in his house, in the German settlement.  Marta herself - the future Ekaterina Alekseevna - did not learn to read and write and was in the house as a servant. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The version given in the dictionary of Brockhaus and Efron gives other information according to which her mother did not die of the plague, but lost her husband.  Widowed, she was forced to give her daughter to the family of the same Gluck.  And this version says that she studied literacy and various needlework. </p><p>  According to the third version, she got into the family of Gluck after reaching 12 years.  Before that, Marta lived with Anna Veselovskaya, her aunt.  At 17, she was married to a Swede Johannes Kruse on the eve of the Russian offensive on the fortress of Marienburg.  After 1 or 2 days he had to go to war, where he went missing. </p><p>  Such secrets of birth and early years were enveloped in her personality by Ekaterina Alekseevna.  Her biography does not at all become 100% clear from now on; various white spots will still appear in it. </p>

    <h2>  Field Marshal Sheremetev in the life of Catherine </h2><p>  Russian troops at the beginning of the Northern War in Livonia were led by Sheremetev.  He managed to capture the main <span>fortress of Marienburg,</span> after which the main forces of the Swedes moved on.  The triumphant, however, subjected the brutal plunder to the edge.  He himself reported to the Russian tsar as follows: "... he sent to burn and capture in all directions, nothing was left intact. Men and women were taken prisoner, everything was devastated and burned. Work horses and other cattle in the amount of 20,000 were taken, the rest was chopped and chopped " </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the fortress, Field Marshal captured 400 people.  Pastor Ernst Gluck came to Sheremetev with a petition for the fate of the inhabitants, and here (Sheremetev) was noticed by Ekaterina Alekseevna, who then had the name Marta Kruse.  The elderly field marshal sent all the inhabitants and Gluck to Moscow, and Marta was taken by force as a mistress.  For several months she was his concubine, after which, in a heated quarrel, Menshikov took Martha from him, since then her life has been associated with a new military and political figure, Peter's closest associate. </p><h2>  Peter Henry Bruce Version </h2><p>  In a more favorable offering for Catherine herself, the Scot Bruce described these events in his memoirs.  According to him, Martha after the capture of Marienburg was taken by Baur, colonel of the Dragoon regiment, and in the future general. </p><p>  Placing her at home, Baur instructed her to do housework.  She had the right to fully control the servant.  What she did quite skillfully, as a result, she earned the love and respect of her subordinates.  Later, the general recalled that his house had never before been so well-groomed as under Marta.  Once Prince Menshikov, the immediate superior of Baura, was on a visit with him, during which he noticed a girl, she turned out to be Ekaterina Alekseevna.  The photo in those years did not yet exist to capture it, but Menshikov himself noted her unusual facial features and manners.  He became interested in Martha and asked Baur about her.  In particular, does she know how to cook and farm.  To which he received an affirmative answer.  Then Prince Menshikov said that his house is in fact without good supervision and needs just such a woman as our heroine. </p><p>  Baur was greatly indebted to the prince, and after these words he called Marta and said that before her Menshikov was her new master.  He assured the prince that she would become a good support for him in the household and a friend to rely on.  In addition, Baur greatly respected Marta in order to prevent her from ‚Äúbeing able to gain a share of honor and good fortune.‚Äù  Since that time, Catherine I Alekseevna began to live in the house of Prince Menshikov.  It was the year 1703. </p>

    <h2>  The first meeting of Peter and Catherine </h2><p>  On one of his frequent trips to Menshikov, Tsar <span>Peter I</span> met and then turned Martha into his mistress.  There is written evidence of their first meeting. </p><p>  Menshikov lived in Petersburg (then - Nyenshants).  Peter went to Livonia, but wanted to stay with his friend Menshikov.  That same evening he first saw his chosen one.  She became Ekaterina Alekseevna - the wife (in the future) of Peter the Great.  She served the table that evening.  The tsar asked Menshikov who she was, where and where he could get it from.  After which Peter looked at Catherine for a long time and intently, as a result of which he jokingly told her to bring a candle to him before going to bed.  However, this joke was an order that could not be abandoned.  They spent this night together.  In the morning, Peter left, in gratitude, he left her 1 ducat, martially putting it in Martha's hand at parting. </p><p>  This was the king‚Äôs first meeting with a servant girl who was destined to become empress.  This meeting was very important, because if it had not happened, Peter would never have known about the existence of such an unusual girl. </p><p>  In 1710, on the occasion of the victory in <span>the Battle of Poltava</span> in Moscow, a triumphal procession was organized.  The area was held captive by the Swedish army.  Sources say that among them was the husband of Catherine Johannes Kruse.  He said that the girl who gives birth to the king one by one is his wife.  The result of these words was his exile to Siberia, where he died in 1721. </p>

    <h2>  Lover of Peter the Great </h2><p>  The following year, after the first meeting with the tsar, Catherine I Alekseevna gave birth to the firstborn, whom she named Peter, a year later a second child appeared - Pavel.  They soon died.  The tsar called her Martha Vasilevskaya, probably by the name of her aunt.  In 1705, he decided to take it to himself and settled it in the house of his sister Natalia in Preobrazhensky.  There, Marta learned Russian literacy and became friends with the Menshikov family. </p><p>  In 1707 or 1708 Martha Skavronskaya converted to Orthodoxy.  After baptism, she received a new name - Ekaterina Alekseevna Mikhailova.  She received her patronymic by the name of her godfather, whom Tsarevich Alexei turned out to be, the surname was given by Peter in order to remain incognito. </p><h2>  The lawful wife of Peter the Great </h2><p>  Catherine was the beloved woman of Peter, she was the love of his life.  Yes, he had a huge number of novels and affairs, but he loved only one person - his Martha.  She saw it.  Peter I, as is known from the memoirs of his contemporaries, suffered from severe headaches.  No one could do anything with them.  Ekaterina Alekseevna was his "analgesic."  When the king began another attack, she sat down next to him, hugged him and stroked his head, in a few minutes he fell asleep with a sound sleep.  After awakening, he felt fresh, vigorous, ready for new achievements. </p><p>  In the spring of 1711, going on a Prut campaign, Peter gathered his relatives in Preobrazhensky, brought his chosen one in front of them and said that from now on everyone should consider her a legitimate wife and queen.  He also said that if he dies before he can marry, then everyone should consider her the rightful heir to the Russian throne. </p><p>  The wedding took place only in 1712, February 19, in the church of Isaac Dalmatsky.  From this moment, Ekaterina Alekseevna - Peter's wife.  Spouses were strongly attached to each other, especially Peter.  He wanted to see her everywhere: during the descent of the ship, military review, on holidays. </p>

Regarding the process of succession to the throne, he did not bypass this issue.  In 1722, a reform was made in this area, according to which the heir to the throne was not the first male descendant, but the one appointed by the current ruler.  As a result, any subject could become a ruler. </p><p>  On November 15, 1723, Peter issued a manifesto on the coronation of Catherine.  The coronation itself took place on May 7, 1724. </p><p>  The last weeks of his life Peter became very sick.  And when Catherine realized that he was no longer recovering from the disease, she called on Prince Menshikov and Count Tolstoy so that they would work to attract the powers that be on her side, since Peter did not have time to leave his wills. </p><p>  On January 28, 1725, with the support of the guard and most of the nobles, Catherine was proclaimed Empress, heiress of Peter the Great. </p>

    <h2>  Great Ekaterina Alekseevna on the Russian throne </h2><p>  Russian imperial power during the reign of Catherine was not autocratic.  In fact, power was in the hands of the Privy Council, although it was alleged that the Senate possessed all its fullness, which under Catherine was renamed the Great Senate.  Infinite power was vested in Prince Menshikov, the same one who took Martha Skavronskaya from Count Sheremetev. </p><p>  Ekaterina Alekseevna - Empress without state affairs.  She was not interested in the state, putting all the care on Menshikov, Tolstoy and the Privy Council created in 1726.  Her interest was only in foreign policy and especially in the fleet, which was transferred to her from her husband.  The Senate in these years has lost its decisive influence.  All documents were developed by the Privy Council, and the empress's function was to simply sign them. </p><p>  The long <span>reign of Peter I</span> passed in constant wars, the burden of which completely fell on the shoulders of the common population.  It is tired of it.  At the same time, there was a poor harvest in agriculture, bread prices were rising.  The country was in a tense atmosphere.  In order to somehow defuse her, Catherine reduced the capitation rate from 74 to 70 cents.  The born Marta Skavronskaya, unfortunately, did not differ in her reformist characteristics, which her namesake was endowed with - Empress Catherine 2 Alekseevna, and her state activities were limited to petty deeds.  While the country was buried in embezzlement and arbitrariness on the ground. </p><p>  Poor education and non-participation in state affairs nevertheless did not deprive her of people's love - she was buried in it.  Catherine willingly helped the unfortunate and just people asking for help, others wanted to see her godfather.  As a rule, she did not refuse anyone and gave the next godson a few pieces of gold. </p><p>  Catherine 1 Alekseevna was in power for only two years - from 1725 to 1727.  During this time, the Academy of Sciences was opened, the Bering expedition was organized and carried out, and the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky was introduced. </p><h2>  Leaving life </h2><p>  After the death of Peter, Catherine‚Äôs life spun: masquerades, balls, festivities, greatly undermined her health.  In April 1727, on the 10th, the empress fell ill, her cough intensified, and signs of lung damage were revealed.  The death of Ekaterina Alekseevna was a matter of time.  She had less than a month to live. </p><p>  May 6, 1727, in the evening, at 9 o‚Äôclock, Catherine died.  She was 43 years old.  Before her death, a will was drawn up, which the Empress could no longer sign, so there was a signature on her daughter Elizabeth.  According to the will, the throne was to be occupied by Peter Alekseevich, the grandson of Emperor Peter I. </p>

    <p> Ekaterina Alekseevna and Peter I were a good couple.  They supported each other's lives.  Catherine acted magically, soothingly at him, Peter, in turn, restrained her internal energy.  After his death, Catherine spent the remaining time in festivities and drinking parties.  Many eyewitnesses claimed that she simply wanted to be forgotten, while others talk about her walking nature.  In any case, the people loved her, she knew how to win over men and remained the empress, not having real power in her hands.  Ekaterina 1 Alekseevna began the era of the rule of women in the Russian Empire, who remained at the helm until the end of the 18th century with short interruptions of several years. </p>
