And there is an explanation for this.  Residents of the capital of the <span>Samara region</span> prefer to see everything in their city only "the most-most."  So, Kuibyshev Square is the largest of all European squares.  Samara is proud of its embankment, which in Russia is the longest.  Beats records and the building of the railway station.  It is the highest among similar structures of the Old World.  In 2018, in the city located on the bank of the deepest European river, a match is planned to be held as part of the world football championship.  By this time, an even greater number of different attractions will appear in the city. </p>

The city is famous for its contribution to the national space industry.  During the Second World War, it was Samara that was the so-called reserve capital of our state.  The regional center is the birthplace of the most correct beer brand "Zhigulevskoe" and delicious chocolate.

    <p>  All milestones in the history of the city reflect the monuments of Samara.  Moreover, there are some very unusual ones among them.  So, taking walks through the streets, you can meet a smoking crocodile, a monkey sitting at the keyboard, as well as a monument to the heating battery.  I would like to talk more about <span>monumental sculptures</span> and unusual art objects. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><br>  Sculptures of the Soviet era </h2><p>  Many monuments of Samara, which were erected on the squares and streets of the regional center in the era of the USSR, are truly monumental works.  The opening of one of them took place on November 7, 1927 on Revolution Square.  It was dedicated to the decade of the Great October Revolution.  It was on this day that the monument to V.I.  Lenin - the leader of the Bolsheviks.  The author of the sculpture is Matvey Manizer.  He became a classic of socialist realism by the end of the thirties of the last century. </p>

In 1917, the sculpture of the king tragically killed by a bomb was hammered with planks.  Subsequently, it was dismantled, and all the bronze parts on the pedestal were sent for remelting.

It is worth noting that at the same time he always re-takes its rightful place. </p><p>  The monument to Chapaev is popular among children.  They gladly climb onto it, while feeling themselves part of the great army of the commander. </p><h2>  Monument to Kuibyshev </h2><p>  In the Soviet period, Samara was given the name of this major statesman.

    <p>  In life, Kuibyshev's head size was larger than the standard, which created a certain imbalance with the body.  All this is reflected in the installed monument. </p><h2>  Composition with a heating battery </h2><p>  The monuments of Samara are mostly devoted to political and military events.  However, there are exceptions.  In 2005, an unusual monument was built in the regional center to an indispensable device - a heating battery.  The year of the opening of this monument was not chosen by chance.  It was in 2005 that this invention turned one hundred and fifty years old. </p>

    <h2>  Monument to Nansen </h2><p>  This famous Norwegian polar explorer and philanthropist made a great contribution to saving the starving inhabitants of the Volga region.  Fridtjof Nansen served as Commissioner of the League of Nations for Prisoners of War.  On the creation of a monument to this researcher in 1930, a resolution was adopted by the Moscow Council of Deputies.  However, this decision was not implemented. </p><p>  The monument to Nansen in Samara was made with the money of city residents.  The project of the composition, installed at the entrance to the railway station, was the development of a student of the SSACU Daria Bakshutova.  The monument is a cube made of glass.  The side of the figure is eight hundred millimeters.  A portrait of Nansen and a text are written on the cube, which tells about the help of the Nobel Prize winner, which he provided to the starving residents of the Volga region.  The inscription is made in three languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Norwegian, Russian and English. </p><h2>  Monument to Pinocchio </h2><p>  A significant event was timed to the day of the city in the regional center.  The Pinocchio monument in Samara was opened in the year of the celebration of the centennial of the birth of A. Tolstoy.  This outstanding writer is the author of Golden Key.  A fairy-tale hero cast in bronze was installed in the Strukovsky garden. </p>

Tolstoy.  In this city, the writer was born and studied.  One of the best <span>Samara museums</span> is located in the former estate of Tolstoy.  In honor of the famous countryman was named one of the streets of the city.  And therefore there is nothing surprising in the fact that the monuments of Samara were replenished with a sculpture of this fairy-tale hero.  The bronze Pinocchio, who raised his hand with the Golden Key, was cast by sculptor S. Karslyan.

    <h2>  Monument to Sukhov </h2><p>  The beloved movie hero, in the end, returned to his home.  The monument to Sukhov in Samara was not opened by chance.  It was in this city that the Red Army soldier from the "White Sun of the Desert" traveled through the territory of Turkestan.  In addition, the screenwriter of the film, V. Yezhov, also lived in Samara. </p><p>  The bronze statue, installed on the city promenade, has a height of two meters.  The words of Sukhov, known to everyone, are put on the base of the monument: ‚ÄúDo you have any questions?  No questions!".  They were written by the hand of actor Anatoly Kuznetsov.  The monument was a gift to the inhabitants of Samara from Konstantin Chernyavsky - a sculptor from Moscow.  The author plans to create copies of other characters of the popular motion picture. </p><h2>  Company "Danila Master" </h2><p>  Currently, there is a company in Samara that carries out ritual products for customers.  He makes granite and marble monuments "Danila Master".  Samara is one of the cities of Russia in which the capital company has opened its branch.
