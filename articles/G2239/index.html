City Kapan </h2><p>  <span>Syunik province is located in close proximity to the border of Armenia with Azerbaijan and Iran, to which it belonged until the beginning of the nineteenth century, when it was conquered by the Russian Empire and came under its control.</span> </p><p>  <span>As a result of administrative transformations of the imperial authorities, the ancient city was significantly rebuilt, residents of neighboring villages were resettled in it, and the surrounding area was transformed into a new province.</span> </p><p>  <span>Thus, Russia strengthened itself in Transcaucasia, and the Armenian locals, although they could not defend their sovereignty, found themselves in a Christian country, in which they lived on other grounds, without being subjected to persecution, as in the neighboring Ottoman Empire.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Geography and climate of the city </h2><p>  <span>The city of Kapan in Armenia is one of the largest southern cities of the country.</span>  <span>Given the significant heights of the city, and they reach thousands of meters above sea level, the climate of the city can be described as temperate continental, although it is only eighty kilometers from the Iranian border.</span> </p><p>  <span>In the province there is Mount Hutup, whose height reaches 3201 meters.</span>  <span>On one of the slopes of the mountain, the Vachangay River originates, the length of which does not exceed thirty-five kilometers.</span>  <span>It is on the banks of Vachangai that the city of Kapan stands.</span> </p><p>  <span>Armenia is famous for its mountain landscapes, and the province of Syunik is no exception: gorges, hollows and turbulent mountain rivers attract beauty lovers from all over Europe and from Iran, which traditionally has a great influence on the politics and economy of the country.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Economics and tourism </h2><p>  <span>Unlike neighboring Georgia, Armenia, although it is known for its popularity, still attracts a significantly smaller number of tourists from the European Union.</span>  <span>Perhaps this is due to the remoteness of Armenia from the main transport routes and its isolation by such countries of the region as Turkey and Azerbaijan, with which the country does not have an open border.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>In addition, significantly fewer international flights arrive <span>at the Yerevan</span> international <span>airport</span> , and there are no international budget airlines among Zvartnots customers.</span>  <span>But it is budget carriers that bring the largest number of tourists to neighboring Georgia, among which there are many young travelers.</span> </p><p>  <span>Any city in Armenia boasts a large number of monuments of ancient history, among which, of course, there will be beautiful churches, because the Armenians were one of the first peoples who adopted Christianity at the official level.</span> </p><h2>  Kapan.  The city's attractions </h2><p>  <span>Speaking about the modernity of Kapan, it is worth taking into account that the modern city was built a few kilometers from the ancient settlement, which appeared here in the 5th century AD.</span>  <span>That ancient city was devastated and burned by the Seljuks in the twelfth century and several centuries later was again revived as a large feudal center of the princes Orbelian, who controlled the entire province of Syunik.</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">From that ancient city, little has been preserved.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">First of all, these are the remains of the ancient fortress wall, which survived many sieges, assaults and wars, but destroyed by time and Russian soldiers.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The ruins of several buildings, overgrown with forest and shrubs, have also been preserved, and in the immediate vicinity of the city you can find a bridge built back in the lV century AD.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Syunik Province </h2><p>  <span>Although little has been preserved from ancient times directly in Kapan, many remarkable architectural monuments can be found in the vicinity, including ancient monasteries, churches and buildings of ancient seminaries, in which the great scientists of Armenia taught.</span> </p><p>  <span>One of the country's oldest monasteries is Tsitsernavank, which is located on the territory of the historical province of Syunik, but is currently controlled by the authorities of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, which is on friendly terms with Armenia.</span>  <span>It is worth noting that the existence of this republic is the reason for the isolation of Armenia from Turkey and Azerbaijan.</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The monastery was built in the fourth century AD and is a wonderful example of the ancient eastern type in Armenian architecture.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Today, only one church has been preserved on the territory of the monastery, consecrated in honor of St. George the Victorious, and the ancient gate, while the wall itself, which once protected the city from the bustling world, has not been preserved.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Thus, Kapan in Armenia is an important transportation hub for traveling around the Caucasus.</span> </p>
