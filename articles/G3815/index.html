    <p>  The Raymar <span>Hotels Resort</span> 5 * hotel (Raymar) received the first holidaymakers in 2013.  It belongs to the third generation of Stars and Crescent hotels, in which the design and service meet the highest criteria.  It is an hour's drive from Antalya Airport.  It is located 19 km from the city of Manavgat, the recreational capabilities of which are compared with the nearby resort of <span>Side (Turkey).</span>  <span>5</span> star <span>hotels of</span> this region are traditionally in demand among tourists, therefore, the modern hotel complex we are considering was originally designed for modern infrastructure. </p><p>  Of course, contributes to the popularity of the hotel its geographical proximity to Side.  A map of the archaeological sites of Turkey is the most interesting here.  Side itself is an open-air museum, and the hotel we are going to talk about today is a convenient launching pad for excursions. </p><h2>  About the tour price </h2><p>  The price of the tour per person for 7 nights in the velvet season of 2014 is 21.2-21.7 thousand rubles.  The difference in prices (compared with the economy class) is quite noticeable.  Of course, the price of a day hostel here is more than $ 100, but the advantage over standard-type service is obvious.  With all the variety of tariff strategies that Side hotels practice, the prices in the hotel we are considering are moderate enough for the five-star class.  Pension in this hotel complex quickly became popular.  The number of applicants significantly exceeds its capacity, so if you decide to go here, think about accommodation in advance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Building </h2><p>  The hotel‚Äôs modern silhouette and unusual design have led to a harmonious combination of Art Nouveau and neo-Ottoman style.  A graceful, plant-like curvature of the fa√ßade of this dynamic designer creation is combined with a stylized Ottoman dome with a spire.  Vacationers of a multi-story hotel complex are delivered to their room by high-speed elevators, among which there are panoramic elevators. </p>

    <p>  The exterior of the hotel is memorable.  The guests of Raymar Hotels Resort 5 *, judging by the reviews, there is a sense of presence in a modern comfortable castle.  Why?  Style.  It is felt in everything here. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The hotel area is quite compact - 7000 m <sup>2</sup> .  In its layout, a minimum of perpendicular lines.  The pool, terraces and lawns are designed curvilinearly, but they are perfectly combined with each other, creating the feeling of a single ensemble. </p><p>  Obviously, over time, the landscape design of the territory will become even more refined.  Still, one year of existence of the hotel complex is not enough to fully implement the entire landscape design project.  Most likely, the English lawns of Raymar Hotels Resort 5 * will still be decorated with royal palms and plants, to which masters of topiary art will give spectacular rounded and conical shapes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pools </h2>

The use of umbrellas, sun loungers and mattresses is free of charge.  Towels are issued under the same conditions.  Note that the hotel itself has another pool - indoor.

    <p>  The first pool - the original form - is preferred by lovers of passive relaxation, fans of goodies from a nearby bar and connoisseurs of good literature.  Agree, it‚Äôs quite nice to lie quietly under the canopy of an umbrella with a cocktail and a book.  Another category of hotel guests who prefer this place are family people, as in the neighborhood there is a small safe swimming pool ‚Äúpaddling pool‚Äù and a playground for children. </p><p>  Such a decent assortment of snacks by the pool is not available for all 5 * Side hotels.  "All inclusive" - ‚Äã‚Äãthe usual system for guests - in the pool bar is determined by the ultra all inclusive level.  Its terrace seats up to 300 people.  Here, vacationers are offered pizza, french fries, hamburgers, salads, ayran, high-quality packaged juices.  Of alcoholic beverages, beer is offered (the most delicious is Ephesus), red and white wine of local origin (by the way, good), cocktails (we recommend Baileys), vodka.  Imported drinks - paid, local - free.  Note that the local low alcohol is not a scrub at all, because since ancient times the population has been engaged in winemaking in the region of Side (Turkey).  5 star hotels are eager to purchase local farmers.  Judging by the reviews of spa guests, the local ros√© wine is just a ‚Äúbomb‚Äù! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Outdoor swimming is preferred by outdoor enthusiasts.  It is spacious enough, which allows you to simultaneously play water polo and go swimming. </p><h2>  Design of hotel public areas </h2><p>  The public area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is based on the <span>principles of open architecture.</span>  This can be said about the reception area, and the restaurant, and the dance floor.  Interesting design, continuous panoramic glazing, high-quality conditioning, artificial stone flooring, designer shoes, professional three-level lighting.  Guest reviews indicate that an unusual atmosphere of freshness, purity and spaciousness reigns here, and a faint floral aroma is floating in the air. </p>

    <h2>  Unique solutions by designers </h2><p>  Each room of Raymar Hotel (Turkey) is decorated according to individual projects.  The floor of the spacious reception area, as if in a palace, is lined with artificial stone, reminiscent of plain marble.  There are relaxation areas decorated in oriental style. </p><p>  The hall of the main restaurant, which greets guests with a covered buffet, is very stylishly decorated: light ceramic flooring, interesting design of monochromatic white ceilings.  Tables are arranged along the zone of continuous glazing in such a way that a panoramic sea landscape opens in front of those sitting. </p><p>  The Raymar Hotel's cooking area (photo shows this) is in direct line of sight.  Between the zones there are three extensive transverse racks for buffet meals. </p>

    <p>  The design of the dance floor is simply fantastic: only professional architects can create compositions using pink and purple shades.  Combining these tones in the design is difficult, but if you do it correctly, and even with soft lighting pouring from decorative panels, you can create an atmosphere of surrealism. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The hotel has standard rooms (208 units with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã24 m <sup>2</sup> ) and two-room family rooms (18 units with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã37 m <sup>2</sup> ).  The rooms are made elite renovation.  Stylish designer furniture is located harmoniously.  Perfectly matched colors: snow-white ceiling, pastel walls, light laminate on the floor.  Dark blue, dark violet and accent pink elements harmoniously introduced into the composition make up a single finished composition.  Furniture and plumbing are new, expensive.  The rooms of Raymar Hotel (Side) contain all the necessary household appliances for a good-quality guesthouse.  The bathroom has a comfortable shower with hydromassage.  From the huge balcony opens a magnificent seascape. </p><h2>  Room service </h2><p>  Daily guest housekeeping.  After a day, bed linen is replaced, towels are changed every day.  To call the cleaning lady in each room there is a special button.  Through the efforts of the staff, a complete set of shampoos, conditioners, gels, and creams is maintained in the bathroom.  The minibar is constantly updated juices, mineral and drinking water. </p><p>  It is no coincidence that the Raymar Resort hotel (Turkey, Side, 5 stars) is rated in the ratings of the hotel business of the Country of Stars and Crescent for its level of service. </p>

    <p>  Paid at the hotel and some domestic services: extraordinary cleaning, laundry and hairdresser, dry cleaning. </p><p>  Also, therapeutic and cosmetological services are provided at separate rates: procedures of the <span>SPA center, beauty salon,</span> massage therapist, jacuzzi, and peeling. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Often five-star hotels go to holidaymakers who value a relatively passive rest.  Good service, plentiful food, interesting animation and cultural program of the hotel fully satisfy all needs.  That is why vacationers of such hotels rarely buy excursions - the hotel complex itself presents a very decent level of relaxation.  Another thing is vacationers of three- and four-star hotels.  In hotel complexes with less advanced services, people save money on the tour itself in order to purchase more excursions.  However, the list of the most interesting excursions in Turkey may turn out to be tempting for the guests of the Raymar Hotels 5 * Standard five-star hotel.  Judging by the reviews, guests of this hotel complex prefer excursions to Pamukkale, Cappadocia, the Dalmatash grotto, Ich-Kale fortress, the ancient city center of Side, Geynuk canyon, Mira Demre-Kekkova. </p>
