Tergui Club 3 * (reviews are given later in the article) is a budget hotel of the famous resort of Port El Kantaoui.  It is about him that we want to tell. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel ... </h2><p>  After Bulgaria and Turkey, Tunisia remains the most popular destination for beach and sea vacations.  Tergui Club 3 *, the reviews of which we want to discuss during the article, is located on the coast, six kilometers from the center of Port El Kantaoui.  It is eighteen kilometers from Sousse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tunisia tergui club 3 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1566124.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tourists, as a rule, do not have difficulties in order to get to Tergui Club 3 * (Tunisia).  "How to get to the hotel?"  - This is the most frequently asked by travelers, which is logical, since no one wants to get into an uncomfortable situation in a foreign country.  Anfida Ammame International New Airport is just 27 kilometers from the hotel.  And from there the tourists who paid the transfer are delivered to the hotel. </p><h2>  Tergui Club 3 *: room description </h2><p>  The hotel has 150 rooms in the main building and 75 bungalow-type apartments.  How good are the living conditions in Tergui Club 3 * (Tunisia)?  Reviews of hotel guests indicate the presence in the rooms of a balcony or terrace, furniture, telephone, air conditioning, TV, minibar and bathroom.  Cleaning is done every day, and linen is changed once a week. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The situation in the rooms, according to vacationers, is very simple with local flavor: something like clay nightstands and tables.  There is very little furniture in the apartment.  As for the placement in the rooms, there are some nuances in the Tergui Club 3 * (Tunisia).  Reviews of tourists provide an opportunity to draw some conclusions.  Bungalow apartments are much more spacious than the regular rooms of the main building.  In addition, in the evenings, entertainment evenings are held on the terrace in front of the entrance until midnight.  At the same time, the music turns on incredibly loudly, and the closed windows give absolutely no effect.  In the daytime, children run around the corridors, who are also quite thoroughly noisy.  In general, the main body has incredible audibility, which sometimes makes it very difficult to relax. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tergui club 3 tunisia reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1566130.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you dream of a more relaxing holiday, it is better to choose apartments in the bungalow, they are a little in the distance (in the garden), there is a quieter environment.  Rooms have garden or coast views.  The atmosphere in the bungalow is more than peaceful, and the apartments are more spacious. </p><p>  In some rooms, both in the case and in the bungalow, there are quite large ants.  Usually they appear in the evening.  For adults, they do not cause inconvenience, but for children, it is probably better not to contact them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In general, if you plan to organize a budget holiday for yourself in a country such as Tunisia, Tergui Club 3 * (confirmation of this) can be an acceptable option for unpretentious guests who understand that they will not receive super service in an exotic country. </p><h2>  Food in the complex </h2><p>  I would like to pay special attention to nutrition at Tergui Club Aquapark 3 * (Tunisia).  Reviews of tourists regarding food are always contradictory, no matter how high a hotel is.  And what can we say about the budget institution.  The complex offers a variety of catering options: half board, All Inclusive and even Ultra All Inclusive. </p><p>  All guests have different opinions about food.  In general, I want to note that most of the guests are satisfied with the quantity and quality of food.  It is possible that sometimes a variety of dishes is not enough at the buffet, but do not forget about the three-star status of the hotel. </p><p>  In the mornings, vacationers are usually served the standard version of a <span>continental breakfast:</span> eggs, yoghurts, omelets, fruits (melons and watermelons), delicious crumpets, sliced, etc. For dinner and lunch, quite acceptable meat dishes, snacks, salads, desserts appear on the tables.  However, the national flavor of the country should be taken into account.  Still, this is Tunisia.  But because most of the dishes are quite spicy, which is not very familiar to some of our compatriots.  But there's nothing to be done about it.  You yourself understand which country you choose to relax.  But this does not mean that European dishes do not appear on the menu at all.  They are present, just a little less than national food. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tergui club aquapark 3 tunisia reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1566131.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the morning, tea and coffee is included in the price.  But for dinner, drinks will have to be paid separately if you have not purchased a tour with All Inclusive.  Which power system to choose, it's up to you.  However, the opinions of vacationers in Tergui Club 3 * <span>(Tunisia, Sousse)</span> regarding this issue are ambiguous.  Some people think that it makes no sense to pay "all inclusive", while others, on the contrary, are supporters of All Inclusive.  In any case, if you stay on the half-board option, you will not stay hungry, because right in front of the hotel there is a wonderful restaurant with good cuisine, where you can always have lunch and dinner. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  What is the infrastructure of Tergui Club 3 * <span>(Tunisia)?</span>  <span>Where is</span> the hotel located?  After all, this is an important issue.  Tour operators very often give vacationers not entirely true information regarding the location.  The complex really belongs to the resort of Sousse, but is not located in the city center, but rather on its far outskirts.  The area is more like a quiet village away from the bustle of the city.  However, this does not interfere with the rest, since there is a bar, a restaurant, a shop with goods for tourists, a souvenir shop on the territory.  The reception service is open around the clock and offers a paid safe, as they are not available in the rooms. </p><p>  There is also an indoor and outdoor pool with slides in the territory of the Tergui Club Aquapark 3 * (Tunisia).  Guest reviews regarding their cleanliness are satisfactory, but tourists note the presence of a strong smell of bleach in the water.  Near the pool there is a relaxation area with sunbeds and umbrellas. </p><h2>  Sports and Entertainment </h2><p>  I would like to pay some attention to the organization of leisure in Tergui Club 3 * (Tunisia, Sousse).  Guest reviews are a criterion by which to judge a more real state of things.  Vacationers are not very happy with the evening animation.  The fact is that a children's disco is held earlier, but the adult show starts at ten o‚Äôclock and lasts until midnight.  At the same time, on the street in front of the main building speakers are loudly working.  Which, of course, prevents sleep for those who do not attend such events. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tergui club 3 tunisia description" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1566132.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has a hammam, sauna, jacuzzi, fitness center.  Everyone can visit these institutions.  On the ground floor of the main building there is a television lounge, a games room.  Guests of the complex can play mini-golf, table tennis, billiards, volleyball, as well as go horse riding, visit the gym, <span>tennis court.</span>  Near the hotel there is a golf club. </p><h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  Stunning coast and warm sea - this is what attracts tourists to Tunisia.  Tergui Club 3 * (reviews are given in the article) has a significant advantage over similar institutions.  The hotel is located on the beach.  From the hotel to the beach, go just a few minutes.  The complex has its own plot on the coast, which is equipped with umbrellas and sunbeds.  The hotel's beach is very clean, it is cleaned daily in the morning. </p><p>  Tourists can always do water sports on the coast.  It offers banana riding, windsurfing, surfing, parasailing, and catamarans. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Of course, many may not like the remote location of the Tergui Club Hotel from the city center.  However, there are advantages to this.  The fact is that Sousse is a very noisy and famous youth resort in the country.  An incredible number of various hotels of various levels have been built here.  But it should be understood that not a single decent hotel can be found in the city center, all of them are located closer to the outskirts and in the vicinity of Port El Kantaoui.  Here the beaches and water are much cleaner, the coast is not so crowded with vacationers, and the landscape is much more colorful.  And in the city center it‚Äôs interesting to just walk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tergui club 3 tunisia whereabouts" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1566133.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  And the number one place where this can be done is the wide promenade Buzhaafar.  It stretched along the sea and all hotels for almost two kilometers.  On one side of the promenade are trays of merchants with sweets, drinks and ice cream, and on the other side the Mediterranean Sea glistens in the sun.  No less interesting place for walking, as noted by guests of the Tergui Club, is Port El Kantaoui, whose streets are lined with lush ficuses, and numerous fish cafes and restaurants await on the marina. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Fans of shopping will certainly try to buy local souvenirs for relatives.  All the most interesting can be purchased in the large four-story Soula Center store, which is located near the entrance to the medina in the center of Sousse.  If you are staying at Tergui Club, visit this store. </p><p>  A lot of interesting things can be found in the market of the old city, however, local merchants are notable for their obsession. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  If you‚Äôre tired of staying at the hotel, visit your local thalassotherapy center.  Also, as an entertainment, guests of the Tergui Club can visit night discos, a port for pleasure boats.  Local excursion programs are quite diverse, you can order them directly from the hotel.  The city and its environs have many historical sights that you can explore on your own. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tergui club 3 tunisia how to get" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1566134.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The main attraction of Sousse is the medina, surrounded by a well-preserved fortress wall.  On its territory are towers, mosques, catacombs with old graves.  Tergui Club guests will be interested in the Ribat fortress, the Khalifa tower, the Sousse city museum, where you can see ancient statues, mosaics and masks.  The museum of archeology and the famous botanical garden Park Oasis El Kantaoui are no less interesting. </p><h2>  Children's entertainment </h2><p>  For children there is an entertainment complex with go-karts and a park of various attractions.  In addition, young guests of Tergui Club will be interested in visiting the Aqua Palace (water park) and the botanical zoo.  And for the sweet tooth, a trip to the Italian Ice Cream House will be a real holiday.  In general, while relaxing in Tergui Club, everyone can find interesting entertainment for themselves. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel ... </h2><p>  To summarize the conversation about Tergui Club 3 * (Tunisia).  Description, photos of the hotel are given by us in the article.  I would like to note that, according to tourists, the hotel makes a very good impression.  Its main advantage is, of course, its location.  Not every hotel can boast such a close proximity to the sea.  But for a seaside resort this is an important indicator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tergui club 3 tunisia photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1566136.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The complex has animation, but it is not so diverse.  Therefore, vacationers who are counting on active entertainment right at the hotel should look for a different place.  The hotel is good for those tourists who do not intend to spend all day near the pool waiting for animators.  Near the complex is a beautiful beach and warm sea, as well as public transport, from here you can drive to the center of Sousse and independently explore all its sights. </p><p>  The hotel has a representative tour operator who offers a variety of sightseeing trips.  But they are all quite expensive.  It is much cheaper to see the most interesting places on your own. </p><h2>  Staff service </h2><p>  The hotel staff deserves special attention.  At the reception there are Russian-speaking attendants.  Accommodation in rooms in different cases occurs in different ways.  As a rule, workers try not to detain tourists.  As for bonuses for the replacement of numbers, they are not always required.  The administration will gladly change non-liked apartments, if there are any available in stock.  Cleaning occurs regularly and fairly high quality.  In general, the staff is friendly and attentive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tergui club 3 tunisia souss" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1566138.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Experienced tourists in this hotel are advised to book rooms in a bungalow, there it is much quieter and calmer to relax.  In the complex you can meet tourists from different countries (Europeans, Arabs, Russians, etc.).  The hotel is good for undemanding tourists, for whom the interior decoration of rooms and a large assortment of dishes at the buffet are not so important.  If you are going to Tunisia for the sake of a sea holiday and in order to see the country, and at the same time relax and enjoy nature, then Tergui Club 3 * (Tunisia) is suitable for you.  Photos of the hotel and its apartments in the article will help to get a more complete picture of this hotel.  Spoiled tourists, accustomed to luxury apartments and the Turkish All Inclusive option, should not experiment, it is better to immediately find a more suitable place for yourself. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Tergui Club 3 * is a good and inexpensive hotel on the Mediterranean coast, offering budget holidays and decent rooms.  It fully corresponds to the ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù ratio and is a good option among institutions of this level.  Therefore, it can be recommended to tourists who do not want to pay more for additional benefits, but appreciate a convenient location. </p>
