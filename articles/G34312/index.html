    <p>  "Radio" today is a fairly familiar and common word.  In the modern world, everyone knows that radio waves are used to transmit information ‚Äúwirelessly‚Äù.  But some 100 years ago, no one could have imagined such a thing.  The story of the creation of the radio, in fact, is very interesting.  After all, historians still argue about who is his true inventor - Popov or Marconi. </p><p>  At all times, communication was the engine of the process.  As early as 1864, the existence of electromagnetic waves was theoretically predicted by J. Maxwell.  In less than 25 years, G. Herz took up the creation of such waves.  In a series of experiments, he confirmed Maxwell's theory and continued the work that his predecessor began.  The result of this was the creation of a device that was able to transmit and receive the very electromagnetic waves.  Such a receiver was insensitive and worked only at a distance of a couple of meters.  This was the beginning of progress, but for real communication, something else was needed - a more advanced, powerful transmitter.  Unfortunately, Hertz died of severe blood poisoning, but the story of the radio does not end there. </p><p>  The learned world community was interested in the experiments of Hertz.  And very soon, the path to the creation of a new sensitive receiver opened again.  Engaged in this Englishman O. Lodge and Frenchman E. Branly.  They found that a tube filled with some kind of metal powder responds well to waves.  When the first spark jumped on the transmitter, it received a specific signal and conducted a current.  But to receive the next signal, the coherer (handset) had to be shaken a little, returning it, thus, to its original position. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Russian engineer <span>A.S.</span> became interested in these experiments <span>.</span>  <span>Popov, who</span> perfectly understands the need for wireless communications.  He began his search for putting into practice the ‚ÄúHertz waves".  It was necessary to configure the device so that the coherer himself ‚Äútwitched‚Äù after each signal, being able to immediately accept the next. </p><p>  This is where the story of a Russian developer‚Äôs radio begins.  The solution found by Popov is striking in its pure simplicity.  An electric bell was connected to the handset.  When the signal of the bell hammer appeared, it hit the coherer slightly, thereby returning it to its original position.  By sound, it was possible to receive signals without problems <span>with the</span> then popular <span>Morse code.</span>  A pen was also connected to the device in order to register signals on a moving tape.  This reception of radio signals and their transmission (at a distance of 60 meters) Popov demonstrated in 1895.  So began the public history of radio.  Then he created a device that is beneficial - a lightning detector, which records lightning discharges on a tape.  Over time, the communication worked at 250 m. Things were going well, but a lot of work and time was required until the final result. </p><p>  At the same time, G. Marconi, a young Italian, was actively working on a similar project, but using different methods.  By the way, the schemes of his receivers were almost no different from the options of Popov.  Communication was also transmitted only over short distances.  But the Italian developer was more confident and wanted to find application of this system as soon as possible.  He appealed to various state bodies, but everywhere he was refused.  And only in 1897 in the UK he received a patent.  The history of the radio created by the Italian has reached Russia as well, to which Popov reacted quite adequately, believing that Marconi was the first to dare to set foot on paved practical ground and achieved excellent results in his experiments. </p><p>  After some time, the development of both Italian and Russian found their practical application.  The Marconi apparatus was used by the Prince of Wales on the Osborne yacht.  And Popov's debut was the rescue of 50 fishermen with the help of his device for wireless communication, when it was the order of the radiogram that made it possible to correct the difficult situation of the sailors. </p><p>  Both Popov and Marconi were actively working to improve wireless communications.  This made it possible to improve its quality and increase the distance between the receivers.  The story of the development of the radio does not end there, because over time it has become more practical and reliable, modified and improved. </p>
