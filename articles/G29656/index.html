Due to the fact that a huge number of smartphones have already surpassed these gadgets, manufacturers began to produce only special models.  Someone emphasized the special functionality, someone tried to bring the tablet closer to the PC, someone created an unprecedented design.  One way or another, this device can now be purchased without problems, since everyone can find their device in a certain price category and with the necessary technical characteristics. </p><p>  It so happens that an excellent model appears on the market, but a year later the manufacturer releases the older modification.  And the owners of the first device do not know whether they should change their gadget to an updated one.  It was the same with Apple.  Therefore, a comparison is made for the iPad Air 2 and iPad Air.  To adequately assess the changes that have occurred with this tablet, we will consider each separately. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad air 2 and ipad air comparison" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1616867.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  New generation </h2><p>  The introduction of the iPad Air in 2013 marked the beginning of a new generation.  It would seem that all the usual functions remained in place, but the case became "airier", and the "filling" is noticeably faster.  The new model definitely began to look better, work and attracted a lot of attention to itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Superior New Generation </h2><p>  A year later, the updated <span>Apple iPad Air 2</span> came out <span>.</span> Comparing it with the previous model seems ungrateful, because at first glance no updates are noticeable.  But if outwardly the tablets are really similar, inside, with the release of the second modification, everything has become much better. </p><h2>  External differences </h2><p>  With the release of iPad Air, changes with the previous line became noticeable.  He became more strict, but retained the style, complemented by a silver trim and a black / white frame around the screen.  In general, similarities with the iPad mini immediately became noticeable, but the main advantage of the new tablet was its size. </p><p>  Of course, not everyone needs such a large screen.  But even if we compare the dimensions of the ‚Äúair‚Äù tablet with the iPad, then the difference is enormous.  Firstly, it has become thinner, and this is noticeable.  Secondly, it has become less wide.  Thirdly, the weight has decreased by almost 150 grams.  And even if these numbers do not seem radically different for everyone, in life they are very noticeable. </p><p>  But if you compare the iPad Air and iPad Air 2, then, as mentioned earlier, the changes are not particularly noticeable.  The fact is that the main transformation concerns only weight and thickness.  At the time of release, the brand new iPad Air 2 became thinner by 1.4 mm, now the size of the side end is only 6.1 mm, which looks very attractive.  Well, the weight also became less - 437 grams.  There is even an opinion that a change in the mass of the tablet affected the comfort of use, now the back and arms are much less tired. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad air vs ipad air 2 comparison" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1616886.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Color differences and details </h2><p>  Continuing the comparison between iPad Air and iPad Air 2, you need to pay attention to a few more external details.  The first model of the new generation was delivered in two color variations: silver and dark gray.  The new version also got a newfangled golden to the two familiar colors.  Of course, increasing the choice of body shade is only a positive marketing move.  By the way, many owners of gold iPhones with pleasure bought a tone and tablet from the "apple" manufacturer. </p><p>  In appearance, the display orientation lock button has also changed.  Now she‚Äôs not at all, most likely she disappeared to please the thickness of the case.  Now in its place is a small microphone hole.  The ‚ÄúHome‚Äù key has not changed externally, but received an additional Touch ID, which, by the way, is needed in ‚Äúapple‚Äù devices not only for unlocking, but also for the shopping card in the game store. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  In iPad Air 2 and iPad Air, it would seem that it is not necessary to compare the screen, since external signs are invisible.  The diagonal is 9.7 inches, the resolution is 2048x1536 pixels.  But now the second gadget received a special touch display, which was developed in conjunction with lamination technology.  The manufacturer has ensured that the layer between the glass and the matrix has disappeared.  This is what helped make the device thin. </p><p>  Also, this technology has led to a kind of illusion that the image seems to soar above the tablet.  The second version received anti-reflective coating, which improves the visual effect even in the brightest light. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Technical equipment </h2><p>  <span>Comparison of the iPad</span> mini 2 - iPad Air in performance, in principle, will do nothing.  In both models, the processor is A7 on two cores with a frequency of 1300 MHz.  For graphics meets PowerVR version G6430.  RAM is 1 GB, the internal can be from 16 GB to 128 GB.  We can safely say that the technical equipment is the same gadgets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad air 2 and ipad pro comparison" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1616870.jpg"></div>

    <p>  But things are a little better with the iPad Air 2.  Here, the default is the eighth version OS.  The improved processor is A8X, which runs on two cores with a frequency of 1.5 GHz.  PowerVR also got a head taller - it's the GXA6850 - and runs on eight cores.  There is also more RAM - 2GB.  The built-in choice can be from 16 GB to 128 GB. </p><p>  If we take a comparison of the iPad 4 and iPad Air 2, then the new model is significantly superior to the fourth generation.  The iPad 4 runs a slightly weaker processor - the A6X with a frequency of 1.4 GHz.  The younger GPU is the PowerVR SGX 554MP4.  RAM, like iPad Air, is only 1 GB.  By the way, the tablet does not support 128 GB memory cards. </p><h2>  Giant </h2><p>  You can also recall another model with which you can make another pair - these are the iPad Air 2 and iPad Pro.  Comparison of these tablets, though not entirely justified, but still they are "brothers" in the shop, and therefore can be opposed to each other. </p><p>  The first and obvious difference is appearance.  iPad Pro has a screen diagonal of 12.9 inches, which is almost comparable to some "apple" laptops.  This giant also works on iOS 9.x.  The processor here has become a generation higher.  The A9x is paired with the M9 at a frequency of 2.2 GHz.  RAM in the pro version is already 4 GB, which is now very valuable.  But all these improved qualities significantly increase the price tag. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad mini 2 ipad air comparison" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1616864.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Returning to the iPad Air 2 and iPad Air, the comparison is worth continuing, paying attention to the camera.  It has changed significantly from a relatively older model.  In the second version of the tablet, the main one received 8 megapixels, while the first modification had only 5 megapixels.  Also, the new camera was equipped with special technology with a sensor and improved optics, which significantly affected the quality of images. </p><p>  There are also new features like Slow Motion.  Now you can‚Äôt surprise anyone with slow motion, but then it was a great addition to the new lens.  As a result, all the innovations made the photos high-quality, with improved color reproduction, detail, etc. </p><p>  The front camera also added a little - instead of 0.3 megapixels, it received 1.2 megapixels.  Of course, this option is not entirely good, especially for 2017. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Not very dramatic changes have occurred with this characteristic.  Any generation iPad has an excellent sound speaker.  But the iPad Air 2 has become noticeably louder, now it's easy to watch movies and listen to music together.  Outwardly, the dynamics have changed in two models.  The iPad Air had two speakers in two rows of holes, now, for the sake of a slim body, two stereo speaker grilles were made on either side of the charger connector. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad 4 vs ipad air 2 comparison" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1616868.jpg"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The battery size has also changed.  Again, because of the desire to make the case thinner, the battery of the second model received 7184 mAh.  While the first model has 8827 mAh.  As a result, continuous searches on the Internet, watching videos and listening to audio discharges the iPad Air in 12-13 hours, and the iPad Air 2 in 10 hours. </p><p>  Although such changes were not positive, still Apple is almost the only one who managed to fit such a powerful battery into a thin case.  In addition, the compromise between autonomy and the weight of the gadget from the manufacturer turned out to be successful. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Of course, now for iPad Air 2 and iPad Air comparison is not relevant, since both models have been on the market for more than two to three years.  Nevertheless, there are still those who doubt the choice between these two tablets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apple ipad air 2 comparison" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1616869.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Then you should consider two situations: if you are the owner of the iPad Air, or if you just decided to purchase an Apple gadget.  Immediately consider the second option.  If you just decided to purchase an ‚Äúapple‚Äù tablet and choose between these models, then in the iPad Air vs iPad Air 2 battle the comparison is superfluous, in any case, the newer device becomes the winner. </p><p>  The explanation is simple: whatever one may say, but the iPad Air 2 is much better than its predecessor.  It is thinner, prettier, inside it has an updated processor and a new version of the graphics adapter.  He got more RAM, as well as an improved camera.  In general, he overtakes his older model in everything. </p><p>  But if you are the owner of iPad Air, then buying the second version may be pointless.  Of course, albeit noticeable changes, nevertheless they are almost identical models.  It makes sense to look at newer devices.  After all, after the release of iPad Air 2, the iPad Pro already appeared on the market, which we already talked about, as well as the compact iPad mini 4. And in 2016, they introduced a variation of the iPad Pro, but with a slightly smaller screen of 9.7 inches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipad air vs ipad air 2 comparison" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1616863.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  By the way, it is the latest model that is now considered the most popular.  It turned out to be slightly different than the previous ones, not only in technical characteristics, but also externally.  In addition, this tablet received excellent technical specifications, support for corporate stylus and Split View mode. </p>
