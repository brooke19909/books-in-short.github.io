  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Christiania in Copenhagen: address, reviews and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Christiania in Copenhagen is the district in the city where a community of hippie followers currently resides.  They do not accept most of the rules of the modern state and live by their own laws.  This unusual place, the history of its appearance and interesting facts will be described in this article. </p><h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  Christiania in Copenhagen, the official name of which is the ‚ÄúFree City of Christiania‚Äù, appeared on September 26, 1971.  Several dozen people arbitrarily occupied the territory of abandoned barracks.  Gradually, the commune began to grow, and local authorities did not know how to react to what was happening.  Their indecision was associated with the upcoming parliamentary elections.  In order not to lose the potential electorate, the ruling party de facto recognized Christiania, but calling these events a social experiment. </p><p>  Everything that happened found great support in society, an important role in this was played by an article in an anarchist newspaper, telling about the significant advantages of developing society in an alternative social environment. </p><p>  The name "Christiania in Copenhagen" in the first place can cause an association with Christianity.  However, the name of the new city has nothing to do with religion; it is named after the Danish king Christian, so it is more correct to call this settlement Christiania. </p><h2>  Continuation of a story </h2><p>  At first, the emergence of the Christiania district in Copenhagen was not seriously worried by local authorities.  However, after some time it became clear that the emerging commune was able to exert a significant ideological and cultural influence on a large number of people.  The main ideological danger to the authorities was that the main principles of the Christians were based on the rejection of everything bourgeois. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="deanemengaziol.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Unusual homes in Christiania" class="if uuid-2585644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2585644.jpg"></div><p>  However, an attempt was made by the city government to expel the invaders from the territory of the former barracks.  But unexpectedly for the police, the inhabitants of Christiania gave a real rebuff.  In response to police using batons and tear gas, protesters used Molotov cocktails and iron reinforcement. </p><p>  There was a big uproar, the authorities were at a loss, not knowing what to do next.  The Queen of Denmark advised her not to touch the protesters and leave them alone.  Local authorities listened to the advice of their queen, and the inhabitants of Christiania in Copenhagen continued their lives, following their ways and laws. </p><h2>  The rise of Christiania </h2><p>  Subsequently, the history of Christiania began to develop like any other state.  It is believed that Christiania is a city in a city, but this is not so at all.  In fact, this is an enclave, that is, a state in a state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thetraveloguer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Skate park" class="if uuid-2585645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2585645.jpg"></div><p>  After an ideological and fierce armed struggle for their independence from the Danish authorities, their laws and regulations developed here over time.  Its own economy, currency, and ideology have changed a bit.  This kind of experiment has been going on for 40 years, and in this connection it cannot be called a failure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It should be noted that the very existence of Christiania became possible not only because of the ideology, cohesion and steadfastness of its defenders.  A significant role was played by the location of the area, which is protected by large ramparts and high walls, which added to the difficulty of assaulting the police. </p><h2>  The laws of Christiania </h2><p>  In Christiania, there are several categorical prohibitions, such as: </p><ul><li>  Complete prohibition of movement on cars. </li><li>  An absolute ban on any firearms and melee weapons. </li><li>  It is forbidden to wear body armor. </li><li>  Prohibition of the circulation of potent drugs. </li><li>  There are restrictions on photo and video shooting (you can not shoot everywhere and not all). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="karma-kas.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Touristic poster" class="if uuid-2585661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2585661.jpg"></div><p>  All those who first came to Christiania are encouraged to be friendly and friendly, and be sure to follow all the rules.  So that guests do not forget about local laws, there are quite often stands with rules. </p><p>  An interesting fact: despite the fact that heavy drug trafficking is prohibited here (at one time because of this, a real civil war broke out here), you can get marijuana in Christiania. </p><h2>  Description of Christiania </h2><p>  In the photo of Christiania in Copenhagen you can see all the unusualness, even the confusion of these places.  Some compare the local architecture with an abandoned amusement park.  Various container buildings, old barracks, warehouses and similar buildings are painted with graffiti.  The brightness and variety of colors sometimes hurts the eye, and sometimes the drawings themselves amaze with their workmanship. </p><div class="photo" data-original="traveladdicts.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bright graffiti" class="if uuid-2585648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2585648.jpg"></div><p>  Here they move on foot or by bicycle, other transport is prohibited.  Here, to put it mildly, they are not very loyal to the police, if they appear, they can hear a lot of unflattering words, and sometimes insults.  The main street of Christiania is Pusher, it is customary to make appointments and take a walk, and it is also here that marijuana is traded. </p><p>  There are a lot of children, adolescents, as well as a large number of dogs.  In Christiania you can find not only long-haired hippies and carefree rastamans, but also people in formal suits.  Some of the locals are office workers in Copenhagen, leaving for work in the city in the morning and returning here in the evening.  This is taken quite calmly, because the main thing for local people is not where you work, but who you are in spirit. </p><h2>  Christiania in Copenhagen: how to get there? </h2><p>  Getting to Christiania from Copenhagen Central Station will not work.  However, you can catch bus 9A and take it to the final stop - Bodenhoffs Square.  And then go along Refshalevej street until Christiania itself.  You can also get a taxi, it will take you from the Central Station building in about 15 minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.urbangardensweb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The boundaries of Christiania" class="if uuid-2585660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2585660.jpg"></div><p>  In Denmark, as, for example, in Holland, bicycles are very popular.  Here they can be rented for little money (from two euros for three hours, up to five euros for the whole day).  If you decide to use the bike rental services and take a walk to Christiania, you will need to make your way from the station, since it is the shortest. </p><p>  It is worth noting that bicycles in Copenhagen are equipped with navigators for the convenience of local residents and tourists.  This makes walking around the city very comfortable, and there is no need to look for anything.  It is enough to enter the Christiania address in Copenhagen: the intersection of B√•dsmandsstr√¶de and Prinsessegade.  This is the place where Christiania originates.  Then the technician will lay a route, which remains only to follow. </p><h2>  Opinion of tourists </h2><p>  The reviews of Christiania in Copenhagen are rather mixed.  Some tourists who have visited this city and visited Christiania speak not only of the great visual difference, but also of the difference between the people themselves.  Residents of Christiania are more open and friendly than those who live in the capital itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dispatcheseurope.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shooting restriction" class="if uuid-2585657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2585657.jpg"></div><p>  Danish guests who visited Copenhagen and then Christiania note that Christiania, to put it mildly, does not fit into the architecture and culture of the capital, being a marginal place. </p><p>  People traveling around the capital and studying all the ancient sights, say that Christiania, in addition to its architectural color, impressed them with people, their attitude to the world, their kindness and openness. </p><p>  We can say that how many people, so many opinions.  To answer the question - what is Christiania, you need to see her, only after being there, it will be possible to form an opinion.  But it is worth agreeing that this is a unique place, the kind of which on earth no longer exists. </p>
