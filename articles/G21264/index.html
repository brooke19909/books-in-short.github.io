    <h2>  How it all began </h2><p>  Svetlana did not immediately come to <span>embroidery with ribbons</span> .  She always loved to create something with her own hands, however, she took up embroidery just a little over ten years ago. </p><p>  It all started after the birth of a daughter.  Then Svetlana Gerasimova first tried her hand at embroidery.  First, there was a cross in the technique, then went to a more complex embroidery - stitch.  And only after the birth of the second child, the future craftswoman began to create works from tapes.  In this type of needlework, skills acquired earlier in simpler techniques were useful to her. </p><p>  The many years of collecting information on creating paintings with ribbons, studying the experience of famous embroiderers and practice led to the emergence of a new craftswoman - Svetlana Gerasimova.  <span>Embroidery with ribbons</span> became for her a part of life, which brought not only the joy of creativity, but also fame and her favorite thing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Subtleties of craftsmanship </h2><p>  In her works, the needlewoman very accurately depicts flowers and birds.  They look like they are alive.  The craftswoman herself said that in the image of birds it is very important that the direction of the stitches correspond to the direction of growth of the feathers, then the bird will look natural. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Svetlana Gerasimova embroidery ribbons" class="if" height="459" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45924/1556636.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Some works not only cause admiration, but also convey the mood, for example, a drake flying in the rays of the setting sun over a forest river.  According to Svetlana Gerasimova, embroidery with ribbons differs from other types due to its bulk and 3D effect.  However, this effect alone is not able to create a special mood for the picture.  First of all, this is the talent of the master, which is manifested in every stitch. </p><p>  The basis for Svetlana's work is a canvas with an image.  She herself prints the desired picture, and then embroiders it with ribbons.  The work uses different types of stitches.  In the images of birds one feels good mastery of the technique of embroidering stitch.  In some works, Svetlana uses toning tapes with paints (for example, when embroidering flowers). </p><h2>  Needlewoman school </h2><p>  Svetlana Gerasimova <strong> </strong>  teaches everyone to embroider ribbons.  Despite the fact that she herself lives in Pskov, the craftswoman conducts online master classes.  Courses vary in complexity and learning objectives.  The needlewoman shares her knowledge, which she independently sought for years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mk Svetlana Gerasimova" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45924/1556717.jpg" width="600"></div>

These flowers are beautiful in themselves, and performed by a talented master look delightful.  Roses Svetlana Gerasimova can be purchased from her in the form of finished work, or you can take a training master class and learn how to do them yourself.  These are not the easiest flowers to perform.  Specialized MK, dedicated to the methods of their manufacture, includes: </p><ol><li>  Different ways of embroidering roses. </li><li>  The nuances of making petals. </li><li>  Useful tips. </li><li>  Practical exercises on embroidery of buds and roses from different angles. </li><li>  Training in tinting flowers. </li></ol><p>  MK Svetlana Gerasimova helped many people to master the art of embroidering roses with ribbons and improve their skills in this type of needlework.  In addition to studying online, you can purchase a video of the course and take it at a convenient time. </p><p>  There are courses for those who are just starting to embroider ribbons, they include the basics of this type of needlework, the rules for stitch embroidery, and instructions for creating a simple small picture. </p><h2>  Life on canvas </h2><p>  In her works, Svetlana Gerasimova <strong> </strong>  It conveys not only color and volume, but also the texture of the depicted flower.  Dandelions look airy, spikelets - hard, and peonies - tender.  Thanks to such naturalism, the work looks alive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Roses Svetlana Gerasimova" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45924/1556737.jpg" width="600"></div>  Svetlana's paintings not only depict an exact copy of a flower or bird, they cause a desire to smell the poppy, touch a dandelion, stroke the feathers of an owl.  It is pleasant to consider them both as a work of art, and as an example of mastery.  Especially warm feelings arise when watching her sunny summer work, when outside the window is winter and snowdrifts.  A small piece of summer in Svetlana‚Äôs paintings makes the house warmer and more comfortable.
