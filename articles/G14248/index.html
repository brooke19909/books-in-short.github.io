At all the distance stretches the sand-shell coast, and almost parallel to it is a dirt road.

A highway leads to it.  You can get to Golubitskaya by bus or taxi, either from Temryuk, or from Anapa, as well as from Gelendzhik or Krasnodar.

    <ol><li>  <span>Valley of lotuses.</span>  It is located very close to the village in the Akhtanizovsky estuary.  It is really beautiful there.  Individual flower specimens grow up to half a meter in diameter.  A trip here is a sacred affair of every vacationer in Golubitskaya. </li><li>  <span>Tizdar Volcano</span> and its healing mud.  The entrance there is paid, they don’t give dirt to collect in jars and take them out of the territory.  Nearby are an ostrich farm, a tasting bar and showers. </li><li>  Mount Rotten with the volcano Hephaestus (also mud), and at the same time the city of Temryuk, because this is its territory. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea of ​​Azov vacation Golubitskaya" class="if" height="208" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/455770.jpg" width="310"></div></li><li>  Safari park in Gelendzhik, with a working cableway and a wonderful maritime museum. </li><li>  Rufabgo Waterfalls (there are 16 of them and all are unique).

The Sea of ​​Azov gives this area a specific healing air and a little heat in the winter.  The thermometer column here rarely drops below zero.  But in the summer it’s hot in Golubitskaya.  Basically, the temperature during the day in the shade reaches +30 degrees and above.  Precipitation also sometimes occurs, but in summer it is very rare.  Therefore, it is dusty on the roads.  The proximity of the estuary and the location of the resort area in the lowland (relative to the rest of the village) provide the army of mosquitoes.  And where are they not? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Golubitskaya Sea of ​​Azov water temperature" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/455775.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Everyone who came to Golubitskaya dreams of the sea.  It is rather shallow here, and more or less adult depth begins about a hundred meters from the coast.  This is ideal for vacationers with kids, because in shallow water there is practically no danger, because the water there barely reaches the knee.  The second feature, due to which Golubitskaya is suitable for parents with children, is the Sea of ​​Azov, the water temperature in which is always slightly higher than in the Black Sea, in shallow water it warms up to +27 ... + 30 ° C in July and +20 ° C in May.  So it’s very difficult to catch a cold here.  But in terms of transparency, the water on the beaches of the village leaves much to be desired.  But the sea is almost always calm, if there are waves, then they are small.  True, when the north-east begins to blow, and especially the north, they rise to 2 meters, enthralling surfers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews Sea of ​​Azov Golubitskaya" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/455768.jpg" width="310"></div>

    <h2>  Accommodation </h2><p>  According to reviews, the Sea of ​​Azov, Golubitskaya - one of its resorts, in particular - is not liked by everyone.  Someone mosquitoes bit, someone prices.  Someone missed the whole vacation on the beach, someone fought for their rights with the owner of the rented shack.  Of course, subjectivity plays a big role here, but there is some truth in such reviews.  In order for the vacation to go without negativity, you must first of all successfully choose a place to live.  In Golubitskaya there are many <span>recreation centers, boarding houses,</span> guest houses.  One of them provides converted cabins with amenities on site and non-working air conditioning.  In others, you can rent excellent rooms of various sizes with a bath, toilet and a set of necessary equipment.  Of course, prices will differ in the same way as the services provided.  A minimum at the height of the season 350-500 rubles per tourist per night, a maximum of 1500-2000 thousand.  The second sore point is the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. </p><h2>  Places where guests are welcome </h2><p>  Despite the negative reviews, there are many excellent recreation centers in Golubitskaya.  Good reputation at the Happy 25 guesthouse.  The rooms here are spacious, with air conditioning, and two meals a day are included in the price.  The boarding house chip is the drawing of a “happy” dumpling, the owner of which receives a prize.  And every 25th guest also has a free weekly rest next year.  I like vacationers and guest house "Svetlana".  There are rooms "standard" and "luxury" with a toilet.  All rooms have air conditioning, refrigerators, televisions, showers and dishes (you need to cook yourself). </p>

    <p>  A wonderful rest is provided by the private mini-base "Alena", where caring owners equipped a playground for children.  In the village, the opening of guest houses is a family business, so the vast majority of their owners try to please their guests so that they remember the Golubitskaya, Sea of ​​Azov from the best side.  Such hosts always post photos of rooms, a catalog of services and prices on the corresponding resources, so that later the guests have no questions. </p><h2>  Sea of ​​Azov, Golubitskaya, private sector </h2><p>  The greatest amount of negative about the rest in the village is generated by private traders who rent shacks in their yard for the purpose of making money on simple-resting people.  What can I say?  Everywhere there are plenty of dodgers and unscrupulous people.  Such unfortunate owners believe that the northerners who came from far away will also be delighted with the barn with a cot, if only the sea was near.  But nevertheless, in Golubitskaya, most private owners try to please their guests, provide them with everything necessary, do not bother, do not require saving every drop of water and every kilowatt of electricity.  As a rule, such people have regular customers who come to them to rest every year. </p>
