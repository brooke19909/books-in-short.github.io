    <p>  Refund of tax deduction from the purchase of an apartment can be received by any citizen of our country once.  This right is secured by <span>220 articles of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation.</span>  But you need to keep in mind several conditions. </p><p>  The maximum possible amount with which you can return 13 percent of the purchase of an apartment is 2,000,000 rubles.  That is, you can get back only a maximum of 260 thousand.  This can be done in a three-year period from the date of purchase of the apartment. </p><p>  At the time of filing an application with the territorial tax authority, the owner must have official employment.  It is important that all necessary deductions are made from his salary.  The amount of <span>tax deduction</span> directly depends on the size of official income. </p><p>  An unemployed or employed informally is not entitled to a return of 13%.  Pensioners and those on maternity leave are deprived of this right.  But if the owner officially gets a job within a three-year period from the date of the transaction, a return of 13 percent on the purchase of an apartment is possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The contract for the sale of the property must be registered through Rosreestr.  It is necessary to have a certificate from the registration chamber of ownership. </p><h2>  Required documents </h2>

    <h2>  Tax refund on the sale of an apartment </h2><p>  In order to buy new real estate, often people are faced with the fact that you need to sell the old housing.  There are also some nuances here. </p><p>  If the apartment has been owned for more than 3 years, no income tax will be charged on the sale. </p><p>  If the property is owned less than 3 years, then the seller loses 13%.  But large losses can be avoided in three ways: </p><ul><li>  sell the apartment at the same price for which it was purchased; </li><li>  pay 13% of the total cost, while 1,000,000 will not be taxed; </li><li>  sell housing and buy new, that is, take advantage of netting. </li></ul><p>  In real estate practice, there are frequent cases when the real value of the property is greatly underestimated so that the former owners are exempt from paying property tax.  Such actions are illegal, but from a legal point of view everything is drawn up correctly. </p><h2>  What else is important to know? </h2><p>  As a rule, when collecting all the necessary documents, the tax office has no reason to refuse to return 13 percent of the purchase of an apartment.  A refusal is possible if the property was purchased with the money of the enterprise or from the state or local budget.  Also, if an apartment is bought between relatives, a 13 percent return is not possible. </p>

    <p>  Each citizen can receive a deduction only once in a lifetime.  At the same time, it is very important to consider who the property is being drawn up for.  So, if the owner is one member of the family, then the deduction is returned only to him.  If there are several, then the deduction will be made in proportion to the ownership shares.  In this case, the right to file a tax return is repeatedly lost by all owners. </p><p>  A law has recently entered into force, according to which a return is possible from 2,000,000 even when several real estate properties were bought. </p><p>  When buying a home, you should register it as soon as possible with the territorial office of the Federal Tax Service.  How can I return 13 percent of the purchase of an apartment?  This is pretty easy to do.  To do this, transfer the required documents to the department of the Federal Tax Service.  It is worth remembering that the tax deduction is refunded in proportion to the income tax owner transferred from the salary of the owner.  The refund procedure may take several years until the full amount due is paid.  The maximum amount that a citizen can apply for when <span>returning income tax</span> is 260,000 rubles. </p>
