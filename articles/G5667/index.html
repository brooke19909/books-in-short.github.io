Reviews and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  St. Petersburg is one of the most beautiful cities in the world.  A huge number of architectural monuments are concentrated on its territory.  And mainly in the center of the city.  After all, the whole life of Peter is concentrated here!  And therefore it is not surprising that it is in the heart of the Northern capital, among <span>ancient castles</span> and drawbridges across the Neva, that the most original karaoke restaurant is located with a beautiful panoramic view of the city center - “To Dawn”. </p><p>  This is the best <span>restaurant in St. Petersburg:</span> its original premise (in the form of a three-deck ship) is impressive;  the interior is inspiring;  service - 100%;  and the dishes served are delicious and beautiful in their unique design! </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Restaurant "Before Dawn" (St. Petersburg) is atypical in terms of the premises it occupies, because it is located on a ship.  These are 3 tiers of magnificent bright space, supplemented by views of the Neva, ancient drawbridges across the river, Strelka of Vasilyevsky Island. </p>

    <p>  And what is really interesting, every visitor to the establishment from time to time, being in a restaurant, feels himself “floating on the water” - both literally and figuratively: since small currents periodically rock the ship;  and looking through the windows, you observe a smooth flow of one era of the city’s life into another. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But all this only gives an additional twist to the best restaurant of St. Petersburg - "To Dawn"! </p>
