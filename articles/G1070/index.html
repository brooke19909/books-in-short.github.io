    <p>  <strong>Biography</strong> </p><p>  In 1954, the future maniac Chikatilo graduated from high school and entered the Akhtyrsk school of communications.  After a successful graduation, he continued his studies at the Moscow Electromechanical Institute.  In 1957 he was taken into the army in the troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  According to Chikatilo, there he was regularly subjected to humiliation and violence, including of a sexual nature.  In 1964, he married and entered the Rostov Institute to study at the Faculty of Philology.  In 1970, Chikatilo graduated from the Pedagogical Institute in absentia and got a job as a teacher of the Russian language.  In 1972, he was beaten by his own pupils for attempting to rape a sleeping student.  In 1978, he moved to the city of Mines and began working at GPTU-33.  In December of the same year, the maniac Chikatilo first committed the murder. </p>

    <p>  The first victim was Elena Zakotnova, 9 years old.  She was raped and brutally murdered.  Chikatilo inflicted 3 <span>stab wounds to her</span> and threw her near the bridge over the Grushovka River.  The crime shocked the whole city.  All forces were thrown into the search for the killer.  As a result, Andrei Kravchenko, previously convicted of rape, was detained.  Under pressure, he confessed to the murder and was sentenced to 15 years.  However, after numerous demands from relatives of the girls, the punishment was changed, and Kravchenko was sentenced to death. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Chikatilo is a maniac (the photo of the young man did not betray terrible inclinations in him), who was very frightened by the noise that rose around his first victim.  Over the next three years, he did not kill.  And resumed its activities in 1981.  On September 3, he killed a 17-year-old girl.  In 1982, he committed seven murders.  All of his victims were children from 9 to 16 years old.  Up to 60 stab wounds were found on the victims.  The maniac cut off various parts of his body and gouged out his eyes. </p>

    <p>  In 1984, the maniac Chikatilo got a new job, where he got the opportunity to regularly travel on business trips.  This year he killed 15 people.  In total, the number of his victims increased to 32. It is quite possible that this would have ended his criminal career if it had not been for an accident.  On September 14 of that year, he was detained for suspicious behavior.  During a search with him were discovered: rope, knife and petroleum jelly.  The blood taken for analysis did not coincide with the one found on the victims.  Subsequently, this was explained by the negligence of the expert.  Chikatilo was released.  Frightened by the consequences, he moved with his family to Novocherkassk.  After that, they committed another 21 murders. </p><p>  Maniac Chikatilo (photos of the victims of this man are melancholy and horrified) committed his last murder in 1990, November 6.  After a long observation of him and a comparison of some facts, police officers detained Chikatilo.  Only after a conversation with a psychiatrist did he begin to testify.  The court sentenced the maniac to the death penalty, which took place on February 14, 1994. </p>
