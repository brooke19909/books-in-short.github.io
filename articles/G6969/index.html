    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Tourists have long been fond of the <span>Neva resort (</span> 3 * <span>boarding house</span> , Sochi).  Reviews about this institution, for the most part, are positive and contain the following information: </p><ul><li>  the windows of the rooms offer simply incredibly beautiful views (especially for the upper floors); </li><li>  to get to the sea you need to go by cable car - this is very interesting, but everything around is very picturesque; </li><li>  the territory is very large and all in green - there is where to walk; </li><li>  the guesthouse has its own beach, open only to guests; </li><li>  the pool is very clean and large - there is enough space for everyone; </li><li>  the staff is quite friendly and performs their duties well; </li><li>  a lot of opportunities for sports fans and adherents of a healthy lifestyle; </li><li>  location relative to the sea and infrastructure facilities is quite convenient. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  There are a number of negative aspects that characterize the Neva boarding house (Sochi).  Negative reviews are as follows: </p><ul><li>  the elevator is very slow - it is much faster to go down from the upper floors; </li><li>  entertainment in the boarding house is practically absent; </li><li>  the building of the boarding house is very old, and the repair in it was made very superficial; </li><li>  due to the fact that there is a busy highway next to the boarding house, car noise will be heard in the rooms; </li><li>  standard rooms have very old and uncomfortable box-spring beds; </li><li>  for breakfast, burnt porridge is served in the dining room; </li><li>  foreign tourists are not properly registered in the boarding house, which is fraught with a fine for the guests themselves; </li><li>  guests who do not use health services do not have coffee for breakfast; </li><li>  hot water reaches only the fifth floor; </li><li>  the musty smell in the rooms. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  At first glance, this guesthouse may seem like just a paradise for a vacation.  A high-rise building with beautiful views, a huge green area, as well as a medical center - what else is needed for a good pastime.  Nevertheless, getting inside, you will be a little disappointed, because the boarding house is incredibly old, and you have not seen a major overhaul, probably from Soviet times.  And under the "cosmetics" all the scuffs are very clearly visible. </p><p>  Inconsistency in the cost and quality of the services provided is characterized by the boarding house "Neva" (Sochi).  Accommodation prices start at 3,000 rubles for a single occupancy in a standard room.  And in the "hot" season it will cost you even more.  At the same time, the repairs and furniture in the rooms are very old, often there is no hot water, and the food in the dining room is just awful.  In addition, as if in retaliation, for guests who do not want to undergo and, accordingly, pay for treatment, some services are not available. </p><p>  Nevertheless, this pension is quite conveniently located relative to the sea, as well as infrastructure facilities.  In addition, it is located in an incredibly beautiful park area, which allows you to close your eyes to many shortcomings. </p>
