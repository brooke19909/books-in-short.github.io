    <h2>  What is it? </h2><p>  But before you activate the “Who called” service, let's try to figure out what we’ll be dealing with.  It often happens that our phone is out of range of the network.  Or the battery runs out.  And at this time they begin to call you, and it is important to know who exactly.  And at such moments, the service “Who called” (Megaphone) comes to the rescue. </p><p>  The thing is that with this feature, you receive SMS messages about callers immediately after the appearance of your phone in the network coverage area.  So you can not be afraid to miss important calls from people.  Call back when you can.  The message will contain the number of the subscriber, as well as the time of the call.  If it was repeated, then this will also be reported.  Here is such a convenient thing.  But let’s try to connect with you to this opportunity.  Changing the service “Who called” (Megaphone), connecting and disconnecting it can be done literally in two accounts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Surprises for customers </h2><p>  But before you start using it is worth discussing another very important point.  Which one?  Let's try to deal with you in this matter. </p>

    <p>  The thing is that very often customers are interested in: “The service“ Who called ”(Megaphone) is paid or not?”.  And it was very difficult to answer here just a few years ago.  Why?  Yes, all due to the fact that this opportunity has become paid.  And precisely because of this, many customers are beginning to think more and more often how to turn off the “Who called” service on the Megaphone.  Not so in most cases it is important to know which subscriber and when tried to talk with you.  Quite often, it is enough to simply ask in person whether friends / colleagues / relatives tried to call you. </p><p>  In addition, if you thought about the question: “Who called (Megafon) service is paid or not?”, Then you can prepare for another “surprise” of the operator.  Which one?  Even connecting a new feature is paid.  More precisely, we are talking about re-action.  If you have never used the “Who called” service on your SIM card before, then the connection will cost you 0 rubles.  But in case of refusal and repeated resumption of using this opportunity, you will have to pay.  A small amount, but still.  50 rubles - and again you can safely receive alerts about attempts to reach you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to the fact that you will be charged a daily <span>subscription fee</span> for the connected opportunity at Megafon.  Changes in the cost of the “Who called” service may vary.  At the moment, in St. Petersburg you will have to give 1 ruble, and in all other regions - only 70 kopecks per day.  Not very nice, but if you can not do without this opportunity, you have to agree. </p><p>  Here is such a strange service “Who called” (Megaphone).  Now we are going to connect directly with you. </p><h2>  Team call </h2><p>  So, let's start with you by trying to use the so-called USSD command.  It is she who will help you activate this feature.  The use of USSD commands is generally very popular.  The main feature of our method is ease of use. </p>

    <p>  If you suddenly needed the “Who called” service (Megaphone), then dial * 105 * 2401 # on the phone, and then simply press the dial key.  After that, wait until you receive a notification about the successful start of using the new feature.  That's all the problems are solved. </p><h2>  SMS message </h2><p>  Now we move on to the second option.  In fact, everything is much simpler than it might seem at first glance.  The fact is that if you need to connect this feature, you can always send an SMS request to the Megafon help center.  And after processing it, you will get access to the caller notification. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Type in the message “2401”, and then send it to the short number 000105. After that, you can wait for a notification about the successful connection of a new feature.  That's all the problems are solved.  As you can see, nothing is difficult or supernatural. </p><p>  In Megafon, the change in the cost of the Who called service is also carried out as an SMS alert to subscribers.  So do not be surprised if new lines are assigned to the standard text.  Well, we continue to consider all possible scenarios when trying to connect the “Who called” service to your mobile phone.  In general, there are at least 2 more ways that will definitely help us. </p>

    <h2>  Calls </h2><p>  Well, we are moving with you to more interesting and simple approaches that can only be implemented.  The thing is that there is also such an option in which the client must call the operator on a special number and inform about his intentions.  This method is quite popular among everyone else.  And in case of questions, you can always solve them, "without departing from the cash register."  In addition, you can change the service “Who called” (Megaphone).  For example, change the tariff of your SIM card to one that will be the most suitable and profitable way to implement alerts about callers to you. </p><p>  In order to use the call to connect, just dial 01053, and then wait for an answer.  There are two possible scenarios.  The first is a conversation with a real operator.  In this case, you simply inform that you are interested in the “Who called” service (Megaphone), and then ask to connect it to your phone.  You are waiting for alerts - and all problems are resolved. </p><p>  But the most frequent and least enjoyable and convenient is the option in which you will need to chat with an answering machine.  Such a dialogue takes about 10 minutes.  And only after a long “communication” you can receive an SMS alert about a successful connection.  As you can see, this is not a very good method.  When exactly the robot voice will answer you, and when - a living person, no one knows for sure.  Once at a time is not necessary. </p>

    <h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  Just a little more, and we will learn with you how to disable the “Who called” service on the Megaphone.  In the meantime, m will try to figure out the latest option to connect this feature.  Namely, through a personal account on the official website. </p><p>  All that is required of you is to go through authorization on the page of your mobile operator, and then go to the "Services" section.  There you will have to find “Who called”, and then click on this line.  Now you will see a list of possible actions.  Click “Connect” and all problems will be resolved.  You are waiting for alerts and rejoice at the results achieved.  Well, we’ll try to find out how the “Who called” service is disconnected (Megaphone). </p><h2>  Refuse through request </h2><p>  As already mentioned, USSD requests are especially popular among their customers.  And that is why disabling any service should begin with this method.  In order to refuse the “Who called” function on the Megaphone, just dial * 105 * 24 # on the mobile and then press the call button. </p><p>  Wait for a while - you will be informed about the successful processing of the request, after which you will receive a notification that the service is disabled.  You can enjoy your achievement.  As you can see, nothing is difficult.  But there is another rather interesting approach to solving this problem. </p>

    <h2>  Help messages </h2><p>  It's about using the most ordinary SMS message.  In this case, we will have to type “24” in the text of the message, and then send it to 000105. After that, wait a bit - you should receive a notification about the successful processing of the request with the subsequent disconnection of the service. </p><p>  As you can see, it’s quite easy to connect the “Who called” feature from Megaphone, as well as refuse it.  The main thing is to know in what order and what to type.  Well, of course, monitor the balance of your phone.  With a “minus”, all additional services requiring payment are disabled. </p>
