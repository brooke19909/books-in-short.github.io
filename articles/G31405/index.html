At the moment there are many models on the market from various manufacturers at very different prices.  However, not everyone can afford cool devices with artificial intelligence on board.  And the budget option is very difficult to choose, because among these machines there are a huge number of low-quality products.  So what to do?  There is an excellent option that is inexpensive and has all the necessary options - a BEKO WKB 51001 M. washing machine. Reviews about it are unexpectedly positive.  Therefore, it is worth considering this washing machine in more detail.  But first, a few words about the manufacturer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="beko wkb 51001 m reviews" class="if uuid-2993091" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993091.jpg"></div><h2>  About VEKO </h2><p>  The VECO brand is Turkish and has existed since 1997.  However, the lion's share of production is made in Russia.  How is this possible?  Very simple.  In 2006, the first plant was launched on the territory of the Russian Federation.  The company has always been engaged in the production of household appliances.  These were refrigerators, microwaves, washing machines and much more.  However, over time, the brand began to produce smaller items: hair dryers, toasters and more.  It is worth noting that the company is doing well.  Their products are actively sold on the Russian market.  Refrigerators and washers are in very steady demand.  Sometimes in production they do not even have time to produce new batches.  The percentage of factory defects is by no means low.  But this does not affect popularity.  Apparently, the whole point is that products are one of the most affordable.  All is sold at very reasonable prices.  No overpayment for the brand.  An example of such a product is <span>a BEKO</span> WKB 51001 M. <span>automatic washing machine</span> . Reviews and photos will be presented a little later.  In the meantime, consider the appearance of the technique. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="market.yandex.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine beko wkb 51001 m reviews" class="if uuid-2993096" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993096.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  So, we have a front-loading washing machine.  This means that in front of her is a porthole giving access to the drum.  It is made of thick glass.  The joints with the machine body have high quality rubber gaskets.  The device itself is made of metal coated with a thick layer of white enamel.  Just above the porthole is the control panel.  Next to her is a powder compartment.  In the most visible place is the wheel for choosing a washing program.  To the right of it are the necessary buttons to control the process.  There is no display that indicates the progress of washing.  Although he wouldn‚Äôt interfere here.  Closer to the bottom of the machine (and again on the front side) is a hole for draining water.  If such an option is needed.  In general, the BEKO WKB 51001 M washing machine, the description of which is presented in the article, looks quite worthy.  Which is even strange, since the device belongs to the budget segment.  However, we continue.  Next in line are other technical parameters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="market.yandex.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beko wkb 51001 m description" class="if uuid-2993098" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993098.jpg"></div><h2>  Dimensions, weight and design features </h2><p>  This washing machine is very compact.  Its height is 85 centimeters, width - 37 and length - 60 cm, respectively.  With such dimensions, it fits in any bathroom.  Even if there is very little space.  As for the weight, it is 51 kilograms.  It will be problematic for one to drag her away.  Someone will need help.  Especially during installation.  Many models of washers from other manufacturers weigh a lot more.  And in size they are not so compact.  On the other hand, this size is only a plus.  Now about other design features.  The top cover of the washing machine is removable.  This is done specifically in the expectation that the machine will be built into the kitchen.  Also, the machine body has partial leakage protection.  The legs of the device have a unique design that dampens the vibrations that appear at high revs.  The drum itself is made of plastic.  But there is no direct drive.  Although he would not hurt.  So, the BEKO WKB 51001 M washing machine (we will look at customer reviews in the following chapters) has a very modern design that ensures its reliability.  What about energy efficiency and other features?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.mvideo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beko wkb 51001 m washing machine specifications" class="if uuid-2993101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993101.jpg"></div><h2>  Energy and water consumption.  Noise level </h2><p>  We continue to disassemble this interesting washing machine.  What is it with power consumption?  How economical is it?  It should be noted that this device belongs to the energy class A +.  This means that with a fairly high specific power, the machine is quite economical.  In numbers, it will be 0.17 kW \ h.  Now about the consumption of water.  For one wash it takes only 41 liters.  This is much less than the competition.  For many, such efficiency will be a decisive factor when choosing a washing machine.  Now about the noise level.  In standard washing mode, the machine does not make loud noises.  The noise level is only 59 dB.  It is not enough.  But when the spin turns on, then the noise increases sharply.  At high speeds, it is already 72 dB.  And that is a lot.  Even too much.  Nevertheless, many potential buyers choose this particular washing machine.  Now consider the main technical characteristics of the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="do.74.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beko wkb 51001 m washing machine description" class="if uuid-2993104" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993104.jpg"></div><h2>  Key Specifications </h2><p>  We continue the conversation about BEKO WKB 51001 M. The washing machine, the characteristics of which we are now considering, boasts a maximum load of 5 kilograms.  Not so much, considering that most competitors are capable of more.  The maximum number of revolutions during the spin cycle is 1000. This is also not a record figure.  Apparently, it is with this that the low level of vibration during the spin cycle is associated.  The washing machine also has as many as 13 programs, a child lock, an option to control the level of foam, a quick and pre-wash function, a special mode for wool, the ability to select a temperature and adjust revolutions during the spin cycle.  This is almost a standard feature set.  There is also balance control and special programs for delicate fabrics, economical washing and super-rinsing.  In general, this washing machine meets almost all modern standards.  And at the same time it is not as expensive as analogues from other manufacturers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="donlux.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beko wkb 51001 m reviews photos" class="if uuid-2993107" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993107.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive feedback from owners </h2><p>  What say those who have already purchased a BEKO WKB 51001 M washing machine?  User reviews are mixed.  Some may not be happy with such a successful acquisition, while others believe that they simply threw money away.  Let's try to figure out which of them is right. </p><p>  Let's start with the positive comments.  The first thing that customers liked about this washing machine was the price.  And indeed it is.  At the moment, this is the cheapest device of such a plan of all existing on the market.  The second is the abundance of washing programs.  Usually budget washers are not equipped with such an impressive set.  Third - the availability of electronic control of the washing process (one of the varieties of artificial intelligence).  The owners are also happy with a decent amount of additional functions (control of the level of foam, child lock and so on).  Many of the users claim that the machine does not vibrate when the centrifuge is on.  This also caused enthusiastic comments.  In general, everyone is happy with the functionality and price.  And then what are users upset about?  About this in the next chapter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="youla.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beko wkb 51001 m washing machine customer reviews" class="if uuid-2993106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2993106.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative owner reviews </h2><p>  What could not suit the buyers with such an affordable and functional washing machine BEKO WKB 51001 M?  Negative reviews concern the very process of the device.  So, for example, owners are not satisfied that at the end of the washing machine does not make any sounds.  We have to guess for ourselves that she has already finished.  Indeed, this is rather inconvenient.  Also, many were upset by the lack of a screen.  It is unclear what stage of washing is currently taking place.  But the worst part is that during acceleration for spinning the machine roars like a jet engine.  And there‚Äôs no getting around it.  Also, the owners categorically do not like the operation of the machine in economy mode.  For some reason, no savings are observed.  These are all negative reviews.  Not so much for a product for such ridiculous money.  It could have been worse. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, above we disassembled the BEKO WKB 51001 M budget-friendly front-loading washing machine. The feedback from the owners of this device makes it clear that it has more advantages than disadvantages.  But the most attractive point is the price.  She is really funny. </p>
