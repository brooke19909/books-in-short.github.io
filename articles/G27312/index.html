This water stream originates at the top of the Caucasus Mountains, mainly from the melting of the Dzhankuat glacier, and flows through the expanses of the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic of Russia.  The Adyl-Su River flows along the Elbrus region and is a tributary of one of the largest rivers in the region - Baksan. </p><p>  The beauty of this natural site attracts many tourists.  The Adyl-Su gorge is located, the photo of which we present in our article, between the Adyl and Yusengi ridges.  The length of the cleft between the mountain peaks is 15 km.  In this way, the water stream moves from the very tops of the Main <span>Caucasian Range</span> along the entire Baksan Valley to its mouth. </p><h2>  Gorge Description </h2><p>  The beauty of nature is difficult to convey in words, this must be seen.  This place is especially beautiful in summer, when the slopes of the surrounding mountains are covered with green grass with flowering plants.  Then they resemble alpine meadows.  The smell in the air at this time is unusual.  The sharp tops of the rocky mountains surround the valley from all sides.  Glaciers, which stretch their processes in the Adyl-Su gorge, are cut by breaks from melting and sparkle with white against a green background of vegetation. </p>

    <p>  Here in the natural expanses you can find grazing mountain goats or sarn.  Several peaks look at the fault at once, so many climbers start their ascents precisely from this point, because athletes call the Adyl-Su gorge a "green hotel".  Although translated from Kabardino-Balkarian, Adyl means "beautiful, beautiful," suu means "river." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the territory there are many streams and small lakes that are periodically filled, which is associated with the melting of glaciers and snow caps of the surrounding peaks.  The area is covered by a magnificent pine forest, which is also interesting to explore, passing along the narrow forest paths. </p><h2>  Authorization </h2><p>  But it‚Äôs not so easy to look at the beauty of this place.  The Adyl-Su gorge in the Elbrus region is located right on the border between two states: Russia and Georgia.  To pass through the border zone, you must obtain a pass.  This procedure is free, but takes time.  It is better to order it in advance on the Internet, through the website of the border service of the Russian Federation.  There is a sample application.  They will write him out at that checkpoint, where the tourist will subsequently receive it. </p>

    <p>  If you have already arrived at the place, then you can do this at the border office.  It will take three days to wait.  During this period, you can plan a tour of other natural attractions, which are abundant here.  Some climbers or climbers at their own peril and risk begin the journey without any permits.  You can, of course, and so, if you are not afraid of meeting with the border guards and you have time to find out all the details.  Without a pass it is allowed to go only to the <span>climbing camp</span> "Dzhantugan".  So everyone should decide for himself this question for himself, but the best option will nevertheless be to arrange everything according to the law, as it should, so as not to spoil yourself such an amazing adventure as climbing mountains with unnecessary delays and troubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You can fly to Elbrus through the airports of Nalchik and Mineralnye Vody (liners from most cities of the country fly there), but it‚Äôs more convenient to get to the place of travel from Nalchik.  From airports or bus stations you need to transfer to buses, minibuses or take a taxi to get to the village nearest to the gorge called Terskol.  It is located in the upper <span>Baksan Gorge.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Dangerous dating </h2><p>  It is best to get there by public transport, as, according to witnesses, there are times when private traders offer their services very cheaply, and then they bring them into dark nooks and extort money, knowing that tourists take a lot of money with them on vacation.  It is also dangerous to meet strangers who can capture and sell a traveler into slavery, especially if he is on his own way.  In order not to risk your freedom and life, as well as to keep cash safe and sound, it is better not to use the services of strangers.  If you didn‚Äôt have time for the last bus to Elbrus region, it is better to stay overnight at the Nalchik hotel, and in the morning calmly, without risks, get to the place by bus. </p><h2>  "Green hotel" </h2><p>  The peaks of the Adyl-Su gorge form a beautiful valley, which is one of the most impressive places in the Elbrus region.  Since an asphalt road approaches this place, it is the most accessible for most lovers of conquering mountain heights.  Four camps for climbers are located in the valley, which from this "green hotel" go to various mountain routes developed by instructors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  From the mouth of the gorge there is a good <span>asphalt road</span> to the Elbrus camp, but a dirt road stretches higher, which will lead travelers to the other camps of the "green hotel".  There are Adyl-Su, Shkhelda, Dzhantugan. </p><p>  The terrain is flat and great for stopping tourists and climbers.  And a little higher on the mountainside, near the edge of the Dzhankuat glacier, there is also a camp, but it is a base of glaciologists, scientists and students who study eternal ice, their physical properties and the impact of glaciers on our planet. </p><h2>  Glacier </h2><p>  On the mountain Dzhantugan (translated from Balkar means "birth of the soul"), which begins from the gorge, there is a glacier dotted with fractures and crevices.  This is a very dangerous place where it is better not even experienced climbers to stay, not to mention ordinary wildlife lovers.  Directly from the camp in the tent camp of the "green hotel" you need to go through the gorge with the Adyl-Su water stream.  The peaks of the Elbrus region are visible from the trail: Bashkara - 4241 m, Dzhantugan - 3991 m, Chatyn - 4368 m, Ushba - 4710 m, Gumachi - 3805 m, peak of the Caucasus - 4037 m. </p>

    <p>  The Kashkash-tash glacier hanging over the ledge of the mountain fills Lake Bashkarinskoye in the Adyl-Su gorge in summer.  Although the water is cold, you can refresh yourself in the summer heat in the clear water of a clear lake. </p><h2>  A few words about the pond </h2><p>  A water bowl formed in the late 30s of the last century as a result of the melting of "dead" ice falling off the glacier.  Now the volume of the lake is 800 thousand cubic meters of water, and its depth is 33 meters.  It is not the only one on the mountain.  Due to the melting of the glacier, new depressions and cracks are constantly forming, filled with water.  They have not yet been mapped, but it will happen soon, since moraine lakes grow more and more every year. </p>

    <p>  There is no surface runoff from the lake, however, scientists consider it to be one of the most dangerous places in the Elbrus region.  Repeatedly, the strength of the water mass that fills the lake has made itself felt by breakthroughs and the formation of mudflows.  The very first collapse occurred in 1958-1959.  The cause of this disaster was the breakthrough of the grotto in the body of the glacier and the erosion of the ice dam. </p><h2>  Adyl-Su Gorge: mudflow </h2><p>  Let's first understand what is mudflow and what is dangerous mudflow.  During the melting of snow or a glacier and due to numerous precipitation in the spring-autumn period, a mudflow or <span>‚Äústormy stream‚Äù</span> (in Arabic) may suddenly form.  Water along the road gathers fragments of stones, rocks, has a large concentration of mineral particles and soil. </p><p>  Sel is a rather thick layer of water.  Although its promotion lasts only a couple of hours, it has a terrible destructive power.  The mudflow velocity is from 2-6 m / s.  In the course of the course, he can lay a deep channel.  Usually these are either dry places or small streams.  After such a disaster, mountains of mud and stones remain, which subsequently harden. </p><p>  The mudflow has a frontal part, a huge shaft that moves forward, demolishing all objects in its path.  There are flows consisting of several shafts replacing each other.  Such a force of heavy water is accompanied by major changes in the river bed. </p><h2>  Mudflow hazard </h2><p>  In the Adyl-Su gorge, sel disappears quite often, especially in recent years.  Everyone suffers from such a formidable force: people are dying, cars, roads, entire villages are being washed into the water, the gas pipeline is suffering.  The power of mudflows was also recognized by some tourists who were trapped.  Authorities are constantly organizing rescue work.  Several towers were built with observers who are trying to anticipate the formation of mudflows. </p>

    <p>  But, unfortunately, this is not always possible.  More often a collapse occurs with such explosive force that the sound travels for many kilometers.  At the beginning of September 2017, the village got into the Adyl-Su Baksan Gorge, three cars with people were washed away by the mass of the stream during the failure of the route, people were killed, the gas pipeline was cut off, several villages were left without gas.  Authorities evacuated people by helicopters. </p><p>  Tourist groups were cut off from the rest of the world, including children.  Local residents said that they had not seen such a powerful mudflow in their life.  The road was washed away in several places, bridges were destroyed. </p>
