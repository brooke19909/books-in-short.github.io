  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The structure of the psyche from the standpoint of the science of socionics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Traditional psychology has not been able to build a "beautiful", working model of the psyche.  However, the answer to the question of what is the structure of the human psyche can be given by the young science of socionics.  Why is it worth listening to the opinion of science, which has exchanged only a few decades?  Because it is based on the development of the science of computer science, and the psyche has certainly an informational nature. </p><p>  So, what does the human psyche include?  All <span>mental processes</span> occur either in consciousness or in the unconscious part of the psyche.  Moreover, this is not at all a mysterious subconscious, but simply processes that have an "automatic" character.  If a person had to be aware of everything that was happening to him, he simply could not stand the constant flow of information, which should be given conscious attention.  Thus, a number of processes are brought to the automatic level in order to relieve the sphere of consciousness, such is the structure of the psyche. </p><p>  The entire amount of information received from the world can be divided into 8 components - aspects.  Aspects are empirically determined and this knowledge dates back to the development of Jung, who, as you know, described the psychological types.  The brilliant idea that it was not a matter of types, but of ways of perceiving different types of information, came to researchers not so long ago.  So, there are 8 types of information, special mechanisms work with them - mental functions.  And the structure of the psyche, it turns out, is closely related to the work of functions. </p><p>  Information processors - functions - can have different "power".  4 types of information are processed at a very good level, and 4 - at a weak level.  Why do we need weak functions in the structure of the psyche?  Let's take an example. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, some people, due to the type of psyche, do a poor job of building relationships.  They know this from early childhood and often experience it, although they cannot fix it.  In socionics, among the aspects there really is such an aspect - ‚Äúrelations‚Äù.  And for these people they are engaged in a "weak" function.  A person feels insecure in terms of weak functions, and therefore someone else's opinion regarding the ability to communicate and build relationships can greatly affect a person of this psychotype.  He turns out to be dependent on society and specific people who can evaluate his <span>ability to communicate.</span>  Yes, it is becoming manageable.  Is it bad?  No, good, because manageability is necessary for the normal functioning of society as a whole.  That is, blocks of weak functions make us manageable.  But the decisions made are implemented by the executive blocks of the psyche - ‚Äústrong‚Äù functions. </p><p>  As you remember, part of the information is not realized by the psyche.  In socionics, it is believed that the Vital superblock controls this area.  It consists of ID and SUPERID blocks (not to be confused with psychoanalytic terms).  The latter is also called the superblock of pleasure.  For example, some people are greatly activated by other people's emotions, others enjoy clear business instructions, and others love volitional manifestations in others.  There are sixteen types of psyche and there are 16 ways to activate the psyche.  After SUPERID received informational impact, the ID is included in the work.  Moreover, this happens unknowingly. </p><p>  If a person faces a new task that he cannot solve on the basis of old algorithms, a block of consciousness or Mental comes to the rescue.  It includes the SUPEREGO block (the block of society‚Äôs control over the person) and the EGO <span>(block of creativity).</span>  The first of these controls that "everything was like people", and the second creates a creative unique product.  For example, some people are able to create ingenious theories, others - beautiful designer clothes, and others - new work technologies. </p><p>  Thus, the structure of the psyche is determined by the need to make decisions and execute them, and is simple enough to be described in natural languages. </p>
