In order to ensure a decent stay for all guests, the tourist service is excellently developed here.  There are a lot of resorts in Crete.  We invite you to the village of Kato Gouves, to one of its wonderful Gouves Bay Hotel 3 * hotels.  Reviews about him are mostly favorable.  The staff of this hotel, from the manager to the gardener, tries to provide their guests with the best vacation in their life. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In Crete, 18 km east of its capital, Heraklion, there are two villages of Gouves.  One of them is Pano, which means Upper.  It is located on the side of a mountain called Ederi, and is an example of a classic Cretan settlement.  There are small taverns, several churches, ancient buildings.  You can visit Pano Gouves in order to become imbued with Greek and specifically Cretan culture.  The second Gouves is called Kato, which means Lower.  It is located directly on the coast of the legendary Aegean Sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gouves Bay Hotel 3" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2124215.jpg"></div>  It is in Kato Gouves, in its central part, that the Gouves Bay Hotel 3 * is located.  In Crete, it is sometimes difficult to say exactly where one settlement ends and another begins.  The same applies to Kato Gouves.  From the west (from Heraklion), it smoothly passes into the resort village of Pelekita, which, in turn, merges with the village of Gournis.  From the east, Kato Guvers is closely adjacent to the village of Agia Pelagia.  In a southerly direction (towards the mountain) Kato Gouves imperceptibly passes into Pano Gouves.  Such a location allows tourists to take walks and get to know the culture of the Cretans.

    <h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  In Gouves Bay Hotel 3 * for young tourists there is a playground with bright swings and slides, a small children's pool.  The rooms have the ability to order a playpen (for infants) or a crib.  That's probably all that is provided for kids. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Gouves Bay Hotel 3 * (Crete, Heraklion) is located just a couple of tens of meters from the coast of the Aegean Sea.  The beach cover is pebble.  Sunbeds and umbrellas are paid here (5 euros per set).  The sea in Crete is unusually beautiful, but due to the fact that the main resorts, including Gouves, are not located in bays, waves and wind are frequent on the beach.  For those who want to swim and sunbathe, this is not very convenient, but it is ideal for surfers.  Another feature of Cretan beaches is that the water, even off the coast, warms up only by the end of June.  The beach at Gouves Bai Hotel is very clean.  The water in the sea is unusually clear, which makes it possible to enjoy snorkeling.  True, beautiful marine life is not enough here.  Sunset at sea is quite convenient, as pebble cover alternates with strips of sand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gouves Bay Hotel 3 description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2124195.jpg"></div>
