Early repayment of a loan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the additional services that Russians pay while using a loan is insurance.  It reduces the risk of defaults.  Upon the occurrence of certain circumstances during the term of the contract, the bank will receive money from the insurance company (IC).  However, loans, especially consumer loans, are most often repaid early.  It turns out that the need for an additional service disappears.  Will insurance be returned after repayment of the loan to the borrower in this case?  Yes, but not in full. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  November 17, 2009 The Presidium of the Supreme Arbitration Court adopted a ruling according to which bank credit commissions related to measures that infringe consumer rights.  Over the next years, hundreds of cases regarding the return of illegally paid amounts were examined.  Banks were forced to cancel the commission, which was an important source of their income.  But then they quickly found an alternative - increased rates for the use of funds. </p>

    <p>  After the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn Consumer Loans‚Äù came into force, a new problem arose - the imposition of insurance contracts when issuing a loan.  Clients began to file <span>claims,</span> complaining of: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  the fact that banks, frightening them with a refusal to issue a loan, imposed unnecessary contracts; </li><li>  the high cost of insurance services; </li><li>  the fact that the refusal to return funds for additional services was initially prescribed in the loan agreement. </li></ul><p>  On the one hand, banks increase commissions, and on the other, customers are not aware of their rights.  Fearing refusal to obtain a loan, they draw up additional contracts, and then think about how to return insurance after paying the loan. </p><h2>  Who needs it </h2><p>  There is still a need for insurance.  Banks receive additional money back security in unforeseen situations.  If an insured event occurs, the company transfers a specific amount to the credit institution to repay the loan.  If it exceeds the balance of the debt, the difference is paid to the debtor (in theory).  If the amount of compensation is not enough to cover the debt, the bank will look for ways to retain funds from the client.  Most often, the risk of death, the acquisition of disability of groups 1, 2 are insured.  If we are talking about a real estate object, then compensation will be paid in case of unlawful actions of other persons, damage by water, fire, as a result of a natural disaster, natural phenomena, theft of a vehicle, accident. </p>

    <h2>  Insurance </h2><p>  According to <span>Art.</span>  <span>421 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation,</span> individuals and legal entities are free to conclude contracts.  That is, the bank does not have the right to impose any service on its customers as a prerequisite for obtaining a loan.  At the same time, the law spelled out the case when a loan is not provided without customer life insurance.  We are talking about registration of a mortgage and the acquisition of a car.  If the contract is signed, payments are regularly received, a logical question arises: after I paid the loan, do I have the right to return the insurance? </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The beneficiary of such transactions is the bank.  If the loan is fully repaid, the client has the right to terminate the insurance contract, as the property becomes its property.  The bank is obliged to recalculate and transfer the balance of funds.  The insurer has the right to receive part of the remuneration.  Its amount is proportional to the duration of the contract.  Who paid the loan has the right to return insurance.  But provided that the loan was paid ahead of schedule.  That is, it will not work to return insurance after repayment of the loan on time.  The procedure depends on which loan was issued: consumer or collateral.  In the first case, the life of the client is insured, and in the second - collateral. </p><h2>  Ways to save </h2><p>  So, banks do not have the right to impose insurance when applying for a loan, except as otherwise provided by law.  If this still happened, try not to include the cost of the service in the total loan amount.  Otherwise, interest will also be charged on it.  Who paid the loan has the right to return insurance.  This can be done in such situations. </p>

    <h2>  Loopholes </h2><p>  It‚Äôs not worth it yourself to puzzle over how to return insurance for a loan.  It is better to seek help from lawyers.  Most often, one of the existing loopholes is used to solve the problem. </p><p>  You can refer to the wording in the contract on the issuance of borrowed funds, which is associated with insurance.  The document may contain a phrase with the following meaning: ‚ÄúThe insurance contract is signed for the entire term of the use of credit funds‚Äù (wording may differ).  The meaning is as follows: if the loan has been paid ahead of schedule, the borrower's obligations to the bank are deemed fulfilled, the insurer's obligations must also end. </p><p>  The second option is to refer to the lack of risk.  The contract is concluded so that upon the occurrence of an insured event, the bank receives its funds back.  If the loan is repaid early, the need for such protection disappears.  According to Art.  958 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, if "the insurance contract ceases to be valid before the expiration of the term for which it was concluded, or if the risks of the occurrence of an insured event have disappeared", the company is obliged to recalculate and return part of the premium. </p><p>  But even these arguments to insurers rarely work.  Most often, the case has to be decided in court.  The result depends on the position of the judge.  But there is still a chance to return the funds.  Insurers, seeking to prove their loyalty to customers, include in the documents clauses governing the procedure for returning premiums upon early termination.  Also, do not forget about the Insurance Rules.  A client can even examine these documents in advance. </p>

    <h2>  Arbitrage practice </h2><p>  How to return credit insurance if the client is right and the insurance company does not want to accept documents?  It is worth contacting the organization for the protection of consumer rights.  Its employees will help the client defend the rights in court, may even act on the side of the plaintiff.  Practice shows that in claims, when financial institutions imposed additional services on clients contrary to the provisions of the law, the court most often sided with the applicant.  In the case of loans, the organization acts as the seller of the service, which imposes the signing of another contract. </p>
