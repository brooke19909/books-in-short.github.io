    <h2>  First population </h2><p>  The first residents of the city of Mogilev-Podolsky (the map perfectly shows its location) settled on its territory in 1450. The city itself was erected only in 1595, the first building was the castle of Jeremiah of the Grave, in whose honor it is named.  This was followed by the arrangement and ennobling of the surroundings, after which they passed into the possession of the son-in-law of the founder Stefan Pototsky.  In the period from 1654 to 1667, a war broke out between the Poles and the Russians, but the Cossack-Russian troops, united with the Tatars, managed to repel the enemy attack by the Pole.  The inhabitants of Mogilev on the Dniester were not spared by the uprising against the feudal lords, which took place in 1768, the organizers of which were Maxim Zheleznyak and <span>Ivan Gont.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  During the tsarist rule of the Russian Empire, Mogilev-Podolsky (Ukraine) was sold to Russia by Poland (1795), after which it became part of the great Empire.  And a year later he was assigned the status of the county of Podolsk province.  Thanks to developed agriculture and extensive <span>wheat fields</span> , in the middle of the XIX century Mogilev became the largest city in the production of bread.  In 1881, the construction of railways began here, shipping routes appeared.  This contributed to the rapid development of the industry of the county town, various enterprises began to be built, such as a <span>cast iron</span> foundry <span>,</span> <span>sugar production</span> and others.  In 1922, Mogilev became part of the Ukrainian SSR and a year later it acquired its new name, still used today - Mogilev-Podolsky.  The city became part of the Vinnytsia region only in 1932. And already by 1940 its industry had grown tenfold. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mogilev Podolsky city" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1258999.jpg" width="600"></div>
