Goynuk stands out among them for its unique natural monuments - intricate grottoes, caves, canyons.  The second plus of the village is its proximity to the leader of the Turkish tourism business - the city of Kemer.  Some do not share these two settlements at all, considering them to be parts of a single whole.  Here in such an interesting place from the point of view of various tourist bonuses there is a good, but inexpensive hotel for its category, the Majesty Club La Mer Art 5 * hotel.  I would like to note that its territory is adjacent to the Majesty Club La Mer, also a five-star hotel.  Many vacationers do not pay attention to a slight difference in the names, which causes confusion in the reviews, because the conditions of rest in these two hotels are not quite the same.  We will try to avoid inaccuracies and give the most complete information specifically about Majesty Club La Mer Art 5 *, a wonderful hotel that has been pleasing tourists with its excellent service for many years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Majesty Club La Mer Art 5" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1034798.jpg" width="575"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The village of Goynuk occupies a small strip of land in a place where the majestic Taurus Mountains retreated from the sea into the continent.  It is 45 km from Antalya, and only 7 km from Kemer.  Majesty Club La Mer Art 5 * is the third hotel in a row from Kemer.  It is located on the outskirts of the village of Goynuk, right on the shores of the delightful Mediterranean Sea, in a place where the D400 heavy-duty highway makes a big loop, providing peace to the rest.  From the center of Goynuk it is about a 20-30 minute walk.  Nearby is an asphalt road leading to the village, as well as onto the D400 highway leading to Antalya and stretching along the entire coast.  You can get to the hotel on the company‚Äôs company transfer of the travel agency, where you purchased tickets, as well as on your own, on regular buses that run from early morning until the evening with an interval of 30 minutes.  In Antalya, you can take them either at the central bus station, or near the large shopping center Migros.  They come here from the coast.  And it is most convenient to get to Kemer by dolmushi.  The road takes only 5 minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Majesty Club La Mer Art 5 reviews" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1034799.jpg" width="594"></div>

    <h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  Turkey is famous all over the world for its magnificent sea coasts.  Majesty Club La Mer Art 5 * is located right on the beach.  The hotel has its own beach and begins where the hotel territory ends, which is a big plus and is liked by absolutely all tourists.  On the positive side, there are also enough sunbeds, a lot of space under a canopy from the sun, cleanliness on the beach, the presence of locker rooms and showers, a large and comfortable pier, small pebbles underfoot, which does not cause any inconvenience.  However, not everyone likes entry into the water from the shore, and not from the pier, since on the right side there are many large stones in the water that make it difficult to move.  There are no stones on the left side, but in the water after the previous pier there were concrete blocks with reinforcement, about which you can cut the feet.  If you go down to the sea on the stairs from the pier, then the depth immediately starts on the right side, which is not suitable for children and adults who can‚Äôt swim, and only on the left there is a bottom under your feet.  In view of these circumstances, many guests from the Majesty Club La Mer Art 5 * (Kemer) use the beach of the neighboring Sherwood Hotel, dragging sunbeds there.  For the convenience of guests on the beach there is a vending machine with soft drinks.  The sea in the beach area is warm even in autumn and clean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Majesty Club La Mer Art 5 Turkey Kemer" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1034761.jpg" width="582"></div>
