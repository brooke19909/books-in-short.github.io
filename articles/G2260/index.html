    <h2>  About service </h2><p>  In the end, a couple of words should be said about this, discussing a vacation at Simantro Beach Hotel 5 *.  The hotel receives mostly positive reviews.  Largely due to the decent quality of service.  Maids clean their rooms honestly, efficiently, and not superficially.  In restaurants and bars, dishes are always perfectly clean, and appliances are prepared in advance - they lie on tables, neatly wrapped in napkins.  If something does not suit or something is not, then you can call the waiter who will solve the problem. </p><p>  The good news is that in bars and restaurants they speak Russian and understand the guests.  The main thing is to speak articulate.  Bartenders know a lot of cocktails, if you want something special, you can ask.  Everyone in these establishments is doing their job well. </p><p>  Chefs also cook very tasty and varied.  It seems to many that something on the menu is missing, or you want more originality.  Therefore, it is worth mentioning right away that the restaurants in the hotel are not for those individuals who are used to ordering dishes in institutions marked by the highest culinary awards. </p><p>  In general, this hotel is perfect for people who want to enjoy the sea, the sun and fresh air.  That is what the Simantro Beach Hotel is all about.  The reviews of people who have been here are direct confirmation of this.  Not without reason, after all, many come back here again to re-experience all the impressions on themselves. </p>
