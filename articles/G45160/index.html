Everyone has heard the deeds of companies such as Xiaomi or Meizu.  But even less eminent representatives of the "yellow race" have in their arsenal very interesting models of smartphones.  European brands somehow did not think of such devices.  And it is not known for what reason.  Among the Chinese wonders of engineering, sometimes there are ones that are breathtaking.  One such device is the Oukitel K10000 Pro.  Reviews of real owners suggest that this device meets all the declared characteristics.  And this is very interesting, since the latter are slightly inconsistent with the generally accepted canons of "smartphone building."  But we will talk about this device a bit later.  In the meantime, let's figure out what kind of company this is. </p><h2>  A little about the manufacturer </h2><p>  A few years ago, no one heard about a company like Oukitel.  And this is not surprising, because it was founded in 2014.  I must say that in China, such companies grow like mushrooms after rain.  But against the faceless "copies" of other manufacturers from the Middle Kingdom, Oukitel products stand out noticeably.  The founders of this company are several brands at once: the notorious manufacturer of smartphones called Doogee and the Chinese OEM, the manufacturer OUKI.  The task of this tandem is to create a multinational company producing inexpensive, convenient and beautiful smartphones.  But the main priority was the desire to get people to talk about these smartphones and buy them.  And looking at the Oukitel K10000 Pro, reviews of which we will analyze in subsequent chapters of the material, we can safely say that they did it.  Nobody has ever experimented with mobile devices like this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The priority market for Oquitel is the European one.  The company does not intend to sell its equipment in China.  But what it is connected with is not clear.  Perhaps the Chinese are simply hard to surprise with anything.  Or the reason is fierce competition in the home market.  It is extremely difficult for a new company to break through in such conditions.  So, Oquitel relied on the uniqueness of its products.  And the success of the company in this regard is amazing.  The manufacturer, for example, has released the world's thinnest smartphone, protected by IP68.  Also in the arsenal of the company there is also an ultra-thin smartphone made of glass and metal with a very capacious battery.  But of particular interest is the Oukitel K10000 Pro.  Responses of owners are full of laudatory maxims.  Let's take a closer look at this gadget.  Why is it so unique? </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  Consider the kit that comes with the Oukitel K10000 Pro smartphone.  Reviews from real owners are full of claims that they have never seen such a rich set.  And really there is something to be surprised.  The device comes in a black box made of recycled cardboard.  The box itself is not tight enough, but these are trifles.  Inside is the smartphone itself and several cardboard boxes, in which additional accessories and the necessary pieces of paper are located.  The most interesting thing is that the gadget is already dressed in a transparent silicone case.  Such a concern on the part of the company that directly tears of tenderness are welling up.  In addition to the device itself, the box has a pseudo-leather case for carrying a smartphone on the belt (remember the beginning of the two thousandth), a proprietary protective glass (even though a protective film is already glued to the screen), a microfiber cloth and a special alcohol wipe.  Not a single manufacturer had such a rich configuration. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In addition to all of the above, the delivery package of this smartphone has a clip for removing the SIM card tray, a warranty card and an instruction manual.  From the last sense is not very much.  Everyone already knows how to use smartphones.  Especially those who acquire such models.  This is the Oukitel K10000 Pro package.  Reviews of real owners are not deceived.  Such accessories complete with a smartphone have not yet been a single manufacturer.  Even from the Middle Kingdom.  The delivery set is one of the advantages of Oukitel smartphone over devices of other brands.  And there is no problem that the device is designed and built in China.  Now consider the look of the smartphone.  He, too, can pretty much surprise. </p><h2>  Appearance and design features </h2><p>  The main merit of Chinese designers is that they managed to make an apparatus that does not at all resemble modern ‚Äúremnants‚Äù in the candy bar form factor.  When you look at Oukitel, you immediately realize that this is a real male smartphone: a brutal appearance, big and thick, with huge bolts on metal plates.  It even seems that he has some kind of protection class.  But this is not so.  The front panel is almost all occupied by the screen.  The manufacturer indicates the presence of tempered safety glass Corning Gorilla Glass in the Oukitel K10000 Pro.  Responses of owners say that the <span>"protective" glass</span> does not tolerate scratches very well.  That is why extra glass is included.  Under the screen are the familiar touch navigation buttons.  Above it is the earpiece and sensors along with the front camera.  On the upper and lower ends of the device there are brutal metal plates of an unusual shape, which gives the device a unique look. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The design of the rear panel is very interesting.  The main part is made of plastic, covered with a material that mimics the skin.  The most valuable thing about it is that it is resistant to physical impact.  Wipe this beauty will be extremely difficult.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe camera and fingerprint sensor is protected by a thick metal plate, which is securely screwed to the skeleton of the device with huge bolts.  The latter also perform a decorative function, in addition to their core.  In order to remove the back panel, you must first unscrew all the bolts.  At the bottom there is a loudspeaker and a microphone.  Also a connector for charging.  On the top there is only a headphone jack.  This is the look of the <span>Oukitel K10000 Pro.</span>  <span>The reviews of the</span> owners are full of laudatory maxims in terms of quality assembly and high practicality of such a design.  However, now it's time to look a little deeper and see what the smartphone is capable of. </p><h2>  Hardware platform performance </h2><p>  So, let's see what hardware the Oukitel K10000 Pro Black smartphone is equipped with.  User reviews are full of positive gadget performance ratings.  But what makes the device work quickly and efficiently?  The processor uses an eight-core 64-bit chip from MTK with a maximum clock frequency of 1.5 gigahertz.  This is an average processor, but quite productive.  For the graphic part is the Mali T860 chip with full support for DirectX and OpenGL.  Thanks to him, the smartphone easily copes with modern games and can play video content in any format of the Full HD standard.  RAM is represented by a multi-channel energy-efficient solution with a capacity of 3 gigabytes.  Thanks to this component, the device works quickly, smoothly and clearly.  The volume of the internal drive is 32 gigabytes.  But it can easily be increased with a Micro SD memory card up to 64 gigabytes.  However, the device is equipped with a hybrid slot, in which you can install either one SIM card with a USB flash drive, or two SIM cards.  This is a disease of all modern manufacturers. </p>

    <p>  The smartphone supports LTE Cat.6 networks, has advanced Wi-Fi and Bluetooth transmitters and is equipped with a smart navigation module.  The latter connects to satellites within 10 seconds.  A feature of the device is a fingerprint sensor with advanced functionality.  It works with lightning speed and recognizes even wet fingers.  Also, the sensor can work as a touch button.  With it, you can answer the call, switch the track on the player or pause video playback.  This is another "chip" Oukitel K10000 Pro 4G LTE.  The feedback on the operation of the fingerprint scanner is extremely positive.  The Chinese clearly managed to create a very remarkable apparatus of the middle price segment.  However, let's look at the most important component of any smartphone - the screen.  How can he surprise us? </p><h2>  Display specifications </h2><p>  The Oukitel K10000 Pro 4G smartphone, reviews of which will be disassembled a bit later, is equipped with a bright display with an IPS-matrix and a diagonal of 5.5 inches.  At the same time, the screen resolution is 1920 by 1080 pixels, that is - Full HD.  The screen design is very interesting.  It is created using OGS technology.  This means that there is no air gap between the protective glass and the display itself.  This solution helps to significantly improve color reproduction.  The protective glass has an anti-reflective coating, which ensures the readability of the screen even in direct sunlight.  There is also an <span>oleophobic coating</span> so that the fingers slip more easily and fingerprints are not collected.  The pixel density of the screen is such that it is impossible to examine the ‚Äúgrain‚Äù with the naked eye.  This is a sign of a quality product.  The sensor is able to work out immediately ten simultaneous clicks.  This is a standard indicator for all touch panels. </p>

    <p>  The main characteristic of the smartphone screen is almost realistic color reproduction.  Engineers considered it so successful that they completely cut out brightness, contrast, and color tone control components from the firmware.  But to return these elements is not difficult.  With such a screen, it‚Äôs nice to surf the Internet, watch videos or photos, enjoy reading your favorite book.  This is the screen of the Oukitel K10000 Pro Black.  Reviews about it fully confirm the information stated by the manufacturer.  So, we sorted out the iron, looked at the display too.  It's time to turn to the cameras of the smartphone and understand what they are capable of. </p><h2>  Cameras: main and front </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that this device cannot be called a camera phone.  Therefore, one can‚Äôt even expect something extraordinary from the main camera.  The 13-megapixel sensor from On Semiconductor without interpolation is used as the main photomodule.  What good can you say about him?  He especially succeeds in macro photography and portrait mode.  Autofocus is there, but rather slow.  High-quality images are obtained only with adequate lighting.  With a lack of it, numerous artifacts and noises immediately climb onto the surface.  At the same time, the smartphone‚Äôs camera has manual settings and can save photos in RAW format, which is very useful for subsequent processing in any editor.  That's just the quality would be more.  In principle, the Oukitel K10000 Pro 4 main sensor is not so bad. User reviews confirm this. </p>

    <p>  But what about the front camera?  Will she go for a selfie?  But there is almost no front camera.  None of the reviews say anything specific about her.  It is worth saying right away that for a selfie it is rather weak.  Images are fuzzy, blurry.  There is also a huge amount of noise and artifacts.  The main purpose of this camera is video calls.  But even so, the quality will not be up to par.  What do you want?  This is a brutal male smartphone.  What is the front camera?  Men like pink "vanilla" is completely useless.  Even the Chinese understand this.  Well, let's now deal with smartphone software.  What will make us a manufacturer from the Middle Kingdom? </p><h2>  Operating system and software platform </h2><p>  Oukitel K10000 Pro operating system - Android 7.0.  User reviews suggest that this OS feels great on a smartphone.  There are no problems with the animation, there are no brakes and glitches.  However, the main "trick" is not at all in this.  The device uses almost bare Android, which is very strange for Chinese devices.  Celestial programmers usually just burn out of the desire to put their "proprietary" shell on the device.  But in this case, without it.  For what honor and praise to the manufacturer.  The most incredible thing is that there is no Chinese software in the firmware!  Can you imagine?  And the most fantastic is that Google applications are already installed!  The user does not have to surf the Internet in search of international firmware with Google services.  Here's who the Xiaomi guys should learn from. </p>

    <p>  Fans of software updates will have to moderate their appetites.  Oquitel updates the firmware of its devices just a couple of times.  Then support ceases.  Unheard of!  But let's look at the situation differently.  The Chinese usually ‚Äúfinish‚Äù their firmware on the go and smooth out the roughness.  After global updates (once or twice) the whole system starts working like a clock.  And if everything works, then why update something with the risk of killing stability?  The guys from Oquitel adhere to this philosophy.  And it cannot be called illogical.  Almost stock ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù works flawlessly on the Oukitel K10000 Pro 32 GB (black).  Reviews about the operating system have no negative comments.  And this is good.  Now let's move on to the "highlight of the program."  Consider why this device is recognized as one of a kind. </p><h2>  Battery and battery life </h2><p>  So we got to the most interesting in our review.  The smartphone from Oukitel is equipped with an unrealistically capacious battery.  As many as 10,000 mAh!  Can you imagine that?  Not a single global manufacturer has thought of supplying their devices with such capacious batteries.  But the Chinese thought of it.  And what is the increase in battery life?  He is quite large.  But first, consider the design of the Oukitel K10000 Pro 32 GB battery, which reviews (battery) are exceptionally positive.  If you remove the back panel of the device and slightly raise the battery, it becomes clear that in fact these are two rechargeable batteries connected in one circuit.  Such an engineering solution is much cheaper than the release of such a capacious battery.  Here the Chinese can be understood. </p><p>  So what about battery life?  The following information should be given.  The device is able to "live" in the playback mode Full HD-video with sound through headphones for 22 hours!  This is an absolute record!  And this despite the fact that the video was viewed at maximum screen brightness.  It is not surprising that in normal use, the gadget lives freely for 5-6 days.  Naturally, with such a battery capacity, an adequate charger is required.  And it comes with the device.  The smartphone also supports fast charging, which is absolutely necessary, given the amount of its battery.  The Oukitel K10000 Pro 32GB smartphone, reviews of which we will analyze in the next section, is without a doubt the champion in terms of battery life.  No modern gadget can overtake him in this regard. </p><h2>  Smartphone Owner Reviews </h2><p>  So what do the lucky owners of the Oukitel K10000 Pro say?  Reviews about this device are mostly positive.  But there are those who are dissatisfied with something (they are always available in one quantity or another).  However, we will start with positive comments from the owners of the gadget. </p><p>  Many users note a very high-quality assembly of the device.  Even despite the fact that the device was made in China by a company that few have heard of.  Also, owners note the high quality of materials.  Many users liked the brutal and unusual appearance of the smartphone.  Chinese designers have surpassed themselves.  They really got a unique device, not like any other gadgets.  Favored customers and the filling of the gadget.  Almost all smartphone performance is more than enough.  According to users, even such demanding modern toys for mobile platforms as World of Tanks Blitz and Asphalt 8 go without any problems.  Although on the mini graphics settings.  But the buyers were especially impressed by the rich functionality of the device and the ability to control the smartphone with gestures.  No one even suggested that for such money you can get a high-quality, unique and functional mid-range device. </p><p> And what do the "haters" say about the Oukitel K10000 Pro 5.5?  Negative reviews are mainly related to the cameras of the device.  And this is logical.  The main photomodule does not shine with some impressive characteristics.  But there is no need to talk about the front camera.  She's just monstrous.  Nevertheless, disgruntled should not forget that in front of us is not a camera phone.  And the quality of the cameras matches the price of a smartphone.  There are also those who categorically do not like the naked ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù as an operating system.  But they forget about the optimization that this Android is endowed with.  All third-party firmware with a corporate design have tweaks, which often change the characteristics of the device for the worse.  Everything is balanced here.  The funniest complaint from users is related to the weight of the smartphone.  The device is really heavy (compared to classmates).  But this is only because of the design.  Yes, and such a severity is only a plus, because the device feels great in any pocket.  Losing it is almost impossible.  As you can see, negative reviews have very little constructive criticism.  Only complaints about the cameras sound valid.  The rest is a wonderful device with an unrealistically capacious battery.  Those who wanted to get rid of the outlet will finally be able to do this.  Not really sacrificing performance and functionality. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we reviewed the Oukitel K10000 Pro smartphone.  Reviews of real owners suggest that this is a very decent phone.  Few manufacturers are ready to offer a modern, productive, functional gadget with an unusual design at such an attractive price.  The closest competitors of this device can not stand any comparison.  The undoubted advantages of the gadget are the battery with a capacity of 10,000 mAh and pure "Android" as the operating system.  The screen of the device is also good.  But the cameras spoiled the overall impression a bit.  But for the sake of such autonomy, you can sacrifice high-quality images.  Such an unreal "vitality" of a smartphone requires some sacrifice.  They donated cameras. </p>
