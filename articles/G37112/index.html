Rather, he had a huge impact on them.  Chinese painting was studied step by step in Japan, Korea, and other Asian countries.  However, <span>modern man is a</span> little tired of the culture of Europe with its unusual and surrealistic paintings.  Now in honor is tender, natural, truly beautiful. </p><p>  Chinese painting is step by step widely studied in manicure courses, because with this technique you can create <span>beautiful flowers</span> and often even butterflies.  Actually, these are the main topics for the drawings.  The technique of Chinese painting is quite simple and even novice specialists can afford.  The only thing required is a little zeal and practice. </p><p>  The Chinese painting technique is similar to the <span>Petrikov painting</span> using the basic basic elements in creating whole paintings.  However, in the first case, the flowers are very natural. </p><p>  Basic requirements for this technique: </p><ul><li>  Brushes for Chinese painting must be flat, with a flat or beveled edge; </li><li>  It is better to choose colors either contrasting and combining with each other, or dark and light shades of the same color; </li><li>  Brushes for Chinese painting should be artificial, because  in the process, natural pile quickly fails due to significant pressure on the plane; </li><li>  When painting on the brush, you must definitely press it well, even thin lines are drawn on the side surface of the brush; </li><li>  The colors on the brush are usually typed from the palette; </li><li>  On the palette, you can thoroughly mix adjacent lines to form a transitional hue; </li><li>  If you type in a color without a palette, then one corner of the pile should be dipped in the first color (up to the middle of the brush width), which should be below, and the second in a different color, slightly hooking on the first paint. </li></ul><p>  So, the Chinese painting step by step: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - The first element that many professionals offer is a small arch or rainbow.  They do it by pressing the thin edge of the brush to the working surface, then slightly lifting it up, put the brush completely over the entire width, stretch the very top of the arch and roll the brush onto the other narrow side. </p><p>  - The second element is the same as the previous one, only it is executed in a mirror image horizontally.  The result is a tube.  It is important to start and finish the element in the same places as the previous one. </p><p>  - Then, on the same principle, petals are made, they only stretch them more.  You can use a wider brush for these purposes. </p><p>  - Another beautiful effect can be obtained if, holding out a brush, make wave-like movements.  Depending on the smoothness, both the effect of a ribbed surface and a light wave can come out. </p><p>  - After training, you can try to combine not 2, but 3 colors.  In this case, at the very tip of one of the colors is a darker shade.  So you can achieve flower petals with a dark center. </p><p>  If you decide that Chinese painting step by step is a very complex process, then this is not at all.  After you learn how to make basic elements, there are few elements, you can experiment with creating intricate bends and thin tips.  If you wish, you can quickly learn all this.  The technique of Chinese painting is the main for many manicure specialists because of its simplicity and speed of execution, and at the same time it has a very beautiful and sophisticated look on any nails. </p><p>  But before doing manicure in this style, the basic strokes must be learned to make on a piece of paper.  It is better if it is dense, because  the brush clip can easily crush thin paper. </p><p>  The primary colors for the elements are selected in calm natural shades, as  it is with them that natural and delicate flowers are obtained.  Additionally paint the necessary moments with glitters or light colors.  You can also use sequins, pebbles and other decorations, but the Chinese painting is so good that even without additions it looks amazing. </p><p>  Good luck in your work and beautiful manicure to you and your clients! </p>
