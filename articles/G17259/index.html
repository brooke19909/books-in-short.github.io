    <p>  Vacationers really praise <span>Turkish cakes,</span> though, and the line for them is quite large, but in order to enjoy such a wonderful taste, people are ready to wait.  Sunset at sea is convenient, the water is clear, warm, sometimes there are waves.  When weather conditions do not allow swimming in the sea, although this happens infrequently, you can choose one of the pools or visit the water park, which is also very popular with lovers of water slides.  The pool is large, does not smell like bleach, there are sunbeds nearby, enough for everyone.  In hot weather, you can take a walk in the garden, sit in a shade under pine trees or palm trees, or lie in a hammock. </p><p>  Various events and animations are very good for everyone to cheer up, every day sports, discos, shows and much more.  Children are very fond of spending time in a mini-club, where they play, draw, dance, and in the evening they become tired and very satisfied. </p>
