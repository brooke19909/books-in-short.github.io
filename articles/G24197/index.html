    <h2>  Short description and hydronym </h2><p>  Mountain Dolgaya (Tagil) got its name for its appearance, which has an oblong shape, which stretches from north to south.  Its height at the highest point is almost 380 meters, but the lowest part is located at a 250-meter height. </p><p>  This object is the main place for training and holding competitions of international and Russian levels in skiing.  Ski jumps of various heights are located on it, which vary from 40 m to 120 m, and the length of the largest track is 720 m. </p><p>  Although the Long Mountain is part of the ridge, it has a separate location between the valleys of the Irgin and Zyurz rivers.  Near the mountain is a village, about 6 km.  Also interesting is the fact that the hill has a greenish and pockmarked hue due to the quartzediorites that make up its base. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Snow in these places falls already in September, forming a permanent cover that lasts until late spring, depending on weather conditions.  But even in June, you can find small patches of ice on peaks or crevices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="long mountain" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1155306.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Slope relief </h2><p>  Each slope has its own canopy, and the most even is the southern descent with meadows located in the lowlands, but the northern, on the contrary, is steeper.  The steepest is the western descent.  It is distinguished by rocky ledges.  The eastern slope is a combined slope that is ideal for the ski slopes laid here. </p><h2>  Description of the object in the sources </h2><p>  Dolgaya Mountain (Nizhny Tagil) is mentioned in various sources since the 19th century.  There is information about the location of an iron mine near the mountain, and it is also told about the appearance of the object.  The document says that the mountain has gentle slopes, covered with spruce and pine trees, with a domed peak.  There is also a description of the nearby territory, and it is mentioned that the mountain is divided into the 1st and 2nd. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Long Tagil" class="if" height="486" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1155307.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are also small placers of stones that look chaotic, but can reach 2 m. </p><p>  Forests consist of conifers, such as pine, <span>fir, spruce;</span>  Cedar forests, aspen or birch may fall.  The lower cover is represented by various herbs and low shrubs, as well as an abundance of moss and lichen.  At the top there are stunted trees with curved trunks due to strong winds. </p><h2>  Animal world </h2><p>  Dolgaya Mountain (Nizhny Tagil) is not very diverse fauna.  But still there are various animals.  The main representatives are the inhabitants of the taiga, such as elk, lynx, bear.  Also in these places live wolves.
