Mamontov was relieved of his last post by the Decree of the President of Russia V.V. Putin dated June 4, 2018. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.dw.com" data-author=": A.Druzhinin, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian President at the Winter Cherry shopping center" class="if uuid-2999667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/2999667.jpg"></div><p>  After being removed from his post, he was arrested and detained in the framework of the criminal case brought against him. </p><h2>  SEC “Winter Cherry” </h2><p>  In the period from March 25 to 26, 2018, in Kemerovo, a destructive fire occurred in the territory of the “Winter Cherry” shopping and entertainment center.  The fire area was almost 1,600 square meters.  In case of fire and as a result of the fire extinguishing, the roof of the building and floors on the upper floors of the shopping and entertainment center collapsed.  Sixty people were killed, among them - forty-one children.  This fire was the second most dead in modern Russia.  The sad championship belongs to the Lame Horse nightclub (2009, Perm), where one hundred fifty-six people died in fire and were poisoned by combustion products. </p><h2>  Fire causes </h2><p>  According to the results of work aimed at identifying the causes of fire in the “Winter Cherry” shopping and entertainment center, it was found that it started from the location of the LED lamp.  He was flooded with meltwater, which penetrated through the leaking sections of the roof.  The circuit breaker, which was supposed to ensure the shutdown of faulty devices in short circuit mode, turned out to be faulty. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rbth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fire brigades in Kemerovo 03/26/2018" class="if uuid-2999631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/2999631.jpg"></div><p>  Conclusions from the study of the causes and conditions that led to the fire and large casualties indicate that the fire control did not take any part in preventing the emergency in this building. </p><p>  Reconstruction and operation of the building of the “Winter Cherry” shopping center was carried out with gross violations in technical equipment in terms of fire safety.  Wiring suitable for circuit breakers in most cases was constantly overheating, which led to the destruction of thermal insulation, local short circuits, and sparking. </p><p>  From the testimony of direct witnesses to the fire, it followed that a children's pool filled with easily flammable foam cubes became the focus of fire in the mall.  A week before the tragedy, the center’s employees were complaining about water from the ceiling dripping into the so-called dry children's pool and the lights constantly dimming over it.  However, there was no reaction to these appeals. </p><p>  The fire alarm did not work after a fire.  Fire extinguishing systems and other fire fighting equipment were not involved.  Moreover, the actions of the arrived fire brigades during emergency response were extremely poorly coordinated and led to unjustified human casualties. </p><h2>  Preliminary Investigation Results </h2><p>  During the preliminary investigation of law enforcement bodies and employees of the Investigative Committee of Russia, it was found that the Ministry of Emergency Situations for KOs had removed themselves from the coordination of technical conditions for the construction and operation of this building.  Comprehensive inspections of the Zimnaya Vishnya shopping and entertainment center were not carried out, which was justified by the order on supervisory holidays for small business structures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ktla.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fire in the mall &quot;Winter Cherry&quot;" class="if uuid-2999626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/2999626.jpg"></div><p>  The head of the Investigative Committee of Russia Bastrykin, who took control of the fire investigation, told the public that the current scheduled inspections by the fire inspectors of the Winter Cherry were carried out with gross violations.  The fire-fighting condition of the shopping and entertainment center was assessed incorrectly. </p><p>  The conclusions of the head of the TFR of the Russian Federation were also confirmed by the deputy.  Pavel Kononov, head of the regional department of the Ministry of Emergencies, admitting in an interview to REN-TV that since 2016 no checks have been carried out in the “Winter Cherry”, fake reports on the work of fire inspectors in the mall were generated. </p><h2>  Investigative actions </h2><p>  Based on the results of the work, the IC of the Russian Federation opened a case on the grounds of crimes of three articles of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation: 109 (“Causing death by negligence”), 219 (“Violation of fire safety requirements”), 238 (“Provision of services that do not meet security requirements”). </p><h2>  Mamontov and his family, real estate </h2><p>  Currently, the investigation and the public not only in the Kemerovo region, but throughout Russia are interested in the sources of income of General Mamontov and his family.  From the information received by the media it follows that the family of the head of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, Kemerovo Alexander Sergeyevich Mamontov, lived on a “big foot”.  So, the main place of their residence is a modern three-story mansion, which is located in an elite village in the suburbs of the regional center.  The area of ​​the house built on it is more than five hundred square meters.  And the area of ​​the land on which this "palace" stands contains fifteen acres.  This house is made of brick, it has many windows.  On the territory of the plot there is a utility block and a garage.  The house is also equipped with an underground garage.  A photo of Alexander Mamontov and his estate can be found in this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The estate of Mamontov and his mother" class="if uuid-2999637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/2999637.jpg"></div><p>  The land adjoins another land with a similar area, which belongs to his mother - Mamontova Galina Mikhailovna.  It also built a large two-story house, but a smaller area. </p><p>  According to preliminary estimates, only the cadastral value of these estates is almost twenty million rubles.  The family of the head of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Kemerovo, Alexander Mamontov, also has a cottage in the village of Rodnichok, Kemerovo Region.  Its cost is about 12 million rubles.  On the territory there are wooden houses with gazebos, greenhouses and vegetable gardens. </p><p>  In the city of Kemerovo, Alexander Mamonov and his wife, Leyla Mamontova, as well as the mother of the Emergencies Ministry general, owned six apartments at different times.  They are located in the central part of the regional city.  According to the information of the living neighbors, almost all of these apartments are rented out. </p><p>  Of the vehicles owned by Alexander Sergeyevich Mamontov, only one vehicle was identified - the Toyota Land Cruiser SUV. </p><h2>  Valuation, sources of income </h2><p>  According to the results of independent investigations conducted by journalists, it follows that the cost of all structures and real estate, including a car, belonging to the former head of the Ministry of Emergency Situations in the Kemerovo Region, Alexander Mamontov and his family members, is more than 25 million rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="frefilms.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="General A.S. Mammoths" class="if uuid-2999653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/2999653.jpg"></div><p>  As a result, the public has a question: where does the official get such income with a monthly salary of one hundred forty thousand rubles, or one million seven hundred thousand rubles a year.  Approximate calculations show that in order to get the opportunity to acquire the above property, which in the family of the official at different times had up to 11 objects, Alexander Sergeyevich would have to work with such a salary without stopping for almost fourteen years. </p><h2>  Arrest, Arrest </h2><p>  General Mamontov Alexander Sergeevich was detained on May 25, 2018.  According to the investigation, this high-ranking head of the regional Ministry of Emergencies, through his actions from 2017 to 2018, did not contribute to inspections of the shopping and entertainment center in order to comply with fire safety requirements.  Moreover, the next check, which was to be held on March 18, 2018, seven days before the tragedy, was not carried out. </p><h2>  Suspicion of criminal activity </h2><p>  Also, during the preliminary investigation, it was found that during the period from the summer of 2015 to April 2018, General Mamontov Alexander Sergeyevich, using his position by embezzlement in favor of third parties, embezzled 1,800,000 rubles from the regional budget of the Ministry of Emergencies.  This happened as a result of giving them a criminal order to hire fictitious persons to the position of fire inspectors, who were charged and issued wages for the indicated period. </p><p>  As part of the preliminary investigation, facts were uncovered that incontrovertibly proved that, before his arrest, Alexander Sergeyevich Mamontov, taking advantage of his official position, had taken steps to prevent the investigation of the fire in the “Winter Cherry” shopping and entertainment center.  So, the facts of hiding important information were revealed on his part.  For example, he gave orders to destroy the accounting base and other documentary materials.  The facts of falsification on his part of data on the occurrence and course of a fire in this shopping and entertainment center were also established. </p><p>  Moreover, trying to avoid responsibility, the Ministry of Emergency Situations General Alexander Mamontov during the investigation reported that the refusal of his department to check the "Winter Cherry" was actually legalized by order of the former head of the Russian Emergencies Ministry Puchkov dated September 12, 2016. </p><p>  Until now, Mamontov pleaded not guilty.  By court decision, he is in jail.  Its content there has been repeatedly extended. </p>
