For example, you can reimburse yourself part of the costs of some transactions and services.  Today we will be interested in the return of personal income tax for an apartment.  When is it possible?  What does that require?  And how long does it take to wait for the appropriate cash?  Answers to all these questions will be presented below.  With proper preliminary preparation, no difficulties will arise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="helpdol.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much will be returned as a deduction" class="if uuid-3141227" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3141227.jpg"></div><h2>  Definition </h2><p>  What is a personal income tax return for an apartment?  Before demanding something from the state, it is important to realize what a citizen can count on.  Otherwise, unjustified expectations are not ruled out. </p><p>  <span>Income</span> tax <span>refund</span> is called a tax deduction.  It allows you not to pay personal income tax or reimburse yourself part of the costs incurred for some services and transactions.  In our case, we are talking about the acquisition of real estate, in particular, housing. </p><h2>  Why you can claim a tax refund </h2><p>  When buying an apartment, personal income tax is far from always available.  Conversely, in some cases, people can count on two property deductions at once. </p><p>  When purchasing housing, citizens usually face: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  basic property deduction; </li><li>  mortgage repayment. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, if a person takes an apartment in a mortgage, he has the right to two refunds at once.  In the case of buying a home without a loan, the applicant will be offered only the main personal income tax deduction. </p><h2>  Refundable amount </h2><p>  What kind of amount can you expect in a particular case?  Unfortunately, giving a definite answer to this question is problematic. </p><p>  The thing is that the size of tax type deductions is 13 percent of the amounts prescribed in the relevant agreements.  But there are certain limitations.  Once they are achieved, the right to a tax refund will be lost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gov-news.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to apply for a property deduction" class="if uuid-3141229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3141229.jpg"></div><p>  To date, you can return for the purchase of housing: </p><ul><li>  260 000 rubles - in the form of the main property deduction; </li><li>  390,000 rubles - for mortgage interest. </li></ul><p>  There is nothing difficult to remember in the figures presented.  As soon as the indicated amounts are returned, a person will not be able to issue a refund for the purchase of housing. </p><p>  Calculation of funds is quite simple.  You can fill out a deduction application only for the amount of personal income tax paid in a given tax period.  As a result, by submitting documents for several years in a row, you can collect the required amount of cash. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Conditions for registration </h2><p>  The return of personal income tax when buying an apartment in a mortgage is not much different from the registration of the main property deduction.  These two operations are subject to the same conditions for their demand in authorized bodies. </p><p>  Not everyone who bought housing has the right to income tax refund for the relevant transaction.  To do this, you will need to make sure that the established requirements for filing tax type deductions are met. </p><p>  These include: </p><ul><li>  the applicant has Russian citizenship; </li><li>  the transaction for which they want to demand money has been completed on behalf of the potential applicant and for his money; </li><li>  the citizen has an official place of employment; </li><li>  a person requiring income tax reimbursement has income taxed by personal income tax in the amount of 13%; </li><li>  the applicant has a residence permit in the Russian Federation; </li><li>  the property for which you want to return the money is executed by a potential applicant. </li></ul><p>  It follows that the unemployed, as well as people working informally or recognized as retirees, cannot apply for a tax deduction.  But it is not so. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.libertymutual.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Filling tax deduction" class="if uuid-3141231" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3141231.jpg"></div><h2>  For pensioners and unemployed </h2><p>  An example of the return of personal income tax for an apartment will be presented later.  First you need to familiarize yourself with all the features and nuances of submitting applications to authorized bodies.  Otherwise, a person may simply be denied the appropriate service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Pensioners and the unemployed can also apply for a property tax deduction for the purchase of residential real estate.  They are entitled to the so-called transfer of personal income tax. </p><p>  In this case, when calculating the amounts returned for a real estate transaction, taxes that were paid for the last three years will be accepted.  The countdown starts from the moment the applicant appeals to the Federal Tax Service minus. </p><p>  This means that the right to reimburse expenses for real estate against income tax from a pensioner or simply a non-working citizen is abolished 36 months after the official dismissal.  It resumes immediately after the emergence of a new legal income taxed with 13% of personal income tax. </p><h2>  Entrepreneurship and returns </h2><p>  How to fill out 3-income tax return tax?  Buying an apartment is a transaction that entails significant costs.  And reimbursement of even thirteen percent of the corresponding expenses is an excellent state bonus.  Can entrepreneurs use it? </p><p>  Yes, but not always.  Typically, IPs work with special taxation regimes.  And the entrepreneur will only be entitled to personal income tax for the purchase of housing upon payment of 13 percent of income in the form of income tax.  Perhaps this is only on the basis. </p><p>  It follows that under special regimes, an entrepreneur will not be able to claim a tax deduction.  And not only for housing.  If you work on a common taxation system, there will be no refusal by the tax inspectorate. </p><h2>  Where to issue </h2><p>  Returning personal income tax when buying an apartment on a mortgage or without a loan is a long and laborious process.  Preparation for it takes a lot of time and effort. </p><p>  Where to apply for a tax deduction?  Ideally, you should contact the tax office at the place of registration of the citizen.  But you can submit the application in the established form to the MFC or the ‚Äúone-stop shop‚Äù service. </p><p>  Recently, in Russia, personal income tax compensation has become possible through the employer.  This technique is not in demand.  The thing is that when it is implemented, a person does not immediately receive a certain amount of deduction.  His salary will simply be exempt from personal income tax for the appropriate amount of money.  This option does not suit everyone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much will be returned for the purchase of housing" class="if uuid-3141230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3141230.jpg"></div><h2>  Time to call </h2><p>  <span>An application for the return of personal income tax</span> when buying an apartment must be submitted at a certain time.  Otherwise, you may be faced with a denial of the corresponding service. </p><p>  The limitation period for income tax refunds at the moment is only three years.  During this time, you can apply for the return of personal income tax for the purchase of housing or for other reasons. </p><p>  Moreover, you can request cash immediately for all 36 previous months.  This technique is often used when buying a home on a mortgage or in the case of registration of personal income tax for educational services. </p><h2>  Multiplicity of Requirements </h2><p>  Examples of personal income tax refunds when buying an apartment are discussed below.  They clearly demonstrate how much money and how you can return for a real estate transaction. </p><p>  How often can I contact the authorized services with relevant statements?  Endless variety.  Until the above limits on property deductions have been exhausted.  The main thing is to prepare a 3-personal income tax form.  Return for the apartment in the absence of such a document is impossible. </p><p>  In practice, people usually turn to the Federal Tax Service for returns for several years in a row.  But this does not mean that it will not be possible to file a tax refund more times. </p><h2>  Quick Guide - Go to the Federal Tax Service </h2><p>  How to make a deduction for housing?  It all depends on the specific situation.  Suppose that a person personally addresses an authorized body (MFC or Federal Tax Service) for a service. </p><p>  Then he needs to perform the following actions: </p><ol><li>  Prepare a specific set of documents for consideration of a deduction.  Its components vary depending on the specific case. </li><li>  Fill out the form 3-NDFL.  Refund for the purchase of an apartment without a tax return cannot be requested. </li><li>  Carry out the filling out of an application of a standard form for personal income tax refund. </li><li>  Submit an application with pre-prepared documents to the Federal Tax Service or the MFC at the place of registration of the applicant. </li><li>  Wait for a response from the tax authority regarding the provision of income tax reimbursement services. </li><li>  Wait for the transfer of money to the account indicated in the application. </li></ol><p>  It sounds like there is nothing difficult in the operation.  In fact, preparing for the registration of the return of personal income tax for an apartment is a lot of trouble.  This is especially true for the formation of a package of documents for the implementation of the task. </p><h2>  Main components </h2><p>  How to make an apartment purchase and tax refund take place?  3-NDFL - this is the form that should be filled in this case without fail.  You can‚Äôt do without tax reporting.  And what other documents will be useful for the implementation of the task? </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Deduction Application" class="if uuid-3141234" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3141234.jpg"></div><p>  In fact, there are not many.  The following documents will be useful for a person to return personal income tax when buying an apartment: </p><ul><li>  applicant's passport; </li><li>  statement of the established form; </li><li>  contract of sale or mortgage; </li><li>  extract from the USRN for housing; </li><li>  receipts confirming the fact of payment of funds for the transaction; </li><li>  income statements. </li></ul><p>  Without all this, the real estate buyer can not cope.  As already mentioned, you will have to come to the Federal Tax Service to fill out 3-personal income tax.  Return for the apartment in the absence of such a declaration will be impossible.  It will simply be refused. </p><h2>  For mortgage </h2><p>  So, income tax refund in Russia is a responsible process that requires great attention and preliminary preparation. </p><p>  The main documents for the return of personal income tax when buying an apartment, we reviewed.  In addition, most often it is necessary to provide an additional help package.  For example, when registering a property deduction for a mortgage, you need to take to the authorized body: </p><ul><li>  schedule for the payment of interest on a loan for property; </li><li>  checks and receipts evidencing the transfer of funds for a mortgage; </li><li>  bank statements. </li></ul><p>  As practice shows, registration of a mortgage repayment does not differ too much from the requirement of a usual property deduction.  You can immediately apply for both types of personal income tax refund. </p><h2>  If there is a family </h2><p>  People who have families will have to face more paperwork.  They need to prepare an additional list of documents. </p><p>  Typically, these include: </p><ul><li>  Marriage certificate; </li><li>  certificate of termination of marriage; </li><li>  birth certificates of all minor children; </li><li>  certificates of adoption; </li><li>  marriage agreement (if any). </li></ul><p>  In addition, you can bring to the authorized bodies documents indicating the fact of the use of personal funds during the transaction.  Then the right to property return will be only with the spouse whose money went to purchase a home.  Otherwise, both the wife and the husband have the appropriate powers. </p><h2>  Through employer </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the return of personal income tax for an apartment can be carried out through the employer.  This is not the most popular service, but it still exists. </p><p>  To take advantage of such a proposal, it is recommended to adhere to the following algorithm of actions: </p><ol><li>  To carry out the formation of a package of documents for registration of a tax deduction.  We have already familiarized ourselves with its possible components. </li><li>  Fill out the application in the prescribed form. </li><li>  Submit a request to the employer. </li></ol><p>  After that, if all the documents are filled out correctly, and also provided to the employer in a complete set, you can wait for the exemption of salary from income tax. </p><p>  Important: it is recommended to use this method with trusted employers. </p><h2>  Request Processing Time </h2><p>  Are you planning a return for the purchase of an apartment?  3-NDFL - that document that you must fill out yourself or contact a commercial company providing such services.  Such a tax return of a standard form is submitted to the Federal Tax Service in one copy. </p><p>  How fast is tax deduction?  This is far from the fastest operation.  It takes about 1.5-2 months to consider the application in the established form.  The same amount of time will pass before the transfer of money to the beneficiary's bank account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Form 3-NDFL" class="if uuid-3141232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3141232.jpg"></div><p>  In the case of registration of the deduction for housing through the employer, the process will take much less time - only one month.  But this technique is not too common in practice. </p><h2>  Can refuse </h2><p>  Is a return to the apartment executed?  3-NDFL completed and attached to the appropriate package of documents?  Then, most likely, the request will be satisfied.  But can they deny a tax deduction? </p><p>  Yes, but only if there are good reasons.  Such a decision must be justified in writing by the tax authorities. </p><p>  They can refuse a property deduction if: </p><ul><li>  an incomplete or invalid package of documents has been submitted; </li><li>  there is no tax return or it is framed with errors; </li><li>  the transaction is made on behalf of another person; </li><li>  the statute of limitations has passed; </li><li>  a citizen does not meet the established criteria under which the right to a deduction appears; </li><li>  the established limits on refunds for property have been exhausted. </li></ul><p>  What to do if a person is denied a tax deduction?  It all depends on the specific life situation.  Often, within a month, you can correct the cause of the refusal and re-apply to the Federal Tax Service minus.  In this case, you will not have to apply again for personal income tax. </p><h2>  About filling out a declaration </h2><p>  If you plan to issue a refund for the purchase of an apartment, 3-NDFL, as was emphasized earlier, must be filled out without fail.  This is a kind of income reporting form.  An established form can be requested from the Federal Tax Service or the MFC. </p><p>  It is better to use specialized programs to fill out the relevant document.  They help to quickly generate tax reporting in the form of 3-personal income tax when returning tax on an apartment and not only. </p><p>  Typically, to successfully complete the relevant document, you must specify: </p><ul><li>  Information about TIN and passport information; </li><li>  information from the certificate 2-NDFL, as well as other income of a person; </li><li>  data from payment documents for housing. </li></ul><p>  In addition, it is necessary to study the proposed code designations.  The purpose of the tax return will change depending on them.  There is nothing difficult about this. </p><h2>  Sample Declaration </h2><p>  We found out how a tax refund is made when buying an apartment.  3-PIT also learned to fill out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nalog-prosto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Filling out the 3-NDFL form" class="if uuid-3141228" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3141228.jpg"></div><p>  Above you can see a sample tax return and its completion.  If you encounter problems during the creation of the relevant document, you can, as indicated above, contact specialized private companies.  They will help you file a tax deduction for a fee, as well as generate reports in the form of 3-personal income tax. </p><h2>  After a response from the Federal Tax Service </h2><p>  But what if the citizen has already received a response from the tax authorities regarding the provision of a tax deduction?  You need to see what they decided in the Federal Tax Service. </p><p>  If the service is refused, you will have to study the reason for the corresponding decision.  If you can fix it, you should hurry.  The citizen will have only 30 days to correct the situation.  Otherwise, you will have to fill out an application from the very beginning.  And contact the Federal Tax Service, too. </p><p>  If the request for a tax deduction is approved, nothing is required.  Just be patient and wait.  In a few months, the deduction amount will be transferred to the bank account indicated in the application. </p><p>  Important: cash refund of personal income tax for the apartment is not issued. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  How to fill out 3-personal income tax for the purchase of an apartment?  The answer to this question will no longer make you think twice.  We reviewed an example of data entry into tax reporting. </p><p>  From now on, it is clear when and under what conditions it is possible to arrange a refund for the purchase of real estate.  This, with proper and timely preparation, will not be the most difficult operation.  It is recommended that you just start by filling out a 3-PIT declaration.  The return for the apartment after the creation of tax reporting will be carried out much faster and without serious difficulties. </p><p>  If a person does not have time or desire to independently apply to the authorities for the return of income tax, he can resort to the help of private intermediary companies.  Such organizations help to send requests to a variety of services and bodies for certain services.  Compensation of personal income tax is no exception.  True, this scenario is encountered as an exception.  Assistance in making deductions is usually a costly service.  And they often simply refuse it. </p><p>  It is important to note that only adult citizens can apply for personal income tax refunds. </p>
