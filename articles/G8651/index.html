  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Details on how to make a microphone from headphones</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many devices, such as telephones, computers, have a microphone for communication with other people and other purposes.  If the microphone is not included in the device‚Äôs package or if the user is not satisfied with the quality of the built-in microphone, then, as a rule, he or she purchases a stationary microphone separately.  But any device has the ability to break, then you have to look for a way out, so many will be curious to learn how to make a microphone from headphones. </p><h2>  Preparation for work </h2><p>  People, as practice shows, after the breakdown of a certain technique, often just throw it away and try to acquire a new one.  It's about headphones.  Do not rush to throw them ahead of time, because with this device you can make a microphone from the headphones for both a computer and a laptop.  Before starting work, it is necessary to make such blanks: </p><ol><li>  The most ordinary headphones, as an option, from the phone. </li><li>  3.5 mm jack (plug). </li><li>  Good wires. </li><li>  Soldering iron required power. </li><li>  Solder, rosin. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestbuy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="headphone with mic" class="if uuid-2733656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102620/2733656.jpg"></div><p>  There are two ways to make a microphone through headphones.  This work is not too complicated and not very time consuming. </p><h2>  First way </h2><p>  The question of how to make a microphone from headphones can arise at least for financial reasons or in urgent need to contact someone.  This solution is the best option.  So, first of all, you have to work with a soldering iron. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A two-wire cable is taken and soldered to the existing 3.5 mm plug.  It is necessary to treat the place of soldering of wires with rosin, apply a little solder and wait for setting.  It is necessary to achieve a good adhesion, if this is possible, you can proceed to the next step: </p><ol><li>  First you need to disassemble the headset itself on the headphones, it also contains a microphone along with a call acceptance button. </li><li>  Next, the other end of the two-wire wire is neatly soldered to this microphone. </li><li>  The main thing is not to overdo it with solder, otherwise the device may be damaged. </li><li>  At the end of the work, you must reassemble the headset. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.proaudioeurope.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="inside earphone" class="if uuid-2733657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102620/2733657.jpg"></div><p>  Having done everything step by step, as described above, without using the extra amount of solder, which can easily cause a short circuit, you should get a stationary microphone.  If everything is done correctly, then at the time of its connection to the computer you can hear characteristic clicks. </p><h2>  Second way </h2><p>  This method is simpler, requiring a minimum of effort and resources.  In order to make a microphone from headphones, you need to take a mobile phone and a Bluetooth adapter from a PC. </p><p>  Next, you need to establish a Bluetooth connection between the phone and the computer.  After that, by connecting the headset to the phone, you can get a temporary replacement for the microphone, but it is not recommended to constantly use this method. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hifitalo.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="speakers capable of becoming a microphone" class="if uuid-2733659" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102620/2733659.jpg"></div><p>  The disadvantage of this method is the unstable operation of the Bluetooth connection, which can easily be interrupted at the most inopportune moment, plus it greatly affects the battery charge of the phone, the level of which also needs to be constantly monitored.  Putting it on charge, you can partially solve this problem, but it will not be very convenient in terms of the abundance of wires. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Now, no one should have problems with how to make a microphone from the headphones.  As mentioned above, it is possible to make a temporary headset without much effort, while there is no way to purchase a new one.  Of course, talking about the good sound quality of such a microphone is not necessary, such devices will be inferior in many respects to the factory stationary headsets.  But if you have all the necessary details at hand, you can try to assemble a microphone.  Do not forget that the creation of such things helps to understand the principle of operation of many devices that we use every day.  Experiment and create! </p>
