The amount of road tax in Belarus</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Two years ago, transport tax rose in Belarus.  In the period 2014-2015  the base value, based on which this type of collection is calculated, increased by 20%, i.e. from 150 thousand <span>BYR (Belarusian rubles)</span> to 180 thousand.  In this regard, many car owners have a logical question: will the road tax increase in Belarus in the new year 2016?  Let's look at these indicators for various categories of citizens.  It should be noted right away that from January 1, 2016, the base value required for calculating this type of tax has increased again and now amounts to 210 thousand Belarusian rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="road tax in Belarus" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1221944.jpg" width="516"></div>

    <h2>  For individuals </h2><p>  For this category of citizens, the <span>road tax</span> in Belarus is, of course, primarily dependent on the type and weight of the vehicle. </p><p>  The most popular private car for individuals will have such indicators: </p><ul><li>  less (ÀÇ \ =) 1.5 tons - 3 explosives (basic values); </li><li>  weighing 1.5-2 tons - 6 BV; </li><li>  2-3 tons - this is as much as 8 base units; </li><li>  weighing more than 3 tons - 11 BV. </li></ul><p>  Those citizens who own trucks of varying degrees of carrying capacity can rely on such amounts: </p><ul><li>  no more than 2.5 tons - you have to lay out 8 basic values; </li><li>  weighing 2.5-3.5 tons - 17 BV; </li><li>  over 3.5 tons, but less than 12 tons - 22 basic quantities; </li><li>  weighing more than 12 tons - 25 quantities (base). </li></ul><p>  The same rates apply to utility vehicles.  Since 2016, a ‚Äúsolid‚Äù tariff of 20 BV will have to be paid for a truck tractor, regardless of its maximum permissible weight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Those who have trailers will also have to carefully weigh their <span>vehicle.</span> </p>

The owners of the so-called caravan trailers received a slight relief this year.  They will have to pay a fee of only 2 BV (before that there were 5).

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  This difference in tariffs by civil servants is explained by the fact that trailers of a larger mass are most likely used not for private needs, but for doing business.  Therefore, tax rates for them are quite high. </p><p>  Apparently, for the same reasons, a <span>toll was</span> established for bus owners.  True, it all depends on the number of seats: </p><ul><li>  ÀÇ 20 - 12 BV; </li><li>  21-40 "pull" already 17 basic units; </li><li>  ÀÉ 40 - this is as many as 22 quantities (base). </li></ul><p>  It is most beneficial for individuals to ride a motorcycle on the country's roads.  The road tax in Belarus for this type of transport will cost its owner only 2 base units per year. </p><h2>  For legal entities </h2><p>  Much worse in this matter to legal entities.  For them, of course, the road tax rates in Belarus are much higher.  So if you are the owner of an organization or enterprise, you probably should reconsider the need to maintain a large fleet of vehicles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How to pay </h2><p>  Most often, the amount of road tax in Belarus is levied on car owners during the vehicle inspection.  Depending on how old your car is and what category it belongs to, road tax can be paid according to this scheme: </p><ul><li>  once every 2 years; </li><li>  annually; </li><li>  twice a year. </li></ul><p>  Those motorists who are allowed to undergo vehicle inspection once every 2 years must pay a double toll. </p><h2>  Are there any benefits </h2><p>  Nevertheless, there are such categories of citizens, as well as vehicles for which the payment of road tax in Belarus is carried out at a reduced rate.  True, there are not so many of them: </p><ul><li>  medical care cars; </li><li>  transport of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Emergencies, the KGB, the Ministry of Defense and the State Border Committee; </li><li>  buses and trolleybuses (public transport). </li></ul><p>  It is important to note that starting from January 1, 2016, the 50% benefit previously set for retirees was canceled.  Now, a discount of half the fee is given only to WWII veterans, and only if there is a medical document confirming the applicant's suitability for driving a vehicle (in other words, if the veteran was able to undergo a medical examination), while a completely different person can actually manage the vehicle. </p><h2>  For taxi </h2><p>  Unfortunately, for this type of vehicles, no exemptions also appeared.  The size of the road tax in Belarus, according to the law, is paid by taxi drivers twice a year, because it is exactly how many times they must undergo inspection.  Tax rates are determined based on the actual mass of the vehicle specified in the data sheet. </p><h2>  When money can be returned </h2>

Such an action is regulated by article 259 of the Tax Code of the Republic of Belarus.  A partial or full refund of the transport tax can be made if:

Moreover, if, for example, in June of the same year you purchase a new car, you will have to pay the transport tax again. </p><h2>  Where the money will go </h2><p>  Officials traditionally explain the considerable cost of the road tax in Belarus by the fact that the money collected will go in full for the construction of new state roads, as well as for the repair of existing pavement.  This is quite difficult to believe, because the highway and highways from Minsk to regional centers, as well as secondary roads have not been modernized for a long time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amount of road tax in Belarus" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1221943.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is assumed that this year the road funds received from the collection of duties will be equally divided between the local and republican budgets.  But so far these are only plans.  Today, all the money received as a result of the collection of transport duties is accumulated in the republican budget.  It is there that they decide which roads and when to repair.  The manager of accumulated funds is the Ministry of Transport of the Republic of Belarus. </p>
