    <h2>  Design of the Summer Hotel </h2><p>  The hotel building is an example of modern style: it is a small rectangular building with panoramic windows overlooking a delightful beach.  The interior design can be described as eclectic: a combination of modern elements, such as minimalist furniture of the correct form, simple layout and elegant decorative objects (chandeliers, paintings, mirrors in openwork frames) make the hotel really interesting and charming. </p><p>  The most beautiful and magnificent place in the hotel is the restaurant.  The spacious hall with high ceilings and panoramic windows is designed in the best restaurant traditions.  Walls and floors are white - nothing distracts from eating food.  But in order to somehow dilute this whiteness, the designers decided to hang burgundy curtains on the windows.  The furniture in the hall is massive, wooden, which contrasts perfectly, again, with the lightness and airiness of the hall.  In this room I want to be for a long time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The corridors are also designed very reasonably: the color scheme is calm, using natural wood colors and natural materials (of course, wood).  The rooms open onto a cozy terrace in similar traditions, but there are also very comfortable armchairs here: you can sit in the evening and enjoy the stars. </p>
