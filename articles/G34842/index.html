This is one of the oldest states with a rich history and deep traditions.  The country is considered the world center of Buddhism with unique monuments.  In order to see them, you need to know where Sri Lanka is.  This is a small island that spreads in the Indian Ocean, just 800 kilometers from the equator.  He has all the wealth inherent in the tropical islands.  The islanders value a religion whose philosophy completely envelops the lives of people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is sri lanka" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/97953.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In order to find out where Sri Lanka is located, you first need to look at the map.  ‚ÄúBlessed Land‚Äù - this is the name of this island in Sanskrit translation.  The full name of the country is the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.  However, this name appeared only in 1972, and before that the island was called Ceylon.  The official capital of the country is considered to be Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, but all residents consider the city of Colombo the actual capital.  Sri Lanka is a country that keeps many secrets and mysteries.  To this day, scientists and archaeologists cannot explain the origin of many finds found during excavations on the island.  But they all adhere to the version that on the island there was an ancient civilization with special knowledge and abilities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now that you know where Sri Lanka is, it's time to talk about tourism in this country.  Over the years, this island has enjoyed great popularity among European travelers.  But during the thirty-year internal conflict, the number of tourists to this country has significantly decreased.  After the war ended in 2010, tourism began to gain momentum again.  So, according to statistics, during 2010 the flow of tourists increased by 46% compared with 2009.  And by the end of 2011, this number doubled.  This happened because the tourist destination in Sri Lanka has a triple advantage: the authenticity of tourism, the compactness of the island and the unique variety of offers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="last minute trips sri lanka" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/97950.jpg" width="600"></div>

Mount Lavinia Beach is located on the west coast, located 12 kilometers south of Colombo.  Kalutara lies 30 kilometers further, and in the opposite direction, 35 kilometers from Colombo, is Negombo.  There are 8 beaches on the south coast, the closest to the capital is Bentota, and the most distant is Tangalle.  The east coast is occupied by Arugama Bay, the famous Trincomalee, Nilawelli and Uppuveli beaches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For those who think that vacationing on the island is expensive, you can look for last minute packages.  Sri Lanka is an island with unique attractions that you need to see with your own eyes.  The official capital of the country offers tourists to visit magnificent temples and churches.  Buddhist monasteries such as Gotami and Vihara are also noteworthy.  In the actual capital, it is recommended to visit the Gangaramaya Buddhist temple, the Jami Ul Alfar mosque.
