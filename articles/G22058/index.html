For some this is a dream, for others it is an inevitable reality.  Someone wants to quickly pay it off, and someone recently paid it and is going to take more.  The package of documents for a mortgage loan is the same as for a regular consumer. </p><p>  It is not uncommon for an employer to pay cash to an employee without fixing the real salary in official documents.  What if you need to take a mortgage, and the official salary is small?  How to confirm real income?  What to do to clients who work on two or more jobs informally?  What confirmation of wages will a financial institution accept?  This is our article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shopping-cart-reviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gazprombank mortgage certificate in the form of a bank" class="if uuid-3015450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99771/3015450.jpg"></div><h2>  How to calculate income </h2><p>  A certificate on the form of the bank for a mortgage is needed in the case when official income, confirmed by document 2-NDFL, is not enough.  How to determine the adequacy of the amount of wages to obtain a mortgage? </p><p>  Firstly, the amount of the cash loan that the bank approves depends on the amount of free cash that will remain with the person after paying the debt.  The monthly subsistence minimum and monthly mandatory expenses are deducted from the amount of income confirmed by the client.  So it turns out the amount that the client can pay for the mortgage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Secondly, it should be remembered that the income is calculated taking into account the minor children of the client, the presence of the co-borrower and guarantors.  It turns out that to determine exactly whether there is enough income to get a mortgage is quite problematic.  Each bank is individual in terms of settlements. </p><p>  There is one piece of advice.  To obtain a wide range of opportunities and the right to choose, it is better for the client to provide proof of all available income.  Therefore, a certificate in the form of a bank for a mortgage is necessary so as not to bind the client with limited credit conditions.  Not everyone knows what the help form looks like. </p><p>  The photo shows a sample certificate in the form of a bank for a mortgage "Agricultural Bank". </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Help for Russian Agricultural Bank" class="if uuid-3010416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99771/3010416.jpg"></div><h2>  What is the help for? </h2><p>  The bank form provides for a complete and reliable receipt of information about the informal salary of the client.  Most people who come across this document for the first time are concerned that the data will be transferred to the tax office.  Then you have to pay income tax on all charges.  In this case, the employer can write a huge fine. </p><p>  Fears in this case are completely in vain.  The bank does not have the authority to distribute personal financial information that the client provides.  For disclosing trade secrets to the bank (as an organization) and some of its employees face a fine, revocation of the license and punishment, up to and including imprisonment.  The certificate on the form of the bank was created to help borrowers, as the economic situation in the country is very unstable.  Many firms, avoiding taxes, issue wages according to the "gray" scheme. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  For employer </h2><p>  The main problem in obtaining a certificate in the form of a bank for a mortgage is the refusal of the management of the company where the loan applicant is employed to issue it.  Accountants and executives of employers fear data transfer to the tax office.  For loans, for example, to obtain a mortgage, a certificate in the form of a bank was specially invented.  It exists in order to increase the chances of the applicant to approve the loan.  The amount that the applicant asks the financial institution directly depends on what there is confirmed information about the client‚Äôs income.  In case of problems with issuing a certificate at work, a link to article 62 of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation will help.  According to this article, documents confirming income, the organization must provide no later than three days from the date of request.  Of course, quarreling with the employer is not recommended if he does not want to draw up the necessary document.  Below we consider the main points of filling out a certificate in the form of a bank. </p><h2>  Employer details </h2><p>  For example, consider the help on the form of a bank for VTB mortgages.  The name of the employer is written in full, as indicated in the legal documents of the company.  The brand or logo is not required.  The address (legal and actual) is registered in full.  Sometimes it is required to enter the full name in the certificate  direct manager and his phone number.  This information must also be provided.  Particular attention should be paid to the line with the phone number of the organization.  It is required to provide a fixed number.  You can specify a mobile phone if a landline telephone is also written with it.  TIN, PSRN, KPP of a legal entity must also be indicated in full. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the photo below, a certificate for a mortgage in the form of a VTB bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="VTB mortgage certificate in the form of a bank" class="if uuid-3021195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/3021195.jpg"></div><h2>  Applicant Data </h2><p>  FULL NAME.  the employee is indicated in the certificate in full.  Date of birth must match passport.  Often in the certificate appears the position of the employee and his seniority in the organization.  These lines should not be skipped, they should completely repeat the records of the work book. </p><h2>  Wage </h2><p>  In a special table, the accountant of the company must indicate in full the amount that the employee receives monthly.  In a separate line, the year of accrual and the month are prescribed.  Next is written the amount received by the employee in the specified month.  It is indicated in numbers.  At the end is written "total" and the total amount for the past period.  The information provided in the salary certificate will be checked for compliance with reality.  Income is compared with the average earnings in the region for people with the same profession.  Therefore, it must be specified real.  It is not necessary to prescribe the amount more than it actually is. </p><p>  In the photo below, an example of income indications in the certificate on the bank form for a mortgage from Alfa Bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Mortgage with a certificate in the form of a bank" class="if uuid-3021206" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/3021206.jpg"></div><h2>  Decor </h2><p>  The period for which wages are indicated must be at least 6 months.  In some cases, it is possible to issue a certificate for 4 months, if the experience in the organization is not enough.  For the bank, filling out the maximum possible period (within the table) is a priority. </p><p>  Attention should be paid to the lines with the signatures of the accountant and the head of the organization.  If this is the same person, banks recommend that you attach a copy of the order on the appointment of this person to the position of chief accountant.  If the head and the chief accountant are different people, there should be two signatures.  Both with decryption. </p><p>  You can take a certificate in the form of a bank for a mortgage (sample) directly at the branch or print from the website of a specific financial institution. </p><p>  The document is certified by the round seal of the employing organization.  Facsimile or organization stamp is prohibited. </p><p>  A sample certificate in the form of a bank for a mortgage from Sberbank is located on the website of a financial institution.  Detailed instructions for filling are attached to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="myrooms.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mortgage information on the form of the bank which banks" class="if uuid-3020447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99771/3020447.jpg"></div><h2>  Verification Procedure </h2><p>  How is the verification of the submitted document carried out?  The authenticity and reliability of the data specified for the mortgage in the certificate in the form of the bank is checked in several stages.  The scoring system processes information about the details of the employing company and the data of the employee-applicant for a mortgage loan.  The information provided by the client makes its way through the databases and state registers (looking for compliance).  Thus, it becomes clear whether the organization indicated in the certificate really exists and whether it conducts activities. </p><p>  The next to begin the inspection of the loan officer.  Its task is to determine whether the amount of income declared by the client actually corresponds.  The inspector checks the questionnaire, the data from which must completely match the information from the certificate.  In the application form, which is initially filled out by the loan applicant when applying for a mortgage, the salary is indicated in full.  It must correspond to the amount in the certificate on the form of the bank.  Discrepancies in the data provided by the borrower himself may lead the loan officer to think that the information is not true. </p><p>  Pay attention to the appearance of the help.  Corrections, strikeouts are not allowed.  Data should be formatted in accordance with the information fields.  Authentication of print  In 99% of cases, the loan officer makes a call on the numbers indicated in the certificate.  The work number clarifies information on whether the applicant really works in the company, whether the position and length of service coincide.  It will be appropriate to warn employees who answer by phone that the bank will call in order to confirm the data.  If the loan officer cannot reach the employer, the application is rejected or freezes until the telephone becomes available. </p><p>  A sample certificate in the form of a bank for a mortgage from Gazprombank, for example, is distinguished by the requirement for detailed information about the organization.  Filling it requires accuracy and accuracy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="boldheart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Rosselkhozbank&quot; certificate in the form of a bank for a mortgage" class="if uuid-3020450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99771/3020450.jpg"></div><h2>  How to do without help </h2><p>  Not all potential borrowers have time to collect a complete set of documents.  In most cases, if the client cannot provide a certificate in the form of a bank for a mortgage, this is the fault of the employing company, because the company is afraid to disclose information about the unofficial income of employees.  How to act in such a situation?  Some large Russian banks have developed programs for the acquisition of housing with the provision of only two documents.  The applicant is required to bring a passport and SNILS or driver's license. </p><p>  What is the minus of the programs that allow you to avoid submitting a certificate in the form of a bank for a mortgage when submitting documents?  Which banks provide this opportunity? </p><p>  The main minus is the increase in interest rates.  Banks take risks by trusting a client with unconfirmed income.  For this they take compensation in the form of an increased percentage. </p><p>  The second minus is the increased down payment.  A guarantee of the solvency of the future borrower becomes a large amount (30-40% of the cost of housing). </p><h2>  Registration of a mortgage on two documents </h2><p>  Banks that agree to such conditions: </p><ul><li>  Tinkoff  From 15% down payment, interest rate from 6% to 14%, which depends on the type of property purchased. </li><li>  VTB.  From 40% down payment for the purchase of secondary housing and 30% for the purchase of primary housing, the rate of 9.6%. </li><li>  Sberbank  From 40% installment and an additional 0.5% to the base rate. </li><li>  Gazprombank.  From 40% installment, rate from 10.2%. </li><li>  Russian Agricultural Bank.  From 40% down payment, rate from 9, 35%. </li><li>  "Alfa Bank".  Down payment of at least 50%.  Rate from 9.79%. </li><li>  "Deltacredit."  40% installment and 8, 25% rate. </li><li>  Transcapitalbank.  Down payment 30%, rate 8.2%.  This financial institution has a limit on the amount of the mortgage.  For Moscow and St. Petersburg it is 12 million rubles, and for residents of other settlements - 5 million rubles. </li><li>  Uralsib.  40% installment and 9.4% rate. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.fortunebuilders.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Information on Sberbank mortgage bank form" class="if uuid-3015457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99771/3015457.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  A mortgage with a certificate in the form of a bank is possible if the document is executed in accordance with all the rules.  It is important to remember that you should not try to give a fake certificate to the bank.  There are ads on the Internet and other sources with a proposal for several thousand rubles to produce a document with any desired amount.  A copy of the work book is also included.  Such certificates will not pass the test.  Mortgage inspectors work carefully, the information is checked for accuracy thoroughly.  If inconsistencies are found, the fraudulent client may be blocked on all channels for future loan processing, and it is even possible to transfer the case to the police.  In case of suspicion of fraud, the application will go into denial with a special code that will block the client from receiving any loan for life. </p>
