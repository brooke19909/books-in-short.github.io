It will be difficult for people with a tight physique to wash themselves.  Hot water is not always in the evenings. </li><li>  The Internet only works at the reception.  But even here its speed is very low. </li><li>  Many flies and mosquitoes.  Ants crawl in the rooms, sometimes cockroaches are also found. </li><li>  There are very few fruits.  They are given in batches.  For example, a slice of watermelon, a few peaches or oranges. </li><li>  The cleaning is very mediocre.  The maids only brush off the beds and wipe the floor.  Towels and bed linen are washed, sometimes they have sewn holes and stains. </li><li>  Near the bar it is very noisy in the evenings. </li><li>  Inadequate hostess of the hotel, which can easily cheat guests, scream at them.  Solving problems with her is very difficult. </li><li>  There are no elevators in the buildings, but there are quite a few stairs everywhere.  It is not recommended to rest here for people with sore feet. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This is not to say that the hotel will be your ideal place to relax.  Reviews of the Pefkos Garden Hotel 3 * are often negative, and some tourists are advised not to stay here.  But the complex is suitable for those people who are looking for a very inexpensive vacation in Greece, for couples with children, as well as older people.  But still, if you have extra money, then you should choose another hotel. </p>
