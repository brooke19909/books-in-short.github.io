The former are attracted by the beauty of local nature, the abundance of fish, the cleanest ponds.  Second - many secrets and legends associated with the origin of these lakes.  That is why these edges are so popular. </p><p>  The Five Lakes system (Omsk Region) combines such reservoirs as Linevo, Danilovo, Shchuchye, Urmannoe (Shaitan Lake), as well as Potenoe.  Their arrangement is unusual - all are elongated in the same direction and are adjacent to each other.  Therefore, it has long been assumed that once fragments from one meteorite fell into this place, leaving deep traces that were subsequently filled with water.  There is also an opinion that water in all reservoirs is divided into “living” and “dead”, and if you swim in both, you can heal any ailments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="five lakes Omsk region" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1166229.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lurking Lake </h2><p>  Submerged - this is the fifth body of water that is included in the Five Lakes system (Omsk Region).  This place is little known and mysterious.  The location is known only from the legends that determine its location on the right bank of the Tara River.  It is supposedly located 250 meters from the coast, has smooth round shapes, and the lake is shown to the eyes of only a select few.  However, there is no reliable information about its existence. </p><p>  The Five Lakes system leaves no one indifferent.  Tourists note the stunning air with which the lungs are overflowing, a unique nature: clear and healing water, dense forests, where, as in a fairy tale, you can collect full baskets of mushrooms and berries.  The friendly local population is intriguing with riddles and legends, and for anglers there is a paradise. </p>
