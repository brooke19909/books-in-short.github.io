    <h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Since today many people choosing a hotel, including in Turkey, consider it necessary to find out the opinions of those tourists who have already been there, we can summarize the reviews of Russians staying in this complex.  In general, we can say that it is fully consistent with its declared category and cost of living. </p><p>  However, according to some vacationers, Sun Maris City 3 * (Turkey) - reviews speak about it quite eloquently - are more suitable for unassuming and inexperienced travelers or those who come to Turkey for the first time. </p><p>  Regarding the numbers, the Russians basically have no complaints.  All the rooms, although relatively small, are comfortable enough and furnished for a minimum of comfort.  There are no complaints about breakdowns of the air conditioner or plumbing.  The vast majority of holidaymakers at this hotel leave only positive feedback on the quality and regularity of cleaning the rooms, regardless of whether the maids leave a tip or not.  Moreover, for one dollar on return you can find funny figures from towels on the bed. </p>

    <p>  According to them, for lunch or dinner you need to come very early: to the very opening of the restaurant, because otherwise there may not be enough meat dishes.  In addition, discontent was caused by the fact that for food that the cooks themselves lay out in portions of the guests themselves, they had to stand in long lines. </p><p>  Another part of the tourists finds the menu quite acceptable, especially for a three-star hotel.  Many note in their reviews that the manager, along with the administrators, has breakfast and dinner several times a week in the main restaurant with the guests.  This indicates that the management is attentive to the quality of the food offered, thus controlling the operation of the kitchen. </p>

At the same time, <span>beach towels</span> must be paid.  But there is a way out: upon check-in, you can immediately redeem the right to use the kit for the entire stay.  The very same beach, the vast majority of Russians find it very good.  It is completely covered with sand, has a gentle and comfortable entry into the sea.  Many appreciated that to the beach from the hotel - a maximum of five minutes leisurely move.

    <p>  The vast majority of tourists speak very positively about the work of the service staff, although some compatriots are a little annoyed by the fact that most employees do not understand the Russian language.  But the staff is fluent in English. </p><p>  In general, most of the guests of this three-star hotel are Europeans (Swedes, Germans), as well as residents of post-Soviet countries.  There are not so many Russians here as in other <span>cities of Turkey.</span> </p>
