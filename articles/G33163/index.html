According to reviews, the terms and conditions of Binbank credit cards are simple and understandable to everyone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.fpl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="binbank credit card reviews" class="if uuid-3211003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3211003.jpg"></div><h2>  Platinum card </h2><p>  This plastic is a universal type of release, it is related to the ‚ÄúVisa‚Äù or ‚ÄúMastercard‚Äù.  It is inexpensive to service, just fifty rubles a month.  For owners of deposits and pensioners, the use of the card is free of charge.  Other release options are: </p><ul><li>  The rate of twenty-nine percent per year. </li><li>  The credit limit is from fifteen to thirty thousand rubles. </li><li>  Write-off with the commission is four percent, and cashback reaches five. </li><li>  The grace period without interest is fifty-seven days. </li><li>  Repayment of debt on the loan is based on five percent of the amount and charges. </li></ul><p>  The feedback from the owners of the Binbank platinum card is mostly positive. </p><h2>  SVO Club Card </h2><p>  The increased bonus is supposed to be an SVO Club credit card.  A feature of this plastic is the ability to return bonuses of up to five percent spent.  Further, borrowers can spend bonuses on settlements with hotels, air carriers, car rental companies. </p><p>  Customer reviews of Binbank credit cards will be presented at the end of the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="marketingland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="binbank credit cards work reviews" class="if uuid-3211009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3211009.jpg"></div><p>  The characteristics of lending are as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  The limit of funds is not more than thirty thousand rubles. </li><li>  The interest-free period is fifty-seven days. </li><li>  Against the background of spending more than twenty-five thousand, they do not charge for service. </li><li>  Bonuses return up to five percent of the spent. </li><li>  Fee for writing off zero rubles at ATMs of any financial organizations. </li></ul><p>  In the role of additional bonuses the borrower expects: </p><ul><li>  Providing free car parking at a secure site in Sheremetyevo for seven days. </li><li>  Ten percent discount on duty free. </li><li>  Special offers from partner hotel and restaurant chains.  They also collect a large number of positive reviews. </li></ul><h2>  Credit Card Terms </h2><p>  Consider the conditions of Binbank credit cards.  According to reviews, they are quite simple: you just need to come to a nearby office to submit an application with supporting documentation.  In the event that the client has an excellent credit history and meets all the available criteria of the creditor, a positive decision is made on the issue.  In the process of obtaining plastic, it is necessary to check with the manager how to use a Binbank credit card with maximum benefit.  When issuing, the following issues are specified: </p><ul><li>  Use of grace period along with repayment rules. </li><li>  The consequence of non-payment of the amount of monthly payments. </li><li>  Conditions for withdrawal. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.gobankingrates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="binbank credit cards employee reviews" class="if uuid-3211005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3211005.jpg"></div><p>  Most proposals for the production of plastic imply the right to interest-free use by borrowed funds during the first fifty-seven days with mandatory repayment by the end of the term.  The loan interest is charged for all the time used, if the borrower did not manage to fill up the balance by the end of the 57-day period. </p><h2>  Payment calculation </h2><p>  The size of the payment is calculated on the basis of the borrowed amounts used at least five percent of the amount of debt and interest, which is charged at the rate established by the financial institution.  The minimum payment may not be less than three hundred rubles per month.  You should be careful to comply with the schedule, since if you violate the repayment rules, a twenty percent penalty on the amount of debt that exceeds two thousand rubles is charged. </p><p>  It is better to familiarize yourself with reviews of Binbank credit cards in advance. </p><h2>  The process of issuing a credit card </h2><p>  In order to file an application for such plastic, it is not necessary to go to the office itself, the fact is that a preliminary request can also be submitted online using the form on the official website of a financial organization.  In the event that Binbank has agreed to issue a credit card, receipt can be arranged through the delivery service by post or courier, if the limits of funds are not high.  According to credit card reviews of Binbank CJSC, this is very convenient. </p><h2>  Borrower Requirements </h2><p>  Those citizens who meet the established parameters of this bank can get plastic with borrowed limits, for example: </p><ul><li>  Age over twenty-two years, but not more than sixty-four years at the time of release. </li><li>  The presence of a reliable reputation of the payer, confirmed by an extract from the BCI (we are talking about the absence of arrears and bad debt in the past). </li><li>  In the last place you need to work from three months. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.deserve.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jsc binbank credit cards reviews" class="if uuid-3211007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3211007.jpg"></div><h2>  List of documents </h2><p>  You can conclude an agreement on a Binbank credit card at any branch of this financial institution, having previously prepared the following documentation: a civil passport along with driving rights and a certificate of income.  In addition, a passport with documents proving the presence of real estate is submitted. </p><h2>  Credit Plastic Cash Withdrawals and Top-ups </h2><p>  In the event that the conditions for issuing a free cash withdrawal are not expected, the standard debit card scheme is used, it is as follows: </p><ul><li>  The minimum commission is three hundred rubles. </li><li>  Against the background of cashing out larger amounts, they charge four percent. </li></ul><p>  When a client withdraws funds that are stored on the credit card balance, cash is received without commissions, and in the third-party device of any other financial institution, withdrawal of one‚Äôs own savings takes place with a charge of one percent.  For replenishment, the following options are provided: </p><ul><li>  Online replenishment from any other account. </li><li>  By means of a card of another issuer through self-service devices. </li><li>  At the box office of the bank. </li><li>  Through the native terminals of a financial institution. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="blog.equifax.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="binbank credit card customer reviews" class="if uuid-3211006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3211006.jpg"></div><p>  Credit plastic from Binbank is in great demand among borrowers with different levels of needs: in addition to the standard option of issuing, there are special programs that are designed for specific needs of people and provide increased comfort in service along with free cashing, various discounts and bonuses from partners.  This is confirmed by reviews. </p><h2>  Is it worth opening a Binbank credit card? </h2><p>  With the help of cards, this bank provides a revolving loan for use on standard terms, that is, guarantors are not required, and so on.  One of the positive aspects of such an instrument is the short term of processing and applying a loan without interest payments, if you manage to pay off your debts until the grace period passes.  The question of whether it is advisable to open a credit card to this financial organization should be answered positively.  Binbank plastic has a number of the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  Customers can pay for services and purchases at various retail and entertainment outlets without commissions and interest, as well as cellular communications with television and so on. </li><li>  While abroad, you can always transfer money from a card to the account of any citizen located in Russia.  Credit plastic delivers information via SMS notification.  The information consists in the operations performed.  It is also possible once a month to receive an account statement by e-mail.  You can issue additional cards for loved ones. </li></ul><p>  Next, find out what the customers themselves are talking about this financial institution and its credit services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bankrate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="binbank credit card reviews" class="if uuid-3211011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3211011.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews on the Bank and on Binbank Credit Cards </h2><p>  People write that they don‚Äôt like the fact that formally the annual maintenance of plastic is free, but in fact the purchase of insurance from 700 rubles a year is an obligatory condition for obtaining some cards.  Thus, the free service for a number of offers is, in the long run, a marketing move. </p><p>  According to reviews, the benefits of Binbank credit cards include a cashback scheme, which assumes a one percent return on everything.  The disadvantages are the inaccuracy of information about payments with the absence of the amount of sales of grace periods and the minimum payments in your account. </p><p>  Other opinions in Binbank credit card reviews are also available.  Customers write that they are satisfied with the bonus program and the low price for servicing credit cards.  But it is worth noting that there are still more negative reviews about credit cards and the work of Binbank.  And very often people mention that there is a large list of cashback exceptions, there are very few branches, there are incompetent employees, conditions are not always met, and a fairly long examination of claims is noted. </p><p>  Additionally, customers complain about false advertising, imposing a loan, high interest and commissions, and in addition, non-working ATMs and terminals, a dead site and accounts separately from the card. </p><p>  Reviews of Binbank employees about credit cards are also available.  Plastic is in demand among customers, the terms of service are simple and understandable.  Although sometimes there are controversial points about calculating interest or charging a commission. </p><p>  Thus, this bank is quite popular today and has a rather impressive client base, but, unfortunately, many are not happy with its services. </p>
