  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Beautiful DIY crafts for the home</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Give your home a special style with your own things.  Praise and honor to a person who knows how to decorate his house with unique objects created by himself.  It is valuable, status and very fashionable in modern society.  In the old days, most of the household items were made by the owners: this is very important, given the energy that the things that surround us daily carry. </p><p>  In our crazy time, not everyone can afford to create something for their own pleasure, having spent their precious time on it.  Crafts for the home with their own hands - a simple, but inaccessible to most working people occupation.  Day after day they rush rapidly, and the average person has less time for rest and creativity.  For this reason, handmade items have become a luxury, they are highly valued and are a great option for decorating any interior.  And this is justified, because the things of the man-made world are completely original and unique. </p><p>  Today, we will also try to create something unique at home - crafts from improvised materials.  But first, it's worth getting acquainted with the wonderful world of hand-made in the field of household goods and interior design. </p><p>  What homegrown craftsmen will not do!  Key holders, hot coasters, candle holders and candles, watches, rugs and furniture, curtain hooks, various organizers, wall panels and many other beautiful and practical gizmos. </p><h2>  Handmade Miracles </h2><p>  There are people who throughout their life accumulate a certain creative energy, producing simply amazing results.  Such unique people create how they breathe, and they cannot stop this process, because it becomes practically physiologically necessary, saturating with strength and energy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A master lives in each of us, so it‚Äôs important to do manual labor in order to find ourselves, to relieve stress, to inspire ourselves and to inspire others, and all kinds of different things because ... Let's not try to create something grandiose and large-scale, but let's start from small.  Perhaps a fire will ignite from this spark that will warm your soul and fill you with vitality in exchange for your creativity. </p><h2>  Idea number 1.  We organize space competently </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.handmadecharlotte.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jeans organizer" class="if uuid-2421880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2421880.jpg"></div><p>  Each house is home to thousands of small items that strive to occupy the entire space, introducing mess and chaos.  It is possible to stop this process.  An excellent solution to the problem is to create an organizer (or maybe a whole series, united by a single style).  This is the first thing that could lead the heading "DIY do-it-yourself fabric crafts." </p><p>  Plastic, glass, cardboard and textile assistants will organize everything: in the kitchen, in the living room, in the hallway, on the desktop, in the bathroom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="remote control owl" class="if uuid-2422445" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2422445.jpg"></div><p>  A special option for storing a "vital" household utensil - a remote control from the TV - is an organizer in the form of a soft toy.  To acquire such an accessory, it is not necessary to be able to sew soft toys.  It is enough to sew a pocket to a finished toy or a decorative sofa pillow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another option for storing and placing items on the couch is in the following photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sofa organizer" class="if uuid-2422524" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2422524.jpg"></div><p>  To make such a stand is not difficult, but it is pleasant and convenient to use. </p><h2>  Idea number 2.  Stands for hot and cold </h2><p>  A simple and very original little thing can be made from <span>corks from wine</span> or champagne. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.diynetwork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cork stand" class="if uuid-2422590" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2422590.jpg"></div><p>  A great option for DIY crafts for home.  A stand for a hot mug of coffee or a glass of wine - such a thing is both beautiful and practical.  It will also look good in a kit of its own kind. </p><p>  Bottle caps are universal material, it makes kitchen panels, key holders, paintings, carpets, animal figures, people, houses, Christmas wreaths, decorative letters, hearts, balls, vases, bottle coasters, photo frames, chandeliers, key rings and much more . </p><h2>  Idea number 3.  Candlesticks and Vases </h2><p>  The idea is old, but its implementation in a new way can lead to very unusual results.  Candlesticks made of wood or other eco-material look amazing.  <span>Hand-made crafts for the home will</span> warm you with warmth and comfort in the evenings in the family circle.  A great option as a gift for your loved ones, you can make it with your children and give it to grandparents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="sparkandchemistry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="candlesticks with leaf decor" class="if uuid-2427068" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2427068.jpg"></div><p>  There are many options: candle holders with decor from photographs, aged newspapers or notes, with a pattern made of stained glass paints, candle holders from citrus and decorative pumpkins, from shells, from glass jars (using stencils, spray cans and decorative adhesive tape), plastic bottles, cans, gypsum and even ice.  By the way, the last option is just a fabulous gift for any winter holiday. </p><div class="photo" data-original="r.search.yahoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ice candle holder" class="if uuid-2427019" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2427019.jpg"></div><p>  Vases decorated using the decoupage technique with a painting or decor made of polymer clay look elegant.  A simple glass vase can be changed beyond recognition by combining various techniques and materials. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dihiz.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="candlesticks and vases" class="if uuid-2427104" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2427104.jpg"></div><h2>  Idea number 4.  Homemade key holders </h2><p>  The need for such a wonderful thing as a housekeeper is recognized only when the key is lost in pockets, bags or disappears in the wilds of the apartment, which gives the whole family some discomfort.  Not everyone is accustomed to this wonderful thing, but it is certainly worth a try. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="key organizer" class="if uuid-2421885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2421885.jpg"></div><p>  The housekeeper, made by oneself, is a peculiar charm of the home and a unique element of the interior of the apartment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.solid-state-studios.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorative key holder" class="if uuid-2427155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2427155.jpg"></div><p>  It is very simple to make such an DIY homework: a few decorative elements plus hook holders. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.homedit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="frame housekeeper" class="if uuid-2427199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2427199.jpg"></div><p>  A key holder made on the basis of a photo frame or a branch of an intricately curved shape will look creative. </p><h2>  Idea number 5.  We make a rug of sea stones </h2><p>  The idea is awesome, for the reason that, in addition to aesthetic pleasure, such a thing has a healing effect - massage.  Such a carpet will fit perfectly into the bathroom, it is functional and beautiful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rug made of stones" class="if uuid-2422147" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2422147.jpg"></div><p>  To create this rug, you will need a certain amount of round-shaped stones of various sizes, a solid base like linoleum, and strong fixation glue.  Firmly lay the stones on the base, previously fixing with glue.  When the product dries, you can begin to operate.  Perhaps this is a fairly fresh version of the do-it-yourself diy for the home, all the novelties of the needlework world await you in this article below. </p><h2>  Idea number 6.  Grips for curtains </h2><p>  This element is not customary to highlight in the interior; it comes complete with curtains or is completely absent.  And, meanwhile, if you take its creation creatively, you can change the whole space, creating a unique effect. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="curtain hold" class="if uuid-2427301" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2427301.jpg"></div><p>  This is how a simple accessory can revitalize the interior, surprise guests and delight loved ones.  Grips <span>for curtains</span> made of textile flowers (chiffon, linen, knitwear) look gentle and romantic, collecting them in inflorescences, you can change the style of your bedroom or decorate a nursery for a girl. </p><h2>  Idea number 7.  Creative shelves out of stuff </h2><p>  Crafts for the home with their own hands from improvised objects are just that sphere of creativity where imagination can not be limited in any case.  The popular thought in this field is so wide that it is impossible to embrace it.  But the most original ideas are still worth popularizing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.homelysmart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="guitar shelf" class="if uuid-2427324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2427324.jpg"></div><p>  Meet the shelf from the old guitar.  Elegant and original, a chic idea for a loggia, a teenager's room, a living room.
