  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Home Credit Bank - customer reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The credit system in our country is widespread.  Often, before making a major purchase, people apply for consumer loans in banking institutions.  At the same time, several factors are taken into account: the <span>interest rate</span> that the bank sets, as well as its reliability and established reputation in the financial market, if the institution has been operating for a long time.  Therefore, it is so important to study the feedback of employees and customers that, for example, Home Credit Bank has, reviews <strong> </strong>  about his services and work. </p><p>  <strong>Home Credit Bank History</strong> </p><p>  In 1990, in the city of Zelenograd, the Technopolis Bank was registered.  In 2002, it was acquired by Home Credit Finance AS from the Czech Republic and the bank joined the Home Credit Group.  A year later, he acquired the name already known to many - Home Credit and Finance Bank.  Institutional policies have become consumer-oriented.  The bank has six branches, it employs more than twenty-two thousand employees, and its customers are twenty-four million people.  Fifty-eight thousand stores are partners of the bank.  Thus, Home Credit <span>Bank, reviews</span> of which constitute this material, is aimed at universalizing its services, primarily, lending to the population. </p><p>  As often happens, Home Credit Bank is causing mixed reviews.  There is sharp criticism of him, but there are also positive reviews.  Let's consider everything in order.  Customers who apply for a loan to buy (household appliances, cars, etc.) often complain that the bank takes too much overpayment.  Yes, it‚Äôs hard to disagree.  But most often there are options when applying for a loan.  For example, <span>Home Credit</span> Bank <span>, whose reviews</span> are so ambiguous, has a very flexible approach to lending conditions.  Customers have the opportunity to get a loan for a short period, repay it earlier, make a large payment.  Bank employees advise you to carefully treat banking services and pre-specify <span>payment</span> schedules <span>, interest</span> rate, commission, insurance.  The client has the right to refuse the last service.  Most often, outrage among consumers of banking services appears due to their inattention when studying credit documents or inability to make settlements. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Customer reviews about Home Credit Bank</strong> </p><p>  Studying the reviews about Home Credit Bank, it can be noted that customers are satisfied with the service, they call employees wonderful specialists, and the atmosphere prevailing in the institution is friendly and democratic.  When servicing clients, employees very clearly and clearly explain the rules for processing and paying out a loan.  Customers share their positive experiences with the bank.  They talk about the convenience of replenishing a deposit through bank operators, for which there is an electronic queue terminal. </p><p>  For <span>customers, the bank</span> offers credit and debit cards.  You can replenish the account or withdraw interest from the deposit through bank terminals.  Clients can always find in the bank‚Äôs services exactly the kind of loan that is suitable for their purposes.  Some are attracted by rather high interest rates on deposits, and besides, they are insured.  When receiving credit cards at a bank, there is no need to pay a fee for their servicing.  Thanks to its services, Home Credit Bank receives good reviews.  Customers can not doubt its reliability.  In addition, of the positive feedback that the bank provokes, we can note the efficiency of its work.  The bank puts high interest rates on deposits, many of its customers agree on this.  To obtain a loan, approval by phone is enough, the necessary documents are drawn up in the bank itself.  In addition to lending, the bank allows its customers to make money transfers, which also found a positive response from consumers of banking services. </p><p>  Thus, Bank Home Credit reviews collect not only critical, but also a lot of positive ones in which people express their satisfaction with its activities.  Customers like the fact that the bank offers different ways to repay the loan, which makes it possible to work with it more convenient and simple. </p>
