In sec.  Hamyshka is Mount Monk.  According to legend, a monk lived on its top for a long time, in his honor they decided to name this place.  On the highest eastern tier of this mountain is the entrance to the Jolas Cave.  During World War II, the doctor Jolas hid here. </p><p>  Mount Trident is another miracle Adygea is so proud of.  The sights of the region are exclusively a merit of nature.  And although these are actually three peaks, the locals combined them into one. </p><p>  Not far from the Athos St. Michael's Monastery is Mount Fiziabgo.  From its top you can have mercy on the snow-white mountains of the <span>Caucasus Range</span> and the monastery itself.  The slopes are also famous for their underground passages and man-made caves. <br><br>  Here is the highest point of the Lago-Naki plateau - Mount Fisht (2868 m).  Its upper slope is covered with a large glacier.  You can conquer Fisht only if you go along a specially designed tourist route. </p><p>  It is worth noting that this is not all the mountains that are on the territory of the Republic of Adygea.  Sights are even hard to give in to calculus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adygea what to see" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/395992.jpg?1400063605035" width="480"></div>

Here, the charming <span>Belaya River</span> flows through a deep and narrow canyon. </p><p>  See also stands on the river Meshoko with the gorge of the same name.  To get to this place with unique grottoes and waterfalls is not difficult, many roads of varying complexity lead to it. </p><p>  The real treasures of Adygea can be called the Kishi River with its many rapids, Lake Psenoda, Przekeski Falls, the Fars and Polkovnitskaya rivers and many others.

    <h2>  Caves </h2><p>  There are more than 15 caves in the region.  The most famous of them are: Big and Small Azish caves, Through, Ozernaya, Sheep, Saxophone, Flute, Monastery, Soaring Bird cave, Dakhovskaya cave, Fishta, Duhan and others.  Most of them are easily accessible for visiting. </p><h2>  City of apple trees </h2><p>  Of great interest to tourists is also the city of Maykop (Adygea).  Its name from Adyghe is translated as "valley of apple trees."  The capital of the republic is really buried in greenery and flowers.  The real pride of Maykop is the city park, where swimming pools are built.  The Belaya River is quite cold even in the summer, so swimming in a warm pool and admiring the lush vegetation of the park is a pleasure.  In the vicinity of the capital, you can see the ancient mounds, the most significant of them is Oshad.  On the southern outskirts of the city, on the left bank of the Belaya River, is the ancient Maykop fortress, or trype, and a large group of archaeologists are still working on its riddles. </p><h2>  Other attractions </h2>
