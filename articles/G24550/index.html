The purpose of creation, functions performed</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The “Council of All Land” is the representative body of all counties of Russia, acting in the second militia created by K. Minin and D. Pozharsky.  In the difficult time of the Troubles, on April 7, 1612, the birth of Great Russia was announced in the city of Yaroslavl, which was destined to become a powerful power.  This event inspired hope that Russia did not die, that the trials of troubled times did not break it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nne.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why was the council created" class="if uuid-2621880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2621880.jpg"></div><h2>  Previous events </h2><p>  What is the “Council of the whole earth”?  The activity and its creation coincided with the terrible times of turmoil, which became a difficult test.  They questioned the existence of Russia as a state.  The entire central territory of the country was looted and ruined after the invasion of the interventionists.  The villages abandoned by the inhabitants, half-empty cities, the terrible famine that rained down on Russian soil for several years, made the country uninhabited.  On the roads, gangs of Cossacks and robbers were operating.  The measured order of life, established by hundreds of years, was disrupted.  Devastation and desolation reigned over the country. </p><p>  But even more terrible was the anarchy, the coming to power of random people who, as if intentionally, sought to destroy the integrity of the state.  This reign of the “Seven Boyars”, which ruled the country until the creation of the “Council of All the Earth,” was an open treason against the rulers of Russia, calling on the throne a stranger from among those who fiercely hated Russia and dreamed of her enslavement - the Polish prince Vladislav.  Behind him stood his father <span>Sigismund III,</span> who wanted to completely exterminate Orthodoxy and impose Catholicism everywhere. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Zemsky government in Russia </h2><p>  For the period of the XVI-XVII centuries, Russia was an estate-representative monarchy, the remains of which were completely destroyed and liquidated by Peter I. This meant that the state had a higher institution - the Zemsky Sobor, which included representatives of all classes.  The exception was serfs who did not participate in the election of their representatives. </p><div class="photo" data-original="trojden.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the council of all earth was created" class="if uuid-2621875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2621875.jpg"></div><h2>  Betrayal of the boyars </h2><p>  The “Semiboyarschina” consisted of its representatives, the boyars, who were in control of the country at the time of the interruption of the dynastic branch of the Rurikovich (absence of an heir).  This almost led the country to death, calling for the administration of the country of foreigners.  The Polish <span>prince Vladislav, who</span> promised to convert to Orthodoxy and withdraw troops from Russia, in fact turned out to be an ordinary interventionist.  Upon entering Moscow, the Polish-Lithuanian detachment, most of which were German mercenaries, first engaged in robbery.  They cleared the treasury, plundered and spoiled the cathedrals. </p><h2>  "Council of the whole earth" </h2><p>  This is the governing body that replaced the "Seven Boyars".  Most of the Russian people were offended by sheer betrayal.  Resistance units were created throughout the country.  The first militia led by Prokop Lyapunov was created by the service people of Ryazan, Tula, Seversk, Kaluga.  The second militia, led by <span>Zemstvo elder</span> K. Minin and Prince D. Pozharsky, was created in Nizhny Novgorod. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Having besieged the Kremlin and Kitai Gorod, militia soldiers blocked the "rulers".  Nobody wanted to carry out their orders.  But someone had to lead the country, for which the “Council of the whole earth” was created.  It was almost impossible to hold full-fledged elections.  Therefore, the leaders of the militia decided to hold them with participants in the liberation movement, among whom were representatives of many cities. </p><p>  But this body could not, as they say now, be legitimate, despite the fact that it included representatives of almost 25 cities.  Veliky Novgorod spoke out especially violently against him, urging other cities not to recognize the Council, explaining this by the fact that no one elected these electors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="old-yar.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="activity of the council of all land" class="if uuid-2621883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2621883.jpg"></div><h2>  Finance collection </h2><p>  Despite the efforts of the militias, the situation in the country became more complicated.  The Swedes occupied Veliky Novgorod, the Poles occupied Smolensk, the patriarch Germogen wrote appeals to the Russian people, which did not always reach him.  The “Council of All Land” was created to save the Russian state.  From an economic point of view, no state can exist without finance.  The treasury of the country was looted. </p><p>  Even in Nizhny Novgorod, finances were taken up by the zemstvo elder Kozma Minin.  With his help, a fundraiser was held in the city.  Most of them were brought by people themselves, aware of the danger of the situation.  But I had to go home with persuasion, even apply methods of influence.  As the militia moved towards Moscow, making a stop in the cities, it was possible to collect a sufficient amount of money.  Yaroslavl merchants continued to help with money, established the production of weapons. </p><p>  Dispatches were sent to all sides of the country calling for all collected taxes, taxes and donations to be sent not to traitors-boyars and robbers-Poles, but to Yaroslavl.  People's hatred of the interventionists was so great that most cities began to send money to Yaroslavl, recognizing the "Council of All Lands."  It was a victory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="viticodevagamundo.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the council of all earth is" class="if uuid-2621873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2621873.jpg"></div><h2>  The political reason for creating the Council </h2><p>  From a political point of view, no state can exist without government.  The country at that time of its development needed a king.  In Yaroslavl, where the militia spent four months, in April <span>1612 the</span> Council of All the Earth was created.  It was a kind of interim government, which at first solved the urgent issues of the country, relying on the Zemstvo authorities.  Representatives of all classes of different nationalities were included in it. </p><p>  From all sides of Russia, petitions on various issues that needed to be addressed began to come to Yaroslavl.  This was an indicator of recognition of this representative body.  The funds raised, the necessary armaments allowed to continue the campaign to Moscow and 04.11.1612.  After a short siege, the defense of Kitai Gorod and the Kremlin fell.  And on 02/21/1613 the power in the country was transferred to the newly elected tsar - Mikhail Romanov. </p>
