    <h2>  Crown Resort Henipa: traveler reviews </h2><p>  As you know, for a vacation hotel becomes a second home for travelers.  And even if you do not plan to visit the apartments often, you probably want the hotel room to be clean, comfortable and equipped with everything necessary for a comfortable stay.  Therefore, it is very important not to make a mistake in choosing a hotel.  According to many travelers, an invaluable help in finding a hotel is provided by studying the reviews of those who have already visited this or that place.  After all, former guests, based on their own experience, share information about the pros and cons of a particular hotel.  Based on these data, you can decide whether this hotel is suitable for you.  Today we invite you to get acquainted with the impressions of tourists from Russia and other CIS countries regarding their stay at the three-star Crown Resort Henipa hotel (Cyprus, Larnaca).  It is immediately worth noting that the vast majority of our compatriots respond positively about the hotel and assure that they are not completely disappointed in their choice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crown resort henipa reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1191687.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, the guests of the ‚ÄúCrown Resort Khenipa‚Äù were generally satisfied with the apartments offered by him at the hotel.  So, most vacationers prefer to stay in standard rooms.  According to tourists, they have a small area.  But this did not become a problem.  All rooms are cozy, clean, bright.  The furniture is not new, but of high quality.  The technique works without interruption.  If you have any kind of breakdown, then report it to the reception, and the problem will be fixed as soon as possible.  Also, according to a number of our compatriots, if something in general does not suit you in the proposed apartments, then you can ask the administrator at the reception to relocate you.  In most cases, such requests are granted.  Also, former hotel guests warn that not all rooms have refrigerators.  So be prepared for this.  In addition, experienced travelers are advised to take mosquito repellents from home, as in the summertime these insects can annoy you.  Some vacationers pay attention to another feature.  So, if you are sleeping sensitively or come on vacation with your children, it is advisable to ask the reception manager for check-in to provide you with a room whose windows do not face the road.  The fact is that traffic in the vicinity of the hotel is quite active, so noise from the street can interfere with your vacation.  If the windows of your apartment overlook the interior of the hotel, then no extraneous sounds will disturb you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crown resort henipa cyprus" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1191688.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  As for the location of Crown Resorts Henipa 3 * <span>(Larnaca, Cyprus),</span> then, according to tourists, it has its own characteristics that affect the price of accommodation in this hotel.  So, the hotel in question is located on the outskirts of the city.  This area cannot boast of developed infrastructure.  So, within walking distance, its guests have only a couple of cafes and a store.  Judging by the reviews of travelers, even to the pharmacy and supermarket you have to travel by bus or taxi.  Therefore, experienced tourists recommend this hotel to those who plan to rent a car in order not to restrict their freedom of movement, or those who are looking forward to a relaxing beach holiday and are not going to often go to the city or on excursions.  However, you can always reach both the center of Larnaca and any other place in Cyprus by bus.  Schedules can be taken at the reception.  The stop is next to the hotel. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, the Crown Resort Khenip Hotel cannot boast a large territory.  However, there is a garden, a gym, a spa with a jacuzzi and a sauna, sports fields and a tennis court.  The hotel also has several swimming pools with sun terraces and sun loungers.  The Crown Resort Khenip also has a conference room for 150 people.  Guests planning to rent a car can use the free car park.  Some tourists, they said, were slightly surprised upon arrival by the fact that the hotel grounds were not fenced.  However, they argue that it is not worth worrying about this, as the area here is calm and safe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crown resorts henipa 3 larnaca" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1191689.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, this item did not arouse any complaints among the guests of the Crown Resort Henipa (Larnaca).  So, our compatriots claim that the food here is organized at a very decent level for a three-star hotel.  Also note that almost all travelers who visit here assure that when booking a stay, it is best to immediately select the ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù option, so as not to pay extra for lunches and dinners, as well as drinks throughout the day.  Indeed, as already mentioned, in the vicinity of the hotel there is especially nowhere to eat.  Therefore, most of the vacation you will surely eat at Crown Resort Khenipa. </p><p>  In general, according to vacationers, the choice in the hotel restaurant is quite diverse.  So, there are always meat and poultry dishes, often guests are offered fish.  The only negative, judging by the reviews, is the almost complete absence of pastries and sweets.  But at the same time, the guests were very pleased that twice a day they had the opportunity to enjoy delicious ice cream in waffle cups, which to some extent offset the lack of desserts in the restaurant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel crown resorts henipa" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1191690.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  A big plus of this hotel, according to its former guests, is its proximity to the sea.  So, tourists note that the path to the beach takes a maximum of five minutes.  Moreover, half of this time, as a rule, is spent on crossing the road.  The beach next to the hotel is pebble.  When entering the sea, at first there are also small stones at the bottom, but after a few meters the sand begins.  According to holidaymakers, there is a sandy beach within walking distance.  So you can always walk to him.  The beaches here do not belong to hotels, so you will have to pay extra for renting sun loungers and umbrellas (about 6-7 euros for a couple of sun loungers and an umbrella for the whole day).  However, you can always sit right on the sand, laying a towel or mat.  In this case, you do not have to pay extra. </p><p>  As for the sea, it is, according to vacationers, very clean.  So swimming here is a pleasure. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  According to many vacationers, the Crown Resorts Henipa 3 * hotel can rightfully be proud of its employees.  So, the workers of this hotel, according to our compatriots, are very friendly, welcoming, quick and ready to help guests in resolving any issues.  An indisputable plus is the fact that almost all the hotel staff speak Russian.  So, our compatriots will not have any difficulties in communication here. </p>
