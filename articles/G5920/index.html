    <p>  Ayia Napa is approximately 50 kilometers from Larnaca Airport.  Weather conditions in Cyprus have a year-round tourist season.  In summer, the air temperature can reach +40, and the sea - +30 degrees Celsius.  In winter, the temperature of air and water does not fall below +20. </p><h2>  <strong>History of Famagusta</strong> </h2><p>  In ancient times, the locality of Famagusta was a popular resort in Cyprus - the city of Varosha.  This continued until 1974, and then the Turkish troops captured Varosha, after which the Greek Cypriots living in the north of the island were forced to leave their native places and settle south.  Today's Cyprus is divided into Greek and Turkish (northern) territories.  Tourists who rest mainly in the Greek part of the island are not recommended independent trips to the north, only with tour guides to visit the sights. </p><h2>  <strong>What to visit in Ayia Napa</strong> </h2><p>  After arriving in the city, tourists can rent a buggy - an open car for two and go travel along the coast.  Cyprus is famous for its wonderful <span>wild</span> <span>white sand beaches, the</span> atmosphere of romance permeates the entire island - after all, it is here, in the vicinity of Paphos, according to legend, Aphrodite emerged from the foam and gave all mortals the opportunity to love and be loved.  This place must be visited, you just need to be very careful when swimming - the sea has a rather rocky bottom and you can get damaged, because the waves can be strong and the water there is cool. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

All the equipment in the rooms is working properly, including air conditioning, although some guests noted an increased noise from their work, which interferes with sleep at night. </p><p>  In some rooms, guests regretted the presence of old dilapidated furniture. </p><p>  Beach Florida Beach Hotel 4 *, reviews of which all as one sound in a positive manner, is convenient for its proximity to the hotel.  Tourists noted the heated pools, the warm beautiful sea and the presence of free sunbeds at the pools and on the beach.  For pessimists and those who want to find even the slightest flaw in everything, free places on the beach indicate a low occupancy of the hotel by tourists.  In fact, the staff made sure that there were enough sun loungers for all guests, and did not stint on their number. </p><p>  Meet against Florida Hotel 4 * (Cyprus, Ayia Napa) reviews, painted with negative intonation.  They usually come down to a tiny hotel area.  She is really small.  But when you exit, you can immediately get to the street with bars, clubs and restaurants, and a 10-minute walk is the mecca of Ayia Napa's nightlife. </p><p>  Opinions were also divided about the quality of food.  Basically, complaints were received for not very plentiful breakfasts, which, by the way, were compensated by a variety of plentiful dishes for dinner.  During the day you can go to a cafe or a supermarket and have a snack. </p><p>  But for lovers of sightseeing, the hotel provides a wide range of services.  Many experienced travelers are advised to use the services of the hotel, rather than buying hand-guided tours in the city to avoid troubles. </p><p>  In general, the reviews of the Florida Beach Hotel (Ayia Napa, Cyprus) boil down to the fact that the hotel offers a pleasant comfortable stay, which will be affordable for everyone. </p>
