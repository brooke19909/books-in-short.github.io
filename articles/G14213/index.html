The first music lovers were forced to be content with bulky <span>gramophone records,</span> as well as dubious quality gramophones, which constantly needed to be maintained.  If the handle of the device‚Äôs factory did not rotate, then the gramophone stopped playing, and all the fun ended.  Therefore, at all entertainment and holiday events there was always an unfortunate person who had to maintain the ‚Äúvoice‚Äù of the gramophone for dancers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Player and Headphones" class="if uuid-3206077" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3206077.jpg"></div><p>  Nowadays, the situation has changed radically thanks to the emergence of highly functional audio equipment that is capable of storing a huge amount of music in its memory, can work for a long amount of time without additional recharging, and also has significantly small dimensions compared to its very clumsy predecessors.

Portable music players, as a class of gadgets, have generally become extremely popular lately, despite the fact that most people prefer to listen to their favorite songs using a smartphone or tablet.  Only relatively recently, the average music lover began to realize that the vocal and instrumental art, like the skill of photography, it is difficult to fully understand, without using a device specially designed for him. </p><h2>  Development </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Company employees" class="if uuid-3206089" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3206089.jpg"></div><p>  Sony has always been characterized by increased quality control in the development of its products.

The developers of the device provided all, even the most insignificant moments in the management of the gadget, making the device truly convenient for the average user. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Despite the small size and active functional purpose, the authors of the player‚Äôs design with a soul approached its appearance.  The device is an elongated rectangle of monochrome coloring, made quite stylishly, without various patterns, inscriptions or any other identification marks.  The display of the gadget is quite voluminous for players of this type, but it has a significant drawback - a rather weak level of brightness, which leads to the fact that the user needs to constantly increase the brightness of the screen.  From the right side, two volume control buttons are built into the player‚Äôs body, which are very convenient to use.  Most reviews of the Sony NWZ B183F contain information precisely about the incredible comfort when using these same controls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Device in hands" class="if uuid-3206078" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3206078.jpg"></div><p>  The sealed rubber strip protecting the USB input of the player is also made in the corresponding common color scheme.  Thanks to the tight rubber cap, the connector is always clean and securely closed to prevent foreign bodies from entering it. </p><h2>  Warranty period </h2><p>  The instruction for the Sony NWZ B183F player contains all the necessary information regarding the service of the device.  The manufacturer provides a fairly long warranty period for the maintenance of the gadget.  The device technical support program is in effect for one year.  Also, the buyer has the opportunity to contact the Sony consulting center directly. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Full set" class="if uuid-3206079" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3206079.jpg"></div><p>  Numerous reviews on the Sony NWZ B183F show that, bundled with the playback device itself, as additional options, are supplied: </p><ul><li>  stereo headphones from the same manufacturer; </li><li>  several sets of interchangeable ear pads for various types and sizes of the auricle; </li><li>  as well as a small external memory card, which at any time can be inserted into a special slot in the player‚Äôs case. </li></ul><p>  In addition to the above devices, the kit includes detailed instructions for using the device.  The brochure is written in a simple and accessible language. </p><h2>  Popularity </h2><p>  Numerous reviews of the Sony NWZ B183F only once again prove the relevance of this device, which has already become a kind of "classic of the genre."  It is bought by office workers, doctors, truckers, truckers, researchers and athletes, and each of them is quite happy with the purchase.  Thanks to the unique design of the sound system, the player easily reproduces qualitatively both musical works of various genres, as well as audio books, recording lectures and performances.  The convenient headset that comes with the kit will provide a comfortable perception of sound information, and it does not matter where the listener is located - in the subway, in the train, in the office or at home, in a special room for acquaintance with musical works. </p><h2>  Scope of application </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Gold version" class="if uuid-3206081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3206081.jpg"></div><p>  The scope of the gadget can be judged by the reviews on the player Sony NWZ B183F.

Some use the device to listen to music, the second prefer radio channels, the third most of all on the account like to listen to audio performances.  A fairly large number of students often attend lectures from various universities in the world. </p><h2>  Comparison with other models </h2><p>  It makes no sense to compare the described gadget with any other representatives of this family.  However, it is worth mentioning that in comparison with other models of the line, there are much more positive reviews on the Sony NWZ B183F than on other devices of the same type.  The player managed to become a kind of "workhorse", very profitable and reliable, which made it more competitive than other variations of subsequent models.

That is how most satisfied owners respond about the legendary device. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the popularity of the gadget among people of all ages was influenced by its unique technical characteristics.  The device has gathered all the necessary criteria of a good branded product, which can become a worthy technical companion of a person. </p><p>  The player has a frequency range from 20 to 20,000 Hz, a built-in low-frequency amplifier, a standard headset jack, as well as a special USB interface, thanks to which the device can be connected to a personal computer and transfer music audio compositions to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="USB port of the gadget" class="if uuid-3206080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3206080.jpg"></div><p>  The gadget is capable of playing audio files in popular mp3 and WMA formats.  The player also has a built-in memory of four gigabytes.  Unfortunately, there is no way to expand the memory of the device - it does not have a slot for a memory card. </p><p>  The small display clearly shows song titles and artist names.  The display does not have touch control functions, all operations are performed by pressing a small number of buttons. </p><p>  Reviews on the player Sony NWZ B183F contain information that one of the functions of the player is the ability to listen to the radio.  The built-in antenna catches a fairly large number of frequencies. </p><p>  The device is very resistant to stress and is able to hold a battery charge for twenty hours from the moment of full charge. </p><p>  The metal case reliably and firmly protects the device from any external influences. </p><p>  The dimensions of the player are relatively small: the gadget is only eight centimeters in length and two in width.  In thickness - one and a half. </p><p>  A similar device weighs about thirty grams. </p><h2>  Playback Formats </h2><p>  In addition to the most popular and popular mp3 music format among music lovers, the audio device can also play back the WMA audio codec that is close to it in quality.  Usually it is in this format that the average gadget users record the materials they need on the recorder or save important telephone conversations to memory.  Also, both of these codecs are used in the structure of the program for audio notes or ringtones for an alarm on any of the smartphones.  The characteristics of the Sony NWZ B183F player allow it to work freely with the two audio playback formats described above.  Despite the fact that there are much more codecs in the field of sound recording, the average music lover still actively uses these two formats of sound conversion, without the need for additional gadget settings. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue player" class="if uuid-3206082" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110909/3206082.jpg"></div><p>  On various sites and forums, the average score for the Sony NWZ B183F player ranges from 4.5 points to almost a record 4.9.

Indeed, the Sony NWZ B183F mp3 is quite small, and more closely resembles two matchboxes stacked together in length.  People who write reviews about the player are always satisfied with the fact that you can take it with you wherever you go, since it goes into all your pockets, except for the very tiny ones.  Secondly, users with approval describe the technical characteristics of the device, emphasizing the crystal clear sound that gives the player. </p>
