Now the resort is considered a vacation destination for wealthy tourists, because often millionaires from all over the world come here.  However, there are many budget hotels here.  How to get to Kerkyra?  What tours do domestic tour operators offer?  What you need to see on the island?  We will try to answer these questions in our article. </p><h2>  Island history </h2><p>  Kerkyra Island (Greece) is usually known to European and domestic tourists under the name of Corfu.  It is used by many tour operators, but it is not an official name.  The first mention of the island appeared in ancient times.  Even Homer once wrote about Kerkyra, although in his works it was called Scheria.  Active population growth of the island, which was located at the intersection of trade routes of the West and East, began in the era of antiquity.  Athens, Sparta and Macedonia have long fought among themselves for the right to possess this fertile region.  In the III century BC, the island became part of the Roman Empire.  After its collapse, Kerkyra remained a part of Byzantium. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kerkyra Greece" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/1715149.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For many years, the island was attacked by Turks, Sicilians and Italians.  The weakening Byzantine empire could not repulse them, so in 1401 the inhabitants of Kerkyra decided to entrust their fate to Venice.  Corfu was in its composition until 1797.  Kerkyra is the only Greek region that has never come under Muslim rule.  In the XIX century, Corfu was owned by France, and then the Republic of the Seven Islands, which was under the protectorate of Russia and Turkey.  In 1864, the region became part of independent Greece.  The island was badly damaged during the German bombing of World War II.  Many attractions were irretrievably lost. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to Kerkyra? </h2><p>  Many tourists prefer self-organized trips to tours.  The easiest way to get to the island is by plane.  In high season, several direct flights per week fly from Moscow and St. Petersburg airports to Kerkyra.  The price of a one-way ticket is about 7000-9000 rubles.  A flight with several transfers will cost a little cheaper.  Tourists who prefer to travel by land can reach mainland Greece by train, and then take buses to coastal cities.  From here you can catch a ferry that will take you to the island.  Such a journey will take 2-3 days, and its cost will be more expensive than a plane ticket. </p><h2>  Tours in Kerkyra </h2><p>  Every summer, travelers fill the island of Kerkyra (Greece).  Tours here are sold by all major tour operators, and a weekly ticket will not cost very much.  A night in a budget hotel will cost about 1,500-2,000 rubles for a double room.  However, when buying a ticket, you should carefully choose a place to live.  Some hotels for this amount offer shabby little rooms with a minimum level of comfort, while others, on the contrary, have prepared clean and well-groomed economy rooms.  The cost of food is included in many tours, but travelers prefer to eat outside the hotel. </p><p>  On the island there are several hundred restaurants, each of which offers to try the original local cuisine at low prices.  Outside the cafe, you should definitely buy local goat cheese, olive oil, coniferous and citrus honey and kumquat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As a rule, tours involve accommodation in a hotel that has its own pool and a minimum set of entertainment.  However, Kerkyra is a place for outdoor activities.  First you need to visit the capital of the island, which is called little Italy.  Orthodox tourists will be interested in numerous ancient monasteries and churches.  On the beaches of the island you can go diving and snorkelling.  A large water park is open for children here. </p><h2>  City of Kerkyra (Greece) </h2><p>  Kerkyra is not only the Greek name of the island, but also the name of its capital.  The ancient city itself is the main <span>attraction of Corfu.</span>  Its development began in the late Middle Ages, when the region belonged to Venice.  Therefore, the old part of the capital so strongly resembles <span>Italian cities in</span> its appearance <span>.</span>  Along the narrow and winding streets, small houses with low balconies are built, which are richly decorated with flowers and twined with vine.  On the promenade is a magnificent palace surrounded by fountains and a park.  In the central part of the city is the Vlacherna Monastery, which the Greeks consider the guardian angel of Kerkyra.  The most ancient building on the island is the Kardaki temple, which was built about 2500 years ago in honor of Poseidon.  According to legend, it was this god who created Corfu. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kerkyra island greece" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1716011.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The historic city center is a maze of winding cobblestone streets.  As a rule, all of them lead to significant sights of the city.  Tourists should see the Paleo and Neo Furio fortresses, the Palace of Saints Michael and George, the Maitland rotunda, the statue of Georgios Theotokis.  Connoisseurs of history and art will also appreciate the numerous museums.  So, the city has opened the Byzantine, Asian, Serbian, Numismatic and Archaeological museums. </p><p>  Kerkyra (Greece) is also suitable for beach holidays.  The city has a well-equipped coast where you can not only swim in the sea, but also go diving, go <span>water skiing, a</span> catamaran or a motor boat. </p><h2>  Cathedral of St. Spyridon </h2><p>  The cathedral is located in the center of Kerkyra.  Its construction was completed in 1590.  The temple was consecrated in honor of St. Spyridon of Trimyphus, who is considered the patron saint of the entire island.  Its relics are stored in the cathedral, which are one of the main Orthodox shrines not only in Corfu, but throughout Greece.  According to believers, they have miraculous powers and are able to heal from diseases.  A huge number of Orthodox people flock here from all over the country, so huge lines are lined up daily before the relics. </p><p>  The Cathedral of St. Spyridon has a rich interior and exterior decoration.  It is known that money for its construction and repair was donated not only by the Orthodox, but also by Catholics.  So, even the Russian Empress Catherine II sent funds for the needs of the temple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blue lagoon island kerkira greece" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/1715142.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Like the rest of Kerkyra (Greece), the temple is built in the Venetian style and is very different from traditional Orthodox churches.  The cathedral can be visited any day.  Typically, morning service starts here at 08:30 and ends around 10:00.  At the same time, holy relics open for visitors.  During the day, the cathedral is visited by many tourists and pilgrims for whom excursions are arranged.  You can attend the evening service at 19:00. </p><h2>  Fortress Angelokastro </h2><p>  Corfu Island (Kerkyra, Greece) often suffered from attacks by Turks and Italians.  The ancient fortress Angelokastro, located on the coast of the island, was built by the Byzantines at the end of the 13th century.  For a long time she defended the inhabitants of Kerkyra from enemy invaders.  At the peak of her power, a garrison of 4000 people could be placed in it.  Recent excavations have uncovered Christian crypts of the 5th century and large cisterns for storing water.  Today, the fortress, built on a high hill, is visited not only by history buffs, but also by connoisseurs of panoramic views.  From the top of Angelokastro you can enjoy sea views or a bird's eye view of the entire island. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece Kerkyra photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1716013.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Now the fortress is in a dilapidated state, but it is gradually being restored and archaeological excavations are being carried out.  Tourists can visit the ruins on their own or as part of tour groups.  The ticket price for both children and adults is 3 euros.  The castle is open to visitors from Tuesday to Sunday from 08:00 to 15:00.  The day off is Monday. </p><h2>  Achillion Palace </h2><p>  In the 19th century, Greece, Kerkyra, the photo of which can be seen in this article, became the main residence of the Austrian Empress Elizabeth.  After the suicide of her son, she lived here her years.  The palace was built in 1890 in the Pompeian style, and most importantly the theme of its design was the hero of the Iliad Achilles.  The building stands on a high slope surrounded by lush gardens and is considered a favorite place for visitors.  Firstly, the building itself is considered a unique palace complex not only in Greece, but throughout Europe.  Secondly, it offers a wonderful view of most of Corfu.  The entire territory of the palace is decorated with numerous antique busts and sculptures, carved furniture and exquisite paintings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kerkyra island greece tours" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/1715147.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  After the death of Elizabeth, the palace for a long time served as the spring residence of the Kaiser of Germany, and then was given over to the casino.  Now Achillion is open to tourists.  It is located 10 km from the capital, you can get to it by bus.  The cost of visiting is 10 euros.  On weekdays, the palace is open from 08:00 until 19:00.  On weekends, the complex closes at 14:30. </p><h2>  Perulades Beach </h2><p>  Kerkyra (Greece), whose attractions are described in this article, is famous not only for historical, but also for natural monuments.  One of them was the rocky beach of Perulades, which is located 10 km from the coast of Sidari.  True, sunbathing and swimming in the sea is unlikely to succeed.  A small section of the beach is surrounded by layered cliffs, whose height reaches 100 meters.  You can go down the stairs to the sea only during a short low tide.  Most often, tourists come here in the evening to enjoy the sunset. </p><p>  On the cliff is a cozy tavern, where you can not only have dinner, but also rent a room for several days.  The road from Kerkyra takes about 1 hour.  Buses do not go here, so it is best to get to the coast with your own car. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Corfu island Kerkyra Greece" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/1715143.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Blue Lagoon (Kerkyra Island, Greece) </h2><p>  To get to the Blue Lagoon, located next to the sea caves of Murtos, you can only by boat.  As a rule, tourists buy a full sea cruise, which includes a trip along the entire western coast of Corfu.  A sightseeing tour along the coast leaves the city of Kerkyra (Greece) and lasts all day, food and drinks will be included in the ticket price.  For almost an hour, the boat stops at the unusually beautiful Blue Lagoon Bay, where the film of the same name was filmed.  Travelers can swim in the purest waters of the bay or go diving and snorkeling. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kerkyra city greece" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/1715145.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Old fortress </h2><p>  The creation of another fortress of Kerkyra (Greece) is due to the Venetian architect.  According to their idea, it was to become an impregnable place, so the cape on which it was erected was separated from Corfu by a deep moat.  To get to the island was possible only through a narrow bridge, which has survived to this day.  Now it is called the "bridge of suicides."  A few years after the construction, the fortress became desolate.  From it there are only a few bastions and numerous ruins.  Sometimes music concerts are held here, and light shows are held in the dark.  Due to the hot weather, tourists often walk around the area in the early morning or late evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="greece kerkira hotels" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/1715146.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews of tourists about holidays in Kerkyra </h2><p>  Great place for a quiet holiday will be Greece.  Kerkyra, whose hotels are distinguished by their price diversity, also appealed to tourists.  In their reviews, they describe the beauty of the local flora and fauna, a large number of historical attractions, the clean coast and the sea.  Travelers note that the island is not suitable for lovers of lazy relaxation.  Corfu needs to be explored, not just lying on the beach.  Also, tourists liked the mentality of the local population.  The owners of shops and taverns are always friendly and smiling, and for their regular customers they make good discounts. </p><p>  The only drawback of Kerkyra is the lack of a developed network of bus routes.  Going on a trip around the island, you must definitely rent a car for travel.  Otherwise, visiting many attractions will be problematic. </p><h2>  Draw conclusions </h2><p>  Tourists like Greece.  Corfu (Kerkyra) is visited annually by thousands of tourists supporting the city‚Äôs economy.  A trip here should be organized for active people who like to visit historical sites, study the culture and traditions of the host country.  There are budget and respectable hotels and restaurants on the island for you. </p>
