    <h2>  Torba </h2><p>  It is in this village that the Vogue Hotel Bodrum is located.  The miniature resort is not too hyped, and only lovers of the Aegean Sea mostly know about it.  There are not so many hotels and, accordingly, few tourists.  Therefore, Torba attracts vacationers with peace and silence.  Cliffs overgrown with pine trees and the sea favorably set off the unusual architecture of the local hotel complexes, which are often built by the best Turkish architects, especially when such famous brands as Vogue are customers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If your trip does not include a shuttle service and you travel on your own, then in order to get to the hotel you need to get to Bodrum.  Vogue Hotel Bodrum 5 * is easily accessible on a dolmush which go here with enviable regularity.  However, they run only in the daytime.  At night you will have to take a taxi.

Pool lovers praised the capabilities of the Vogue Hotel Bodrum - there are as many as 17 of them!  One of them is two-level, the other is cascading.  And the children's section in the main pool has its own sandy ‚Äúbeach‚Äù.  Moreover, the staff assures that there is a highlight here.  Sand brought directly from the Hawaiian Islands.

Nevertheless, the hotel is recommended for a very beautiful, green and well-groomed area, magnificent nature around, excellent, tasty and varied food, comfortable and spacious rooms, attentive staff who fulfilled almost any request without delay.  A very good peeling and <span>foam massage</span> in the hammam, although it is not cheap, but effective.  Everyone praises the children's animators, with whom the little guests spent almost all their time.  In a word, even the most fastidious guests did not always find something to complain about.  This is a hotel where you can truly relax.  Many believe that this is one of the best resorts in Turkey. </p>
