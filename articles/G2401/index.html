How to insert a needle into a sewing machine?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The fundamental condition for the proper operation of the sewing machine - for high-quality stitching and perfectly sewn things - is the correct installation of the needle.  Many needlewomen ask themselves how to insert a needle into an old-fashioned sewing machine (Singer or Seagull), how to do it in the case of a new machine.  In order to answer this question, it is necessary to understand the principle of installing a needle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.williamgee.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="industrial needles" class="if uuid-2875126" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2875126.jpg"></div><h2>  Choosing the right needle </h2><p>  The presence of a huge number of needles on sale even for professional seamstresses greatly complicates the choice.  Most of the needles are similar to each other, and only a magnifying glass will make it possible to make out different rods, points, needle ears.  The needle device is configured in such a way that in order to sew any part or thing, each of these parameters will matter.  When choosing a tool, you need to pay attention to the following: </p><ul><li>  fabric thickness; </li><li>  type of appliance. </li></ul><p>  The manufacturer, producing high-quality needles, should pay attention to the owners of the machines.  German Schmetz and Japanese Organ Needles are among the best.  After each major sewing project is completed, the needle should be replaced, that is, the tip of the seamstress tool should always be sharp, and the eyelet whole.  The user of the machine will always be satisfied with the result of sewing, if he takes into account all these points when choosing and using sewing needles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Needles for household machines </h2><p>  Problems with sewing will not help to solve even the correct installation, if the tool is incorrectly selected.  Distinguish between American and European systems for marking sewing needles.  If the numbering starts from sixty to one hundred and twenty, it is European, and sizes from eight to twenty-one include the overseas system.  Two numbers are immediately indicated on the package so as not to be confused.  For general-purpose machines, needles are marked as follows: HAx1 or 130 / 705H. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sailrite.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="needles for cars" class="if uuid-2875125" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2875125.jpg"></div><p>  The purchase of a needle of one type or another depends on the quality of the material: </p><ul><li>  Numbers 60/8 - 120/20 are universal and due to the slightly rounded point they are suitable for any fabrics. </li><li>  The numbering of needles, including sizes from 60/8 to 100/16, is used for sewing from knitted fabrics with a rounded point that runs between the loops; these needles differ. </li><li>  Needles with sizes 90/14 - 110/18 are ideally suited for sewing leather goods, leather goods, synthetic suede, their difference is a blade-shaped point that allows you to cut through heavy fabrics. </li><li>  The denim needle (size range from 90/14 to 110/18) is used when sewing products from dense jeans.  The needle has a small eye, the shape of the tip is rounded, and it does not bend. </li></ul><p>  To get a perfectly tailored product and not have problems skipping stitches, you should constantly check the condition of the needle.  The check includes determining the quality of the tip and irregularities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to insert a needle into a sewing machine? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="huntingforladybugs.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="screw tightening" class="if uuid-2875132" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2875132.jpg"></div><p>  This will be a “Singer”, or “Dzhanome”, or “A Seagull”, or some other machine, the process of installing a needle is simple, if you first familiarize yourself with the instructions for use and operation of the device.  Usually it is there that the subtleties of replacing the accessory are presented.  If there is no instruction, you can use the basic installation steps described below: </p><ol><li>  When replacing a needle, it is recommended that you pay attention to the position of the old one in the needle holder before removing it. </li><li>  Before the process, disconnect the electric sewing machine from the network. </li><li>  Then you need to unscrew the fastening screw using a screwdriver. </li><li>  The needle holder is installed in its highest position.  Having completely unscrewed the screw, remove the old needle and remove it from animals and children. </li><li>  Paying attention to the type of machine, a new needle is installed: the groove for industrial should be directed to the left side, for household - to the right. </li><li>  When the needle is already in place, the user, holding it, tightens the screw. </li><li>  The screw is tightened so that the needle does not stagger and is installed securely. </li></ol><p>  Here are the key points on how to insert the needle into the sewing machine.  In principle, there is nothing complicated, and all that is required for installation is a new, whole, straight needle and a screwdriver. </p><h2>  Installation Quality Check </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="needle replacement" class="if uuid-2875130" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2875130.jpg"></div><p>  It is not recommended to start work on the sewing project immediately after installing the needle in the sewing machine.  First you need to make a test line on the patch, thereby checking the installation.  If the thread is torn, you should slightly change the position of the needle, rotating it in one of the sides. </p><p>  For oblique, low-quality stitches, you also need to adjust the position of the tool in the needle holder.  The stitch is checked until it is even, with stitches the same in length. </p><h2>  Incorrect needle installation </h2><p>  A malfunctioning needle leads to problems.  The main malfunctions include skipped stitches and tool breakage. </p><h2>  Reasons for skipping stitches </h2><p>  Usually skipped stitches are associated with such problems when replacing the needle: </p><ul><li>  curved tool; </li><li>  the tip has become dull; </li><li>  the needle is rust; </li><li>  the needle is inserted on the wrong side; </li><li>  the product is not intended for fabric thickness or device type. </li></ul><h2>  Causes of Needle Breakage </h2><p>  The causes of failure include: </p><ul><li>  The selected needle number does not match the thickness of the fabric. </li><li>  Tool curvature. </li><li>  The needle is not fully inserted into the needle holder. </li><li>  The needle touches the plate as it passes and breaks.  This can happen due to improper installation of the accessory, and also because of the possible curvature of the needle holder. <div class="photo" data-original="financialtribune.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stitch check" class="if uuid-2875145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2875145.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  Simple needle installation manipulations can adversely affect the operation of the machine.  Therefore, if the user has no idea how to correctly insert the needle into the sewing machine ("The Seagull", "Singer", etc.), or after installation the device malfunctions, the best option would be to contact the service center. </p>
