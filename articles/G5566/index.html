    <h2>  What should be considered during training? </h2><p>  The main thing you should pay attention to is the choice of material with which you plan to work later.  For example, it can be beads, mouline thread, twine, satin ribbons, colored rubber bands, etc. Accordingly, each type of material provides its own subtleties and features of weaving, as well as patterns.  Therefore, before you start learning this or that <span>type of weaving,</span> select the material. </p><h2>  What you need to know when weaving baubles from threads? </h2><p>  Suppose you have chosen <span>mouline thread</span> as your starting material <span>.</span>  What's next?  And how to weave baubles from colored threads?  Next, you need to study what are the knots in weaving, since the creation of <span>bracelets from threads is</span> based on them. </p><h2>  The main nodes in the mouline thread: node number 1 </h2><p>  The node number 1 on the diagram looks like a cross with an arrow and a pointer down.  It is deciphered as follows: you have two working threads of different colors (for example, yellow and orange);  you take the thread that is located to your left and bends it to the other side, holding the formed triangle with your finger;  Pull the end of the bent thread straight and tie a knot.  Then repeat the same procedure a second time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to weave baubles" class="if" height="269" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/857778.jpg" width="600"></div>

This designation is deciphered as follows: before you again two colored working threads;  this time you take the one on the right side, put it on the other;  Thread the end into an impromptu ring and tie a knot.  The second node is performed by a similar system. </p><h2>  We understand the schemes: the main node number 3 </h2><p>  Node 3 in the diagrams is depicted as a cross with a circle inside which there is an arrow (it shows the direction to the right and down).  Before weaving baubles with such a knot correctly, pay attention to the position of the arrow in the center of the circle.  Look where she points. </p><p>  Such a knot works according to the following principle: you take the thread that lies on the right and pass it under another;  tie a knot;  repeat all the same actions again. </p><h2>  How to weave baubles according to the pattern: knot No. 4 </h2><p>  The fourth node is usually schematically depicted as a cross and a circle with an arrow pointing left and down.  This picture is decrypted as follows: the working thread to your left is laid on top of the other remaining;  the end of the thread is pulled into a ringlet, and the knot is tied.  The second time you put the same working thread under the bottom of another and tie it in a knot in the same way. </p><h2>  <span>What is a</span> bauble weaving <span>cycle</span> ? </h2><p>  Before weaving baubles in stages and according to the scheme, you need to find out one interesting nuance.  As it turned out, bracelets can be made both in full and in part cycles.  So, if a full cycle image is supposed on the diagram, then all the colors of such a bauble are arranged sequentially on both sides of the product. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the scheme provides for an incomplete weaving cycle, then in the photo you will see a complete discrepancy in the color of the threads on the left and on the right. </p>

    <h2>  Paired and unpaired weaving </h2><p>  Want to learn how to weave beautiful bracelets?  Don't know how to weave baubles according to the pattern?  Read our useful tips - and you will immediately become clear.  So, in the diagrams you can often see that when weaving, a pair and unpaired number of threads or ribbons are used.  For example, you can have 5 gray and 5 black threads or ribbons, 4 white and 4 red.  This weaving will be paired.  In unpaired, the number of working threads may not coincide.  For example, you may have 5 red and 7 white threads. </p><h2>  How to weave bracelets with inscriptions? </h2><p>  Many of the craftswomen and masters of one of their first works are trying to make a decoration with a name or inscription.  Is it hard to do this?  In general, no.  However, the creation of such bracelets involves working with a large number of threads, in which it is easy for beginners to get confused. </p>

    <p>  Before weaving baubles with inscriptions, you should find the appropriate pattern and calculate the exact number of threads needed to create the product.  To do this, you need to count the number of cells in the first vertical column in the diagram.  For example, they turned 8. This means that for weaving you will need exactly 8 threads. </p><p>  In addition, it is worth considering the fact that the pattern or inscription on the bracelet involves the use of two types of threads or ribbons: one of them is used to create the background, and the second is used for the inscription or pattern.  In this case, the length of the secondary thread or tape should not be large (50 cm is enough), and the background length is 2-3 times longer than the estimated length of the product.  Note that to create a background you will need a large number of threads.  Therefore, it is better to take a whole skein.  As a result, one leading thread and 6-8 background threads should be obtained.  What else do you need to know before weaving baubles with inscriptions? </p><h2>  What else needs to be done before weaving baubles with an inscription? </h2><p>  Before starting the work itself, you need to make some simple mathematical calculations.  This must be done not only so that the bracelet finally fits on your hand, but also in order to correctly place the inscription on the product. </p><p>  To make it easier for yourself, it is worth writing the intended name or inscription on a sheet of paper in a cage.  Next, pay attention to how many cells it occupies.  For example, you get 30 cells, which equates to 30 rows.  The approximate density of weaving your product will be 1 cm bracelet - 5 rows.  Consequently, 30 rows have a density of 6 cm (30/5). </p>

    <p>  Then we measure the volume of the wrist.  Suppose it corresponds to 15 cm. This means that with a length of 15 cm for a bauble with a text length of 6 cm (15 - 6 = 9), you need to make 9 cm of the main background.  If we divide this number into two, we get 4.5 cm on each side.  Next, multiply the resulting value by 5 and get the number of rows for the background (4.5 x 5 = 22.5 cm).  And only if these conditions are met, will the inscription be in the middle of the decoration.  We talk about how to make simple baubles. </p><h2>  How to make simple baubles? </h2><p>  It is always better to start with simple products, which in the future will allow you to quickly master a more complex technique of weaving.  So, if you want to make a simple bracelet, then <span>oblique weaving is</span> best for you <span>.</span>  To do this, take an even number of threads or ribbons and divide them in pairs by color.  For example, in the middle there will be two blue threads or ribbons, followed by two orange (one on one, the other on the other side), the next two green, then two violet, two orange and two red. </p>

    <p>  How to weave a slanting bauble further?  Next, you need to fix all the threads into a knot and fix them in any convenient way (using tape, pins, invisibility or a holder for money).  Weaving should begin with the leftmost tape or thread. </p><p>  Take the first and second threads and, using the knot technique, tie both threads together.  Repeat the same movement again with the same threads, and then with the last two (this time the movement with the nodes will be in mirror image).  After that, repeat the same procedure with the remaining threads or ribbons.  If you work with the scheme correctly, you should get a herringbone pattern. </p><h2>  How can I make round baubles? </h2><p>  If you still do not know how to weave round baubles, we will tell you.  The most difficult is considered to be straight and round weaving, requiring a certain experience.  For example, in order to make a product using braided wire (round), you need to select a pattern and prepare the threads (their length should be three times that which is reserved for the bauble itself). </p><p>  In this case, the simplest version of such weaving is based on work with four threads;  for example, it can be two red and two white or multi-colored.  Such weaving is carried out strictly according to the scheme: turn the threads to the sides and tie the two extreme ones;  then put the first on the second and tie;  second to third, next to fourth and then repeat in a circle. </p>
