    <p>  It is best to come here in the summer.  Mid-June is traditionally considered the beginning of the tourist season.  Warm weather has been around since the beginning of May, but the sea warms up only by the beginning of summer.  The most popular months are July and August.  At this time, the air temperature rises to +30, and the sea warms up to +28 degrees.  It is worth paying attention to September, when the velvet season begins in Bulgaria.  Most tourists leave the country's resorts, but the weather is still warm.  It is best to go in early September, when you can still swim in the sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Basic hotel information </h2><p>  Holiday Village 4 * (Bulgaria) is part of a huge tourist complex located in a picturesque park.

Let it have some drawbacks, but they are not significant.  If you want to relax in an ecologically clean and quiet area surrounded by trees and shrubs, you can choose this hotel without hesitation.  Youth companies that love outdoor activities may find it boring here.  There are no huge nightclubs and bars in the area.  Do not confuse the hotel with <span>Santa Marina Holiday Village</span> 4 * (Bulgaria).  The complex has a similar name, but is a completely different place to relax. </p>
