Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Moscow Interbank Currency <span>Exchange (MICEX)</span> was founded in 1992.  600 Russian issuers trade in shares and bonds here daily, including Gazprom, Lukoil, Sberbank, Tatneft, etc. The total value of assets is 24 trillion rubles.  The Interbank Currency Exchange includes 550 professional securities market participants.  They serve 280 thousand investors.  About what the Interbank Currency Exchange does, you will learn from this article. </p><h2>  History of development </h2><p>  In November 1989, Vnesheconombank of the USSR held currency auctions.  For the first time, the ruble to dollar exchange rate was fixed on them.  After the creation of the MICEX, all <span>currency trading</span> between enterprises and banks was held on this site.  Since July of that year, its rate was used by the Central Bank for quoting the ruble against foreign currencies.  Here, for the first time, tenders of T-bills were held.  In the mid-90s, preparations began for transactions with corporate securities and futures.  In August 2006, the MICEX accounted for 95% of trades in Russian companies and 69% of the global volume.  The volume of transactions reached 20.4 trillion rubles.  Gradually, the MICEX network of partners spread throughout the Russian Federation.  One of them is the Siberian Interbank Currency Exchange.  In January 2015, the IMB was nationalized in the ARC. </p>

    <p>  Until 1998, the purchase and sale of monetary units from around the world took place in the form of auctions.  The seller sold dollars, marks, pounds and francs for the national currency through competitive bidding.  Now they go online through SELT at 8 sites.  Based on these transactions, the exchange rate of the Interbank Currency Exchange is formed.  With the increase in trading volumes, a ‚Äúpayment versus payment‚Äù risk management system appeared. </p><h2>  Stock market </h2><p>  This is the largest trading platform on which securities are sold.  98% of transactions in the domestic stock market take place here.  In circulation are more than 1,500 different securities.  The total capitalization of issuers is 29 trillion rubles. </p>
