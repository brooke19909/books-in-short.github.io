Photos of this metropolis give the impression of a romantic and very beautiful place.  And not in vain.  Seventy thousand tourists visit Quebec every year.  In this article you will find not only a description of the numerous attractions of the city.  We will give a couple of useful tips on where to stay, how to get around and what to try in Quebec. </p><p>  The history of this city is very entertaining and full of exciting events.  Quebec is the capital of the province of the same name.  Although not the largest city in the region.  In terms of population, Montreal overtakes it three times with its indicator of 1,670,000 people (against 508,000 in Quebec).  Therefore, the capital gloss does not interfere with the chamber, almost homely atmosphere of the "metropolis".  Other cities in the province of Quebec - Laval, Gatineau, Longueuil and others - are very small settlements with a population of one hundred and three hundred thousand inhabitants.  The capital plays a huge role in the Canadian economy.  It is the fourth city in terms of living after Saskatoon, Calgary and Edmonton.  Here is the lowest unemployment rate.  And Quebec is the third most important seaport in the country. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Quebec is a city lying on the north bank <span>of the St. Lawrence River,</span> closer to the mouth.  This location gave the city a name.  According to one version, the narrowing of the channel in the language of the Algonkin Indians is called kebek.  The future city was laid in the place where the river, on the contrary, expands, and the mouth turns into a estuary.  The province, whose capital is Quebec, is bordered by four US states (Vermont, New York, New Hampshire and Maine) and three Canadian territories (these are Newfoundland, Ontario and New Brunswick). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Quebec there is an international airport.  Jean Lesage, where flights arrive from major cities of the country, as well as from New York, Chicago, Detroit, Paris.  Quebec's air gate is twenty minutes from the center.  You can overcome this distance by taxi.  This pleasure is estimated at a fixed amount - thirty two and a half dollars.  Several times a day, the city bus number 78 runs to the airport. A ticket will cost two and a half dollars. </p><p>  Quebec can also be reached by train - from Montreal, Toronto and Windsor.  The main bus station is located in the same building as the central railway station.  Orleans Express and Interstar cars arrive between different cities of Canada.  In summer, there is a ferry from Montreal to Quebec.  The journey by water will take almost seven hours, but such a journey is already a tourist attraction. </p>

    <h2>  Best time to visit </h2><p>  Quebec is Canada‚Äôs largest area.  It occupies four climatic zones: arctic, tundra, temperate continental and marine.  In the latter, the breath of the Atlantic Ocean softens the summer heat and winter cold.  But where the city of Quebec is located, the climate is temperate continental.  This means that the winters are harsh.  Minus fifteen is a common thing for January in Quebec.  And in the coldest month - February - the thermometer can drop even below forty degrees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Spring in these places is very short and rainy.  A week or two - and the population is changing warm boots for sandals.  The summer in Quebec is very hot.  High humidity (eighty percent) makes the heat unbearable.  The best time to visit the city is the so-called Native American summer.  This is September and early October.  During this period, which we commonly call the Indian summer, clear and warm weather sets in Quebec, quite comfortable for excursions and leisurely walks around the city.  What follows is the same as spring, short autumn in duration.  The first snow usually falls by the end of October.  In winter, storms and storms are frequent, accompanied by heavy snowfalls and blizzards. </p>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  One of the oldest European settlements on the North American continent is Quebec City.  Canada was not a state then, but a locality.  Its name was translated from Native American languages ‚Äã‚Äãas "villages."  And the province of Quebec occupied a narrow strip along the St. Lawrence River, which was processed by the first settlers from France.  On July 3, 1608, the city was founded by Samuel de Champlain, who first wanted to call him Louis, in honor of the king. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Quebec was built not from scratch, but on an abandoned settlement of the Iroquois, which was called the Stadacon.  Therefore, when the city became the capital of the province, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreturning the old historical name to it was seriously considered.  Samuel de Champlain was his manager until his death.  Quebec, the capital city of New France, has become a <span>bone of contention</span> in three major battles.  As a result, in 1763, he, along with the entire province, went to Britain.  When the United States began a struggle for separation from England, unrest was also observed in Quebec.  American revolutionaries attacked the British garrison, but were defeated.  Thus, Quebec and its province have expressed their will not to enter the newly formed state of the United States.  Now these territories are occupied mainly by the French-speaking population. </p>

    <h2>  Quebec City: Where to Stay </h2><p>  There is no shortage of hotels in this capital of the <span>Canadian province</span> - from budget hostels to luxury hotels.  If you plan to stay in Quebec for a long time, then it is best to look at the apartments (residences).  In this case, we can recommend Universite Laval.  If you rent an apartment in such a residence for a period of more than four weeks, then a day will cost you eleven dollars. </p><p>  The budget hotel in Quebec is the Auberge de Junesse.  A room with a kitchenette and breakfast will cost only $ 20.  In the Old Town there is a wonderful family hotel, Hotel du View Quebec.  The price from 96 to 266 dollars per room is quite acceptable, given that this place is a couple of steps from all the significant sights, museums, banks and shops.  Not the most expensive, but the most photographed hotel in North America is Le Chateau Frontenac.  This hotel, stylized as an old castle, is rightfully proud of the city of Quebec (Canada).  Hotels, the photos of which look pretty nice, can not be compared with this picturesque and proud citadel.  Frontenac Castle is visible from anywhere in Quebec.  It is the oldest hotel in the city.  A night in this hotel will cost you from three hundred dollars.  But, however, the hotel often offers discounts. </p>

    <h2>  How to get around the city </h2><p>  Local authorities are very promoting a healthy lifestyle and environmental protection.  Therefore, to move in a car in the center is sheer torment.  The streets are often <span>one-way.</span>  Paving stones and expensive parking complete the negative driving experience.  Quebec is a leisurely city.  There are no running crowds like in New York.  Public transport, represented by buses and shuttles, runs infrequently, but clearly on schedule.  A ticket costs $ 2.5 and is valid for two hours after purchase.  You can buy a ticket - for one day or for a whole month. </p><p>  For residents and tourists there is a wide network of bike paths.  We can say that Quebec is a city of cyclists.  At least from April to October, the number of people pedaling on two-wheeled vehicles of various (sometimes very original) designs significantly prevails over motorists.  In the city, which is the twin city of Russian St. Petersburg, they plan to introduce (or rather, renew) a tram service.  The bridges of Pierre Laporte, Quebec and Orleans are thrown across the <span>St. Lawrence River</span> .  A <span>ferry service</span> has been established with the Levi area on the south coast <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Quebec City: Attractions </h2><p>  The entire old part of this first settlement of Europeans on the St. Lawrence River is fully included in the UNESCO list.  Most tourists are impressed by the European appearance of this city in the New World.  As if traveling in Lyon or Brussels!  Maybe, by a wave of a magic wand, we were transported to "old Europe"?  But no, it's Canadian Quebec.  Photos of the city show that there are many winding, cobblestone streets, beautiful houses, ancient castles. </p><p>  It is recommended to start acquaintance with Quebec with Place Royal.  In this square back in 1608, Samuel de Champlain laid the first stone of the city.  Next, it is worth hiring a horse-drawn carriage to drive through all the significant places in the Old City.  Then it would be nice to take a ferry ride to Levy - not to get to the area on the south bank of the St. Lawrence River, but to take panoramic photos of Quebec from the surface of the water.  Well, now you can get acquainted with the sights of the city closely. </p><p>  You can not miss the change of the guard of honor at the Citadel.  It runs daily at ten in the morning.  Guardsmen in funny fur hats still guard the gates of Saint-Louis and Saint-Jean, leading to the Old City.  Even if you were not lucky enough to be a guest of Frontenac Castle, you should still go up to this hotel on the old Quebec funicular.  And, of course, we must not forget about the main sacred structures of the city.  This is the basilica of Notre Dame de Victoire.  Until the 60s of the twentieth century, the province of Quebec was under the great influence of the Roman Church.  The city has preserved the buildings of Jesuit monasteries, ursulins and other orders. </p>

    <h2>  Museums </h2><p>  The nuns left a good memory in the hospital for the poor, where they served as carers.  Now the Hotel Dieu has been turned into a museum.  Its exposition is dedicated to the charitable activities of Augustinian women.  The museum of Ursulines testifies to the clerical past of Quebec.  The National Gallery of Fine Arts holds in its collections paintings by Canadian and European artists of various periods.  This museum is worth a visit, especially since admission there is free.  The citadel can also surprise with its exposure. </p><p>  The Museum of First Nations recalls the fact that Quebec (the city), Canada and other lands were the abode of indigenous peoples.  Its exposition is decorated in the style of the culture of the Indigenous Indians.  There is also the Historical Museum of the 400th anniversary of the city and other interesting places.  It is worth returning again to the Royal Square in order to pay closer attention to the huge murals on one of the houses. </p><h2>  Events </h2><p>  Each year, in early February, hundreds of sculptors come to the winter carnival in Quebec.  Photos of the city flash not only in local, but also in international news.  Still - after all, the Place Jacques-Cartier in Quebec grows a real palace of ice.  All week, sculptors compete with each other in the skill of carving masterpieces of art from cold shining blocks.  And as part of the winter carnival, swimming in the snow is provided (and there is traditionally a lot of it in Canada), three parades and canoe races. </p><p>  Festival d'ete starts in mid-July.  It lasts eleven days.  But, unlike the winter, the entrance to the summer festival is paid.  To listen to musicians of the first magnitude, who have gathered from all over the world in Quebec, you need to spend forty-five dollars.  A badge-shaped ticket is valid for all eleven days.  All summer from Thursday to Sunday on the streets of Quebec, you can participate in the Edwin-Belanger Bandstand Festival.  Jazz and blues are everywhere these days.  The festival "New France" starts in the first weekend of August.  Overwhelmed by nostalgia, residents dress in ancient costumes of those times and stage parades.  At the end of August, an international competition of military bands is held. </p>

    <h2>  What to try </h2><p>  Do not think that the cuisine of this part of Canada is a complete copy of the French.  Yes, the city of Quebec (reviews of tourists repeatedly mention this) is famous for its cheeses.  Thanks to the Canadian climate, local Camembert and Brie are more characteristic.  These cheeses are considered the best in all of North America.  And, of course, you need to try traditional French pancakes in some creperia.  But Quebec is able to surprise the gourmet and exotic.  At Old Canadians Restaurant you can enjoy amazing dishes from wapiti deer, caribou and buffalo.  If you come to this place before six in the evening, you can order a comprehensive Canadian-style dinner for twenty-five dollars. </p><p>  You can taste seafood, huge lobsters and a filet mignon melting in your mouth at Le Continental.  Fine French cuisine will be accompanied by fine wines and a cozy, stylish atmosphere.
