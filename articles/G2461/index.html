Scientists, researchers and archaeologists around the world for many years studying the most interesting of them.  Something was created by Mother Nature, and something was created by ancient people.  All this causes incredible interest.  But far from all the questions we get answers.  Let's make our own small review, which will include only the most amazing places on the planet that attract the eye and make you think about their origin. </p><h2>  Sphinx in Giza </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amazing places of the planet" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19732/526521.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  We begin our story with the Sphinx in Giza.  It may seem incredible to many that this building is made of a monolithic part of the rock.  This giant reaches 60 feet in height, 20 in width, and 240 in length.  It is hard to imagine how many people or what technology the Egyptians used to create such a masterpiece.  Today, almost all scientists agreed that the Sphinx plays a purely symbolic role.  Statues were mainly installed near temples, tombs, as well as pyramids.  The Sphinx is a vivid example of this; it is installed near the pyramid of Hafra.  According to most researchers, the face of this particular person is shown by a statue.  Many are still puzzling over who and when such a giant was erected.  Many call the figure in 2500 years BC.  e.  But the biggest mystery remains how the Sphinx was built.  Even in our time it will be very difficult to make such a statue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Stonehenge, England </h2><p>  This is perhaps the most mystical and mysterious historical monument that you can imagine.  For the first time, scientists began his research in the Middle Ages.  Even then it was believed that this is a very old building.  Stonehenge is located near London, 130 kilometers to the south-west.  If you describe the most amazing places in the world that were known to mankind, then this stone megalithic building will be among the leaders.  As a result of thousands of studies, scientists came to the conclusion that Stonehenge was built as a monument.  It is located near several hundred grave hills.  But it‚Äôs hard to say who these people were: ordinary slaves or nobles.  Some scholars are inclined to believe that this place was sacred.  Here people were healed spiritually and atone for their sins before the gods.  But all this is only speculation, the real secret is hidden from humanity forever. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most amazing places on the planet" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19732/526530.jpg" width="484"></div>

    <h2>  Great Barrier Reef </h2><p>  If there are amazing places on the planet whose photos are simply mesmerizing, then this is the BBR - the largest <span>coral reef</span> formation on the whole planet Earth.  Along the tropical coast of Australia is this huge system of living organisms.  The length of the reef is almost 3,000 kilometers.  There are approximately 900 islands, as well as 3 thousand different reefs.  This is one of the most beautiful natural wonders that humanity has ever known.  The cleanest Coral Sea makes this place a real paradise for scuba divers and divers.  The incredible fabulous underwater world attracts a huge number of tourists from all over the world.  It is noteworthy that the water here is always the same temperature.  When it becomes at least 1-2 degrees colder or warmer, the reefs begin to die. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amazing places of the world" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19732/526532.jpg" width="600"></div>

This natural phenomenon captivates the views of tourists, as it flows from one of the highest cliffs in a small stream.  The waterfall got its name due to the fact that its stream resembles a dragon's wriggling tail. </p><p>  Literally 10 kilometers south is another creation of mother nature - Angel Falls.  It is the largest in the whole world, so at least once it is worth a look at this miracle.  These two waterfalls share the same valley.  It is impossible not to mention the Socha River, which is located in Italy and Slovenia at the same time.  Locals nicknamed this natural miracle the Turquoise River.  The uniqueness of this place is that along its entire length the river has a turquoise color that attracts the eye.  It is necessary to visit this place if only because you can enjoy all the beauty of the Slovenian Alps and at the same time go deep into the valley, from where Sochi originates. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amazing places of the planet photo" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19732/526595.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Torah Well - a unique natural formation </h2><p>  To see this miracle, you need to get into Oregon, which is washed by the Pacific waters.  There are a lot of wonderful places here, starting from untouched forests and ending with mountain peaks.  But all this pales against the backdrop of such a natural phenomenon as the Well of Torah.  This unique place is located on a cape called Perpetua.  This natural anomaly is a stone funnel, which is located near the ocean.  This place turns into a magic fountain during high tides and strong winds.  Most impressions can be obtained when water flows into the funnel.  As a result, it seems that this is the entrance to the underground gate, although in fact the depth is only a few meters.  This place is a real paradise for photographers.  Many people come here for the sake of the next unique shot.  If we list all the amazing places on the planet whose photos were taken under extreme conditions, then the Well of Thor will probably come first.  By the way, this place got its name for a long time.  According to legend, there was a couple in love.  Once a girl was jealous of her fianc√©e and took his life.  Thor, seeing everything that was happening, turned the youth‚Äôs blood into lava, which burned a <span>large hole</span> in this place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most amazing places on the planet photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19732/526534.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sak-Aktun - an incredible underground river </h2><p>  Mexico has the longest <span>underground river</span> in the world on <span>the Yucatan Peninsula</span> .  Its total length is 20,000 kilometers.  Currently, no more than 2-3% of the underground world of this place has been studied.  According to scientists, he is at least 65 million years old.  A system of underground rivers formed, most likely due to the fall of a large meteorite, the crater from which eventually filled with water.  Tourists from all over the world come here to see the most amazing places on the planet.  Aesthetes find in Sak-Aktun those unique shots that cannot be obtained anywhere else, and extreme divers can enjoy all the beauty of this place.  What is unique is that, regardless of the time of year, the water temperature here is 23-24 degrees Celsius.  According to many tourists, here under water are the most amazing places on the planet, photos of which everyone wants to make. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amazing places on planet earth" class="if" height="241" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19732/526591.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Mount Ararat and its secrets </h2><p>  This amazing place is located in Armenia.  Not far from each other, at a distance of 11 kilometers, there are two mountains: Big and <span>Small Ararat.</span>  The first rises 5165 meters above sea level, the second - at 3 927. Until now, scientists do not know when the last volcanic massif erupted, there are suggestions that this was back in the 3rd millennium BC.  But what causes the greatest surprise and attracts researchers from all over the world is the legend that Noah's Ark is located on Great Ararat.  Back in the 15th century, Marco Polo, who saw the most diverse amazing places on the planet, with a description of Ararat and Noah's ark returned home.  According to his records, it is there, under the thick snows, that the remains of the ark are located.  The lieutenant of the Russian army back in 1916 equipped an expedition to the top of Ararat.  There he was discovered.  He was photographed in parts, measured, but as a result of the revolution, all the data was lost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amazing places of the planet with a description" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19732/526594.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We have not considered all the most amazing places on the planet.  There are so many of them.  Each country marked on the map has its own unique places, which were built as a result of the works of ancient peoples.  But much has been done by nature itself.  It's hard to take your eyes off such places, because these are real masterpieces.  Much has not yet been explored and shrouded in secrets.  Scientists studied something far and wide, but did not find the necessary answers.  Every year, there are all new natural anomalies that have no logical explanation.  All this suggests that there are such amazing places in the world whose secret has sunk into oblivion.  And all that remains for a man is to enjoy their beauty and reflect on the origin. </p>
