What to do?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  People started using headphones right after the invention of the radio.  In the first receivers, sound vibrations were heard through <span>headphones.</span>  They consisted of two cups and a bow, worn on the head and covered the ears.  These headphones did not fall out of your ears. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ojcommerce.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Over-ear headphones" class="if uuid-2501884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88575/2501884.jpg"></div><p>  These devices were originally used for military purposes.  Only a few years later they began to be used in ordinary life.  For example, for simultaneous translation and recording of songs.  To do this, they began to attach a microphone to the headphones in order to be able to hear their speech. </p><h2>  Open earphones </h2><p>  The revolution in the development of these devices was the invention of open <span>types of headphones.</span>  In the 2000s, the first "barrels" appeared - models that allow you to insert a nozzle into each ear. </p><p>  Their appearance is associated with the proliferation of mobile gadgets.  They gave people the opportunity to listen to music on the street, while jogging and traveling.  But alas, such headphones fall out of your ears. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In-ear headphones" class="if uuid-2501880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88575/2501880.jpg"></div><h2>  Rules for wearing a vacuum headphone </h2><p>  The described device is an invention that made human life much brighter and more interesting.  But many music lovers are forced to abandon this device due to the fact that it impairs hearing.  After all, people often wear them wrong: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  You need to know that you can not turn on the headphones at full volume and listen to music in them for a long period. </li><li>  If the vacuum headphones are not worn correctly in the ears, a plug is formed, as the nozzles push sulfur into the ear canal, which in excessive quantities impairs hearing. </li></ul><p>  In addition, vacuum headphones often fall out of your ears.  What to do to fix it? </p><ol><li>  Placement of the device should begin with a light pushing the earpiece deep into the ear. </li><li>  The device must be securely fixed there.  In the absence of this, the sound quality will deteriorate significantly: low-frequency bass will be heard worse, and extraneous noise from the street - on the contrary, better.  By the way, if you insert the headphones incorrectly, you can feel a headache.  This leads to irritability and fatigue. </li><li>  It is essential that you wear ear pads that fit perfectly in your ear.  They should not enter the ear canal too tightly or fall out. </li><li>  The earphone is inserted into the ear in a smooth twisting motion.  In this case, you need to feel how the pad fills the ear canal. </li><li>  After use, the device must be carefully pulled out of the ear.  If it is pulled out sharply, then the pad may get stuck, and only a doctor can remove it. </li><li>  Periodically overlays need to be changed.  After all, they wear out over time.  You also need to properly position the device - if this is a standard modification, then it is inserted into the ear canal at a right angle.  If this is a rotated device, then the wire will be behind the ear. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.wired.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to wear headphones" class="if uuid-2502499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/2502499.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of Headphones </h2><p>  Why does the earphone fall out of my ear?  As a rule, this is due to improper wearing of the device.  You should consider the type of device purchased.  The most famous types of headphones are in-ear plugs and droplets.  They are very convenient and compact in size, but they also have disadvantages. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>In-ear headphones</span> fall out of ears.  Droplets are inserted tightly only when choosing the right ear pads, but this is not obtained at all.  Therefore, they also slip out of the ear. </p><h2>  What to do if headphones fall out of your ears </h2><p>  Some modifications of in-ear headphones solve this problem in an original way.  They are designed to be worn with the cable up.  Then the entire load will fall on the replaceable wire, and the headphones will last longer.  Another feature associated with this wearing: the size of the headphones can be much larger, which allows you to place several emitters in the case. </p><div class="photo" data-original="expreso.cl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inverted Headphones" class="if uuid-2501894" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88575/2501894.jpg"></div><p>  So the wire is also positioned in reinforcing devices.  When inverted, it is possible to hang them on the ears, the result will be the same as when wearing on the neck. </p><p>  Not only high-end headphones are designed for similar wearing.  Inverted models exist for some budget manufacturers.  These models are distinguished by the fact that they denser fill the auricle. </p><p>  By the way, standard headphones can also be worn in the opposite way: by turning them over and putting the cable in your ear.  True, some modifications do not allow this, but more often than not, any model can be worn on the ears without fear of accidentally stretching it, for example, at a difficult moment in training.  Such devices guarantee a tight fit in the ear canals under heavy loads, so that headphones rarely fall out of your ears. </p>
