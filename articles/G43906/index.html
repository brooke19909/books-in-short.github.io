    <p>  The civil war <span>in Spain</span> began as a result of social, cultural, political and economic contradictions and was the biggest shock for the country, because then its fate was determined.  It was a confrontation between totalitarian forces and Republicans defending democracy, at the very time when there was a clash of communism, democracy and fascism throughout Europe, resulting in its split.  The call for help from countries that were on opposite sides of the <span>international conflict</span> formed the basis for the internationalization of the latter. </p><p>  Thus, the Spanish Civil War is a struggle between the left government (with the support of the USSR) and the right forces (with the support of Italy and Germany), which ended with the establishment of a fascist order in the country. </p><p>  When the Popular Front parties that subsequently created the Republican government won the <span>Spanish parliamentary</span> elections in 1936, right-wing forces led by Franco began to prepare a coup.  Soon, riots were held in the Canary <span>Islands, Spanish</span> Morocco and Spain.  These rebellions were crushed, but Germany and Italy provided assistance to the rebels, sending them their so-called volunteers. </p><p>  The Spanish Civil War aroused high public interest throughout the world.  At first, France supported the republican government, but soon it sided with the Nazis.  And already in the summer of 1936, twenty-seven countries, most of which actually supported the right-wing <span>forces of Spain,</span> chose a policy of ‚Äúnon-intervention‚Äù.  Italy and Germany in every possible way contributed to the creation of a new source of war, and the USSR protested against interference in military operations in favor of the rebels.  In addition, the Soviet Union, along with fifty-three other countries, provided volunteers to support Republicans. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The war in Spain contributed to the signing of the German-Italian Union in Berlin, one of the goals of which was the conduct of hostilities against this country, and a month later the Anti-Comintern Pact was signed between Germany and Japan, the essence of which was the struggle against communism, and in November 1937, Italy joined this pact. </p><p>  Meanwhile, near Madrid, the Nazis were defeated, which led to increased assistance to their allies.  <span>Spanish cities</span> suffered the bombing of German aircraft.  Western states strongly supported Franco, and already in February 1939 they proclaimed a fascist order in the country.  In the spring of the same year, Madrid was captured by the rebels, the republic collapsed.  Spain, in which the civil war lasted from 1936 to 1939, lost more than four hundred thousand people, almost all major cities, roads, bridges and public utilities were destroyed. </p><p>  Thus, the political unity of Germany, Japan and Italy changed the nature of the struggle.  The civil war in Spain over time has become, on the one hand, revolutionary and, on the other, conservative, and has become international. </p><p>  Through the efforts of the countries in which fascism reigned, the Spanish Republic was defeated, which was a step towards the start of the Second World War by Germany in five months, since these military operations were included in the plans for the conquest of world domination.  However, all these events led to conclusions about the changes during the fighting that have occurred since the <span>First World War.</span> </p><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the main problem of the last century was the problem of war and peace.  In addition, history has constantly sent trials to mankind in the form of regional confrontations.  It was in the twentieth millennium that third forces intervened in these armed conflicts, which contributed to the revival of global conflicts. </p>
