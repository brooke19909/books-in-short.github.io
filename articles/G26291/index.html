    <p>  The hotel, although not very large, but the territory on which it is located is spacious and all planted with trees.  In summer it is just paradise.  In the shade you can hide from the unbearable heat. </p><p>  You can safely go here with children.  For them there is a playground with a swing and a sandbox.  Adults can enjoy relaxing in the gazebos. </p><p>  The pebble beach is 20 meters from the fence.  The hotel offers sunbeds for free use.  Changing cabins are also available, although a bit non-standard.  The sea is just gorgeous.  The first three meters the bottom is pebble, then sand.  The water is clear. </p><p>  Prices here are not very high, especially when compared with other similar hotels in Abkhazia.  The rooms are spacious, but the only drawback is the poor soundproofing.  With neighbors, you can safely communicate through the wall.  The room has a TV, a small refrigerator.  There is always hot water.  But you need to clean the rooms yourself or ask the staff. </p><p>  The food at the hotel is gorgeous.  All dishes are prepared very high quality and with a soul.  The main thing is that all these goodies are served on the table with lightning speed.  The waitresses are incredibly nimble.  Food prices are reasonable. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings can be noted the lack of drinking water throughout, a small refrigerator in the room, problems with cleaning. </p><p>  But in this place you can definitely have a good rest.  It is quiet, calm and the sea is close. </p><h2>  Mini-hotel "Argo": detailed description </h2>
