The discontent generated by many problems, both in the political and social spheres, has grown into a revolution.  Unrest increased.  The monarch could no longer handle the situation.  He had to compromise, which was the beginning of the end of the empire. </p><h2>  The internal premises of the revolution </h2><p>  Residents of a huge state were dissatisfied with the conditions of their residence and work on many issues.  The revolution of 1905-1907  covered all classes of Russia.  What exactly could unite people from different social groups and ages? </p>

    <ol><li>  Peasants had almost no rights.  Despite the fact that this group of the population made up the majority of the inhabitants of the Russian Empire (70%), they were begging and starving.  This situation highlighted the agrarian question. </li><li>  The supreme power did not seek to limit its powers and carry out a number of liberal reforms.  At that time, the ministers of Svyatopolk-Mirsky and Witte put forward their projects for consideration. </li><li>  The working question remained acute.  Representatives of the working class complained that there was no one to take care of their interests.  The state did not interfere in the relationship between the subordinate and the employer.  Entrepreneurs often used this and created favorable working and payment conditions only for themselves.  As a result, the revolution in Russia set itself the goal of resolving this. </li><li>  The discontent of the inhabitants of the empire, on whose territory there were 57% of non-Russian citizens, intensified due to an unresolved <span>national issue.</span>  Forced Russification did not go as calmly as the authorities imagined. </li></ol><p>  As a result, a small spark instantly turned into a flame that swept the most remote corners of the empire.  Treason on the part of some high military officials also played a significant role.  It was they who provided the revolutionaries with weapons and tactical recommendations and determined the outcome of the case, even before the outbreak of popular unrest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  External causes of the revolution </h2><p>  The main external reason was the defeat of the empire in the Russo-Japanese War in 1904.  Failures at the front gave rise to discontent of that part of the population who hoped for a successful outcome of hostilities - soldiers, their relatives. </p>

    <p>  According to an unofficial version, Germany was very afraid of the growing power of Russia, so she sent spies who nagged the local population and spread rumors that the West would help everyone. </p><h2>  Bloody sunday </h2><p>  The main event, which shook the social foundations, is considered to be a peaceful demonstration on Sunday, the ninth of January 1905.  Later this Sunday will be called "bloody". </p><p>  The peaceful demonstration of peasants and workers was led by the priest and active public figure Georgy Gapon.  The protesters planned to arrange a personal meeting with Nikolai II.  They were heading to the Winter Palace.  In total, about 150,000 people gathered in the center of the then capital.  No one imagined that a revolution would begin in Russia. </p><p>  Officers came out to meet the workers.  They began to demand that the protesters stop.  But the demonstrators did not obey.  The officers began firing weapons to disperse the crowd.  The military, who did not have rifles, beat people with sabers and whips.  That day 130 people were killed and 299 wounded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The king was not even in the city during all these events.  He prudently left the palace with his family. </p><p>  Society could not forgive the tsarist government for so many innocently killed citizens.  Together with the <span>priest Gapon,</span> who survived that Sunday, plans began to prepare for the overthrow of the monarchy. </p>

    <h2>  The uprising on "Potemkin" </h2><p>  One of the turning points of the revolution was the rebellion on the largest Russian battleship - ‚ÄúPrince Potemkin of Tauride‚Äù.  The uprising took place on June 14, 1905.  The crew of the battleship totaled 731 people.  Among them were 26 officers.  The crew members closely communicated with the workers at the shipyards.  From them they adopted the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãstrikes.  But decisive action the team began only after they were served rotten meat for lunch. </p><p>  This has become the main reference point.  During the strike, 6 officers were killed and the rest were detained.  The Potemkin team ate breadcrumbs and water, standing under the red flag for 11 days on the high seas, after which they surrendered to the Romanian authorities.  Their example was adopted on the "George the Victorious", and later on the cruiser "Ochakov". </p><h2>  Climax </h2><p>  Of course, it was impossible to predict the results of the revolution of 1905-1907 at that time.  But when in the fall of 1905 a large-scale All-Russian strike took place, the emperor was forced to listen to the people.  The printers started it, and workers from other trade unions supported it.  The government issued a decree stating that from now on some political freedoms were granted.  The emperor also gave the green light to the creation of the State Duma. </p>

    <p>  The granted freedoms suited the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, who took part in strikes.  For them, the revolution ended at that time. </p><h2>  RSDLP </h2><p>  The revolution was just beginning for the radicals.  In December of the same year, members of the RSDLP organized an uprising with weapons on the streets of Moscow.  At this stage, the results of the revolution of 1905-1907.  replenished with the published law on elections to the first State Duma. </p><p>  Having achieved active action from the authorities, referring them to the results of the revolution of 1905-1907, representatives of the <span>workers' party</span> no longer wanted to stop.  They expected the results of the work of the State Duma. </p><h2>  Activity decline </h2><p>  The period from 1906 to the first half of 1907 is characterized by relative calm.  The State Duma, which mainly included the Cadets, set to work, becoming the main legislative body.  In February 1907, a new <span>State Duma</span> was created <span>, the second</span> in a row, consisting essentially of leftists alone.  They were dissatisfied with her, and after only three months of work, the Duma was dissolved. </p>

The monarch remained in power. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the main results of the Russian revolution of 1905-1907 can be called significant and fateful.  They not only drew the line of the absolute power of the emperor, but also made millions pay attention to the terrifying state of the economy, the belated technical progress and the underdevelopment of the army of the Russian Empire in comparison with other states. </p>
