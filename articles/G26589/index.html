Choosing a good place!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As soon as summer comes, everyone strives to do two things: get a vacation and go somewhere for a swim.  And it is not known what we want more, because one is directly related to the other.  Today it is difficult to find a person who would refuse to relax on a <span>sunny beach:</span> warm sand, gentle sea, light breeze ... This is perhaps the dream of any of us. </p><p>  With the onset of the summer season, many services have ‚Äúfun days‚Äù: sanitation workers need to check the water for the presence of bacteria and viruses in it, beach workers - to clean the area.  Naturally, the beaches are carefully checked before the opening of the swimming season.  In addition, the depth of the reservoirs is determined, and buoys are installed in the deepest places.  And now - crowds of swimmers, hurrying to plunge into the cool water as soon as possible. </p>

This is especially true of foreigners who have just visited this amazing city with a long history.  It is for such guests of the northern capital that we will conduct a brief excursion and tell you where to swim in St. Petersburg, as well as what rules should be followed.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To start with the rules of conduct on the beaches.  Even if you install stands and posters with <span>safety</span> rules <span>on the water</span> through every meter, swimmers still do not pay any attention to them.  But in vain!  Remember that the question: "Where to swim in St. Petersburg?"  is not a priority, because you can always find a place.  But without knowing (or not adhering) to the rules of behavior in water, you can get into a very unpleasant situation.  So, one of the main requirements when bathing is not to go far.  If you feel that you are not good at water, do not try to <span>show yourself as a</span> hero.  It‚Äôs better to have a bottom for safety under your feet.  Naturally, it is strictly forbidden to take alcoholic or <span>energy drinks</span> before swimming.  Firstly, because alcohol affects common sense, and secondly, heart problems can occur.  In any case, try to refrain from picnics with alcohol near the river. </p>

At the moment, 25 recreation areas are registered in the city.  However, on some of them you can only get a tan, as it is forbidden to enter the water.  Others, on the contrary, are complex, allowing you to swim and sunbathe on the beach.

It was about them that they sang in the famous song "For a Week ...".  The level of service here can be called one of the best in the city.  There is also a cafe with soft drinks and fruit cocktails, and rental sun loungers, and even dry closets.  As they say, everything you need for a good vacation.  In the Vyborg district of St. Petersburg, you can also visit several beaches, tasting delicious cakes, french fries and fried chicken.  When wondering where to swim in St. Petersburg, remember the Kronstadt beach.  It combines both active and passive rest.  Here you can not only get a great tan, but also participate in "races" on catamarans, as well as rent an inflatable boat.  Since the lake near the beach is simply huge, some people choose it for fishing, going by boat straight to its center. </p>

This is a great place for picnics and family vacations.  If you are not inclined to carry huge packages of food, you can dine in a good restaurant near the complex.
