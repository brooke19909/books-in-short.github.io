    <h2>  Who can get a credit card at Sberbank? </h2><p>  Based on the requirements of Sberbank, the Momentum credit card can be issued by citizens aged 21 to 65 years.  In addition, in order to receive plastic you must have a permanent registration and citizenship of the Russian Federation, as well as a total work experience of at least a year.  In this case, I mean the performance of your official duties over the past 5 years.  At the same time, you must work at least six months at your current place of work. </p><p>  A card is issued at the Sberbank branch on the passport. </p><h2>  Under what conditions can I use the instant card? </h2><p>  Before applying for a credit card, you need to study the conditions of its service.  So, the “Instantum” credit card (Sberbank) (cash withdrawal conditions and other payment transaction rates can be seen in the photo) does not provide for paid services as part of the pre-approved offer.  The size of the rate is from 25.9% per annum.  During the grace period, interest is not paid.  In case of non-observance of the repayment terms of obligatory payments and the amount of the loan, the cardholder will be charged a penalty of 36% per annum. </p>

    <h2>  Sberbank (credit card): cash withdrawal </h2><p>  When withdrawing cash within the limits of subsidiaries of credit organizations of the Russian Federation, as well as in Sberbank branches, a fee is charged from the client in the amount of 3% of the total amount (not less than 390 rubles).  In case of cashing of plastic in third-party financial institutions, the size of the commission increases to 4% of the amount.  In addition, when withdrawing cash, you must remember the established daily limits.  So, each owner of an instant card has every right to withdraw money through ATMs, but within 50,000 rubles. </p><p>  Sberbank “Instantum” credit cards (we examined the conditions for processing them above) allow you to cash out according to certain rules.  If money is issued at one of Sberbank's cash desks, then the limit is 150,000 rubles.  The same restriction applies to cash withdrawals through cash desks of other financial organizations.  The maximum amount when carrying out transactions on the transfer of money to replenish a credit card is 10,000,000 rubles.  Any other non-cash card transactions are carried out without commission. </p><p>  Sberbank Momentum credit card also provides for the provision of paid information.  For example, for each request through an ATM at an affordable amount of a credit limit, a bank client will be able to pay 15 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  How to fill out an application for a card online? </h2><p>  In order to fill out the application online, you must first download it.  In this form you must specify: </p><ul><li>  your contact details; </li><li>  the presence of education (secondary special, higher); </li><li>  address of the actual residence; </li><li>  marital status; </li><li>  information about the main job (individual entrepreneur, wage worker); </li><li>  position; </li><li>  terms of work in the organization you have indicated (current place of work); </li><li>  Kind of activity; </li><li>  salary, etc. </li></ul><p>  Also in the application you must indicate the name of the credit card that you plan to open in the near future.  Next, the completed and sent application will be considered by representatives of the bank.  After about 1-2 days they will give an answer. </p><h2>  What do users say about Sberbank credit cards? </h2><p>  Before applying for a particular bank card, you must first examine the reviews.  So, the credit card of Sberbank “Momentum” (reviews about it you will find in this article) has a large number of wishes and comments.  For example, some credit card holders speak about it in a positive way.  They report that they are pleased with the high speed of plastic design.  Others like the fact that a credit card can be attached to virtual wallets. </p><p>  Still others, on the contrary, are dissatisfied with the slow service of the call center employees, who, when contacting them, solved the problem of the latter slowly.  But here opinions differ.  For example, many report troubles that, thanks to the prompt intervention of bank representatives, were avoided.  In this case, we are talking about the loss or theft of a credit card abroad.  According to them, in a matter of seconds, bank employees blocked a lost or stolen card and provided the victim with the necessary amount thanks to the emergency cash assistance service. </p><p>  Many customers liked the opportunity to pay utility bills with this card, which undoubtedly eliminates the need to go to a bank or savings bank and stand in line.  However, some believe that, on the contrary, it is cheaper to make transfers through the cashier than to do it using a card, since a large commission was taken from them for a small amount of transfer. </p><p>  Quite a few people are delighted with the large grace period of 50 days when it is possible to make payments by card without interest. </p><p>  Some talk about such a positive moment, as the transfer of money from an old paper passbook to a card.  Such a service is undoubtedly convenient and very fast. </p><p>  Almost all customers are satisfied with the connection of convenient services and <span>loyalty programs,</span> fast service and high speed of receiving funds. </p><p>  In a word, each of the cardholders has something to say.  However, these reviews, as often happens, are both positive and negative.  Therefore, to get a general idea of ​​a credit card, you need to look at both of them, and only then draw a conclusion. </p>
