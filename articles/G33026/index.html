Sights and features of the city</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Spanish New York, a small European city on the territory of which many skyscrapers have grown, is considered to be Benidorm.  The sights here are usually divided into old and new, since earlier the city was an ordinary Spanish fishing village with its own special history.  Later it began to be actively built up, and nowadays it already looks like an American metropolis.  Well, we will discover for ourselves Benidorm, the sights and beauty of this region, and also consider where you can have a great rest. </p><h2>  Beautiful promenade </h2><p>  Many tourists go to Spain on vacation, not only to lie on the beaches, but also to spend several romantic evenings, walking along the picturesque streets.  One of these is the two-story Ponete embankment built in 2009, which has already become the main symbol of the city of Benidorm.  The map shows us that it has a winding line, which in its structure resembles a <span>sea ​​wave.</span>  The promenade is surrounded on the city side by exquisite restaurants where you can taste the rarest delicacies.  There are outdoor summer cafes on the beach side.  If you decide to take a walk along this promenade, you can choose the lower or upper level.  They are interconnected by many stairs, which are illuminated at night.  So this architectural masterpiece looks unusually surreal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="benidorm sights" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/555479.jpg" width="600"></div>

Spain is famous for its narrow pavement, winding streets, which are surrounded by low houses.  And the territory called Parte Vieja meets these standards.  The most interesting thing is that the most refined establishments for recreation, restaurants, coffee houses and even branded clothing stores are located in the old part of the metropolis.  You can roam the local streets endlessly, but we assure you you can never get lost in these neighborhoods.  Almost every house that gets in the way will cause great interest, and will certainly remain in your memory for a long time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="benidorm parks" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/555480.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The main church of the city </h2><p>  We continue to master the old and very beautiful Benidorm.  Its sights do not end with beautiful houses and estates.  So, following up a steep climb (everyone here knows where this street is, so you can easily find it), you will reach the Temple of San Jaime and Santa Anna.  White walls, blue domes, an architectural style characteristic of the eighteenth century - all this can be seen in one building.  The beauty of the ideal structure is complemented by the fact that it is located on a hill that literally hangs over the sea.  That is why there was built an observation deck, standing on which, you can enjoy the view of the natural beauties of the Mediterranean endlessly.  In addition, many come here in order to successfully take pictures, because the local lighting can not be compared with any other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="benidorm map" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/555484.jpg" width="600"></div>

Each of them is unusual and interesting in its own way.  We begin now with the most important, which is located in the city center.  It is famous for its ancient bullfighting site, which is surrounded by the greenery of local shrubs and trees.  For tourists who are used to having fun during their holidays, rather than visiting ancient <span>sights, the</span> Aqualandia park will be a <span>find</span> .  There are many water attractions that will appeal to both adults and children.  But those who prefer to discover new representatives of the fauna during their trips can go to the Terra Natura park.  This is one of the most accurate imitations of a real African safari in the world.  Not far from it there is another similar “zoo” - “Mundomar”.  Here tourists are presented with the rarest species of birds.  Also note that in the territory of this park water shows are held with the participation of dolphins and fur seals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beaches of benidorm" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/555481.jpg" width="591"></div>

    <h2>  Sea vacation </h2><p>  The beaches of Benidorm have recently been considered the best on the coast.  They are well-groomed, clean, the entrance to the sea is gentle, and their favorable location (as if in a bay) protects them from storms and winds.  In the city there are four recreation areas, each of which has its own characteristics.  The most important one is located in the center and stretches along the promenade of Ponete.  The infrastructure here is at a high level, the waves of the sea washed by the golden sand.  Nevertheless, there are not very many tourists going there, because if you are looking for a place that is not too crowded, then this is ideal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="benidorm spain" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/555482.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  A much more noisy beach is Playa de Levante.  It stretches along the old part of the city and annually collects millions of tourists on its open spaces.  The bottom is sandy, which is quite acceptable for relaxation. </p><h2>  The nooks of the city </h2><p>  Above were mentioned those beaches that are part of the city called Benidorm.  The attractions for which tourists from all over Europe go here are located outside it.  For example, in a cozy bay is the beach of Cala Del Tio Ximo, which is popular with nudists. </p><p>  Another secluded spot is the La Isla de Benidorm Recreation Area.  They get there most often by sea.  The only drawback is the rocky shore and a very narrow sand strip.  However, swimming, enjoying the peace and harmony with nature will certainly work here.  Have a nice rest! </p>
