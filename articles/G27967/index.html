    <h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  Like the whole of Austria, S√∂lden is full of sights and ancient objects.  In your free time from skiing, you can see, for example, the Timmelsjoch road, also known as Passo del Rhombo.  It connects the √ñtztal Valley with Passiria and Merano, located in the Italian province of Bolzano.  This is the highest mountain road in the Eastern Alps.  In S√∂lden, a <span>water mill of</span> almost two hundred years ago, which currently serves as a museum, has also been preserved.  It is worth taking a look at the monument in honor of Auguste Picard, who landed on the local Gurgl glacier on a stratosphere balloon on May 27, 1931.  In the village of Obergurgl, located nearby, there is the church of St. John of Nepomuk, which is considered the highest in Europe.  Nature lovers should take a walk in the protected relict <span>pine forest.</span>  Pines of a century ago will allow you to briefly distract from the vibrant pace of the ski resort.  The territory under the name Zirbenwald occupies twenty hectares and since 1963 is considered a national <span>natural monument.</span>  The location of the discovery of an ancient human mummy frozen in ice, which was called Etzi, also became S√∂lden, Austria.  Reviews of tourists note that a memorial sign is now installed on the glacier where the find occurred.  Finally, it is worth seeing the church on Mount Rothkegl.  As the plate installed on it says, the building was built by Hans Fender, who fulfilled the vow in gratitude for the return from captivity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="S√∂lden, Austria: reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13506/380534.jpg?1398274485896" width="600"></div>
