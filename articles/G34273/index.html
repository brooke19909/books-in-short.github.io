    <p>  However, summer is considered the best time to visit Niagara Falls, and then the natural phenomenon is shaded by the emerald green of the trees.  Although in winter, when the air temperature drops, part of the waterfall turns into huge icicles, reaching a height of several tens of meters.  They look spectacular in the neon rays of a light show that begins daily in the dark.  Against the background of the gray sky, bright fireworks explode, and multi-colored lights are reflected in the ice belt of the cascades. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The story of the appearance of the waterfall </h2><p>  The whole world learned about the existence of a miraculous miracle after it was described in his work by researcher Louis Ennepin in 1677.  And several centuries later, when the fashion for tourism arose, the phenomenon began to enjoy extraordinary popularity, after which this area began to develop rapidly. </p>

    <p>  When did the real wonder of the world appear, the roar of which is heard at a distance of several kilometers?  More than 18 thousand years ago, a giant glacier began to melt, and powerful streams of water pushed their way into the ground.  A cliff has formed, from which the admirable waterfall collapses, rising 11 kilometers up over many years, and this movement continues today.  As scientists predict, in 50 centuries the cliff will reach <span>Lake Erie,</span> and then the natural phenomenon will disappear from the face of the earth. </p><h2>  Niagara Falls (USA): where is it located? </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the waterfall is located on Niagara, which separates the Canadian province of Ontario and New York.  Two sides are distinguished by the small island of Gout (Koziy). </p>

    <p>  On the two banks of the river, small settlements, bearing the same name - Niagara Falls, grew up.  One of them is in the state of New York, and on the opposite bank of the river is its Canadian twin brother.  Two prosperous tourist centers are connected by a bridge, along which travelers who come to enjoy Niagara Falls (USA) move.  The city of Buffalo is located just 30 kilometers from a masterpiece of nature, and the path of all tourists lies through it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Three cascades </h2><p>  In fact, the natural phenomenon consists of three waterfalls, two of which are located in American territory (American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls), and one in Canada (Horseshoe Falls).  These are wide cascades, and the volume of falling water in them is 5700 cubic meters per second.  Due to its unusual shape, the Canadian part of the powerful waterfall is called the Horseshoe, and it surpasses its American relatives in all respects. </p><h2>  Power generation </h2><p>  Much more water flows through Niagara Falls (United States of America) than through other cascades of the country, and the power of the turbulent flow has long been successfully used to <span>generate electricity.</span>  Therefore, without any exaggeration, we can say that a natural miracle is an important factor for the economic development of the country. </p><p>  Already at the end of the 19th century, the first power station appeared, destroyed after a severe landslide.  In 1961, the construction of a new hydroelectric station was completed, named after the American leader R. Moses, who implemented many projects. </p><h2>  State Protected Territory </h2><p>  This area, protected by the state since 1885, has the status of the country's oldest reserve. </p>

    <p>  All year round Niagara Falls (United States of America) is visited by tourists from around the world.  Perhaps the most popular attraction is a fascinating trip on the ships, which are called "Virgin of the Fog".  Tourists travel from two sides - the American and Canadian.  They have the opportunity to fully appreciate the greatness and strength of local attractions.  Vehicles come close enough to the waterfalls, so you need to bring a raincoat. </p><h2>  Element that does not favor the daredevils </h2><p>  Unfortunately, over the past 150 years, Niagara Falls (United States of America) has killed many daredevils who have tried to confront the elements.  Extreme sportsmen from all over the world are testing themselves, diving into the stormy streams of water.  It must be remembered that all attempts to go down the cascades are considered illegal, but new crazy people periodically appear, dreaming of glorifying their name. </p><h2>  Niagara Falls (United States): tourist reviews </h2><p>  Visitors to the natural monument admit that one cannot take their eyes off the magical beauty of the water extravaganza.  Cascades look very impressive at night, when the illumination lights up.  The play of light can be watched forever, and it is such an impressive sight that it fascinates even the most indifferent tourist.  The power of the flows is surprising, and in front of a unique phenomenon, all the illusions that a person is the king of nature disappear. </p><p>  Guests who arrived in clear weather say they saw an amazing rainbow, and not just one, but several. </p>
