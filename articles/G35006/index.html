He is associated with a national hero who fought for justice, who did not know mercy as a cruel and bloody ruler, and the well-known image from books and films draws in the imagination of the legendary bloodsucker embraced by passions.  For many who watched the popular film adaptations, blood ran cold from the horror-transmitting atmosphere, and the vampire theme, shrouded in a fleur of mystery and romance, becomes one of the main ones in cinema and literature. </p><h2>  The birth of a tyrant and a killer </h2><p>  So, the story of Vlad Dracula began in late 1431 in Transylvania, when a son was born at the heroic governor Basarab the Great, famously fighting the Turks.  I must say that this was far from the most beautiful baby, and it is with its repulsive appearance that some historians attribute the pathological manifestation of cruelty.  A boy possessing incredible physical strength with a protruding lower lip and cold eyes bulging showed unique properties: it was believed that he saw people through and through. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vlad iii chain" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1132837.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The young <span>Count Dracula,</span> whose biography was full of such terrible stories, after which he was even confused by reason, was considered an unbalanced person with many strange ideas.  From childhood, his father taught little Vlad to own weapons, and his fame as a cavalryman literally boomed throughout the country.  He swam perfectly, because in those days there were no bridges, and therefore he constantly had to swim across the water. </p><h2>  Order of the Dragon </h2><p>  Vlad II Dracul, belonging to the elite <span>knightly order of the</span> Dragon with strict military monastic orders, wore a medallion on his chest, like all its other members, in the form of a sign of his belonging to society.  But he decided not to stop there.  With his filing, images of the mythical fire-breathing animal appear on the walls of all churches and on coins that circulated in the country.  The prince received the nickname Dracula converting infidels to Christianity in the order.  It is translated from Romanian ‚Äúdragon‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle of dracula" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1132836.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Compromise solutions </h2><p>  The ruler of Wallachia - a small state located between the Ottoman Empire and Transylvania - was always ready for attacks from the Turks, but tried to compromise with the Sultan.  So, in order to maintain the state status of his country, Vlad's father paid a huge tribute to the forest and silver.  At the same time, all the princes had obligations to send their sons hostage to the Turks, and if rebellions broke out against the dominance of the conquerors, then inevitable death awaited the children.  It is known that Vlad II Dracul sent two sons to the Sultan, where for more than 4 years they were held in voluntary captivity, meaning the guarantee of a fragile peace, so necessary for a small state. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  They say that the fact of a long stay away from the family and the terrible executions witnessed by the future tyrant left a special emotional imprint on him, which was reflected in the already shaken psyche.  Living in the Sultan's court, the boy saw a manifestation of cruelty towards everyone who is obstinate and opposed to power. </p><p>  It was in captivity that Vlad III Tepes learns about the murder of his father and older brother, after which he receives freedom and the throne, but after several months he flees to Moldova, fearing for his life. </p><h2>  Cruelty coming from childhood </h2><p>  Historical chronicles are aware of the incident when a rebellion was raised in one principality, and in revenge for this, the offspring of the ruler who were held hostage were blinded.  For the abduction of food, the Turks ripped open their bellies, and for the slightest offense they put him on a stake.  Young Vlad, repeatedly forced to renounce Christianity under threat of reprisal, watched such terrible spectacles for 4 years.  It is possible that the daily rivers of blood influenced the unstable psyche of the young man.  It is believed that life in captivity was the very impetus that contributed to the appearance of animal cruelty to all naughty. </p><h2>  Vlad's nicknames </h2><p>  Born in a dynasty, on behalf of which was later named Bessarabia (ancient Romania), Vlad Tepes is referred to in documents as Basarab. </p><p>  But where did he get the nickname of Dracula - opinions differ.  2 versions are known explaining where the sovereign‚Äôs son got this name from.  The first says that the young heir was called the same as his father, but he began to add the letter ‚Äúa‚Äù at the end to the inherited nickname. </p><p>  The second version says that the word ‚Äúdracula‚Äù is translated not only as ‚Äúdragon‚Äù, but also as ‚Äúdevil‚Äù.  And that is how Vlad, known for his incredible cruelty, was called by his enemies and frightened locals.  Over time, the letter ‚Äúa‚Äù was added to the nickname Dracul for the convenience of pronunciation at the end of the word.  A few decades after his death, another nickname is ruthless killer Vlad III - Tepes, which translated from Romanian as ‚Äúgingerbread man‚Äù (Vlad Tepes). </p><h2>  Ruthless Impaler Reign </h2><p>  The year 1456 marks the beginning of not only the short reign of Dracula in Wallachia, but also very difficult times for the country as a whole.  Vlad, who was particularly ruthless, was cruel to enemies and punished for any disobedience of his subjects.  All the perpetrators died a terrible death - they were put on a stake, which differed in length and size: for commoners, low murder weapons were chosen, and the executed boyars were visible from afar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bram stoker's dracula" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1132835.jpg" width="385"></div>

    <p>  According to ancient legends, the prince of Wallachia had a special love for the groans of agonizing people and even arranged feasts in places where the unfortunate suffered from incredible torment.  And the ruler‚Äôs appetite only increased from the smell of decaying bodies and the cries of the dying. </p><p>  He was never a vampire and did not drink the blood of his victims, but he was reliably aware that he was a clear sadist who enjoyed watching the sufferings of those who did not obey his rules.  Often the executions were political in nature, retaliatory measures leading to death followed the slightest disrespect.  For example, the Gentiles, who did not remove the turban, arrived at the prince‚Äôs court, were killed in a very unusual way - by driving nails into the head. </p><h2>  Lord who has done a lot to unite the country </h2><p>  Although, as some historians say, only 10 boyars were documented to death, as a result of a conspiracy of which the father of Dracula and his elder brother were killed.  But the traditions call a huge number of its victims - about 100 thousand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lord of wallachia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1133574.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If we consider the legendary ruler from the point of view of a statesman whose good intentions to free his native country from the Turkish invaders were fully supported, then we can confidently say that he acted on the basis of the principles of honor and national duty.  Refusing to pay the traditional tribute, Vlad III Basarab creates a <span>militia</span> from among the peasants <span>,</span> which forces the Turkish soldiers, who arrived to deal with the naughty ruler and his country <span>,</span> to retreat.  And all the prisoners were executed during the city holiday. </p><h2>  Fierce religious fanatic </h2><p>  Being an extremely religious person, Tepes fanatically helped the monasteries, giving them the gift of land.  Having gained reliable support in the person of the clergy, the bloody ruler acted very far-sighted: the people were silent and obeyed, because in fact all his deeds were consecrated by the church.  It is difficult to imagine how many prayers for ruined souls were offered to the Lord every day, but sorrow did not pour out into a fierce struggle against the bloody tyrant. </p><p>  And what is surprising - his enormous piety was combined with incredible ferocity.  Wanting to rebuild his fortress, the cruel executioner gathered all the pilgrims who came to celebrate the great Easter holiday, and forced them to work for several years until their clothes decayed. </p><h2>  The policy of cleansing the country from antisocial elements </h2><p>  In a short time, he eradicates crime, and historical chronicles tell us that the gold coins left on the street continued to remain in the very place where they were thrown.  Not a single beggar or tramp, of whom there were so many in those troubled times, dared not even touch wealth. </p><p>  Consistent in all his endeavors, the ruler of Wallachia sets about implementing his plan to cleanse the country of all thieves.  Such a policy, as a result of which everyone who dared to steal, was waiting for a quick trial and painful death, bore fruit.  After thousands of deaths at the stake or chopping block, there was no one who wanted to take someone else's, and the unprecedented honesty of the population in the middle of the 15th century became a phenomenon that did not know analogues in the whole history of the world. </p><h2>  Order in the country through cruel methods </h2><p>  Mass executions, which have already become commonplace, are the surest way to gain fame and remain in the memory of posterity.  It is known that Vlad III Tepes did not like gypsies, famous horse thieves and loafers, and still in the camps he is called the mass murderer, who destroyed a huge number of nomadic people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vlad Tepes Vampire" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1133579.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It should be noted that all those who incurred the wrath of the ruler, regardless of their position in society or nationality, died a terrible death.  When Tepes learned that some merchants, in spite of the strictest ban, had established trade relations with the Turks, as a warning to all the rest, put them on a stake in a huge market square.  After that, there were no people who wanted to improve their financial situation at the expense of the enemies of Christ's faith. </p><h2>  War with Transylvania </h2><p>  But not only the Turkish sultan was dissatisfied with the ambitious ruler, the merchants of Transylvania began to threaten the power of Dracula, who did not suffer defeats.  The rich did not want to see the prince so unbridled and unpredictable on the throne.  They wanted to put on the throne their favorite - the Hungarian king, who would not provoke the Turks, endangering all neighboring lands.  Nobody needed a prolonged massacre of Wallachia with the troops of the Sultan, and Transylvania did not want to engage in an unnecessary duel, which in the event of hostilities would be inevitable. </p><p>  Having learned about the plans of a neighboring country, and even conducting trade with the Turks, which was banned on its territory, Vlad Dracula was extremely angry and dealt an unexpected blow.  The army of the bloody sovereign burned the Transylvanian lands, and locals of public weight were imprisoned. </p><h2>  12 year imprisonment of Tepes </h2><p>  This story ended disastrously for the tyrant himself.  Outraged by the cruelty, the surviving merchants turned to the last resort - the appeal of the overthrow of Tepes with the help of a printed word.  Anonymous authors wrote a pamphlet describing the ruthlessness of the ruler, and added a little from themselves about the plans of the bloody conqueror. </p><p>  Count Vlad Dracula, who is not expecting a new attack, is taken by surprise by Turkish troops in the very castle that the unfortunate pilgrims built for him.  By chance, he escapes from the fortress, leaving his young wife and all his subjects to certain death.  Outraged by the atrocities of the rulers, the European elite was just waiting for this moment, and the Hungarian king, who claimed his throne, was detained by the fugitive. </p><h2>  The death of the bloody prince </h2><p>  Tepes spends a long 12 years in prison and even becomes a Catholic for his political reasons.  Taking the forced obedience of a tyrant for humility, the king frees him and even tries to help ascend to the previous throne.  20 years after the beginning of the reign, Vlad returns to Wallachia, where he is already waiting for the angry inhabitants.  <span>The Hungarian army</span> accompanying the prince was defeated, and the king, who is not going to fight with his neighbors, decides to surrender the tyrant to the state that suffered from his atrocities.  Upon learning of this decision, Dracula runs again, hoping for a happy occasion. </p><p>  However, fortune turned away from him completely, and the tyrant accepts death in battle, only the circumstances of his death are not known.  In a fit of anger, the boyars chopped the body of the hated ruler to pieces, and his head was sent to the Turkish sultan.  Remembering the good monks, supporting the bloody tyrant in everything, quietly bury his remains. </p><p>  When, after several centuries, archaeologists became interested in the figure of Dracula, they decided to open his grave.  To everyone's dismay, it was empty, with traces of debris.  But nearby they find a strange burial of bones with an absent skull, which is considered to be the last refuge of Tepes.  To prevent the pilgrimage of modern tourists, the authorities moved the bones to one of the islands protected by monks. </p><h2>  Birth of a Legend of a Vampire Seeking New Victims </h2><p>  After the death of the Wallachian sovereign, a legend was born about a vampire who did not find shelter in heaven or hell.  Local residents believe that the spirit of the prince took on a new, no less terrible appearance and now prowls at night in search of human blood. </p><p>  In 1897, the light saw the mystical novel by Bram Stoker, describing Dracula, who rose from the dead, after which the bloodthirsty ruler was associated with a vampire.  The writer used real letters from Vlad, preserved in the chronicles, but a large amount of material was nevertheless invented.  <span>Bram Stoker's Dracula</span> appears no less merciless than his prototype, but aristocratic manners and a certain nobility make a real hero from the Gothic character, whose popularity is only growing. </p><p>  The book is seen as a symbiosis of science fiction and a horror novel in which ancient mystical forces and modern realities are closely intertwined.  According to the researchers, the memorable appearance of the conductor <span>Ferenc Liszt</span> served as an inspiration for creating the image of the protagonist, and many details were borrowed from Mephistopheles.  Stocker clearly indicates that Count Dracula receives his magical powers from the devil himself.  Vlad Tepes, who turned into a monster, does not die and does not rise from the grave, as described in the early novels about vampires.  The author makes his character a unique hero, crawling along vertical walls and turning into a bat, always symbolizing evil spirits.  Later, this little animal will be called a vampire, although he does not drink any blood. </p><h2>  Validity effect </h2><p>  The writer, who carefully studied Romanian folklore and historical evidence, creates unique material in which there is no author's narrative.  The book is only a documentary chronicles, consisting of diaries, transcripts of the main characters, which only enhances the depth of the narrative.  Creating the effect of true reality, Bram Stoker's ‚ÄúDracula‚Äù soon becomes an unofficial vampire bible, which details the rules of an alien world.  And the carefully drawn images of the characters appear alive and emotional.  It is believed that the book is an innovative art, made in the original format. </p><h2>  Adaptations </h2><p>  Soon the book will be filmed, and the writer‚Äôs friend becomes the first actor to play Dracula.  His Vlad Tepes is a vampire with noble manners and attractive appearance, although Stoker described an unpleasant old man.  Since then, the romantic image of a young handsome man has been exploited, against which the heroes unite in a single impulse to save the world from universal evil. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Count Vlad Dracula" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1132827.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p> In 1992, the director Coppola filmed the book, inviting the leading roles of famous actors, and Dracula himself was perfectly played by <span>G. Oldman.</span>  Before the filming began, the director made everyone read Stoker's book for 2 days for maximum immersion in the images.  Coppola used various techniques to make the film, like the book, as realistic as possible.  He even shot the black and white camera footage of the appearance of Dracula, which looked very reliable and frightening.  Critics considered that the vampire played by Oldman was as close as possible to Vlad Tepes, even his makeup resembled a real prototype. </p><h2>  Dracula's castle for sale </h2><p>  A year ago, the public stirred the news that a popular tourist attraction was put up for sale in Romania.  <span>The gloomy</span> Bran <span>Fort</span> , in which Tepesh allegedly slept during his military campaigns, is sold by its new owner for fabulous money.  Once the local authorities wanted to redeem Dracula's castle, and now the world-famous place, bringing fabulous profits, expects a new owner. </p><p>  According to the researchers, Dracula never stopped at the place of worship of all fans of vampire works, although local residents will vying with each other to tell chilling stories about the life of the legendary ruler in this fortress. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Count dracula Vlad chain" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1132830.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <p>  Described in the smallest details by Stoker, the castle only became the scene of a horror novel that has nothing to do with ancient Romanian history.  The current owner of the castle refers to old age, which does not allow him to conduct business.  He believes that all costs will pay off in full, because about 500 thousand tourists visit the castle. </p><h2>  Real bonanza </h2><p>  Modern Romania makes full use of the image of Dracula, attracting numerous tourist flows.  Here they will talk about ancient castles in which the bloody atrocities committed by Vlad III Tepes, even despite the fact that they were built much later than his death.  The highly profitable business, based on an unflagging interest in the mysterious figure of the ruler of Wallachia, provides an influx of sect members for whom Dracula is the spiritual leader.  Thousands of his fans make a pilgrimage to the places where he was born to breathe in one breath. </p><p>  Few people know the true history of Tepes, taking on faith the image of a vampire created by Stoker and numerous directors.  But the story of a bloody ruler who does not shun anything in order to achieve his goal begins to be forgotten over time.  And with the name Dracula, only a bloodthirsty thirst comes to mind, which is very sad, because the fantastic image has nothing to do with the real tragic person and the terrible crimes that Tepes committed. </p>
