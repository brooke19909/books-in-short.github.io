    <p>  However, there is definitely no problem with choosing this kind of technology, since today there are more than one hundred models from a bunch of manufacturers.  That's just about how not everyone knows how to connect a washing machine to the water supply.  But at the same time, I don‚Äôt want to pay to the hired craftsmen, since these ‚Äúknights of the screwdriver‚Äù tear completely unreasonable amounts for not too difficult work. </p><p>  In this case, it‚Äôs much cheaper and easier to independently understand the theoretical part of the event.  Immediately tell you that it is better to <span>change the wiring</span> in advance at least in the area where the machine will be connected (if necessary).  In addition, you will have to visit plumbing stores, as you may need quite a lot of fittings (depending on the condition of your water supply). </p><h2>  We select the "right" place </h2><p>  As you know, in an ordinary city apartment there is simply no special choice in this regard.  The following three options are considered classic: a bathroom, a toilet or a kitchen.  Note that in the toilet of most apartments you can only place models with vertical loading of linen, as for other washing machines there is simply not enough space there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  It is very important not to forget that free access to the car is necessary at any time.  This is especially true for families with small children, where washing volumes sometimes simply amaze the imagination.  Before connecting a washing machine to the water supply, it is very advisable to fill in a normal concrete base.  So you ensure its maximum stability, which is especially important for models with 3.5 kilograms of laundry. </p><h2>  Unpack the equipment correctly </h2><p>  If you didn‚Äôt get the car from the store, you can safely skip this part.  The same applies to those who have already bought a car before. </p><p>  We remind everyone else that the manufacturers of such equipment protect it from damage during transportation, providing for this special transport bolts that secure the drum.  In order not to spoil the appearance of the product and to prevent various small parts and debris from getting inside the machine, plastic caps are also included with it, which subsequently cover the bolt holes. </p><p>  The LG washing machine (the instruction to which is always included) for these purposes is generally equipped with twisting plastic caps. </p><p>  We will not describe the procedure for their removal: our material is nevertheless devoted to a slightly different topic, and you will find everything you need in the instructions for the newly purchased equipment.  Very very important!  If you do not know where these bolts are located, in no case try to turn on the machine without removing them.  The consequences may be such that they will not help you even in the service center. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="connect the washing machine to the sewer" class="if" height="496" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/434452.jpg" width="496"></div></h2><h2>  Some recommendations for operating conditions </h2><p>  Well, so how to connect a washing machine to the water supply?  Well, let's get down to describing this process. </p><p>  First of all, we note that the normal operation of this equipment is possible only under the condition of a constant and uninterrupted supply of cold water under normal pressure.  Most household washing machines are not designed to be connected to a hot water supply system, and therefore we will not talk about such cases. </p><p>  Actually, the connection to the water supply must be carried out using a special hose, which always comes with the machine you purchased.  If he simply does not reach the nearest riser with water, visit specialized stores: there are a lot of models of almost any length. </p><p>  Important!  Do not immediately grab a hose of maximum length: first read the manufacturer's recommendations.  In <span>low-cost machines,</span> sometimes it‚Äôs far from the most reliable and powerful pump, which can not cope with the load when pumping water. </p><h2>  We connect to the car and water supply </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  One end of the hose is attached to the machine itself, and you will definitely not have problems with this, since there is a special fitting in it.  <span>FUM tape</span> does not need to be used, since the connection in any case is very tight.  As for the direct connection to the water supply system, this can be done in several ways at once. </p><p>  The best and easiest way is to <span>connect the washing machine</span> to the water supply, when the plumbers have already provided for this purpose a separate adapter.  In this case, you only need a crane and a supply of FUM tape.  Pay attention to the quality of all parts, as builders often manage to save on cheap items. </p><h2>  Cast iron pipes </h2><p>  The most difficult thing is with metal water pipes, since in this case you will have to embed a tap in them, which for beginners will probably be difficult.  To do this, you need to purchase a crane, as well as a special bandage.  Please note that before tapping it into the water supply system, it is necessary to shut off the water.  Having drilled a hole, put a bandage on it, tighten the clamps, and then attach a crane to the resulting structure.  You hook the washing machine to its second exit.  There is also an option with a crane for three exits. </p>

    <p>  If the machine is in the toilet, it is best to hook the connecting tap to the inlet of the toilet flush tank.  Important!  In no case should you break the hose, twist and bend it.  All compounds are carefully insulated with FUM tape or something similar. </p><p>  Since it is your and the neighbor‚Äôs safety in terms of protection against the flood that depends on the crane, you should not save on the quality of products by buying cheap Chinese fakes.  It is best to buy taps of proven brands made of brass. </p><h2>  Other options </h2><p>  But what if, due to the small size of the apartment, you have to place the washing machine somewhere in the hallway, where there is no water supply nearby?  Of course, not everyone can afford to hollow walls and conduct pipes.  And how much will it cost if the house is old-built, and the pipes are cast-iron ... So how do you connect a washing machine to the water supply? </p>

    <p>  Need to look for an alternative.  As such, we can offer this: you buy a regular <span>garden hose</span> made of normal dense rubber, the bandage described above, as well as several clamps and a couple of ball valves.  Note that the length of the hose should not be more than five to six meters: even the most reliable Ariston washing machine (the instructions say the same) can burn out from a heavy load on the pump. </p><p>  First, we also connect to the water supply in the way that was already described above.  We catch the bandage, attach the crane.  Just put on a hose at its exit, which we already cling to the machine with a second crane. </p><h2>  What to do with ‚Äúwaste‚Äù? </h2><p>  Alas, few people think about how to <span>connect the washing machine to the sewer.</span>  Typically, the hose is attached using the plastic bracket that comes with the machine to the edge of the tub or sink.  In the toilet, its end is simply sent to the toilet.  All this is not too right from the point of view of professional plumbers, since the drains of the same shower stall or even the bath can clog very quickly from the used water, which is full of different fibers and dirt. </p><h2>  Important notes </h2><p>  It is much better and more correct to use special adapters for this purpose, connected directly to the sewer system.  It is only necessary to buy a suitable siphon and fix it, not forgetting about some rules. </p><p>  Important!  Be sure to place the siphon only over (!) The curved sections of the sink siphons, since in this case your sense of smell will be reliably protected from far from pleasant smells from the sewer.  In no case can you cut the hose into the sewer risers directly: you are not only guaranteed the smell of wastewater inside the machine and the bathroom, but also the effect of the pump, when the water pumped inside the machine will be drained into the sewer at the same time. </p><p>  Any Indesit washing machine is especially sensitive to this.  The manual says that in most models there is simply no valve that would prevent this phenomenon. </p><h2>  The electrical side of the issue </h2>

    <p>  Despite the topic of the article, it‚Äôs necessary to talk about it, since violation of the operating rules may well cost the owners not only health, but also life.  Be sure to invite a professional electrician, as for reliability you will have to route a separate cable from the shield to the machine itself, and you do not need to forget about grounding. </p><p>  Here's how to connect a washing machine.  We hope that you will succeed the first time. </p>
