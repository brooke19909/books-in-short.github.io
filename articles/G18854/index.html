LG Optimus L5 E612: specifications, photos and description of the phone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Probably the most competitive segment of the smartphone market today is the segment in which the devices running the Android operating system are located.  One of these devices is the <span>LG L5, the characteristics of</span> which will be discussed in this article in different sections. </p><p>  The competition, which was mentioned, does not allow many models to stand out from competitors absolutely advantageously only due to technical characteristics.  That is why the rate has recently been made not so much on equipment as on the original, comfortable and practical design and, of course, the price of the device. </p><p>  LG began to adhere to this concept.  Its employees decided that the key that will allow them to succeed in the market is precisely the attractive appearance of the LG L5 smartphone, the characteristics of which will be given below.  The result of the work of the company's engineers was a line called ‚ÄúL-Style‚Äù.  It includes three devices: Optimus L3, Optimus L7 and LG L5.  Its characteristic in comparison with the younger device has been improved, and about it, in fact, the article will be discussed. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2>

    <p>  On the front side is <span>a proximity sensor.</span>  During a telephone conversation, he will respond to the location of the device relative to the head of the speaker, to automatically turn the display backlight on and off.  There, on the front panel, the company logo, the main speaker, as well as a <span>touch screen</span> with a diagonal of 4 inches are located.  It is worth noting that the screen has a very good resolution for such a diagonal LG L5.  The characteristics of the display will be discussed in more detail later, and for now we will be engaged in evaluating the design of the smartphone. </p><p>  The front panel also includes standard keys inherent in the Android operating system.  These are ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, which are made in the form of touch buttons, as well as ‚ÄúHome‚Äù (physical type). </p><p>  The left side contains the volume keys.  There are no keys or inputs on the opposite panel. </p><p>  As usual, on the upper end there is a jack for a wired headset of 3.5 mm standard, and at the bottom there is an input for charging the device.  In our case, it is MicroUSB.  With its help, you can also connect the device to a personal computer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you pay attention to the back face, then you can find the camera.  Its resolution is 5 megapixels.  It also features auto focus and LED flash.  About the camera LG Optimus L5 E612, the characteristics of which are rated average, we will also talk below. </p><p>  On the rear panel is another speaker.  Its design is a little non-standard: it is divided by a kind of bridge.  It provides incomplete pressing of the apparatus to the surface.  And this, in turn, allows the sound not to linger and not be reflected, but to pass quietly. </p><p>  With effort, you can remove the back cover.  Below it is a slot for a flash drive, a slot for a SIM card, as well as a battery.  When you press the touch keys, the user of the device will not feel the vibration, because in fact it is absent.  And this, perhaps, is the first drawback of the LG Optimus L5 E612 smartphone.  Characteristics indicate that the vibration response of the keys in this model is inactive.  And users often say that he would clearly not be in the way. </p><p>  Judging the appearance of the device is quite difficult.  Some people may like it and others may not like it at the same time.  It will not work for everyone, therefore, in the case of this model, we can only talk about the relativity of the design.  But nevertheless, many note that, although the smartphone has a fairly strict appearance, it does not look completely budgetary. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2>

    <p>  The device is designed with high quality.  Neither backlashes nor any creaks can be seen in it.  Its back cover has a textured surface, which allows the smartphone not to slip out.  In addition, the texture allows you to hide mashing and scratches.  The only thing that can alert users is the plastic trim of the LG Optimus L5.  The characteristics of this material indicate that the edging can peel off during many months of operation. </p><h2>  LG L5 Dual: display specifications </h2>

    <p>  The first acquaintance can please the user of this phone.  Indeed, the screen is not so small, and the color rendition seems to be at a high level.  However, impressions are quickly forgotten during the operation of the model.  Time passes, and they are replaced by a constant account of the shortcomings of the apparatus. </p><p>  First of all, such a disadvantage of the screen can be attributed to the relatively low density of dots, which are one inch.  It is only 144. You can get used to this.  But to come to terms with viewing angles, which, in fact, are just disgusting, will never work out. </p><p>  This will not be a problem for the average user of LG Optimus L5.  Characteristics show that when performing a standard set of tasks, viewing angles that introduce aberrations into images are invisible.  However, this will be very clearly manifested when playing on the phone.  You can forget about the normal game in applications in which you need to tilt the device at all.  The picture will simply fade.  But the responsiveness of the screen can really please people who have purchased this phone model.  The display accepts up to 5 simultaneous touches. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  The device did not expect good quality pictures.  However, even in this I managed to surprise users of the LG L5 E612.  The characteristic indicates only 5 megapixels, but the photos really look quite clearly.  With enough light, of course.  In general, here the ratio ‚Äúprice - quality‚Äù was unambiguously maintained. </p><p>  In the case of the video, everything is a little worse.  Resolution will be only 640 by 480 pixels (this is the maximum).  If it were not for problems in management, then, in principle, such a flaw could have been forgotten. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>

    <p>  It's no secret that many devices running the Android operating system cannot work all day without recharging if third-party programs are not used.  Yes, and they, in fact, briefly extend the battery life.  But LG Optimus 5 coped with this problem. </p><p>  It has <span>a</span> 1540 mAh battery.  If you believe the words of the manufacturers, the operating time can be almost 10 hours.  This is for continuous conversation.  In standby mode, the device can remain ‚Äúin one click before communication‚Äù up to 900 hours. </p><p>  Many experts who tested the smartphone noted that the numbers are actually confirmed.  If you turn on all wireless modules on the device, put the screen at maximum backlight and start playing video continuously, the device can last 9.5 hours. </p><p>  Ordinary users will be able to squeeze out of the model two days of work without recharging.  At the same time, you can exchange text messages with average intensity and make phone calls. </p><h2>  LG Optimus L5 Dual: specifications and conclusion </h2><p>  Well, in terms of design, the device gets a solid four.  The same rating is obtained and the characteristic of battery life.  If you go through the technical equipment, you can put a solid three, and the camera also deserves four points on a five-point scale. </p>
