Any resident of Russia can regularly check the amount of deductions.  Read about how to find out your retirement savings. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Since 2015, working citizens have insurance pensions and savings.  The first are divided into three types: old age, disability, in case of loss of the breadwinner.  Retirement benefit payments are urgent, one-time or earmarked.  Rights are formed on the basis of coefficients or points.  Citizens may receive old-age benefits if: </p><ul><li>  reached 60 (men) and 55 years (women), certain categories may begin to receive benefits ahead of schedule; </li><li>  their insurance experience is more than 15 years; </li><li>  the minimum number of accumulated points is 30. <em></em></li></ul><p>  For each year of work, a citizen generates pension rights in the form of points.  Their number depends on the option of pension provision.  When forming only insurance payments to a citizen, 10 points are awarded.  If funds are also directed to the formation of savings - 6.25. </p>

There are several ways to do this: </p><ul><li>  receive a notice in the mail; </li><li>  make an extract from an individual account; </li><li>  through the Internet; </li><li>  at a branch of Sberbank. </li></ul><p>  In December 2014, the President of Russia signed a decree to extend the moratorium on pension savings.

According to the document, you can track how faithfully the employer made deductions last year.  The cumulative part of the contributions is displayed in the 3rd paragraph of the notification (for individual entrepreneurs - in the 2nd).  The figure of insurance premiums is shown in the 15th paragraph.  How to find out your retirement savings for your entire work experience?

    <p>  The notice also indicates: </p><ul><li>  the amount of funds transferred by the PF to the trust management of the company; </li><li>  part of the contributions that were transferred under the Co-financing Program; </li><li>  the amount of maternity capital, which is aimed at the formation of the funded part of the pension; </li><li>  information about the selected management company and investment portfolio. </li></ul><p>  Such notifications are sent in the form of registered letters, which are handed to the client under his signature.  If the letter did not arrive, you will have to personally contact the local PF branch for an account statement. </p><h2>  How to find out pension savings under SNILS? </h2><p>  This can be done via the Internet.  To get started, you must register on the Gosuslug portal.  This process may be delayed, as the authorities must identify the user.  At the end of the procedure, you can go to the "My Account" using the SNILS number as a login.  This method is the most convenient and safe, as it allows you to quickly generate an extract at any time of the day. </p><h2>  In the branch of Sberbank </h2><p>  You can find out the savings in the Pension Fund through the portal of a <span>credit institution.</span>  But first you need to register in the information exchange system.  To do this, you must contact the structural unit of Sberbank with a passport, SNILS and fill out the appropriate application.  After registration in the database, the information will be available in the "Personal Account" of online banking.  A similar application can be written at any credit institution in the country: <span>Uralsib, Bank of Moscow,</span> VTB, Gazprom.  Here's how to find out the amount of retirement savings. </p>

    <h2>  Alternative methods </h2><p>  There is another option, how to find out the amount of pension savings.  If a citizen has chosen a non-state Pension Fund as the managing body for accrual and payment of savings, then this organization needs to know the account balance.  The client can receive this information upon a personal visit and provision of SNILS.  Some non-state pension funds provide a service such as a special service for a fee. </p><h2>  Increased security </h2><p>  Due to the increase in the number of cases of fraud, the government tightens control over transfers of funds between PFs.  Complaints about the unauthorized transfer of money began to come from the Russians.  A person draws up a loan for consumer goods, provides a copy of SNILS in a package of documents, and then, after a few months, receives a notification by mail about the transfer of funds to a non-state PF.  According to preliminary data, the number of citizens deceived in this way exceeds 26 thousand people. </p>

    <p>  But even if you received a letter about the transfer of funds, you should not panic.  The problem can be solved.  But you have to run around a bit.  It is necessary to write a statement to the non-state PF on termination of the contract.  Better yet, complain to law enforcement.  Then the NPF will be required to pass a test at the Central Bank for reliability. </p><p>  In the meantime, the state is trying to change the rules of the re-registration procedure.  If earlier it was enough to sign on the contract of the future insurer, now it is necessary to notify the PF in writing about the voluntary transfer of funds to another organization.  Forms and samples of such applications are already being prepared. </p><h2>  Other CIS countries </h2><p>  Data on pension savings through the Internet can be found not only by Russians.  Since 2015, a similar scheme began to be used in the Republic of Kazakhstan.  How to find out pension savings?  Through a special mobile application for smartphones and tablets.  Since 2013, all insurance contributions of citizens are sent to the accounts of JSC ‚ÄúUnified Accumulative Pension Fund‚Äù.  Its shareholder is the government represented by the Ministry of Finance, and the National Bank will manage the savings. </p>
