A slightly different situation with ground coffee (even for brewing in cups).  It looks a little like the ‚Äúright‚Äù product, but the best results are obtained only when using a coffee machine.  Even in a coffee maker, you can‚Äôt make quality coffee.  But coffee machines are capable of this.  And the question now is which of the machines to choose.  There are a huge number of models on the market for every taste and budget.  However, it is important to choose the right car and not be guided only by the notorious slogan "cheap and cheerful."  In the case of coffee, you do not need to save.  So, the most interesting option on the modern market is the Bosch BenvenutoClassic TCA5309 coffee machine.  Let's consider it in more detail.  But first, a few words about the manufacturing company. </p><h2>  A bit about Bosch </h2><p>  The German company was founded in the nineteenth century.  But still business is booming.  Thanks to purely German solidity and inclusiveness.  Indeed, Bosch produces almost everything that a modern consumer needs: household appliances, construction tools, auto parts, industrial tools, medical equipment and much more.  It seems to be such different directions, but the ‚ÄúBosch‚Äù is doing fine.  But the <span>coffee machine Bosch</span> BenvenutoClassic TCA5309 belongs to the category of consumer equipment. </p>

    <h2>  Bosch nowadays </h2><p>  The high quality of Bosch products is well known to consumers from Russia and the CIS countries.  The brand, by the way, is popular not only in our countries.  People from European countries also appreciated the quality of the products.  What can I say!  The Bosch company managed to gain popularity even in the American market.  That says a lot.  Therefore, if you are offered equipment from Bosch, then you need to take it.  Of course, if the products are original, and not made by hardworking Chinese in Moscow cellars.  So, let's move on to the Bosch BenvenutoClassic TCA5309 coffee machine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  The appearance of the coffee machine evokes memories of the Bosch coffee makers from the beginning of the two thousandth: the same bulky box.  Only this box of functions is much more.  The coffee bean reservoir is located on the back of the machine.  In general, the device looks decent.  Case material - plastic.  However, the plastic turned out to be so high quality that even scratching it is a problem.  Despite the fact that it is glossy.  There are, of course, metal parts: pallets, mechanisms and more.  On the front panel there are a number of silver buttons for controlling the machine.  In terms of design, the coffee machine Bosch BenvenutoClassic TCA5309 is very good. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance Features </h2><p>  In principle, this machine is similar in appearance to all similar products.  But there are differences.  So, for example, coffee from it can be poured into cups of various sizes.  Although this is a design feature, it also affects the design.  Thanks to the strict lines of the case and the classic color scheme, the car fits perfectly into any interior.  A good coffee machine should be standard and versatile.  His task is to brew coffee, and not decorate the kitchen.  This is exactly what the Bosch BenvenutoClassic TCA5309 coffee machine is.  An overview of the features of this unit will convince you of this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Machine features </h2><p>  This is the most interesting.  The coolest cars are able to brew coffee almost from a stool and decorate it with all sorts of excesses.  But the <span>Bosch TCA 5309</span> Benvenuto Classic coffee machine, the photo of which is shown in this material, does not have such wide capabilities.  It is understandable.  Before us is a simple and reliable machine, which was created in order to brew a lot of high-quality coffee.  And the machine copes with this task with a bang.  The machine can brew espresso, latte, cappuccino and americano in huge quantities.  There is an option to select the degree of grinding and strength of the drink.  Also very interesting is the proprietary Aroma Whirl System option.  The device pre-pours grains with boiling water.  This contributes to the full disclosure of the taste and aroma of coffee. </p>

    <h2>  Functional Features </h2><p>  Also in the arsenal of the coffee machine is a ‚Äúmechanical cappuccino machine‚Äù.  This is a metal tube through which compressed hot air is supplied.  He makes a froth of milk for later adding it to a cappuccino.  Also, the machine can give ordinary boiling water.  It can also be used as a mill.  Such multifunctionality is a common thing for modern coffee machines.  And there is nothing surprising here.  There is only one drawback: there is no coffee strength regulator.  I have to experiment with the degree of grinding.  The rest of the coffee machine Bosch BenvenutoClassic TCA5309, reviews of which we will discuss a little later, is a great machine for home and office use. </p>

    <h2>  Control </h2><p>  There is nothing complicated here.  All machine controls are built on buttons.  But first you have to study the instructions, because it will not work to prepare high-quality coffee the first time.  Each button corresponds to a specific operation.  So, there is a button for selecting the portion size (there are two), a button for turning on the cappuccino machine, a button for adjusting the degree of grinding.  There is also a special ‚Äútwist‚Äù that controls the amount and pressure of the supplied steam for the cappuccino machine.  In general, we can say that the management of the coffee machine was successfully implemented.  The interface is not overloaded and intuitive.  Even a beginner can handle the machine.  Ergonomics is the main advantage of the Bosch BenvenutoClassic TCA5309 coffee machine.  The instruction is needed only if you need to make some special coffee.  Then it will be necessary to select the settings manually.  And so the machine copes well. </p>

    <h2>  Cleaning and flushing </h2><p>  This is a very important aspect, as any coffee machine needs to be washed from time to time.  Otherwise, it will fail.  This is the worst case scenario.  At best, it starts brewing disgusting coffee.  Bosch has no problems with flushing.  This machine is equipped with an automatic flushing and cleaning system.  All you need to do is fill the tank with clean water and insert a branded cleaning tablet into the appropriate compartment.  After that, it remains only to click on "Start".  Then the car will do everything herself.  This procedure is best done once a month.  In general, the coffee machine itself will notify the user when it is time to clean it.  To do this, there is a special indicator (LED of a certain color) and a sound signal.  After washing and descaling, the machine will continue to delight the user with high-quality and aromatic coffee. </p><h2>  Positive feedback from owners </h2><p>  So what do people say about the Bosch TCA 5309 Benvenuto Classic coffee machine?  What disadvantages and advantages did consumers find in it?  It should be noted immediately that there are much more positive reviews than negative ones.  Moreover, owners praise almost everything: build quality and materials, versatility, automatic rinsing mode.  Especially people like the quality of the brewed coffee.  The machine can brew coffee no worse than professionals in specialized institutions.  Of course, it is worth mentioning that you need to use the appropriate sources: quality grains and bottled water.  Only then will it be possible to achieve the maximum effect.  Also, many praise the "cappuccino machine."  He is far from Panarello, but for the latter he also needs a barista with the appropriate skills.  And the Bosch cappuccino machine can froth any milk for its subsequent addition to drinks. </p><h2>  Negative owner reviews </h2><p>  They are much smaller.  Such a product is a Bosch BenvenutoClassic TCA5309 coffee machine.  Negative customer reviews describe, as a rule, factory defects.  It is far from the fact that you will come across just such a machine.  So, some complain that the machine brews very weak coffee.  Even if you choose "strong."  This is a matter of taste.  Most users of the fortress are more than enough.  Some also observed a problem with the shaft for supplying already ground coffee to the teapot.  But this only indicates that the user himself does not clean the feed shaft.  Therefore, the coffee is tasteless.  The remaining reviews are not worthy of attention, as they belong to the category of ‚Äúand other coffee machines ...‚Äù and further in the text.  Let's not forget that we have a budget option.  For an entry-level machine, such functionality is a huge achievement.  In a good way, writing negative reviews about this coffee machine is a bad manners.  It is unlikely that you will find anything at the same price with similar functionality.  Anything that at least somehow fits the description, or costs much more, or worse quality, or does not have the desired set of functions. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, what is a Bosch BenvenutoClassic TCA5309 coffee machine in general?  This is a great machine for making quality coffee at home.  The device has a compact size, excellent design, has many functions and an automatic washing and cleaning system.  There is also a built-in mechanical ‚Äúcappuccino machine‚Äù.  The device can cook different types of coffee and copes with any strength and any volumes.  But the main thing is the price.  She will delight even the most fussy buyer. </p>
