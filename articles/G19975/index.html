However, some guests noted that sometimes in their rooms they forgot to wipe the dust, take out the trash or change the towel and bedding.  However, you could remind this maid if you meet her on the floor, or inform the receptionist. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The rest, as tourists say, was cleaned daily, towels and linen were updated several times a week.  Also, according to the guests, sometimes upon returning to their room, they found on their beds funny figures made of towels and petals in the form of hearts, swans, etc. In addition, as they were spent, the maids replenished supplies of bath accessories and the contents of the minibar.  Also, every day you will be brought a couple of small bottles of drinking water.  According to our compatriots, the minibar can be used for a fee.  Price list is available in the room.  Drinking water is provided free of charge. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  As our compatriots note, the staff of this hotel quickly and willingly respond to the requests and wishes of guests.  So, for example, if something goes wrong in your room, then after contacting the reception the malfunction will be quickly eliminated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket woraburi phuket resort spa 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1078554.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  According to tourists, the arrival of new arrivals at the Woraburi Phuket Resort &amp; Spa 4 *, the reviews we are reviewing, begins after two in the afternoon.  Therefore, if you arrive at the hotel in the morning, then be prepared for the fact that the room keys will be handed to you only after a few hours.  However, this time is not necessary to spend bored in the lobby near the reception.  So, you can leave your bags and suitcases near the reception and go to the pool or straight to the beach.  In addition, be prepared for the fact that upon check-in you will be asked to make a deposit.  Its size is about $ 100.  They will return it to you on the day of departure. </p><p>  When you leave, you should release the occupied room before noon.  If your departure from the hotel is planned in the evening, then you can extend your stay at an additional cost.  However, it is advisable to notify the administrator at the reception in advance of such an intention. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="woraburi phuket resort spa 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1078553.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cost of living in the ‚ÄúVoraburi Phuket Resort &amp; Spa‚Äù includes breakfast only.  According to our compatriots, in the morning they feed here quite varied and delicious.  So, in the hotel restaurant for breakfast, you can eat fried eggs or scrambled eggs right in front of you (you can order the filling to your taste), pastries, muesli, cereal, fresh fruits, sausages, rice, noodles, soup and meat dishes.  Also at the guests' disposal are milk, tea, coffee, juices. </p><p>  During the day you can eat in the restaurant Woraburi Phuket Resort &amp; Spa 4 *, as well as in the cafe next door.  According to our compatriots, they cook at the hotel very tasty, but the prices here are slightly higher than in establishments located in the vicinity of the hotel.  In addition, experienced guests pay attention that the account in the restaurant ‚ÄúWoraburi Phuket Resort &amp; Spa‚Äù will already include tax and gratuities. </p><p>  As for food outside the hotel, tourists note that the choice of establishments here is very wide.  So, you can try a variety of <span>Thai dishes,</span> and if you want to eat the usual food.  Indeed, in almost every cafe, in addition to traditional dishes, they also serve pasta, pizza, as well as other dishes familiar to us.  In addition, our compatriots advise to visit the local market at least once, where you can buy fresh fish and seafood.  You can cook them in a nearby restaurant for a small surcharge. </p><p>  In addition, many travelers were happy to buy various dishes in the so-called macaroons (mobile kiosks).  Here you can try delicious pancakes, kebabs of fish and seafood, etc. Our compatriots say that you should not be afraid to buy such food, as the locals also eat it.  Therefore, you will not have stomach problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel woraburi phuket resort spa 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1078552.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  A big plus of ‚ÄúWoraburi Phuket Resort &amp; Spa‚Äù, according to many tourists, is its location near Karon Beach.  This beach is considered the best on the island.  You can walk to it from the hotel in just five minutes at a leisurely pace.  The beach here is large, wide, with a fine white sand, which creaks pleasantly underfoot when walking.  Sun beds and umbrellas are not here, since from last year their placement was prohibited by the local government.  Tourists can sit right on the sand, laying a mat or towel.  You can buy a mat, as well as a beach umbrella in one of the neighboring shops or right on the beach at the merchants who regularly pass here. </p><p>  As for the sea, it is here, according to travelers, quite restless.  So, it‚Äôs unlikely to get a full swim here because of the constant strong enough waves.  However, many enjoyed jumping on the waves.  If you want to swim, you can go to the nearby <span>Kata</span> Beach.  To reach him from the hotel, according to our compatriots, can be in 20 minutes.  You can also get to it, as well as to the other beaches of the island, by taxi, tuk-tuk or a rented scooter. </p>
