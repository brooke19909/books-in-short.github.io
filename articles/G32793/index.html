That's right, there is a trademark operating in Russia that offers electronic equipment under this brand.  And no, this is not about another Chinese developer offering his copy of the iPhone at an affordable price.  This is a completely independent, already managed to be realized on the market manufacturer, which has 27 years of experience working with domestic buyers.  And yes, this company is of Russian origin. </p><p>  And although, as we have already mentioned, products under this brand include both tablet computers and electronic books (which you may have even heard of), the attention in today's review will be focused mainly on what a mobile phone is TEXET </p><h2>  Positioning </h2>

    <p>  I would like to note right away that TEXET is clearly not involved in the technology race, which is also taking place between Chinese manufacturers.  This can be judged by the characteristics that are indicated on smartphones.  Here, take, for example, a TEXET TM 5007 mobile phone. On the company‚Äôs website-store, it is designated as New (a product that has gone on sale relatively recently).  However, its parameters indicate that the device is clearly late with the appearance on the market.  This is clearly demonstrated by a screen with a resolution of 540 by 960 pixels (despite the fact that some Chinese developers have been supplying their devices with Full HD-quality displays for a long time) or 512 MB of RAM.  Such characteristics indicate that with such a device it will not be possible to launch any modern game or program.  Moreover, the performance of the smartphone as a whole will significantly suffer (resources simply will not be enough even for a smooth deployment of the Android menu). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The lineup </h2><p>  The catalog of the TEXET online store presents all the models that the company offers.  At the time of writing, 12 devices were present in it - smartphones with different features, capabilities and, of course, different pricing policies.  All names are given in two variations - with the index X (X-mini, X-maxi, X-cosmo) and with a four-digit number (for example, TEXET TM 5016 phone). </p>

    <p>  What is characteristic is the fullness of the device catalog exclusively with smartphones (with a 4-5 inch diagonal touch screen, 2/4 nuclear processors running on the Android 4.2.2 / 4.4.2 operating system. I would even like to notice that visually many devices are similar to each other , except for the ‚Äúprotected‚Äù (TEXET X-mega phone). The rest of the devices really seem to belong to a single class. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  I would immediately like to make a note regarding the appearance of mobile devices sold under the TEXET brand.  Firstly, there is nothing special about their design;  of what might be of interest to the buyer, to present some value to him.  In fact, we have 11 ‚Äúshovels‚Äù and 1 ‚Äúprotected‚Äù rubberized phone, which, it seems, were designed according to one model. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you look closely, you can even notice some elements of the appearance of the ‚Äútop‚Äù devices - from Samsung, Apple and other developers.  For example, the TM-4503 model is similar to the first, and TM-5006 is the second.  Other models of devices also included some ‚Äúborrowings‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  Obviously, when projecting their gadgets, specialists from TEXET did not disdain frank plagiarism in order to please the buyer and increase sales due to this. </p><h2>  Hardware basis </h2><p>  Speaking of TEXET smartphones, one should not hope that they work on the basis of powerful, advanced processors that produce serious performance.  Those devices that we analyzed (X-mega, X-line) are able to compare with the available Chinese smartphone.  We are talking about 4-core Spreadtrum or MediaTek processors, which are rather a budget compromise than a request for speed. </p><p>  Accordingly, the TEXET phone interacts at the same level - it can cope with most games on basic or average characteristics;  but the ‚Äúbulky‚Äù graphics of colorful gameplay, of course, he will not pull.  Plus, we should mention the small amount of RAM - only 512 MB or 1 GB.  For comparison: in normal operating mode, the Androiid system eats 300-400 MB of memory.  Imagine what happens if you run two or three programs in the background?  The smartphone will simply experience serious problems with the response - and its owner will feel a lot of inconvenience.  And all due to the fact that those who make the TEXET phone, obviously, tried to save as much as possible on accessories.  To some extent, of course, they succeeded. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  For many users, the ability to take pictures and make videos is the most important option on any smartphone.  It‚Äôs so convenient: as soon as it becomes possible to take pictures in some unusual setting, get a mobile phone (which you always carry with you) and click on a couple of frames.  Of course, for this it is necessary to have a device that will be capable of this. </p>

    <p>  On paper, TEXET phones (we don‚Äôt take into account reviews of real users yet) are equipped with two cameras, as befits modern phones of their class.  This is the front for the ‚Äúselfie‚Äù and the main (back) camera.  Some of the described characteristics may even seem solid 5- (like X-line) or 8-megapixel matrices (as is the case with TEXET iX).  However, as we all know very well, this is not enough to speak with confidence about the quality of the pictures. </p><p>  In fact, color reproduction, the ability to focus the camera, and the accuracy of program settings play a huge role.  In the event that the developer saves on this, even an 8-megapixel camera will shoot worse than the one that has a high-quality 5 megapixel matrix. </p><p>  Therefore, speaking about the TEXET camera, we can safely say that it was significantly saved.  And you should not expect colorful, realistic shots - these are smartphones of a completely different class. </p><h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  By the way, speaking about the classes of models, it should be noted that TEXET phones belong, their classification in terms of cost.  So, as you can already understand, we have budget devices that do not claim serious functionality.  Their task is not to show stability, ample opportunities, quality of work, but to appear before the buyer in the most attractive (from the point of view of acquisition) light.  And, if you look closely, everything is designed for this. </p>

    <p>  The first factor we have already named is design.  It is copied from the most popular, best-selling devices.  The second is the geographical location of the manufacturer.  Well, of course, if this is a Russian company, then who would not want to support it by buying their product?  Third is the price.  The cost of smartphones, which we characterized in this article, is much lower than even the most affordable ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù.  If the latter are offered for 8-12 thousand rubles, then the TEXET phone (for example, the X-mega model) will cost only 5-6 thousand.  There is a lower price positioning - take at least the X-mini 2 smartphone with a price tag of 3400. </p><p>  That is, as we see, the manufacturer consciously takes all measures to make the smartphone more accessible and attractive from the point of view of the average layman.  Of course, the buyer will not go into the details of the technical characteristics, since, most likely, he himself is not well versed in them. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>

    <p>  To ensure that our review does not turn out unfounded and biased, we will provide customer reviews that we were able to find in the process of searching for information.  So, I would like to say that many comments are positive for the TEXET device.  Obviously, who bought a smartphone fits his concept of ‚Äúcheap and cheerful,‚Äù which is why they reasonably do not expect anything more from him. </p><p>  However, there are more objective characteristics.  For example, they note that the device periodically loses connection.  This can happen during a conversation - so this fact will cause discomfort to the user.  Another example is the failure of some additional modules on a smartphone, such as Bluetooth or GPS, directly during the work with the device.  Again, this is very unpleasant and characterizes the developer not from the best side. </p><p>  The same applies to other situations in the reviews describing the TEXET mobile phone.  All of them note some problems caused by the negligence of manufacturers. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2>

    <p>  Should I switch to the products of this company?  It all depends on your needs and requirements.  As an additional ‚Äúhandset", a TEXET cell phone can be an excellent assistant, but, in our opinion, it is not reliable enough as the main means of communication. </p>
