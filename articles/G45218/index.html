In its segment, there were no alternatives for this model, and even any technical problems such as the short duration of a single charge or insufficient functionality did not stop buyers.  This device after its release has become so widespread that the general expectation of the next model from this manufacturer has become a kind of sport. </p><p>  Immediately it is worth noting the fact that the Nokia 8600 phone itself is not distinguished by any outstanding features, and more was acquired in order to further emphasize the status of its owner.  In this regard, many people after the release of the next model quickly enough changed their devices to new ones, which could even more clearly emphasize their status. </p><h2>  Nokia 8600 Premium </h2>

    <p>  It would seem that it is not surprising that the Nokia 8600 goes into the Live Premium category, because this is exactly what buyers of such devices were expecting for the most part.  However, it is worth noting the fact that in this case, not everything is so simple and obvious.  In particular, it is worth mentioning that, for example, the Nokia 8600 Luna has a 250 euro higher cost compared to the SE modification device.  And all this despite the fact that the new device significantly surpasses its predecessor in functionality, as well as in dimensions and other important points for consumers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The reason for such a slight increase in value is that such a decision by status is slightly lower, that is, the model does not represent the flagship version.  Nokia 8600 Luna is just an additional solution, and in order to attract people to purchase this phone, it would be impossible to increase its cost even more, since in the future, perhaps, they would have to buy new updated variations. </p><h2>  Title </h2><p>  The name of this device does not represent the code name of the product, as many people thought about it long before the device appeared on the markets, this is a standard addition.  The company decided to use proper names in its products, and for some iconic models separate names are used, while for a series of categories or devices the names of this segment are used. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  The main problem that the <span>Nokia 8800</span> encountered was that it could not work much, and this was due to the use of a metal case, because for normal signal transmission it was necessary to allocate significant energy costs.  At the same time, the developers did not have the opportunity to fight for any improvement in work without changing the materials used, as a result of which the Nokia 8600 Luna was released in glass.  The lower part of the slider is made of specialized tempered glass, although it feels like standard stainless steel.  But it may seem so only at first glance, because as soon as the Nokia 8600 (the original) rings, the flickering keyboard under this cover is immediately visible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How reliable is glass? </h2><p>  Of course, hardly anyone will decide to check the strength of the glass, since in this case it is necessary to achieve some kind of result, but the feedback from most users suggests that in the event of a fall the device behaves absolutely normal and without any glitches in work.  It is worth noting that before the release of this model, the glass in the case was used exclusively by Motorola, but the main difference in this case is that Motorola products use the standard glass shape, which is used to cover the external screen and act as a front panel, while as here it is a separate part of the structure, which can be moved if necessary. </p><h2>  Housing </h2>

    <p>  The Nokia 8600 Luna (original) is equipped with a case made of specialized stainless steel, but a decision was made to use a matte finish that would not indicate directly the use of metal in this design.  In the production process, specialized spraying was applied, which made the surface slightly rough, and this is what clearly differs from the soft touch coating, which was already popular at that time.  The reason for the appearance of this spraying, most likely, is the desire to make the case extremely non-marking, and indeed, on the back surface of the Nokia 8600 case almost completely eliminated fingerprints.  At the same time, such a problem is present on the front panel, so from time to time you will need to use a special cloth to wipe the screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Analogs </h2><p>  For its time, this body texture was quite unique, and only Mobiado Luminoso, in which powder is used for body coating, can be distinguished.  In principle, this model and Nokia 8600 phones are even similar, since they are based on the 6233 model and at the same time practically do not differ in the number of available functions. </p><h2>  Decor </h2>

    <p>  There is practically nowhere to find fault with the design elements of the 8600, but the grilles made of metal mesh mounted on stereo speakers and a chrome-plated twin volume control key give a special shine to the device.  In their reviews, people often mention the highest build quality of the Nokia 8600, the price of which is fully consistent with the internal and external content (from 7500 rubles).  Given the complete absence of gaps, in the hand the phone turns into a kind of monolithic block. </p><p>  The device was made exclusively with the black color of the case, since, most likely, the use of glass did not allow designers to use any other color solutions.  For example, you should look at the design of Motorola KRZR, which was achieved using exactly the same glass. </p><p>  Make sure to use stainless steel in the housing only after removing the roof of the battery compartment.  The latch is located on the left side and is removed after pressing.  In principle, this procedure is easily performed even with the device closed, but then it can be closed later only in the open state of the phone. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The phone‚Äôs dimensions and weight are exactly the same (with a difference of a couple of grams and millimeters) as in the 8800 model and include the following values: </p><ul><li>  Dimensions - 107x45x15.9 mm. </li><li>  Weight - 140 grams. </li></ul><p>  The Nokia 8600 can also be distinguished from the 8800 by its larger screen, which at the same time did not affect the convenience and physical size of the keyboard. </p><p>  A rather convenient and reliable opening mechanism deserves special attention, since the halves slide without any difficulty, and, if necessary, the automatic connection mechanism is triggered.  Unlike the same model <span>8800, Nokia</span> 8600 Luna, the price of which is only slightly higher than the cost of this device, does not emit any metal rattle when opened, and in principle, the opening sound is as calm and quiet as possible. </p><h2>  Battery </h2>

    <p>  The device has a lithium-polymer battery model VR-5M, whose capacity is 900 mAh.  According to the manufacturer, the phone can function for 10 days in standby mode, as well as up to 3.6 hours with intensive communication.  Approximately the same specifications were presented for the 8800 SE, but in practice it turned out that the device worked for no more than one day.  Of course, another battery was used there, with a capacity of 700 mAh. </p><p>  The increased battery capacity, as well as the use of other case materials, allowed an increase in the overall operating time slightly.  The phone lasts about 10% longer compared to the 8800 SE.  If we talk about the fact that during the transition to the SE modification, time also rose by 10%, a very interesting increase is obtained. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  The display in this model is used by QVGA and has a resolution of 240x320.  The screen can display 16 million colors, while the image is quite juicy and bright colors.  It is worth noting that the manufacturer did not provide any functions that allow you to change the screen backlight settings, since the menu simply does not have such functions.  In other words, there is always uniform illumination of the screen, providing economical energy consumption.  The user is given a choice - to use the screen saver in standby mode or just completely turn off the backlight, after which the display can be viewed in room lighting at a certain angle.  There is the possibility of completely turning off the screen, which allows you to make it black and excludes the display of any information.  There is a mirror layer on the display, providing good behavior in the sun, that is, any text and menu items are easily read. </p><p>  Many say that the display was manufactured using OLED technologies, but in reality these are absolutely unfounded statements that originate from the work of journalists from the British media company TK. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  The camera in this device costs 2 megapixels, which even by the standards of that time is far from being so much, but it‚Äôs quite enough for shooting with more or less decent quality.  In this model, they decided not to use a bet on any special photographic abilities, as a result of which the camera became optional.  In this regard, it was decided to use not the most expensive camera modules, and therefore the overall quality is poor.  There is a function to turn off the shutter during shooting, as well as the ability to use digital zoom with an eightx zoom, but its use is almost meaningless. </p><p>  This device makes it possible to record video in 3GP format at a resolution of 174x144 or 128x96.  Recording quality can also vary in three main ways.  If necessary, you can set limits on the total recording time, but if there is no limit, it will be kept until the available memory runs out on the phone. </p><p>  Thus, the phone can be called a fairly good option, even among modern devices, although it lacks a fairly large number of functions.  Its only advantages at the moment are price, as well as design and reliability, which have always been a hallmark of Nokia phones. </p>
