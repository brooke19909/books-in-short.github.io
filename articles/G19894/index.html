  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Credit and consumer cooperatives: feedback from investors, list, description of services</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Consumer credit cooperatives are an alternative to banks and microloans.  KPC in the financial market of Russia for more than 15 years, but citizens are wary of their activities.  Distrust is associated with insufficient knowledge about the activities of cooperatives and negative feedback from deceived investors.  Not all CCPs are bona fide creditors.  Some of the cooperatives are modern pyramid schemes that pose a danger to potential investors.  Reviews of consumer credit cooperatives, which are popular among Russians, will allow new customers to learn about the activities of the CCP, the advantages and disadvantages of credit cooperation in the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  PDA "Flagship" </h2><p>  Credit and Consumer Cooperative "Flagman" provides services to residents of the following areas: </p><ul><li>  Voronezh; </li><li>  Samara; </li><li>  Saratov; </li><li>  Volgograd; </li><li>  Rostov; </li><li>  Lipetsk. </li></ul><p>  The basis of the cooperative is the opening of deposits and the issuance of loans.  The table below shows the deposits of KPK "Flagship". </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Deposit Name </td><td><p>  Minimum deposit amount </p><p>  thousand rubles </p></td><td><p>  Maximum term </p><p>  storage of funds, years </p></td><td><p>  Interest </p><p>  rate,% per annum </p></td></tr><tr><td>  "Take advantage" </td><td>  10 </td><td>  3 </td><td>  12.5 </td></tr><tr><td>  "Multiply" </td><td>  10 </td><td>  3 </td><td>  12.5 </td></tr><tr><td>  "Manage" </td><td>  10 </td><td>  3 </td><td>  5,0 </td></tr><tr><td>  "Comfortable" </td><td>  10 </td><td>  3 </td><td>  11.0 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  According to Flagman consumer credit cooperative reviews, capitalization is not provided for in all deposits.  Interest accrual on ‚ÄúUse‚Äù and ‚ÄúManage‚Äù tariffs is provided only at the end of the term, without capitalization.  According to the ‚ÄúComfortable‚Äù deposit, capitalization is set at the request of the shareholder. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kpk-flagman.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit consumer cooperative flagship reviews" class="if uuid-3143404" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3143404.jpg"></div><p>  The loan in the PDA "Flagship" is provided exclusively to shareholders.  To do this, the client must join the CCP by paying 150 rubles (in total) against the entry and membership fees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Loans are issued to shareholders-citizens of the Russian Federation from the age of 21 years.  A prerequisite is the existence of a work experience of 2 months. </p><p>  According to reviews, in the credit consumer cooperative "Flagman" very high interest on loans.  KPC offers customers to get borrowed funds at 41% per annum.  The loan term is standard: from 3 months to 2 years.  Customers are unhappy with such interest, despite the large amounts to issue.  In the CCP, borrowers can receive from 500 thousand rubles to 15 million. </p><p>  The application is considered within 2 days.  When providing collateral, a loan is issued within 1 hour.  A pledge may be not only the property of the shareholder, but also liquid property.  For the convenience of shareholders, an online calculator operates on the site, which allows you to calculate loan conditions. </p><h2>  PDA "Maximum" </h2><p>  CPC operates in Moscow and the Moscow region.  Activities related to the provision of loans and deposit operations.  The main focus of the company is on the opening of deposits: in KPC "Maximum" there are 4 types of deposits. </p><p>  Types of deposits KPC "Maximum" are presented in the table below. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Deposit Name </td><td><p>  Minimum deposit amount </p><p>  thousand rubles </p></td><td><p>  Maximum shelf life </p><p>  funds years </p></td><td><p>  Interest rate, </p><p>  % APR </p></td></tr><tr><td>  "Stable" </td><td>  10 </td><td>  3 </td><td>  12.5-13.95 </td></tr><tr><td>  "Record" </td><td>  10 </td><td>  3 </td><td>  12.5-13.95 </td></tr><tr><td>  "Available" </td><td>  10 </td><td>  3 </td><td>  5,0 </td></tr><tr><td>  "Poste restante" </td><td>  10 </td><td>  3 </td><td>  11.0-12.5 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  When placing funds on a deposit, the client automatically becomes a shareholder of KPK "Maximum".  When concluding an agreement, you should take your passport and SNILS with you. </p><p>  The reviews on the Maximum Credit Consumer Cooperative say that the conclusion of the agreement allows shareholders to receive a free grocery basket every month as part of a social program for CCP members.  Shareholders can also expect a consultation on civil matters with the lawyers of the partner firm.  The service is provided once a month. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="credit consumer cooperative maximum reviews" class="if uuid-3143409" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3143409.jpg"></div><p>  Loans, according to reviews on the maximum credit consumer cooperative, are issued not only to members of the CPC.  Credit funds in the amount of 500 thousand to 10 million rubles are available to shareholders, individuals and organizations. </p><p>  The interest rate is fixed and amounts to 41% per annum.  Customers can take money in cash or by transfer to the account.  Redemption is carried out at the offices of the CCP or by bank transfer (non-cash).  Early repayment is carried out only in the branches of KPK "Maximum". </p><p>  Borrowed funds are issued on bail, which can be a car, apartment or private house, as well as the property of the organization (for legal entities).  Consideration of the application takes up to two business days.  The borrower must have a passport, SNILS, TIN and documents on collateral property with him. </p><h2>  KPK Capital Invest </h2><p>  The activities of Capital Invest are in doubt among many investors, as there are negative reviews on the Web from deceived citizens.  Some of the shareholders were forced to go to court, because KPK Capital Invest refused to pay deposits after the contract expired. </p><p>  Reviews of the credit investment cooperative "Capital Invest" indicate that previously the company was called "Sberkassa 24".  Later, the CCP offices were closed, and hundreds of depositors were left without funds paid. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Previously, the cooperative‚Äôs offices were located only in Ryazan, and after bankruptcy, the Russians did not receive 20 million rubles paid at the promised 7-14% per annum (in 2010 banks offered no more than 10% per year). </p><p>  Now KPK Capital Invest continues to attract customers to invest at interest.  The company guarantees that the savings of customers are insured by the organization Central Insurance Company LLC.  But many Russians are aware that the guarantee of a refund in an insured event is only the entry of a financial institution into the system of "Deposit Insurance Agency", a state-owned company.  All major banks of the Russian Federation are members of the deposit insurance system, which helps protect depositors' savings in the amount of 1.4 million rubles (per 1 insurance participant). </p><p>  KPK Capital Invest proposes to invest at 8.00-13.05% per annum for up to two years.  In case of early termination, the demand rate will amount to 6.00% per annum, while banks charge only 0.01% per annum when closing deposits.  Such conditions alarm many investors who do not want to lose their accumulated funds, chasing high interest rates. </p><p>  The funds contributed will be used to issue loans to CPC members.  Loans are issued for amounts from 100 thousand rubles to 50 million. Both individuals and individuals and organizations can become borrowers.  It is possible to get a loan online or at the office of KPK Capital Invest. </p><h2>  "Zenith" </h2><p>  The conditions of the CPC "Zenith" are very reminiscent of the proposals of the cooperatives "Flagship" and "Maximum".  Even the conditions for loans, deposits and the design of the official website coincide.  This causes suspicion among responsible citizens who do not want to be deceived by an unscrupulous organization. </p><p>  The terms of deposits in the Zenit PDA are as follows. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Deposit Name </td><td><p>  Minimum deposit amount </p><p>  thousand rubles </p></td><td><p>  Maximum term </p><p>  storage of funds, years </p></td><td><p>  Interest </p><p>  rate,% per annum </p></td></tr><tr><td>  "Profitable" </td><td>  10 </td><td>  3 </td><td>  12.5 </td></tr><tr><td>  Cumulative </td><td>  10 </td><td>  3 </td><td>  12.5 </td></tr><tr><td>  "Poste restante" </td><td>  10 </td><td>  3 </td><td>  5,0 </td></tr><tr><td>  "Comfortable" </td><td>  10 </td><td>  3 </td><td><p>  11.0 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  They completely coincide with the proposals on deposits of KPK "Flagship", so some customers think that the same person is at the head of the companies.  At the same time, the regions in which the CCP offices are located are different.  According to the opinions of depositors of credit consumer cooperative "Zenith", the company offers services in the Novosibirsk, Kemerovo, Tomsk and Omsk regions and the Altai Territory. </p><p>  Loan terms also resemble lending at Flagship.  Zenit offers a ‚ÄúTrust‚Äù loan to shareholders at 30-41% per annum.  Loan amounts vary from 500 thousand rubles to 15 million. Loans are issued to individuals and legal entities upon entry into membership. </p><div class="photo" data-original="novosibirsk.flamp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cheap consumer cooperative zenith reviews" class="if uuid-3143414" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3143414.jpg"></div><p>  The collateral is the collateral of the shareholder.  When applying, you need a TIN, SNILS, passport and a document that confirms the rights to the pledged property. </p><p>  According to reviews, the credit consumer cooperative "Zenith" pays deposits, but not always on time.  For example, in Omsk, residents are afraid to invest cash, as they have already encountered the sad experience of the KPK Golden Fund.  The cooperative has stopped calculating interest and payments on deposits, and for more than two years, depositors have not been able to receive their money even with the early termination of the contract.  Many argue that Zenit appeared immediately after the disappearance of the Golden Fund from the market and attributed this to the reorganization of the CCP into another financial pyramid with a new name. </p><h2>  "Assistance" </h2><p>  The difference between KPK "Assistance" from other credit and production cooperatives is the possibility of issuing a loan against maternity capital.  This allows families with children to receive maternity capital funds faster and spend them for other purposes not provided for by the state program. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ekaterinburg.flamp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit consumer cooperative promotion reviews" class="if uuid-3143417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3143417.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews on the credit consumer cooperative "Assistance", the transaction is official if the Pension Fund of Russia allows it to receive maternity capital to repay the loan in the CPC after the conclusion of the contract. </p><p>  The loan amount varies from 150 to 600 thousand rubles.  Issuance under the capital is carried out at 25% per annum.  In case of early repayment, the minimum amount that the borrower is obliged to repay for the issuance of a loan is 40 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Reviews about the credit and consumer cooperative "Assistance", unlike previous KPC, are positive.  The organization has been on the market since 2005, its activities are controlled by the Central Bank of Russia.  Borrowers trust the lender.  There is no information about the delay in paying interest or closing deposits. </p><h2>  CPC "Commonwealth" </h2><p>  Credit and Consumer Cooperative "Commonwealth" began its activities in 2015.  At that time, only 7 people were shareholders, who founded a financial organization.  According to the results of 2017, the total number of shareholders increased to 550 people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="consumer credit cooperative society reviews" class="if uuid-3143421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3143421.jpg"></div><p>  The basis of activity is the issuance of term deposits and the issuance of loans to individuals and legal entities.  The main office is located in Belgorod.  Additional units are located in Gubkin and Stary Oskol. </p><p>  The network has a lot of feedback from investors who have encountered problems with paying deposits.  Problems with finances began with the organization in November 2018.  According to reviews, the credit and consumer cooperative "Commonwealth" in 2019 did not pay a single deposit to shareholders.  Therefore, customers who have previously invested in the company do not recommend that Russians become shareholders of the CCP. </p><h2>  "First" </h2><p>  On the network, you can often find negative reviews about this PDA.  And more than 98% of them are from defrauded investors.  Not the most positive reviews about credit and consumer cooperative "First". </p><p>  PDA on the Russian market since 2009.  During this time, he became a well-known organization engaged in processing deposits and loans outside of banking.  He is a member of the Russian Union of Insurance on Shareholders, which includes 99 more CCPs. </p><p>  Despite the long-term activities, prospects and fame, the CPC "First" has serious financial difficulties.  This was indicated in the reviews of the credit and consumer cooperative shareholders of the cities of Lesnoy and Nizhnyaya Tura.  When trying to withdraw funds from accounts, customers were refused, and the Personal Account stopped working in 2018.  Offices in cities are closed, and customers are waiting for money to be returned to them by court order. </p><div class="photo" data-original="surgut.yarmarka.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="consumer credit cooperative first reviews" class="if uuid-3143425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3143425.jpg"></div><p>  Negative reviews were also with customers who entered into a loan agreement.  In their opinion, ‚ÄúPervyi‚Äù accrues high interest in the event of a forfeit, therefore, if it is not possible to repay the loan on time, the shareholders can get into an unpleasant financial situation. </p><p>  After 20 days of delay, KPC specialists can transfer the debt to a collection agency, which in a strict form requires a refund of finances.  To avoid this, it is not recommended to issue quick loans at KPK "First" without confidence in the repayment of funds within the specified time frame. </p><h2>  Ugra </h2><p>  KPK "Ugra" works only in the city of Surgut, so the Network has virtually no information from customers.  The offers of a credit cooperative resemble the deposits and loans of Flagman, which, most likely, indicates a similar activity of organizations. </p><p>  High interest on loans is not attractive to residents of the city, but profitable deposits have allowed the CCP to become a successful financial institution.  Reviews about the credit consumer cooperative "Ugra" can leave only residents.  In other regions, the offices of this PDA do not work. </p><p>  To apply for a loan, available only to shareholders, you need to contact the office of Ugra.  An online application for obtaining borrowed funds is not provided. </p><p>  According to information on the official website, CCP funds are insured in the "Interregional Mutual Insurance Society".  This guarantees depositors a payment in case of financial problems. </p><h2>  CPC "People's Capital" </h2><p>  The cooperative has been operating in the financial market of the Russian Federation since 2012.  The advantage of the organization is its membership in the SRO "Interregional Union of Credit Cooperatives" No. 271 of December 29, 2017.  Membership in the union ensures that the CCP is responsible for its responsibilities.  This is confirmed by regular contributions to the reserve fund, from where funds are paid to depositors in case of closure of the organization. </p><p>  The offices of KPK "People's Capital" are located in 15 cities of the Russian Federation.  The presence of a large number of branches confirms the popularity of PDAs and the trust of customers. </p><p>  According to reviews, in the consumer credit cooperative "People's Capital" only shareholders can get a loan.  They must make 200 rubles as mandatory contributions.  Interest on loans varies from 29% to 33% per annum.  Shareholders can issue a microloan at a rate of 0.5% per day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ekaterinburg.jobfilter.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="consumer capital credit consumer cooperative reviews" class="if uuid-3143424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3143424.jpg"></div><p>  On deposits, you can get up to 13.0% per annum.  To open an account, it is enough to deposit 10 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Reviews about the consumer credit cooperative online are positive.  But some shareholders complain about high interest rates on loans.  For KPC, large interest on loans granted is the norm, as they are offset by attractive deposit offers. </p><h2>  "Savings" </h2><p>  In Orenburg, Orsk and Chelyabinsk, there are branches of KPK "Saving".  There is little information on the CCP's activities on the Web, but most of the reviews are negative.  A negative assessment of the activity is given not only by former shareholders, but also by employees. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the Sberstvoitelny credit consumer cooperative, one can judge that the company is another financial pyramid.  The proposed interest on deposits of more than 13.0% per annum can afford less than 10% of financial institutions. </p><p>  Doubts cause too low interest on loans.  As a minimum, KPC offers clients loans from 2.8% per month, but there is no information on how the interest rate for shareholders is calculated.  The drawback, according to borrowers, is the obligatory collateral burden when applying for loans. </p><p>  Entrusting their finances to the CCP or borrowing money from them, Russians should not forget about possible difficulties.  After studying the activities of the company, reading reviews, you can protect yourself from financial risks when concluding an agreement in a credit production cooperative. </p>
