    <p>  In our everyday life, probably, no homemaker can do without her faithful helpers: household appliances.  Modern women are no longer imagining how to cope and manage to do everything without always having at hand such necessary household appliances as kettles, refrigerators, electric dryers, toasters, blenders, vacuum cleaners and washing machines.  We will dwell on the latter in more detail. </p><p>  Today, the market for washing machines is such that manufacturers conduct practical combat operations for each client.  Each company that produces washing machines, tries with the new model to improve its products, add any new useful features and at the same time try not to significantly increase the price of their products. </p><p>  Annually leading publications that are focused on this topic make up the rating of washing machines.  Of course, every manufacturer wants his products to be at a higher level and makes every effort to this. </p><p>  So, if you‚Äôre at a loss and don‚Äôt know which automated ‚Äúassistant‚Äù to buy at home or give it to someone, then you should read this rating of washing machines for reliability.  This list contains information including reviews of customers who already use washing machines.  Based on their opinions, as well as expert opinions, this rating was compiled.  In addition, washing machines were included in the final results, reviews of which were provided by more than one service center.  It's no secret that every service center or just a repair shop maintains its statistics on the frequency of breakdowns of certain models, these data were also taken into account in the final results. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Opens our Miele appliance washing machine rating.  This German company has become famous for its devices that have tremendous reliability.  Miele washing machines, although they are quite expensive compared to the rest, but if you think about it, the price is not too high, because the <span>life of the washing machines of</span> this company reaches about thirty years!  No other company producing such a miracle of technology can boast of such a result. </p><p>  We continue our <span>rating of washing machines</span> and in second place are Bosch products of the Spanish assembly.  Of course, these units cannot boast such a long service life as Miele cars, but nevertheless, Bosch home helpers are also a standard of quality at an affordable price. </p><p>  Washing machines, also rated high enough, are manufactured by Zanussi and Electrolux.  Why two at once?  Everything is quite simple, the fact is that both of them are made from the same components and, as a rule, the models are quite similar.  In fairness, we note that both Zanussi and Electrolux are fairly reliable manufacturers, and the washing machines of these companies have always been at the highest level in assembly quality and durability. </p><p>  We rightfully give the fourth place to Siemens.  The household appliances of this manufacturer have always been famous for their reliability, washing machines are no exception.  Pretty good price and high quality are the key to the success of this product.  Just if you decide to buy a Siemens washing machine, remember that in case of a breakdown, not every service will undertake its repair, since the design is quite complicated, and it is not so easy to get parts. </p><p>  Rounding out our rating of washing machines is Ardo's home helpers.  These are the products of a Chinese company.  The key to success of these washing machines is as follows: the quality is very high, but at the same time the price is quite low compared to competitors, which is why <span>Ardo washing machines</span> have become so popular. </p><p>  This is the list of the five most reliable manufacturers of washing machines.  I would like to note that it was created on the basis of numerous data, but in the end, it is up to you to decide which washing machine to buy. </p>
