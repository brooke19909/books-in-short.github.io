  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian foreign policy in the 18th century</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The 18th century in world history is characterized as the era of the beginning of modernization and enlightenment.  Of course, improvement processes have been going on for several centuries.  But it was in the 18th century that the beginning of the renewal of the traditional old society was laid.  These processes have led to the emergence of modern society. </p><p>  Of particular importance in the development of the Russian Empire belongs to the 18th century.  This period is estimated as a complex and controversial historical stage.  Many problems remained unresolved and controversial in it. </p><p>  <span>The foreign policy of</span> Russia of the 18th century was accompanied by changes in all sectors of socio-political life.  Changes affected both the economic and cultural spheres.  Transformations have occurred in both social and <span>political relations.</span> </p><p>  For the first time, Peter I tried to modernize the Russian Empire according to European standards. The second attempt was made by Catherine 2. As a result of radical transformations, the state turned into a powerful world empire. </p><p>  Volumes of agricultural and industrial production increased intensively, Russia achieved certain successes in establishing foreign trade relations, and domestic trade in the country also developed successfully.  The local and central authorities strengthened their positions.  The accelerated development of associated areas has begun. </p><p>  The foreign policy of Russia in the 18th century by historians is conditionally divided into three time stages. </p><p>  The first stage begins during the reign of <span>Peter 1</span> and ends after his death.  The first event that marked the <span>foreign policy of</span> Russia in the 18th century is the <span>Northern War.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The next stage is closely connected with the struggle for the throne after the death of Peter 1. This stage ends with the death of Elizabeth (daughter of the emperor).  The main events that marked the foreign policy of Russia in the 18th century at this stage are the Russo-Turkish and Seven Years War. </p><p>  The beginning of the third stage coincides with the ascension to the throne of Catherine the Great.  The main events of this era are the wars with Turkey, the conquest of Crimea, the partition of Poland. </p><p>  The foreign policy of Russia in the 18th century was carried out mainly with the aim of turning the country into a full-fledged powerful sea power.  It should be noted that transformations within the state and actions in the international arena were interconnected.  The Russian economy developed against the backdrop of the state‚Äôs entry into the foreign policy sector. </p><p>  From the very beginning, the international activity of the government of Peter 1 had the same direction as in previous times.  The movement of Russia was directed south.  The government sought to eliminate the Wild Field, which arose in ancient times with the formation of a nomadic culture.  <span>The liquidation of this</span> area freed Russia from the trade route to the Black and Mediterranean Sea.  To achieve these goals, campaigns were undertaken to the Golitsyn Crimea and the "Azov campaigns" of Peter himself. </p><p>  The main result of the international activity of the Russian Empire in the 18th century is the transformation of the country into a powerful naval state with a full-fledged fleet and army.  Over the course of a century, the nation has also continued to strengthen within its natural geographical and ethnographic boundaries.  This desire was finally realized at the beginning of the next century. </p><p>  The foreign policy of Russia of the 19th century was marked by the annexation of the entire eastern part of the Baltic coast, the acquisition of the Aland Islands and Finland.  In addition, the southwestern borders expanded.  At the same time, historians note that with the establishment of natural borders, foreign policy in the state began to fork.  Thus, different goals were formed when moving in the eastern, Asian, European (south-west) direction. </p>
