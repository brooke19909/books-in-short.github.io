In this regard, it is often called a country within the state.  Today we will get to know the sights of this city and find out why it is one of the three most beautiful cities in Europe, founded during the Renaissance. </p><h2>  Dubrovnik today </h2><p>  Dubrovnik is located on the Adriatic coast and has a rich history.  The successful combination of these features has led to the fact that today it is called a museum with beaches.  Vacations to Dubrovnik (Croatia) are bought by those who want to combine a cultural holiday with a beach holiday.  This is the main highlight of the city in terms of tourism.  In addition, Dubrovnik is a major port, which plays an important role in the economy of Croatia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vogue.com" data-author=": Alamy, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Dubrovnik (Croatia)" class="if uuid-2301311" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27428/2301311.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to the city </h2><p>  The city is located near the border with Montenegro and is the capital of South Dalmatia.  It is best to get here from the countries of the former CIS by plane.  Of course, direct communication is far from established with all cities, but this is not a problem - the capital of Croatia is only an hour's flight from Dubrovnik and receives flights from a wide range of countries.  As for local flights, they are carried out several times a day.  The distance from the center of Dubrovnik to the airport is 22 kilometers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Two faces </h2><p>  Like most ancient cities, Dubrovnik in Croatia has two parts varying in area: the old and the new city.  The first part is surrounded by fragments of an ancient wall, which to this day have retained their greatness.  Their total length today is about two kilometers.  Behind the wall lies the colorful city life of the 17th century, which can still be felt here. </p><p>  The main part of the architectural ensemble of the new city was born in the XIX century.  However, here there are interesting places for tourists.  Due to the fact that most of the new buildings are low-rise, they harmoniously fit into the ancient architecture of Dubrovnik.  In the new city there are no bored skyscrapers and tasteless dormitory houses.  Everything here is beautiful, colorful, and you can even say ‚Äúlively‚Äù.  Moreover, it is not inferior in equipment and development to other European cities.  Thus, having received a visa to Croatia, in Dubrovnik you can secure a wide range of bright emotions.  And we still did not talk about the sea. </p><h2>  The walls of the city fortress </h2><p>  The walls around Dubrovnik were built in the distant 10th century.  Surprisingly, they survived to our time almost in its original form.  The height of the walls is approximately 25 meters, but the width in different places varies, reaching a maximum of 6 meters.  It is noteworthy that the city fortress of Dubrovnik is not a pile of stones, but a reliable chain of towers, strongholds, bastions and casemates, which are skillfully combined into one impregnable defensive system. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.layoverguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubrovnik city wall" class="if uuid-2301310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27428/2301310.jpg"></div><p>  It is also surprising that the ancient builders were puzzled not only by the reliability of the structure, but also by its beauty.  As a result, thanks to the excellent combination of lines, harmony of forms and interesting solutions embodied in the design of the towers, the walls of the city fortress of Dubrovnik became famous throughout the world. </p><h2>  Towers and fortresses of Dubrovnik </h2><p>  Tours to Croatia are always associated with visits to medieval towers and fortresses, and Dubrovnik is very popular in this regard.  One of the oldest towers of the city is the tower of Minchet, whose name translates as ‚Äúwatchtower‚Äù.  She owes her appearance to the brilliant architect Nikifor Rabbi.  Several centuries after the construction of the tower, it received a new look, with more elegant and rounded shapes.  In this form, the structure stands to this day. </p><p>  The key link in the ring defending Dubrovnik is the fortress of St. Ivan.  Today it houses the famous city aquarium and the Maritime Museum, rich in unique exhibits.  Thus, visiting this place, you can not only get acquainted with the fortress, which repeatedly saved the city of Dubrovnik and Croatia from enemy invasions, but also admire the inhabitants of the underwater world and human creations that allow you to conquer the sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main "guardian" of the city gates is the powerful Bokar fortress.  It was designed by a brilliant Renaissance architect, architect Michelozzo di Bartolomemeo.  Bokar fortress, as well as St. Ivan's fortress, is not only an architectural monument, but also a working platform for organizing festivals.  Therefore, in the summer you can not only admire the magnificent buildings, but also watch some colorful show. </p><p>  The largest open terrace in the city is the Revelin fortress, made in the form of an irregular square.  Once this building protected the locals from the Venetian warriors. </p><p>  Another interesting defensive structure is the fortress Lovrienac, which is located at the fork in the sea and land routes to Dubrovnik.  It has thick majestic walls, which still give the impression of the most reliable shelter. </p><h2>  Stradun Street </h2><p>  Many excursions around Dubrovnik in Croatia begin on this street.  It was once called the Parade ground.  Today it is just the main street of the city, however, in a conversation with local residents, you can still hear the old name.  The origin of Stradun Street deserves special attention.  Surprisingly, it was built on water.  The fact is that once, at this place the sea passage passed, which separated the island of Ragusa from the mainland.  In the 11th century, the townspeople decided to expand their holdings and covered the water with marble slabs.  So the street appeared, which soon became the main artery of the city.  She retains this status to this day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.matthewwilliams-ellis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Street Stradun in Dubrovnik" class="if uuid-2301314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27428/2301314.jpg"></div><p>  On Stradun Street there are many souvenir shops, cozy restaurants, cafes and boutiques.  A similar situation is observed on adjacent streets.  But the majority of tourists come to Dubrovnik and Croatia not to buy and have a bite, but to admire the local beauties.  On Stradun Street, the Onofrio Fountain and the bell tower that adorns the Franciscan monastery are considered as such. </p><h2>  Puddle Square </h2><p>  The picturesque Puddle Square adjoins Stradun Street.  She received such an unusual name not because of the increased amount of precipitation, but in honor of the city belfry located here.  The belfry was built in the 15th century, and its name, in the local dialect, translates as an open box.  Indeed, it is located on a large elevated terrace.  Earlier, upon hearing a bell ringing, all the townspeople rushed to this place to make joint important decisions regarding the fate of the city, local rules, laws or decrees.  Based on this fact, we can guess that the area is quite spacious. </p><p>  From the point of view of architecture, the Puddle is a unique place, an ensemble of different eras (15-18 century) and styles.  The predominant role among various directions was given to baroque.  Gothic is coming for him.  The least of all in the buildings surrounding the area is a renaissance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="exploya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Puddle Square in Dubrovnik" class="if uuid-2301328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27428/2301328.jpg"></div><p>  According to tourists' reviews, among the architectural masterpieces of the Puddles, a special place is occupied by the Spontsa Palace, which was built in 1516.  Now the city archive is functioning in the building.  Attention also deserves the church of St. Blasius, who was considered the good patron of Dubrovnik.  Inside the church there is an amazing altar decorated with a silver figure of the saint, made more than 5 centuries ago by some of the most talented jewelers in Croatia. </p><p>  The sights of Dubrovnik surrounding Luzha Square are surprisingly in harmony with each other.  Obviously, the architects who undertook the design of the next building carefully studied the neighboring buildings and took care of the form of the overall composition. </p><h2>  Churches </h2><p>  According to reviews, Dubrovnik in Croatia is a place of concentration of fascinating church architecture.  In addition to the church of St. Blasius mentioned above, there are other popular places for believers in the city.  The first of these is the oldest synagogue in Europe.  It was founded in 1408 and for a long time was the only non-Christian sacred structure.  The construction of the synagogue was initiated by Jews who moved to Dubrovnik from Spain. </p><p>  The next in the list of church buildings of the city is the Dominican monastery.  At one time, he was responsible not only for the education of believers, but also for the safety of the city, carefully covering it from the sea.  Now in the monastery building there is a museum. </p><p>  At the entrance to Dubrovnik, near the gates of Pile, is located Franciscan Monastery.  There is still a monastery pharmacy and a miraculous fountain, built in the 15th century and named in honor of its creator the Onofrio's Great Fountain.  Attention of tourists is also attracted by the courtyard of the monastery, which is not only remarkable for its picturesqueness, but also for its size. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.likealocalguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Franciscan Monastery in Dubrovnik" class="if uuid-2301329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27428/2301329.jpg"></div><p>  Considering the sights of Dubrovnik in Croatia, one cannot ignore the St. Clara Convent located in the city.  Its main "highlight" is considered a lucky stone, which romantic natures from around the world seek to visit.  This stone is more than 500 years old. </p><p>  According to legend, 5 centuries ago, a local nun fell in love with a brave captain who conquered the sea, and these feelings were mutual.  In punishment for the forbidden passion, both lovers were imprisoned in separate dungeons.  One day, Klara decided to ask the Lord for help.  Choosing a special stone in her prison, she prayed desperately beside him every day.  After some time, a miracle happened, and the beloved were able not only to reunite, but also to escape safely.  What happened to them further, no one knows, but the romantics are sure that the couple was all right, and that same stone really has power. </p><h2>  Lokrum Island </h2><p>  The island, located just 700 meters from the mainland, is famous primarily for the fact that at one time it was visited by many famous people.  The beauty of Lokrum was admired by: Napoleon Bonaparte, Richard the Lionheart, Emperor of Mexico Maximilian the First and many others.  Attractions such as the Botanical Gardens, the Royal Fortress and the monastery are located on the island.  In addition, the attention of tourists attracts, albeit a small, but very beautiful lake with the awesome name Dead.  And Lokrum, thanks to its clean and quiet beaches, will be interesting to adherents of relaxation on the sea coast.  In this regard, it is very popular, because tours to Dubrovnik and Croatia as a whole can not do without a beach holiday. </p><h2>  Chilipi village </h2><p>  Everyone who wants to plunge into the national traditions of Dubrovnik, and Croatia as a whole, as well as get in touch with the local color and history, should go to the village of Cilipi.  It is located very close to the southern part of the city.  It is best to go here on Sunday when the locals, dressed in national costumes, gather in the main square of the village and have fun.  Such local holidays allow not only to get acquainted with national songs, dances and cuisine, but also to appreciate the hospitality of Croats.  Here you can buy souvenirs from local needlemakers.  As for gastronomy, the Konavollski Dvori konoba is considered the best establishment in the village. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches of Dubrovnik" class="if uuid-2301334" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27428/2301334.jpg"></div><p>  Another tourist trump card of Dubrovnik in Croatia is the sea.  Local authorities skillfully used it and made the city a popular resort.  The most attractive beaches are on the Lapad Peninsula.  Most of them are pebble or concrete, but there are also sandy ones on the coast of the bay.  The most famous beaches of the peninsula are Uvala and <span>Copacabana, the coast of</span> which is covered with a mixture of fine pebbles and sand.  Rest here is loved not only by tourists, but also by local residents.  The beaches of President and Neptune, located at the hotels of the same name, also deserve attention.  For the purity of sea water, they received an insignia called the Blue Flag. </p><p>  Banje Beach, which is located near the historical part of Dubrovnik, is also very popular.  It offers an excellent view of the city walls and the island of Lokrum.  Here is the EastWest Beach Club nightclub frequented by celebrities from around the world. </p><p>  Most of Dubrovnik's beaches in Croatia are equipped with sun loungers and parasols.  Lovers of outdoor activities can enjoy water skiing, a banana, a boat or a boat here.  Almost all beaches are free, so they are always noisy and fussy.  Those who want privacy will have to pay for a relaxing holiday. </p><h2>  Restaurants </h2><p>  Speaking about holidays in Dubrovnik (Croatia), one cannot but mention the places where tourists can get acquainted with local cuisine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.total-croatia-news.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubrovnik cuisine" class="if uuid-2301331" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27428/2301331.jpg"></div><p>  Consider the most popular of them: </p><ol><li>  Cafe Royal.  This establishment is located in the center of the Old Town, in a luxurious 17th-century baroque building.
