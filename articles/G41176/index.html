On the territory of this amazing country, a huge number of outlandish varieties of flora grow, and the richness of the fauna is simply amazing.  This country is also known for many fascinating stories and comic tales about Aibolit, who sat under a baobab and treated animals.  The most famous symbol of Tanzania is <span>Mount Kilimanjaro.</span>  A popular resort is Zanzibar.  Tours here are not cheap, but the trip will give truly unforgettable emotions. </p><h2>  Zanzibar - a separate country </h2><p>  As for the political system, this state has long had sovereignty, as well as its own president, parliament and other necessary authorities.  Zanzibar is not considered to be a separate territorial unit, however, this island has long been fighting for freedom and, it must be said, is not unsuccessful.  Many representatives of the <span>population of Zanzibar</span> have long been separated from the main people, considering themselves only Zanzibar people and no one else.  Speaking of culture, it is worth noting the similarity with the Tanzanian one, nevertheless, differences can still be found in something. </p><h2>  Holidays in Zanzibar </h2><p>  As for the organization of recreation and leisure, the <span>island of Zanzibar</span> is the best option for these purposes.  Diverse sightseeing trips are regularly held here, the most interesting of which is a trip to visit plantations where many common spices are grown.  Guides organize various tours, during which everyone can learn the intricacies of growing seasonings such as cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Zanzibar is ready to offer visitors about 25 cleanest beaches with an azure sea bottom and dazzling white sandy beaches.  I must say that it is on the territory of the beach areas of Zanzibar that the lion's share of the most beautiful pictures that get on the Internet is removed, and many visitors to sites with skepticism believe that photoshop is involved here. </p><p>  Information about the fact that the beaches of Zanzibar are firmly entrenched in the top five <span>best beaches in the world</span> both in the beauty of nature and in the level of service will not be superfluous. </p><h2>  Underwater world </h2><p>  Visiting tourists are very fond of diving on the island, since the underwater world of this area is extremely rich and diverse.  There are beautiful corals, and outlandish fish, and amazing aquatic plants, and much more.  There is even an opinion that many pearls were lost at the bottom of the ocean in this place. </p><p>  The visibility level under water is from 10 to 30 meters, which makes it easy to find under the water column and <span>electric rays,</span> and moray eels, and jellyfish, and crabs, and other bizarre marine settlers.  The best places, according to many professional divers, are the reefs of Boribo and Morogo, on the territory of one of which is located a mysterious turtle cave.  In addition, here is the habitat of the giant Mantoux stingray.  Very close to this place a long time ago sank a tourist ship, long overgrown with moss.  There is a path between the lost islands of Pange and Bave. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Speaking of attractions, it is worth mentioning such an amazing place as Stone Town, another name for which is the stone city.  This city was built in the first half of the 20th century by the Sultan of Zanzibar Island.  By the way, this city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The territory of the stone city is literally completely built up with a variety of shelters for believers.  There are 51 mosques, 6 churches for Jews and 2 churches for Catholics.  Among other things, on the territory of the stone city there is a huge number of buildings made of stone rocks, the oldest of which is the fort of the Arabs.  The main highlight of this place is a huge number (about five hundred) of doors carved from wood, which have brass upholstery and are a kind of heart of this city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another amazing place that you should definitely visit is the palace of ceremonies of the Sultan, once rightfully called the "House of Miracles".  The thing is that the outlandish phenomena in this house were those amenities that no apartment building can do without now: this is an elevator, hot and cold water, and sewage. </p><p>  A very famous place is the island of Prizon, which has a huge number of prisons for the mass of prisoners.  Now these buildings have stopped working, and remained only as visiting places for visitors.  Giant turtles, whose age is measured in several hundred years, are in great demand here.  These turtles were introduced directly from the Seychelles, where they appeared initially. </p>

    <p>  Holidays in Zanzibar are not complete without a visit to the Josani Forest.  On the area of ‚Äã‚Äãseveral hundred hectares there is a huge amount of variegated greens, tropical trees, shrubs and flowers.  In this protected forest, it will not be difficult to encounter what is called face to face with real wild monkeys that freely jump from branch to branch of tropical plants.  These animals are very cute and do not cause any panic among tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On this island there are plenty of magnificent museum complexes, among which one can distinguish such as, for example, the Livingston Museum or the National Museum.  A line of visitors is also gathered at the doors of the Museum of Natural History or at the Palace Museum. </p>

    <p>  Hotel La Madrugada Beach Resort is considered one of the best on the island of Zanzibar.  He wins due to his location in a great area.  The complex takes place directly on the coast.  On the territory there are several pools and bars. </p><h2>  About nutrition </h2><p>  Breakfast is included.  The rooms are very comfortable.  The only negative is that fresh towels must be taken at the main entrance.  Also, the quality of the pillows leaves much to be desired.  They are very large and tough, but someone might like it.  Some rooms have decorative pillows for sleeping.  But at the first call the staff will correct all the flaws and even bring the missing accessories.  A refrigerator can be brought to your room for free. </p><p>  Every evening, maids come to the room to disinfect and install a mosquito net.  In Zanzibar, nowhere without it.  Every day, 2 bottles of water are delivered to the room. </p><p>  The restaurant is fed and served very well.  The choice of dishes is quite large.  Especially tourists note the high quality of seafood dishes with vegetables.  Breakfast consists of a variety of fruits, snacks, dairy products.  The food is varied, tasty and satisfying. </p><h2>  Own beach </h2>

    <p>  The hotel is designed for a relaxing holiday.  It is in a secluded place.  Nearby there are practically no entertainment and restaurants.  But the hotel itself offers such a variety of delicious dishes for little money that going somewhere else simply does not make sense. </p><p>  In Zanzibar, problems with hot water can occur.  This complex is no exception.  There are often interruptions in water, but tourists are not particularly bothered. </p><p>  In general, La Madrugada Beach Resort (Zanzibar) has an ideal value for money.  Despite some of the shortcomings that can be found in any complex, this hotel deserves attention. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2>

    <p>  The main advantages of La Madrugada Beach Hotel Resort (Tanzania, Zanzibar) are its convenient location and friendly staff.  With this service you can solve any problems.  The rooms are pretty decent.  They are cleaned efficiently and even care about the health of guests.  I am glad that the hotel has its own beach area.  Here even in the windiest weather you can find a cozy place under the sun.  By the way, this is one of the best beaches on the island of Zanzibar. </p><p>  Tours to this hotel are very popular among different groups of tourists.  Here you can meet newlyweds who came to enjoy their honeymoon, and families with children, and even pensioners.  The hotel‚Äôs remoteness from civilization makes it popular among tourists who prefer a relaxing beach holiday.  Those who come to Tanzania in search of adventure should definitely go on excursions around the island, which are kindly offered by local guides.  This will help diversify the rest and saturate it with new impressions and emotions. </p><p>  Africa is full of exotic.  You will not find such color in any other state! </p>
