New models regularly go on sale, which successfully replenish the already considerable product line of the company over and over again.  Another creation of the company was the phone under the name ‚ÄúPhilips X5500‚Äù.  Conventionally, all the devices of the company can be divided into several categories.  We will not go into this topic particularly deeply. </p><p>  We will only say that the company has a certain tendency, reduced to the production of models with a high energy efficiency indicator.  As a result, a long battery life without recharging from the electric network follows from here.  Perhaps for this the owners of the device also fell in love with it - for not having to worry about it turning off at the most inopportune moment. </p><h2>  Phone "Philips X5500": specifications and features </h2>

    <p>  Due to the presence of a very powerful battery (and its capacity is about three thousand mAh), the device can work for a very long time.  Interestingly, the engineers managed to put such an energy-efficient battery in the device, equipped with a screen with a diagonal of only 2.4 inches.  This decision aroused applause among mobile phone specialists.  Still, it was expected that the device would not be an example larger, and this would be a significant drawback.  However, the company employees do not get their money in vain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, the screen is made on the basis of the matrix technology IPS.  This allows the phone owner to contact the display for a long time visually without significant damage to the eyes, but instead takes away the quality of the image output.  The Philips Xenium X5500 phone supports the function of two SIM cards, for which the device has separate slots.  The device does not have a particularly high-quality camera built in (its resolution is only 5 megapixels).  Nevertheless, the software has an autofocus function, which makes it possible to achieve far from the worst pictures with this resolution. </p><p>  For the rest, we note that the Philips X5500 telephone, reviews of which you can read at the end of this article, has become a logical continuation of the company's product line.  Namely, this is a modified version of the X623 model.  Well, if this is the case, then it will be quite interesting to see what has changed in the subject of our review in comparison with its predecessor. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  What will we find in the package?  The delivery set is very, very average and typical for such devices.  In fact, in the box is, first of all, the phone itself, as well as a battery with a capacity of 2,900 mAh to it.  In addition, we will be able to find a cable standard MicroUSB - USB, which is designed to connect to a network adapter.  It can also be used to synchronize with a personal computer or laptop. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to all of the above, in the package you can find, of course, the instruction manual and warranty card.  And complete this entire ensemble adapter, with which you can charge the phone from the mains, as well as a wired stereo headset of very average quality. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  It is possible that the reader used the X623 device at one time.  In this case, he will immediately find a lot of similarities between this model and the Philips X5500.  We can say that the first device contained certain ideas, which, however, did not find full practical application.  So the X5500 was a continuation of this idea, engineers successfully implemented the previously mentioned factors in it. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2>

    <p>  The device turned out pretty weighty.  In general, the case can be called a monoblock, and there will be absolutely no mistake.  In addition, it is thick.  Now the main trend of the smartphone market is the pursuit of the subtlety of the device.  And in this peculiar race, the Philips X5500 is clearly not in the first places.  The dimensions of the device in all three planes are 124 by 53 by 15.5 millimeters.  In this case, the phone weighs 156 grams.  Yes, it‚Äôs large, of course, but let's remember which battery is installed in the device.  After that, everything must necessarily fall into place. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2>

    <p>  There should not even be any complaints about this parameter.  The monolithicity of the construction is simply excellent, it does not deteriorate at all, and the use of plastic as a material for the manufacture of the case does not have any attention to this.  In general, the device is assembled really high quality.  Nothing creaks in it and does not fall off; backlashes were not detected during operation.  In addition, the mass of the phone has become a positive factor in terms of assembly and its reliability.  Although it is felt in some way particularly massive, but this adds strength to it.  So why not then? </p><h2>  Side faces </h2>

    <p>  They have special inserts that are decorated in relief.  Faces, which are made in a similar way, can improve the reliability of holding the phone in your hands.  And not just reliability, but also comfort.  It will be practically impossible to accidentally drop the device from the hands, the chances of this are reduced to almost zero.  By the way, if we talk about the color of the inserts, then they are gray.  In general, most of the case is decorated in black, so gray elements stand out to a large extent against the background of such an ensemble.  And this is not a drawback, but a thoughtful design solution, which can be called an advantage. </p><h2>  Top end </h2><p>  He sheltered a 3.5 mm standard jack, to which computer headphones can be connected, as well as a wired stereo headset. </p><h2>  Bottom end </h2><p>  Here we have the MicroUSB standard port, designed to connect the corresponding wire and synchronize with a personal computer (or laptop).  In addition, it is used to connect to a network adapter, from which the phone‚Äôs battery is directly charged. </p><h2>  Controls </h2><p>  The volume and power buttons are located on the side faces.  But there is no separate element that would allow controlling the camera in the phone.  He was in the X623 model, however, in the case of the X5500, the engineers decided to refuse this button.  The rocker allows you to change the sound mode, as well as manipulate the volume of music playback in the corresponding multimedia application. </p><h2>  Rear panel </h2><p>  It is nothing more than a combination of a small number of glossy inserts integrated into a metal structure.  It is interesting that such inserts are located exclusively on opposite ends: upper and lower.  It is possible that the designers of the phone using this solution tried to make the design as original as possible.  However, in fact, we see that this affected negatively.  Some time after use, the metal cover is covered with a network of small (and maybe large, depending on operating conditions) cracks. </p><h2>  Phone ‚ÄúPhilips X5500‚Äù.  Owner reviews </h2><p>  Many buyers of this unit referred to the poor quality of the speaker.  The melodies that are available in the standard set of ringtones have, to be honest, disgusting sound quality.  The subject of our review today was created specifically for calls, and this is clear right away.  So why did the company's engineers miss such an important point?  One can only guess about this. </p><p>  In the service menu, however, you can make some tricky manipulations that will partially solve the problem with sound.  The case is certainly heavy.  For some, this can also be a negative indicator.  Nevertheless, this topic has already been discussed together with the device‚Äôs battery, so we won‚Äôt complain and unequivocally write down the dimensions of the smartphone.  A 3G device is not supported, therefore, you cannot make a modem from a device. </p>
