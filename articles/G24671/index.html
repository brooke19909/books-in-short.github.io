    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  In general, our compatriots liked the apartments in this hotel.  True, some argue that the situation is already in need of updating, but there have been no particular complaints about this.  So, the rooms here are quite spacious, bright, comfortable and clean.  They have everything you need for a comfortable stay - large comfortable beds, spacious wardrobes, a modern TV with several Russian-language channels, air conditioning, a bathroom with a hairdryer, a minibar.  Guests of Sheraton Sharm Resort 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh) are provided with bathrobes and slippers.  In addition, travelers who come here on their honeymoon, as well as those who choose ‚ÄúSheraton‚Äù not for the first time, can count on a compliment from the hotel in the form of a fruit basket, a bottle of champagne or a delicious cake. </p><p>  According to some tourists, on the day of arrival they were first accommodated in small rooms that do not have a terrace or balcony.  Someone did not pay attention to it, and someone asked for other apartments.  Therefore, if you are not comfortable with the room that you were offered, you can expect that upon request you will be moved to a more suitable room. </p><p>  As for the location of residential buildings, experienced tourists advise those who want to relax in silence, if possible, settle in apartments in villas.  They are located far from the main pool, and the noise here does not bother you.  On the contrary, you can enjoy the orchards while breathing in the scent of exotic trees.  Those who always want to be in the center of everything that happens at the hotel are better off choosing apartments in the main building. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sheraton sharm hotel resort villas spa 5" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1056313.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beverages </h2><p>  The complex has several bars, including by the pool, on the beach and in the lobby.  Here you can order alcoholic and soft drinks, drink fresh or taste delicious ice cream. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Basically, travelers just for the rest on the shores of the Red Sea go to Egypt.  Hotel Sheraton Sharm Resort 5 * (Sharm-El-Sheikh), according to our compatriots who have been here, offers its guests an excellent beach holiday.  So, despite its location on the second coastline, it has its own beach, which is also used by tourists living in the neighboring hotel complex of the Sheraton chain. </p><p>  The beach here, according to vacationers, is very large, sandy, well-equipped, clean.  There are many comfortable sun loungers and parasols.  As our compatriots note, there are always enough sun loungers on the beach, so there is no need to run ashore early in the morning to take a seat, as is the case in other, even five-star, hotels.  There is also an outdoor cafe on the beach where you can not only have a snack during the day, but also have lunch, there is also a bar with a wide selection of drinks. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Most of our compatriots did not forget to mention in their reviews about the Sheraton Sharm Resort 5 * hotel, a photo of which can be viewed in this article, and about the magnificent coral reef located near the coast.  According to tourists, here you can see a variety of amazing, vibrant and unique marine life, because the local underwater world is very colorful.  Therefore, when going on vacation, be sure to arm yourself with a snorkeling mask and fins.  After all, you can swim here and watch the life of the inhabitants of the Red Sea for hours.  But, by the way, the necessary equipment can be taken at the local diving center.  Here, everyone can take a scuba dive and take a few lessons from a professional instructor. </p><p>  As for entering the water, most vacationers preferred to use the pontoon.  From it you can go down the stairs directly to the depths and find yourself next to the reef.  Those who swim poorly can go into the sea directly from the shore.  However, in this case, it is recommended to use special shoes so as not to injure your legs on the coral.  Also, family tourists note that the beach has a small area, completely cleared of stones and corals.  Here you can swim with young children. </p>
