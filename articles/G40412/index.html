    <h2>  A Brief History of Tarragona.  Ancient Roman trace </h2><p>  Around the III century BC.  e.  the territory of modern Spain was inhabited by Iberians.  At the turn of the V-VI centuries.  BC  e.  these people founded the settlement of Kesse.  It was captured by the Romans under the command of the proconsul Publius Cornelius <span>Scipio Africanus</span> during the <span>Second Punic War.</span>  This event took place in 218 BC.  e.  At the site of a simple settlement, Scipio erected fortifications.  Subsequently, around the fortress grew a city called Tarracon.  It has long been the capital of the ancient Roman province of Near Spain.  Subsequently, during the reign of Julius Caesar, the city was renamed the Colony of Julius Urbis Triumphalis Tarraco.  A little later, after the end of the Cantabrian war, Octavian Augustus waited here for the winter cold, erecting a huge number of buildings in honor of the great victory.  Several years of life were given to this place by the future emperor <span>Septimius Severus</span> as head of the Roman administration.  The city received the status of the capital of the <span>kingdom of Aragon</span> in the Middle Ages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of tarragona" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/467312.jpg" width="550"></div>

It consists of two magnificent, insanely interesting parts.  One of them relates to the Ancient Roman era, the second to the Middle Ages.  In 2000, UNESCO declared Tarragona a cultural heritage site.  Today it is one of the most attractive cities for tourists.  What to see in Tarragona?  More on this later in the article. </p><h2>  St. Mary's Cathedral </h2><p>  Tarragona, whose sights are interesting not only for its appearance, but also for its fascinating fate, attracts thousands of tourists every year.  Most interesting places are located in the "old" part - Part Alte.  The magnificent beautiful building of the Cathedral of St. Mary was erected in the XII century.  The main elements of the structure are the statues of the Archangel Michael.  The first - the main sculpture - depicts him trampling a trait.  The second composition is in the treasury of the cathedral and is made in a grotesque-satirical form: the pink-cheeked puffy Archangel Michael trampled on a mad horned demon.  During the very long construction of the cathedral - about 150 years - architectural genres and images have undergone many changes.  This left its mark on the decoration of the building.  The cathedral turned out to be rather peculiar - the Romanesque style is combined here with Gothic.  The land on which this magnificent building is located has long been considered sacred.  Since the time of Emperor Tiberius, temples were built on this site.  At first it was the <span>temple of Jupiter, a</span> little later the Visigoth church, then a Muslim mosque.  In the XII century, the Catholic Cathedral of Tarragona was erected on this holy land, which, by the way, is still valid today.  It hosts daily services and festive services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park central tarragona" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/467313.jpg" width="400"></div>

The attractions located here have been preserved from the most ancient times.  So, in the II century BC.  e., near the coast of the Mediterranean Sea was built an amphitheater.  The stands of this magnificent building saw a lot of blood, pain and suffering.  The amphitheater accommodated 13,000 people.  Here, in the terrible times of persecution, many first Christians were martyred, who were brutally tortured and executed.  On one of the winter days of 259, a huge bonfire burned in the arena under the feet of Bishop Fructuos.  In memory of this event and in honor of this saint, on January 21, Tarragona Christians light candles in temples.  For a long time, the amphitheater was hidden under the thickness of the earth and sand, until in the middle of the 20th century one of the archaeological expeditions came across it.  Thanks to such a long oblivion, the building seemed to be mothballed.  The stands, the main gate, and the large amphitheater arena, which occupies nearly 2500 m <sup>2, are</sup> perfectly preserved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tarragona beaches" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/467314.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Roman aqueduct </h2><p>  This is another interesting place that is famous for Tarragona.  Sights of the city, by the way, almost all have their own tradition.  An <span>interesting legend</span> is also associated with the Roman aqueduct <span>.</span>  They say that in ancient times, Satan built a bridge over the gorge, and in exchange requested the soul of the first resident of Tarragona, who drank water in this place.  The first "quencher" was the donkey.  Since that time, the aqueduct, with a height of 27 m and a length of 220 m, has received the name Devil's Bridge.  Initially, in the era of ancient Roman rule, two structures were built, along which water was brought to the city.  One of the viaducts has survived and is well preserved to this day.  Today it is recognized as one of the UNESCO heritage sites.  Today, the neighborhood of the aqueduct is a beautiful ecological and historical park.  Fans of extreme sports have a great opportunity to tickle their nerves.  To do this, you just need to go over the abyss along the narrow gutter of the drain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tarragona map with landmarks" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/467322.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Building with a fake facade </h2><p>  This is one of the most popular attractions in the center of Tarragona.  In 1995, the wall of one of the houses of the city was painted in a special manner by the artist Carles Arola.  If we look at the fake facade from afar, for example, from the center of the square, a 3D effect is created, a kind of illusion of an animated image.  It is natural that this unusual fabulous side of the standard building attracts a huge number of tourists.  The master of fine art captured on the blank wall the classic facade of the Tarragona house of the 19th century.  On the painted balconies among the flowers live the characters of Spanish legends and fairy tales famous all over the world.  There is Harlequin with his Colombina, Captain and others.  There was a place on the third floor for the artist himself and his beloved wife, whom he depicted busy watering flowers. </p><h2>  Modern Art Museum </h2><p>  This is one of the most popular places that Tarragona is famous for.  Sights that combine the splendor of architecture and diverse content invariably attract visitors.  Located in three reconstructed mansions of the 18th century, the city‚Äôs most entertaining museum dedicated to contemporary art.  It opened its doors to visitors in 1976 and immediately became one of the most popular places in the city.  Its halls are filled with masterpieces of modern Catalan masters of painting and sculpture.  Furniture items, jewelry, beautiful tapestries and a huge collection of ceramics of the 12th-18th centuries also occupy a worthy place here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of tarragona spain" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/467316.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  House Canals </h2><p>  A magnificent mansion, combining several eras in its architecture.  The base of the house rests on the remains of an ancient wall, the age of which is dated to the 2nd century BC.  The first floor was erected on the ruins of a medieval house of the XIV century.  The interiors of blue and pink bedrooms, stunning with their splendor, with ancient paintings and mirrors in heavy frames hanging on the walls, date back to the 19th century.  Canals House has a terrace with magnificent views of the whole of Tarragona. </p><h2>  Platja llarga </h2><p>  This sandy strip is considered one of the best areas for sunbathing and swimming.  Tarragona, whose beaches are clean and well maintained, are not only magnificent architectural structures.  It is also a resort with a high level of service.  The coast of the city is considered the standard of cleanliness and grooming.  One of the most famous beaches is Long.  The length of this sand line is about 3 km.  It is spacious enough and at the same time quite a few people.  This place attracts with its picturesque nature - oak groves with white storks and Spanish lynxes rise almost off the coast.  These territories are considered protected.  It is here that you can see the Mediterranean nature in all its glory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see in tarragona" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/467320.jpg" width="550"></div>
