    <p>  Among the advantages that Touch Bank offers with its debit card, one can note a refund and a bonus program.  With this ‚Äúplastic‚Äù you get access to all the organization‚Äôs services (deposits, loans, Internet banking, and so on), and when spending on an account, 1% of the amount is returned.  If you are talking about products from the "favorite category", get 3%.  In total, about 4% of the spending is returned to the card.  Very comfortably. </p><p>  By the way, the Touch Bank card is single.  You can get a loan with her, open a deposit, and simply use finances with a bonus program.  The system of payment for purchases is based on contactless payments using PayPass technology.  Touch Bank receives positive reviews for this opportunity.  So far, not all banking companies have this highlight!  And it‚Äôs very convenient to use. </p><h2>  Design and Activation </h2><p>  Making a Touch Bank card does not take much time.  And only positive reviews are left about this process.  All that is required of you is to fill in the fields provided for by the form for creating ‚Äúplastic‚Äù on the organization‚Äôs official page.  Here is written personal information about the owner, his passport details.  Nothing special.  But then the problems begin.  Accordingly, reviews from positive to negative. </p><p>  The thing is that not everyone can use the services of Touch Bank without any problems.  Bank card delivery is provided only in some cities.  There are many of them, but, for example, in St. Petersburg there is no such possibility.  There are also problems with activating the card.  To do this, you need to get through to Touch Bank.  To do this, as the reviews indicate, is not so simple.  But if you persevere, you will be able to translate the idea into reality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="touch bank hotline" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1351616.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  What conclusions can be drawn about a company called Touch Bank?  Everyone can see the details and services of this bank on the official website.  Here you can draw up a map and find out where the company is located.  Familiarization with news and bonus programs is also fully embodied through the official page of the company.  In a word, Touch Bank is a real bank that conducts its business via the Internet.  Only customers often indicate that the bonus program with a debit card is not working.  And loans and borrowings require the payment of high interest.  Therefore, not everyone is ready to use Touch Bank.  If you want to master contactless payments, while not so fast service doesn‚Äôt scare you, you can rely on Touch Bank. </p>
