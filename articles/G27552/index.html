And there are certain reasons for this.  For those who love nature, this is an ideal place.  You should not go here hoping to see some outstanding monuments created by man.  But Sakhalin offers tourists much more.  This is clean air, mountains, lakes, springs with thermal water.  On the mainland, such natural wealth is rare. </p><div class="photo" data-original="military.wikia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sakhalin rest at sea" class="if uuid-2603807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/2603807.jpg"></div><p>  Particularly impressive holiday in Sakhalin in the summer.  The island is simply buried in lush vegetation.  Here unique representatives of the flora grow, the sizes of which even exceed the height of a person.  And this is not about tall trees.  The rich fauna also contributes to the creation of a certain atmosphere, after which tourists travel to these parts. </p><p>  There are also man-made objects.  For example, lighthouses, bridges, abandoned roads.  Buildings in the <span>cities of Sakhalin</span> do not cause much interest among tourists.  Most of them were built in Soviet times. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  For more than forty years, the southern part of the island belonged to the Japanese.  Today their heritage can be seen in unusual buildings, monuments and freeways.  Most of the locals drive Japanese cars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The history of Sakhalin Island dates back to the 17th century.  Then the Russians began to explore the Pacific coast.  Until the 19th century, the island did not officially belong to either Russia or Japan.  And only in 1855 was the beginning of a diplomatic alliance between these states, which reinforced the treatise on borders and friendship.  According to this document, the island of Sakhalin was in the possession of Russia and Japan.  In 1875, Sakhalin completely came under the power of Russia under the St. Petersburg Treaty. </p><h2>  Negative side of rest </h2><p>  Reviews about the rest on Sakhalin do not always speak about its positive aspects.  As in any other tourist place, the island has its own characteristics that just need to be taken into account.  The main thing that tourists distinguish from negative aspects is too high prices.  Accommodation, food and transport here are almost twice as expensive as in other cities of Russia.  Other negative aspects are characteristic not only for Sakhalin.  For example, tourism infrastructure is practically not developed here, the quality of roads is poor, and transport links are poorly developed. </p><h2>  What to see on Sakhalin? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.balanceyourbodyandsoul.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest on Sakhalin" class="if uuid-2603754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/2603754.jpg"></div><p>  Cities on the island have been inhabited relatively recently, so there are no historical infrastructure here.  The cities themselves are not of interest to tourists, which can not be said about the natural beauties of the island.  Especially travelers note the local caves - Vaidinskaya and Bear tragedies.  In addition to stalactites, here you can admire alpine meadows and the purity of mountain lakes.  The caves are located near the village of Izvestkovy, which can be reached by rail from the Smirnykh station.  There is nothing to pay for entering the caves, but local guides do not recommend exploring them yourself.  This may be uninformative, and also life threatening. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Holidays on Sakhalin Island are diversified by unique natural monuments, the main of which will be described below. </p><h2>  Tunaycha Lake </h2><div class="photo" data-original="flyfishingrussia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest on Sakhalin in the summer" class="if uuid-2603763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/2603763.jpg"></div><p>  This lake is considered the largest on the island.  To see this beauty, you must overcome the path 45 km from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.  Ornithologists like to visit this place.  You can get to the lake by minibuses following in the direction of Okhotsk. </p><h2>  Moneron Island </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.quazoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sakhalin vacation reviews" class="if uuid-2603768" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/2603768.jpg"></div><p>  To the west of the city of Kholmsk is the amazing <span>island of Moneron.</span>  He attracts tourists with his underwater world.  A warm Tsushima current passes here, thanks to which even representatives of the subtropical climate can be found in local waters.  The island is also home to seals, numerous colonies of birds and fur seals.  You can get here only by air or by boat.  The island is considered a national reserve. </p><h2>  Seal Island </h2><p>  The island is washed by the waters of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãOkhotsk.  It is located 12 km from Cape Terpeniya.  Here you can find a huge number of seals and sea birds.  The territory is considered a reserve, so you will not be able to get here on your own, only with an organized excursion. </p><h2>  Zhdanko Range </h2><p>  The massif is of volcanic origin.  Its length is 13 km, and its length is up to two km.  It organizes hiking routes that take several days.  During this time, you can go around the entire ridge.  The attraction is located north of the village of Tikhaya.  The station is followed by a mail train from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, which can be reached. </p><p>  Without a comfortable stay, rest on Sakhalin will not bring so many positive emotions. </p><p>  In the major cities of the island provides a huge selection of places to stay.  But many people prefer to live closer to nature and therefore choose recreation centers located in the suburbs. </p><h2>  Tourist complex "Fir-trees" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="market.sakh.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holiday Village Sakhalin" class="if uuid-2603790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/2603790.jpg"></div><p>  "Fir-trees" - recreation center (Sakhalin) - invites everyone to relax in the bosom of pristine nature.  The base is equipped with everything necessary.  Here you can spend time with your family, have a wedding and even conduct business negotiations.  The combination of picturesque nature with vibrant entertainment appealed to many guests of the base.  It is located in the suburbs of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. </p><h2>  Base "Yasnomorskaya" </h2><p>  An unforgettable vacation at sea (Sakhalin) can be offered by the Yasnomorskaya base.  Here you can not only breathe clean air while walking through the forest more often, but also learn to dive.  The tourist base offers accommodation in comfortable rooms.  In total, up to 20 people can live here.  This place is often chosen by large companies.  Meals can be pre-ordered or prepared on their own.  All kinds of events are held in the beautifully decorated banquet room. </p><p>  The main feature of the base is that it has its own diving center. </p><h2>  The recreation center "Tunaycha" </h2><p>  The beauty of nature and all the benefits of civilization have successfully combined this wonderful hotel complex on the coast of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãOkhotsk.  Cozy houses are equipped with modern appliances and comfortable furniture.  The houses have a thematic design, for example, a hunter's house, a bath house, a fisherman's house.  The picturesque beauty of the lake opens from all windows. </p><p>  On the territory there are arbors, barbecue facilities.  You can cook your own meals or eat in the local dining room.  From leisure - the beach, cycling, billiards, sauna, pool.  The base is located among centuries-old trees, surrounded by beautiful nature.  Rest here, according to travelers, brings true pleasure and beautiful photos. </p><p>  Rest on Sakhalin is full of surprises.  The nature of the island will not leave indifferent any traveler.  Mountains and lakes, volcanoes and seas, forests and reserves - from the natural beauties there is everything that you could wish to see.  But experienced tourists still recommend caution when walking around the local nature reserves.  A lot of bears live on the island.  And these animals do not always welcome guests with hospitality.  But if the animal is not provoked, it will not attack a person. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wildsalmoncenter.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sakhalin Island vacation" class="if uuid-2603755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/2603755.jpg"></div><p>  Sakhalin today embodies all the problems of Russia.  Weak infrastructure, poor roads, the contrast between rich cities and impoverished villages.  But all this fades into the background.  Those who at least once rested on Sakhalin want to return here again.  And all because of the unique atmosphere, which is not on any of the continents.  The islands have always attracted travelers with their natural landscapes. </p>
