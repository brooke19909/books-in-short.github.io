    <p>  As can be seen from the reviews, all programs are in demand.  To activate the tariff, it is necessary to issue an account in rubles and conclude a service agreement.  Then the client will have access to all the benefits of the services.  There are tariffs for settlement and cash services for <span>corporate clients</span> in Sberbank.  Moreover, prices in each region are different. </p><h2>  Differences </h2><p>  The main difference is the list of required documents for concluding a transaction.  LLC owners must prepare OGRN certificates and registration with tax authorities, charters, extracts from the Unified State Register of Legal Entities, protocol documents on the organization of the LLC, orders as agreed upon for the positions of managers and chief accountant (copies of their passports).  Lists of LLC participants and other documents will also be required. </p><p>  If the CSC is issued for an individual entrepreneur, then you need to provide a passport, a registration number, certificates from the Federal Tax Service Inspectorate, INN, OGNIP.  By law, individual entrepreneurs may not draw up settlement accounts - it is possible to open a bank card.  But if the calculations will be performed between legal entities, then the work is based on cashless payments. </p>

    <p>  IP without an account will not deliver payment terminals.  If the account is drawn up, then for convenience a card of an individual is connected to it for transferring funds to it without interest.  LLC needs to open a checking account for its work.  A personal card for them is not issued, all settlement procedures will be with fees. </p><p>  Thus, CSC is a necessary service for individuals and legal entities.  Given the reviews, everyone should have this service.  The main thing is to choose the most suitable program from the tariffs presented. </p>
