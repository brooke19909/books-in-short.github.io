    <p>  Convenient geographical location, very developed infrastructure is famous for <span>resort Greece.</span>  Chania will shock anyone with the beauty of its landscapes and unusualness, as well as the abundance of architectural monuments of the Turkish and Venetian era.  The Mediterranean and Aegean seas are washed by Chania, playing a strong contrast of bright blue waves and green dense vegetation.  When you look at the White Mountains with forests of cypress trees, you get the feeling that they have not changed their appearance since the Cretan Minoan civilization, and the sun is still illuminating an even strip of warm sandy beaches, adding a special touch to this place. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Greece is famous for its picturesque places.  The island of <span>Crete, Chania is</span> especially popular with tourists.  It is worth noting that most of the attractions are located in the so-called Old Town.  It represents the historical part of the city with narrow quarters and old houses, small parks, mansions and palaces that previously belonged to wealthy Venetians.  A walk through the Old City in terms of beauty and delight from what you see is not inferior to a trip to the museum. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the bay, the Venetian port was successfully located, in which you can meet an extraordinary number of fishing boats.  The port offers stunning sunset views, as well as many taverns and small cozy restaurants.  Also in the port is the Turkish Janissary Mosque, which is the oldest Muslim building in Chania and a cultural historical monument. </p><p>  Frikas Fortress is located near the port, it was there that the <span>flag of Greece</span> was first raised <span>.</span>  The Maritime Museum, located in the fortress, can be visited by tourists who are interested in considering various models of ships, ancient maps, marine instruments.  The museum has a fairly large collection. </p><p>  The Church of St. Francis is the largest, its construction dates back to the times of Venetian rule.  At the moment, there is an archaeological museum. </p><p>  The city market, which was founded in 1911, cannot be deprived of attention.  Its originality lies in its arrangement in the shape of a cross.  Everything can be found on the market - from souvenirs to food products that Greece is rich in. </p><p>  Chania is also a shopping center.  Fans of original and exclusive products just need to visit the "Leather Street".  Whatever you meet there.  A huge assortment of leather items, from skirts to raincoats, as well as leather bags, wallets, belts and, of course, shoes.  Prices in the market are low and affordable for everyone. </p><p>  A peculiar symbol of the city is a lighthouse located in the harbor of Chania.  It is one of the oldest buildings. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Not only beautiful places attract tourists to Greece (Crete, Chania).  The hotels here are simply gorgeous.  Everyone will be able to choose a suitable option, from budget to luxury.  Many old buildings here have been restored and converted into hotels.  In most of them there is no registration and booking via the Internet, all this is possible only on the spot. </p><h2>  Fereniki Holiday Resort &amp; SPA - great offer at good prices </h2><p>  This hotel is located in the resort village of Georgioupolis.
