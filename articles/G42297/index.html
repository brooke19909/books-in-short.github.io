  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Origami clapperboard and other origami crafts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Thanks to the very ancient and fascinating art of <span>paper plastic, in</span> other words, origami, we can create various objects and figures from paper.  In the origami technique, not only objects decorating the house are created, but also useful, practical things.  At the same time, various funny origami are quite quickly and easily executed. <br><br>  Those who are interested in clapperboard origami, for sure, have already tried to find step-by-step instructions for its manufacture.  Probably, in the search process on Runet you have stumbled upon more than one origami technique. </p><p>  Indeed, there are several origami technicians: <br>  ‚Ä¢ modular origami.  This technique is used to create paper three-dimensional figures, consisting of many elements made by a single technology. <br>  ‚Ä¢ medicinal <span>balls (kusudama).</span>  This technique is used to create volumetric balls from individual modules; <br>  ‚Ä¢ origami made from wet paper.  Thanks to this technique created by origami master Akiro Yoshizawa, the fabricated figure seems ‚Äúalive‚Äù; <br>  ‚Ä¢ quilling technique.  This technique is used to create volumetric or flat compositions made from long curled paper strips. <br><br>  Almost all of us made paper toys and other crafts in childhood.  For some, children's fun has grown into a favorite pastime.  Someone now, on the contrary, is unlikely to be able to remember how, in childhood, a simple boat was folded from a sheet of paper, or a clapper-board was made.  And this despite the fact that, being little mischievous, they got a lot of pleasant moments, costing their parents much cheaper if we draw a parallel with the modern wonders of pyrotechnics.  Our paper toys were not only "reusable", but also the safety of such entertainment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You probably remember how a clapperboard folded at an origami break, slamming nearby classmates chatting about something, caused their screech.  Why don't we refresh these long past carefree days now? </p><p>  Let's try to recall what the origami scheme looked like (clapperboard).  You can make this harmless paper toy with your children! <br><br>  Origami clapperboard does not require you a lot of costs.  From the materials we need only one ordinary piece of office paper for the printer or a piece taken out from the spread of the most ordinary school notebook.  Recall that the notebook sheet must be carefully removed from the middle of the notebook, unbending paper clips and not tearing it. </p><p>  A further scheme of origami (clapperboard) will look like this: </p><ol><li>  the prepared piece of paper needs to be folded in half </li><li>  bend the corners of the sheet from two sides to the center </li><li>  bend the workpiece inward in half </li><li>  bend the sheet in half again, and then bend it, getting clearly defined fold lines. </li><li>  bend the edges to the existing bend line, getting oblique bend lines from the sides of the workpiece </li><li>  Now gently fold our workpiece along the formed fold lines </li></ol><p>  An origami clapper pops if you take it by its free ends so that the inside of the craft looks straight ahead, while the hand must make a sharp forward movement.  If everything is done correctly, then the inside of the cracker will fly out and emit a loud pop. </p><p>  We can make a double or double-barreled origami clapperboard that makes a louder clapping sound.  To do this, the corners of our sheet must be bent on both sides.  Then the workpiece is bent exactly in half once, and then again.  Then, in turn, they take both ‚Äúwings‚Äù of the workpiece, are inserted inward, bending in half.  So we got a double clapperboard.  Cotton with such a toy is produced in the same way as in the first case. </p><p>  So, we made two harmless and funny origami: single and double-barreled gun.  We arm ourselves and go to amuse our friends or relatives, but do not forget to inform them in advance about the upcoming draw in order to avoid incidents ... </p>
