The music that sounds in the car, not only activates the brain activity of the driver and helps to keep him in good shape, but also raises the mood.  This is especially true for night trips or monotonous tracks.  That is why the acquisition of a high-quality JVC car radio is not just a whim. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.carid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New technologies from JVC" class="if uuid-2476069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2476069.jpg"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Car radios from the JVC brand combine the following impeccable features and characteristics: </p><ul><li>  The original design. </li><li>  Superior technical performance for trouble-free operation. </li><li>  Powerful sound in the highest quality. </li><li>  Wide functionality at a relatively low price, in comparison with other brands, without sacrificing reliability. </li></ul><h2>  Hi-tech </h2><p>  In the field of auto electronics and car audio, the manufacturer JVC places the main emphasis on <span>head units.</span>  Each year, the company updates its lineup with so many car radios and with such functionality / characteristics that it has long covered a significant part of car enthusiasts who, for various reasons, need to replace the factory head unit with a more functional and modern one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Choosing a JVC" class="if uuid-2476103" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2476103.jpg"></div><p>  With the latest innovations, you can connect ƒ∏ the JVC radio of your smartphone and use your favorite applications conveniently and safely while driving.  And the contents can be viewed on a large touch screen that is sensitive to touch your hand. </p><h2>  How to choose a radio </h2><p>  To make the most rational choice of radio for your car from the well-known brand JVC, first of all, decide on the size and functionality that are preferable for you.  For example, diskless media receivers are more popular due to their reliability and low price.  Widespread MP3 format provides the ability to accommodate without compromising sound quality the maximum number of audio files. </p><p>  An additional bonus for JVC radio tape recorders, according to owners, is the availability of protection against shaking. </p><p>  The price of a particular model may be affected by such aspects as the presence of a backlight, design, ergonomic buttons, LCD screen, touch control. </p><h2>  Connect and configure the JVC radio </h2><p>  Installing the main box usually does not cause any problems, although there are certain features.  For example, the use of a special stud that secures the rear of the radio and decorative strip.  In the future, they are much easier to remove using regular hooks.  And on the other hand, fastening with ordinary screws looks more reliable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="We connect the car radio" class="if uuid-2476110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2476110.jpg"></div><p>  No one will have any problems connecting the radio‚Äôs connectors if the vehicle has a universal ISO connector, and the connection will take just a couple of minutes.  This connector, unfortunately, appeared relatively recently.  Therefore, on early models of Honda, BMW, Nissan, Ford, there are their own connection options.  You just have to choose the appropriate adapter. </p><p>  There are no special problems with tuning and controlling the radio.  If you have a question about how to configure the JVC, refer to the parameter settings via SEL (hold the button for more than two seconds). </p><h2>  JVC KD-X70BT </h2><p>  A diskless car radio with Bluetooth wireless technology for connecting external additional devices is equipped with a USB interface and an AUX input. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.caraudiocentre.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="JVC KD-X70BTEYD" class="if uuid-2477458" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2477458.jpg"></div><p>  Advantages and features: </p><ul><li>  remote control for Android Smart Remote; </li><li>  power supply with a current strength of 1 A via a USB port; </li><li>  rear input AUX; </li><li>  50 W x 4 MOS-FET; </li><li>  Bluetooth support - adapter included; </li><li>  backup memory; </li><li>  radio timer </li><li>  remote control and instruction manual for radio JVC KD included; </li><li>  play files from iPod / iPhone and via USB; </li><li>  front slot for SD / SDHC memory cards in MP3 / WMA / WAV; </li><li>  separately changeable color of the backlight of the display and buttons; </li><li>  three-band parametric equalizer; </li><li>  volume control and subwoofer; </li><li>  liquid crystal matrix display; </li><li>  sound signal support; </li><li>  high and low pass filters. </li></ul><h2>  JVC KW-X730 review and photo </h2><p>  If you want to listen to music in the original sound without loss of quality, then this model is what you need.

It will make the interior of your car unique and attractive. </p><p>  The receiver has AUX and USB inputs, which are located on the front panel.  On the back you will find three pairs of connectors for a linear output - a subwoofer, front AC, rear AC. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avtozvuk.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="JVC KW-X730" class="if uuid-2477452" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2477452.jpg"></div><p>  Specifications: </p><ul><li>  high-speed charging in U–ÖV; </li><li>  the ability to play with Andro—ñd; </li><li>  –Öras Enhancement; </li><li>  steering wheel remote control supported; </li><li>  two-line, vertically oriented LCD-display; </li><li>  Sound L—ñft; </li><li>  sound delays. </li></ul><h2>  Multimedia Center with U–Ö </h2><p>  The JVC KW-AV 61W with iPod / iPhone support is equipped with a 6.1-inch display.  The model differs from its previous counterparts by the presence of a Bluetooth module for safe communication on the phone on the go.  It is possible to listen to music through the USB connector directly from the phone.  You can connect a USB flash drive, a phone for charging, and an Apple device. </p><p>  This JVC car radio has many features to expand the functions of the system.  It supports the connection of a rear view camera and additional monitors for convenient viewing of video in the back seat.  The outputs to external amplifiers can be adjusted to a high-quality audio system with a subwoofer and good acoustics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ek.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car JVC" class="if uuid-2477449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2477449.jpg"></div><p>  Specifications: </p><ul><li>  Touchpad; </li><li>  WVGA widescreen monitor; </li><li>  wireless technology with a Bluetooth adapter; </li><li>  playback through the USB interface of video and audio files from iPod / iPhone; </li><li>  function for setting background images; </li><li>  removable control panel; </li><li>  Dolby Digital format; </li><li>  wired microphone and bluetooth adapter; </li><li>  support for rear view camera; </li><li>  subwoofer control. </li></ul><h2>  Additional features </h2><p>  Connecting a smartphone to an Android or iO–Ö smartphone is not a problem.  Voice control provides access to the controlled personal assistant –Ö—ñr—ñ and is an important function that eliminates the need to be distracted from driving and remove your hands from the steering wheel.  You can make calls or play music without touching the mobile device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.halfords.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="top JVC models" class="if uuid-2476046" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2476046.jpg"></div><p>  Another important advantage of JVC multimedia recorders is their equipment with a multilingual screen.  About 15 languages ‚Äã‚Äãare available, including Russian, English, German. </p><p>  The JVC brand also cares about sound quality.  The wide range of sound settings available allows you to adjust and customize the sound individually for you.  Some models have a function that restores sound quality.  It amplifies the low frequencies lost during compression of audio files in MP3 or WMA formats. </p><p>  The display size of the JVC multimedia player is standard 6.2 or 7 inches.  Most of the top models have a built-in voice Bluetooth connection with a microphone.  This feature of this manufacturer always works fine. </p><p>  In addition, via Bluetooth, you can connect two phones at the same time, while ensuring a simple and secure connection. </p>
