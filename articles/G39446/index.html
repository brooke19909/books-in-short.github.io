And when this succeeds, you are surprised to find that in fact there is no more free money, and spending has increased proportionally.  Well, you are not alone in this - most people have this problem.  But the good news is that in fact at any level of income you can be financially successful - that is, spend less than you earn.  Let's think about <span>how to save</span> money painlessly and how to start the path to financial freedom. </p><p>  <strong>Step One - The Most Important</strong> </p><p>  You can dream for a long time to wake up once rich, imagine, visualize ... But without your specific actions it will be an empty lesson.  The first and most important secret of all the rich is to always spend less than you earn. </p><p>  Following this is very simple: make it a rule to save 10% from any amount that falls into your hands.  Set up a separate <span>savings account</span> and no doubt and reasoning - save money!  So every month you will pay not only to sellers of food, clothing and entertainment, but also to yourself.  You can‚Äôt even imagine how much calmer and more confident you will feel in life. </p><p>  So, you have 90% of the income.  And comes ... </p><p>  <strong>Step Two: How to Save Money</strong> </p><p>  We all want to live here and now, receiving blessings and joys from life.  Fear to refuse, to infringe on oneself most often keeps people from saving.  But there are many ways to save money almost imperceptibly. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1. Protect yourself from unnecessary waste! </p><p>  Impulsive shopping is a huge chasm, where a lot of money flows.  They bring a second joy, and then there remains only a smack of regret about the wasted money.  You can protect yourself with a few simple tricks: </p><p>  - Stick a bright sticker in your wallet with the inscription: ‚ÄúDo you really need this?‚Äù  This phrase helps to save 70% of funds from rash spending.  Just do not forget to periodically change the color of the sticker and the text of the question so that attention is not "blurred". </p><p>  - Never buy expensive items right away.  Take a time out: one day of deliberation for every <span>$ 100</span> price. </p><p>  2. Save on daily purchases! </p><p>  Saving money on food is a great way to save between $ 50 and $ 200 a month. </p><p>  - Write a list before you go to the store.  This simple rule helps you not to be distracted and buy only what you really need.  After all, so often we go to the supermarket just for bread, and we spend there ten times more along the way.  Just following the list will help to avoid this painlessly. </p><p>  - Do not go to the store on an empty stomach.  This is a <span>psychological technique: a</span> hungry person buys 30-40% more products than he really needs.  Almost all the food in the store seems delicious and <span>vital</span> to him!  Therefore - eat first, and then spend money. </p><p>  - <span>Home saving</span> does not like semi-finished products and packaged products.  Count for yourself: weighted goods and food prepared on their own cost about 30-40% cheaper than their half-cooked and bagged brothers. </p><p>  3. Be wary of buying new items and custom products! </p><p>  How to save money on this?  Very simple: wait a couple of months until the hype on the freshly released model of the phone, TV or other equipment subsides.  The price always drops by an average of 30%, and the quality of the goods remains the same.  The same thing happens with the "product from the window" - manufacturers sell it at a significant discount. </p><p>  4. Get rid of unnecessary pathos! </p><p>  Tell me, what is more important for you - to go or checkers?  What kind of overpayment do you make for things of a well-known brand, status car or watch?  Check for yourself - there are many things that you can buy half cheaper, without losing quality. </p><p>  If you stubbornly choose only expensive brands for yourself, without agreeing with your real financial capabilities, then this is an occasion to think - is everything all right with your self-esteem and self-confidence?  Maybe you are trying to buy yourself inner well-being?  But this is a separate topic for discussion. </p><p>  So, we have shown the simplest ways to save money.  Try to form in yourself these new habits that all rich people have.  This is not difficult.  But it is guaranteed to improve your life! </p>
