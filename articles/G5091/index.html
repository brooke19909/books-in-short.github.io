    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  Many people who stayed at Sanya Jinglilai Resort 3 * are happy to talk about the benefits of this hotel.  And one of those is service. </p><p>  The hotel, like its entire territory, is very clean.  So much so that you can walk barefoot along the corridors.  The rooms are cleaned daily; the rooms are cleaned carefully and not superficially.  Hygiene kits (shampoos, gels, soaps, lotions, etc.) are replenished regularly. </p><p>  The only negative that guests note is the lack of personnel who speak Russian.  But this is not surprising because the Sanya Jinglilai Resort 3 * hotel is located in an Asian country and is intended mainly for residents of Northern and Central China.  But if you need to communicate with the administrator, there is a solution.  We need to go to the reception desk and call the interpreter from there (he has his own at the hotel, located remotely), after which he will explain everything to the administrator of the complex.  And although the staff does not know the Russian language, but the people there are polite and friendly, ready to do everything possible for the comfort of their client. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In general, about the hotel Sanya Jinglilai Resort 3 * (China, Sanya Bay) leave mostly positive reviews.  But in them, guests warn potential tourists that they should not go there if they want a quiet and peaceful vacation.  The complex is located on a busy street, close to the city center, so it is always crowded there.  For this reason, in fact, the rooms are finished with soundproofing material.  But it‚Äôs very quiet near the sea.  All cafes and restaurants open in the evening, during the day you can see only sellers of food and drinks and ATV rental. </p><p>  It is also worth knowing that a road with very active car traffic leads to the hotel's beach.  It is difficult to cross, as the cars do not stop.  But many get used to it. </p><p>  A huge plus tourists consider a free shuttle service.  And the downside is the lack of beach towels.  However, you can take with you on the beach those that are issued in the room.  All the same, the maids always bring them in the amount of several pieces, and change them daily.  So there is no need to bring a beach towel with you. </p><p>  In general, if you want to go to Sanya and spend on vacation not a very large amount, then you can stay at this hotel.  It is an excellent example of a good combination of low price and decent quality, which once again allows us to verify the reviews of tourists who have already been here. </p>
