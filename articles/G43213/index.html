The granting of new ranks, the payment of large incentives, the awarding of orders and medals - all this faded in comparison with obtaining personal use of estates. </p><h2>  Manor - what is it from a historical point of view? </h2><p>  Obtaining estates for his services to the Fatherland was considered one of the king's greatest gifts.  One has only to think: a person awarded such a prize, became the owner of a piece of land with a minimum size of 100x100 meters or more.  Accordingly, all the buildings, equipment and people living there at that time became the property of the owner.  Speaking in fact, the sovereign actually "shared" a particle of his power with a decent man, in his opinion. </p>

    <p>  However, the estates at the same time differed significantly from the estate - land ownership was given out for life only to those who deserved it.  The plot could not be sold, leased or inherited by another landowner.  However, later, in accordance with the decree on inheritance of 1714, this line was erased, and the concepts of estates and estates merged into one definition of land ownership, namely, the estate.  Now, estates could become "tribal", that is, passed from generation to generation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Family estates </h2><p>  As mentioned above, with the adoption of the <span>decree on the</span> same <span>inheritance, the</span> landowners were given the opportunity to create and equip their family estates, looking confidently into the future and knowing that all their work would go not to the next landowner, but directly to their descendants.  In the period of the XV-XIX centuries, patrimonial estates played a significant role in many countries of the world.  So, for example, in Spain and the countries of Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, etc.) there were varieties of estates - hacienda and hacienda, to which people living in this territory were often attached as slaves.  Theoretically, they were in complete freedom and were not considered slaves, but in fact, in order to be able to exist, they were forced to work for the benefit of the owners of estates. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="estates of Russia" class="if" height="245" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/443889.jpg" width="539"></div>

    <p>  However, what is an estate other than a "native nest"?  Of course, this is a big money bag, which you can get by selling such a large possession, which many landlords used in emergency situations, since by the same decree the sale of the land granted by the sovereign was approved and allowed. </p><h2>  In Russia </h2><p>  In Russia, estates quite often became “heroes” of many short stories, comedies and dramas written between the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 20th century - the main ups and downs of the story took place in them.  So, the play “Cherry Orchard”, written in 1903, occurs almost entirely in the estate of the main character of the work.  The estate itself is a kind of the main theme of the play. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Fonvizin’s comedy “Undergrowth”, the epic “War and Peace” by Tolstoy, “Woe from Wit” - Griboedov’s comedy, “Dead Souls” by Gogol - all this is just a small list of those famous works in which events took place on estates (or around them) ) the main characters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="family estates" class="if" height="442" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/443888.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Russian estates were more than a plantation with slaves.  The estates in Russia were created and maintained with the aim of supporting the family, with the aim of satisfying, if possible, all the needs that arise for a person, whether it is a desire to take a walk in the forest or swim in the pond, or to take care of the household, or perhaps get an education at home .  Also, Russian estates were often highly valued for their hospitality - families came to dinner parties and balls, grooms traveled to their family estates in order to get married, travelers and travelers sought to find a temporary roof over their heads and provisions. </p><h2>  For the younger generation </h2><p>  If we turn to the present and consider the possibility of lawful maintenance of estates in real time, then perhaps many people will be tempted to move to a separate piece of land.  Despite the fact that at present cottage villages have gained great popularity, do not confuse them with family estates.  The estate, under the framework of previous laws, is such an estate that is obliged to pay taxes to the state, which has an independent energy structure, as well as a household.  In other words, the owners of estates themselves must take care of the electricity, as well as the disposal of all waste.  So what is an estate and what are its advantages for our descendants? </p><p>  The answer to the question asked above is obvious - the owner of the estate gives the future generation the opportunity to be in environmentally friendly conditions, and he can also teach his descendants to physical work and independence.  You should not take family estates as isolated from the general world.  The question is only in the presence of a huge acquired plot on which you can erect any buildings pleasing to your family.  In the end, a group of ancestral estates can easily unite into an entire ancestral settlement and together create their own infrastructure, which will include educational, medical, sports, etc.  constructions and institutions.  This is what the estate of the future is! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian estates" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/443887.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Convenience and positive qualities of family estates </h2><p>  Speaking about the positive aspects of estates, it is first necessary to mention the environmental situation in the world.  It is quite reasonable that during the construction of the estate the owner will not want to live in the wasteland and in this regard will begin the active planting of various trees and shrubs.  Some will want to grow a whole forest on their site, where you can walk.  Also, native Russian estates were never surrounded by a stone fence, a hedge almost always acted as a fence.  All this is significant enough and has a positive effect on improving the environmental situation in the country - there are more trees protected by private property, less junk food is being consumed, and this is accompanied by minimal costs, since all the food, as they say, “from the garden to the table ". </p><p>  Another advantage that the Russian land possesses is its large territories, unlike both its western and eastern neighbors, which simply physically cannot allow one person to have large tracts of land privately.  The development of family estates will lead, first of all, to the development and improvement of the land itself.  And, of course, this will help preserve family and tribal traditions, as well as strengthen <span>family ties.</span>  What is an estate?  <span>This is the stronghold of the</span> family! </p>
