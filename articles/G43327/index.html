But this is so on the calendar.  The fact is that, as a rule, only the first thawed patches occur this month.  Well, if the spring is early, then the snow melts and everywhere there is such a thaw that you will not pass and you will not pass.  I want to have warmth and even real summer.  Therefore, if your vacation falls at the beginning of spring, then you involuntarily think about where to relax in March, so much so as to enjoy the good weather and maybe even swim and sunbathe.  Moreover, the March vacation can be extended at least a little thanks to an extra day off - International Women's Day.  In addition, in many tourist places this month is either still a low season, or a decline in vacationers is already beginning.  Therefore, the prices are not so high. </p><p>  In this article, we will consider the different possibilities of where to relax in March at sea.  And we will also get acquainted with the reviews of travelers who have already tried such a spring vacation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.popsugar.com" data-author=": Matthew Alejandro, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to relax in March at sea" class="if uuid-2401986" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2401986.jpg"></div><h2>  Holidays in March: where to relax in the offseason </h2><p>  When you go on vacation in the summer, then it is as if unlimited possibilities open up for you.  Sochi and Turkey, the Baltic states and Spain - all beckons you.  It remains only to choose.  And what to do in the offseason?  Ski lovers are easier, mountains are still waiting for them.  Indeed, most of these resorts are closed in late March, or even in early April.  But if we just want the sea and the sun, then, first of all, the ocean coast comes to mind as an option.  Eternal spring or summer reigns there, and the waves rustle, pleasantly caressing the ear.  But not only on distant islands or in Asian and Caribbean exotic countries, people spend their vacations in the off-season. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When thinking about where to relax in March, do not lose sight of the states of the Middle East and Africa - Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Israel and Egypt are already taking beach tourists with might and main.  But those who know what summer swimming in the Baltic Sea or the Bay of Biscay will not be scared off by the Canary Islands, Mallorca, Malaga or the south of Italy.  Yes, and in Russia you can find places where, in good weather, you can if not splash around in the sea, then at least sunbathe.  But let's understand all of this in order. </p><h2>  Egypt </h2><p>  So, the month of March has come.  Where to relax at sea abroad?  A budget tourist will not even puzzle over this issue.  The most interesting and inexpensive option is Egypt.  Although there is no organized flow of tourists there, but there is always the opportunity to use the services of operators in Ukraine or Belarus.  The water temperature on the coast there is above 20 degrees, otherwise the corals would not have survived in it.  The coldest month for holidays in this country is January.  In March, spring is already felt, and air temperature can rise up to 30 degrees.  But hellish summer heat is not there.  Therefore, it is comfortable to relax here in March, and the cost of living in hotels and meals is quite low. </p><p>  The only problem is the cool desert wind.  In Hurghada, it can be very strong, so that the air temperature sometimes drops to 16 degrees Celsius during the day, and at night to 10. In Sharm El Sheikh, where there are many bays that are sheltered from the wind, especially in Naama Bay, the conditions for a beach holiday is better.  In addition, most resorts in Egypt have heated pools.  In a word, when you choose where to relax inexpensively in March, do not lose sight of this country.  And the lack of heat will allow you to go on numerous excursions and explore the pyramids, temples and palaces that you heard about as a child. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.roamingaroundtheworld.com" data-author=": John Widmer, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to relax inexpensively in March" class="if uuid-2402001" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2402001.jpg"></div><h2>  Emirates </h2><p>  This is one of the countries that is often considered as an option when looking for where to relax in March.  Beach holidays in the UAE are very different at the beginning and at the end of this month.  No wonder March is considered a transition period in the Emirates.  In early March, winds still blow and coolness reigns.  But in the end it is already getting hot.  The warmest temperature in the emirates on the shores of the Persian Gulf.  Therefore, if you want more summer, then choose Abu Dhabi, Ras al-Khaimah or Sharjah.  Somewhat cooler in Dubai and Fujairah.  Most tourists believe that March in the UAE is just the perfect month for a beach holiday.  But keep in mind that shopaholics come to Abu Dhabi at this time - sales are just beginning here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holidaypirates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to relax in March" class="if uuid-2402007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2402007.jpg"></div><h2>  Jordan and Israel </h2><p>  If the Egyptian resorts are already fed up with you, pay attention to the other coast of the Red Sea.  The same Gulf of Aqaba, where Dahab and Taba are located, also washes the shores of Jordan.  Why not think about where to relax in March in this country?  Stunning desert cities like Petra, or the baptismal site of Jesus - all this will be available to you in the travel agency of any resort hotel in Jordan.  The water temperature there is approximately the same as in Sharm el-Sheikh, which is not too far from here, directly opposite, across the bay.  In addition, Jordanian resorts are distinguished by a special microclimate, and there are immeasurably less people there. </p><p>  Israel in March is a great opportunity to combine beach holidays, excursions and pilgrimages.  Weather promotes travel.  Spring is in full swing and summer is felt in the air.  It is best to settle in Eilat this time of year.  On the local coast, the air temperature is about 26 degrees, and the water - 22-24.  Tourists begin to noticeably increase, especially compared to winter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="igoogledisrael.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in March where to relax" class="if uuid-2402011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2402011.jpg"></div><h2>  Thailand </h2><p>  Where is it inexpensive to relax in March, so much so that it is original?  Of course, in Thailand.  This is one of the best months for a vacation in this country.  The dry season still reigns, but not as hot as in April.  You can literally go to any resort - Pattaya, Hua Hin, Koh Samui, Koh Lanta, Phang Nga - everywhere it will be very comfortable to relax at sea.  This month, there are no as many tourists as in winter, so you can travel without the hassle.  Holidays in this country in March are quite affordable, the beaches are good and prices are falling.  The sea is so warm that you do not want to get out of it.  Although in the second half of the month on the beaches, especially on the islands, waves can appear. </p><h2>  Vietnam </h2><p>  This is a country that stretches strongly from south to north.  Therefore, unlike Thailand, here you can sunbathe not at all resorts, but only at some.  Where to relax in Vietnam in March?  Of course, in Nha Trang and Phan Thiet.  These are southern resorts, beloved by Russians, with beautiful beaches and very good weather at this time.  March is the driest month in Vietnam.  As a rule, there is no rain.  Water temperature is about 27-29 degrees, air - 32. But it is in the south.  It happens, of course, that it can be comfortable in the northern resorts of the country.  But most often at this time of year it is cool there.  Therefore, tourists are still advised to choose the south of the country for recreation.  The weather will be guaranteed.  And living here is cheaper than in Thailand.  In addition, you can treat yourself with excursions - go to Ho Chi Minh City, or even neighboring Cambodia and Laos. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zoomvacations.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="March where to relax at sea abroad" class="if uuid-2402018" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2402018.jpg"></div><h2>  Bali and Hainan </h2><p>  In the region of Southeast Asia, there are two more resorts where you can relax in March "perfectly".  These are the islands of Bali and Hainan.  They are located in different places, and therefore this month begins the season in Hainan and the end in Bali.  The Chinese island is already warm and dry, and swimming in the sea is quite pleasant.  But in Bali, you can get in the rain.  But this will only happen if you return to the hotel late at night.  Day in March, the rains in Bali, as a rule, do not go.  And the water temperature is just like in the bathroom - about 30 degrees. </p><h2>  Goa and Sri Lanka </h2><p>  Ideal weather for beach people comes at these resorts in the first month of spring.  Where to relax in the Indian Ocean in March?  It depends on what type of beach resorts you prefer.  The temperature of air and water in the state of Goa (India) is already quite summer.  The humidity of the tropics is felt.  Water warms up to 28 degrees, and air - up to 31. Just the velvet season.  And housing and food prices in this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãIndia are quite affordable.  Sri Lanka is not exactly the resort <span>where you can relax inexpensively</span> in March.  This island is aimed at fastidious tourists.  Water and air temperatures are about the same as in Goa, but prices are higher.  In addition, there is already a rainy season.  There are short showers, and sometimes waves rise in the ocean. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": GIVAGA, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to relax in March beach vacation" class="if uuid-2402022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2402022.jpg"></div><h2>  Caribbean Resorts </h2><p>  Unexplored exotic and great vacation await you in Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba.  In early spring, summer warmth reigns here.  And besides, you will find clean beaches, jungle, azure water of the ocean or the Caribbean, rum and real relaxation.  Among Mexican resorts, tourists usually choose Cancun, where you can not only swim and sunbathe.  From there it‚Äôs quite inexpensive to go to the mysterious cities of the ancient Mayans - especially Chichen Itza. </p><p>  Caribbean resorts are simply the perfect combination of natural beauty and historical sites.  Green tropical landscapes, <span>volcanic sand,</span> coffee plantations, colonial mansions and ancient pyramids, as well as uninhabited islands - all this made the coast between North and South America one of the most popular beach destinations in the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelandleisure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to relax in March" class="if uuid-2401971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2401971.jpg"></div><h2>  Spain </h2><p>  Many believe that when looking for an answer to the question of where to relax in March at sea, European resorts can be omitted.  But in vain!  The fact is that the air temperature in southern Europe is already quite comfortable.  At least it is not lower than in the Baltic in summer.  But the temperature of the water often depends on the currents.  They are cold, and then you just have to roam the beach and breathe the sea air.  But if they are warm and you are lucky, then you can swim.  Guaranteed water will be a pleasant temperature - about 20 or 22 degrees in the Canary Islands.  In Mallorca or the south of Spain - how lucky.  True, the nights will be cool.  Therefore, in your suitcase should be a swimsuit, and sunscreen, and a windbreaker or sweater.  Just in case. </p><p>  In Italy, at least in the north of the country, it rains in the first half of the month.  But by the end of March, there are more and more sunny days.  And in the very south of the country, especially in Sicily, protected from the north-west winds, you can already breathe the sea air and at least walk along the coast and enjoy dishes of freshly caught fish in local taverns.  Everything blooms around, so your photo shoots will be simply unique!  The water temperature, however, is unpredictable, because this month an African sirocco wind blows in Sicily.  It can bring both heat - and then you can swim - and cold.  In the latter case, you will have to dress warmly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": MANOLO YLLERA, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where better to relax in March" class="if uuid-2402025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2402025.jpg"></div><h2>  Sochi </h2><p>  Where to relax in March in Russia?  The question is difficult, especially if you want the sea, and not skiing.  Mostly tourists recommend the resorts of Sochi and Adler.  True, the weather in March is quite changeable, the sea is stormy, and the water is still too cold for swimming.  Although there were years when the air warmed up to 25 degrees Celsius, so you could even sunbathe.  In the afternoon, travelers from other cities often wear t-shirts and jeans, while fastidious locals wrap themselves in coats.  Everywhere there is young greenery, palm trees and cypresses rustling under the gentle breeze, bushes and Mediterranean trees bloom, and nightingales sing in the foliage.  However, snow lies in the mountains, cold winds fly in and sometimes it rains.  So, tourists still cannot do without warm clothes in the wardrobe. </p><h2>  Where better to relax in March: reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Of course, you can go to the paradise beaches of the Maldives and Seychelles, where the gentle sound of the surf and white sand are waiting for you all year round.  But the prices at these resorts are pretty bite.  Therefore, tourists often prefer more budget places, such as Egypt or Spain.  Expensive holiday destinations also include Bali and Sri Lanka.  Accommodation in Vietnam, Thailand, Goa and Hainan can be found inexpensive.  But here the flight plays a big role. </p><p>  If you manage to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù hot tours, then you will find not only excellent, but also cheap spring exotic.  And now, resorts of the Caribbean can afford more affluent tourists. </p><p>  Where is it better to relax in March?  Tourists constantly argue among themselves about this.  Some people like to ski during the day, and in the evenings, wrapped in a plaid, wander around the deserted beach.  And someone wants real southern warmth and a beautiful tan before Easter.  The choice of resort is yours.  The main thing is to know that such a vacation is available to everyone. </p>
