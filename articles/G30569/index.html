  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modern cheap TVs from popular manufacturers: a brief overview and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The buyer who buys a cheap TV understands that you do not need to expect super-interesting features from him.  The main thing is that he shows a picture.  However, many still want subconsciously that such a device had not only an acceptable image, but also something more.  The article discusses what constitutes an inexpensive device, is it worth it to purchase at all, and also what features it has. </p><p>  The review does not describe black-and-white televisions, but rather modern devices that have a democratic price tag with good image quality and technical advantages.  The devices have an excellent appearance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="weekly.ascii.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheap tv" class="if uuid-2230878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2230878.jpg"></div><h2>  Where are the cheapest TVs? </h2><p>  It‚Äôs not profitable to take TVs with you, so you should not consider this option.  It is best to see offers from large trading floors that can sell discount models that are no longer top-end. </p><p>  Given the static data, the most inexpensive stores should be called "Eldorado", "Technosilu".  If we talk about Internet resources, then <span>the cheapest TVs</span> can be purchased on sites such as Ozone or Citylink.  The main thing is to choose the right seller and model.  You should also read reviews about the device, not having the opportunity to personally test it before buying.  Stores are pleased with numerous promotions, as well as bonus events. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be noted that on the shelves of such outlets you can find not even old televisions at a low price, but modern ones that have gone out of fashion.  They will please with good characteristics. </p><p>  Next, we consider specific models of devices that can be purchased at a small price.  They have attractive functionality and quality components. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gumtree.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old tv" class="if uuid-2230890" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2230890.jpg"></div><h2>  Samsung UE32J5100AK </h2><p>  This is the cheapest Samsung TV.  The budget model has a screen diagonal of 81 cm - it's 32 inches.  The device supports Full HD resolution.  The output picture is quite decent.  Given that you can separately adjust the brightness and contrast of the backlight, it is quite possible to get the most realistic image. </p><p>  This model works with a <span>satellite tuner as</span> well as a digital one.  There is also a special functionality called ‚Äúpicture in picture‚Äù.  Due to this, this device is also the cheapest among smart devices.  With regard to sound, the described TV is quite suitable for small rooms, but it can not cope with large rooms. </p><p>  The average cost is 20 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Shivaki STV-40LED14 </h2><p>  Another cheap TV from the manufacturer Shivaki.  This model has a meter diagonal.  Resolution Full HD.  The described device is suitable for those who do not like special bells and whistles in optionality.  The contrast level is at the middle mark, the sound is not impressive, and the scan is 50 hertz.  However, for a low cost, you can get a good picture in Full HD quality.  It supports work with a digital TV tuner, and also the ability to play various video formats is built-in. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If we talk about digital channels, the image quality will be at the best level.  The analog stream is inferior, but it looks quite worthy.  The interface works as quickly as possible, but configuration is difficult. </p><p>  This model will be a good choice for those who want to get an excellent diagonal for little money without any sophisticated functionality. </p><p>  You can purchase the device for 17 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hi-news.pp.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV b / w" class="if uuid-2230874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2230874.jpg"></div><h2>  Sony KDL-32R303B </h2><p>  Sony's TV quality is impressive.  Next, we describe the cheapest device from the line from this manufacturer, which is popular. </p><p>  This device is created using special technology.  The TV combines a large number of advantages from other devices, but it is considered more advanced.  This device will be a good choice for those who do not want to overpay money for some functions that it does not need.  The resolution is HD, and the diagonal is 81 cm. For 720p, the last figure is quite small, but the result is a clear picture.  It is rich and vibrant.  The drift is 100 hertz.  At the same time (due to resolution), it practically does not affect the image quality.  There is no smoothness, but such a characteristic still warms the soul. </p><p>  The screen is matte, it received excellent viewing angles, as well as protection against glare.  There is a built-in TV tuner that allows you to work with digital reception of channels.  There is also an FM receiver, and thanks to it you can listen to the radio.  The sound of the TV is not impressive, but when compared with other budget models, it is quite good. </p><p>  The price is about 20 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.afrazesh.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Color TV" class="if uuid-2230876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2230876.jpg"></div><h2>  Mystery MTV-3223LT2 </h2><p>  Another color TV, which has a low cost.  This device is often called the most budget in its segment.  Even with the fact that the price is low, this device has received a standard set for comfortable viewing of modern TV shows. </p><p>  We are talking about HD-resolution, built-in digital tuner, a good matrix, as well as acceptable viewing angles. </p><p>  The sound, unlike the above devices, is impressive.  There are two 10-watt speakers that can work well in a large room or in an average cottage complex.  The aesthetes will probably not like the appearance, but for an ordinary person, a plain-looking design does not play a special role. </p><p>  The average cost is 12 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hi-news.pp.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV quality" class="if uuid-2230877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2230877.jpg"></div><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  This article describes not the old TVs, which can be purchased for just 1 thousand rubles.  with hands and modern options.  They will be affordable for any person. </p><p>  If the buyer wants to watch video content from external media, the devices must have a USB interface.  The main thing is to check the data transfer rate.  After all, if the device will slow down with a large file size, then there is no sense in such an interface. </p><p>  The TV tuner also expands the capabilities of the TV.  If there is a need to purchase a device for a small room, then be sure to pay attention to the viewing angles.  The larger they are, the better. </p>
