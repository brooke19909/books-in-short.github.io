SKK "Petersburg" is far from the last in importance cultural object in the city.  Let's take a closer look at it. </p><h2>  From the history </h2><p>  <span>Sports and Concert Complex</span> "Petersburg" for more than forty years.  Initially, it was called the JCC named after V.I. Lenin.  The history of this object begins back in 1970.  The city in the Soviet historical era was called Leningrad, and not St. Petersburg.  JCC named after V.I. Lenin was to become one of the sports facilities of the XXII Olympic Games in Moscow in 1980.  In an architectural sense, he presented an almost complete copy of the Olimpiysky sports complex on Mira Avenue in Moscow.  The construction of the complex lasted about ten years, and it was solemnly put into operation on May 19, 1980, shortly before the opening of the Moscow Olympics.  It was a large-scale <span>sports facility that</span> meets the highest international standards.  It was in the Soviet years that the complex was actively used for its intended purpose - as a sports arena.  However, pop and entertainment events were also held here quite regularly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg SKK" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/440739.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h2>  Architectural features </h2><p>  The complex is located in the Moscow Victory Park.  The dominant style of the building, of course, is constructivism.  The buildings of this style, popular in the first half of the twentieth century, are mainly located in Moscow and other large industrial centers.  But modern St. Petersburg also has them.  SKK "Petersburg" in plan is a grand cylinder built into a massive basement.  The height of the structure is 40 meters and the diameter is 160 meters.  The capacity of the CCM in St. Petersburg exceeds 25 thousand spectators.  The complex is still one of the largest on the European continent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  During the years of economic crisis </h2><p>  In the memorable many nineties, the city of Leningrad regained its original historical name - St. Petersburg.  JCC named after V.I. Lenin at the same time began to be referred to as the St. Petersburg Sports and Concert Complex.  But these years cannot be called happy and prosperous.  Keeping up to date such large sports complexes as the CCM in St. Petersburg requires significant financial resources.  In order to obtain them, a significant part of the construction area was given to commercial structures for retail outlets.  <span>The sports complex</span> has existed for many years, combining a flea market and a concert venue for touring pop groups under one roof. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="SKK in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/440737.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <h2>  SKK, <span>St. Petersburg.</span>  Official website and technical information </h2><p>  In 2011 SKK "Petersburg" ceased to be a trade and fair platform.  But the direction of his activity has significantly changed from sports to concert-entertainment.  It is considered an honor to perform many world-famous musical groups and performers.  In addition, various kinds of festivals and events of citywide significance are held in the building of the complex.  The CCM site is in demand and popular.  For many pop groups it is a very significant fact when their track record includes the mark ‚ÄúCCM, St. Petersburg‚Äù.  This address is respected among music performers. </p><p>  The schedule of all upcoming events in the CCM is prepared in advance for a significant period of time.  Everyone can get acquainted with it on the official website at: http://www.spbskk.ru/.  It also contains all the necessary information about the work of the structural units of the complex and how it is better to get to it from different areas of the city.  The official address of the complex: 196105, Russia, St. Petersburg, Yuri Gagarin Avenue, 8. </p>
