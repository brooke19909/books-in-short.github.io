History of education, development prospects</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Boguchany of the Krasnoyarsk Territory is an ancient Siberian village, a regional center.  It was founded by Russian peasant immigrants in 1642.  It is located on the left bank of the Angara, which in this place has a width of about 2 km.  The distance to Krasnoyarsk is 563 kilometers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aviateka.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Boguchany Krasnoyarsk Territory" class="if uuid-3162900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3162900.jpg"></div><h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  The village is located in the Far North, on the banks of the Angara, on both sides of which there is an endless taiga.  Located in the north-east of the Krasnoyarsk Territory.  Boguchany is the final destination of the regional road 04K-020, starting from Kansk.  Its length is 330 km.  At a distance of 135 kilometers from the village is the <span>Boguchanskaya hydroelectric station,</span> and 148 km away is the city of Kodinsk. </p><p>  Almost the entire territory of the Boguchansky district is covered with taiga forest.  It borders in the north with Evenki, in the east with Kezhemsky, in the south with Abansky, in the south-west with Taseevsky, in the west with Motyginsky areas.  From the southeast is the Irkutsk region.  The area covers an area of ​​54 thousand square kilometers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="energosfera.spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Boguchany village, Krasnoyarsk Territory" class="if uuid-3162904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3162904.jpg"></div><h2>  History of education </h2><p>  The Boguchans of the Krasnoyarsk Territory were formed in 1642.  The founders of the village were peasant immigrants from northwestern Russia.  Although there is a version that it was formed by the Cossacks, no confirmation was found. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before the appearance of Russian peasants in these lands, the lands were inhabited by the Tungus tribes, the ancestors of modern Evenki.  Their main occupation was deer breeding, hunting, and fishing.  The entire territory of the modern district was part of the county, the capital of which was the city of Mangazeya.  The pioneers, rising higher along the Yenisei, built jails, about which they informed Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich in their reports.  In one of them, dated 1642, they wrote about this village.  Since this is the first written mention of the village of Boguchany of the Krasnoyarsk Territory, the countdown of its existence is determined from this year. </p><p>  The first inhabitants of the village plowed up the land that they received in unlimited quantities, raised livestock, cleared mowing lands, fished, hunted, including the fur trade.  They traded the Angara with other settlements.  After the construction of the Moscow tract, which was held at a distance from Boguchany, furs sales declined sharply. </p><p>  Local residents learned to breed deer, make skins, sew warm shoes from them.  After laying a toboggan route to Kansk (end of the 19th century), merchants, furs and grain purchasers began to travel to the village.  According to the “Lists of Populated Places of Russia” (1859), in the village of Boguchany of the Yenisei province there were 29 peasant households, 193 inhabitants, a church, a parish school and a government store. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tvk6.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Boguchany Krasnoyarsk Territory" class="if uuid-3162914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3162914.jpg"></div><h2>  Village development </h2><p>  The Boguchans of the Krasnoyarsk Territory in the pre-revolutionary times were a large village by Siberian standards.  The first stone church in these places, destroyed after the revolution, and a parish school were built here.  Residents continued to engage in agriculture, hunting, and fishing.  The enlargement of the village, its formation took place in the Soviet years.  This was facilitated by the development of logging, export and rafting of timber along the Angara. </p><p>  In April 1924, the Boguchansky district was created.  With the opening of timber industry enterprises, new residents began to come here.  Infrastructure was formed, roads appeared linking these places with cities and towns located in the immediate vicinity, an airport was built.  50 kilometers from the village is the railway station Karabul.  In old photos of Boguchan in the Krasnoyarsk Territory, you can see that many houses built on larch foundations and with walls made of Angarsk pine are well preserved. </p><p>  The population increased year by year.  The maximum number of residents was registered in 1989 and amounted to more than 13 thousand people.  In recent years, the number of residents has been steadily declining: in 2016, slightly more than 11 thousand were registered. </p><h2>  Development prospects </h2><p>  On the territory of the Boguchansky district, in Soviet times, deposits of gas, coal, aluminum, iron, vanadium, titanium, and manganese were explored.  Nature has endowed this land with countless riches.  An aluminum plant is currently under construction.  The North Siberian Railway will pass through Boguchany. </p>
