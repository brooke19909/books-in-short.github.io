    <h2>  An annuity payment is ... </h2><p>  Before the practical part of studying the issue, you should familiarize yourself with the theory.  In economic theory, annuity payment is one of the methods of monthly payment of a loan, when its amount remains unchanged throughout the entire loan term. </p><p>  With this <span>method of repaying the loan, the</span> payer simultaneously pays accrued interest and part of the principal.  But, as a rule, at the beginning the monthly installment mainly consists of interest on the loan.  Therefore, when calculating annuity payments on a loan, you can notice that this method of returning funds is not very beneficial for borrowers. </p><h2>  Annuity Classification </h2><p>  Depending on additional lending conditions, annuity payments are divided into small groups.  Their classification is quite diverse, but some types of annuities are no longer found or are extremely rare in the list of banking services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Types of annuities: </p><ul><li>  Fixed - unchanged throughout the loan term. </li><li>  Foreign exchange - the amount of payment may vary depending on fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. </li><li>  Indexable - can be adjusted adjusted for the current inflation rate. </li><li>  Variables - payments vary depending on the level of profitability of a financial instrument. </li></ul><p>  The mechanism for calculating annuity loan payments depends on their type.  However, fixed annuities are most often used for consumer lending. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of annuity payments </h2><p>  Calculation of annuity payments on a loan is usually made before it is issued.  Therefore, it is important to know whether it is worth doing any calculations at all, or whether it is better to immediately choose another bank for a loan.  To decide, you need to weigh all the pros and cons of annuity payments. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  invariability of the amount and date of payment throughout the loan term; </li><li>  accessibility for almost all borrowers, regardless of their financial situation; </li><li>  the possibility of reducing payments adjusted for inflation. </li></ul><p>  For many people, the annuity method of repaying a loan is convenient because, knowing the exact amount of the monthly installment, it is easier to plan a family budget.  However, in terms of economic benefits, it has several significant drawbacks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  the total amount of overpayment is much higher than with a differentiated method of repaying debt; </li><li>  complexity of early repayment; </li><li>  the impossibility of recalculation if the borrower wishes to repay the loan ahead of schedule. </li></ul><p>  If we consider an example of calculating an annuity payment on a loan, then it immediately becomes clear that it is beneficial for banks to issue such loans to customers.  However, some are not so keen on profit, therefore, provide borrowers with more favorable credit conditions.  It is worth noting that there are no such companies among <span>microfinance organizations</span> .  Therefore, when applying for a loan, an annuity method of paying off debt is always used. </p><h2>  What does a loan payment consist of? </h2><p>  If we consider the components of an annuity payment, we can see that it is divided into two parts.  The first is fixed interest on the loan, the second is part of the amount of the principal debt.  Moreover, the amount of accrued interest usually exceeds the amount used to repay the loan. </p>

    <p>  The loan body is compared with interest on it only in the middle of the total loan term.  Further, the amount that is used to pay off the main debt begins to grow, gradually exceeding the amount of payments for using the loan.  As mentioned earlier, this is not beneficial for borrowers, especially when it comes to <span>long-term lending.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Methods for calculating the monthly annuity loan payment </h2><p>  In fact, calculating the exact size of the payment is quite simple.

    <h2>  Calculation formula </h2><p>  The calculation of interest on loans for annuity payments, regardless of the chosen method of calculation, is carried out using a special formula.  Credit calculators, mobile applications and other software makes the right calculations, starting from it. </p><p>  The general form of this formula is as follows: </p><p>  AP = O * ps / 1 - (1 + ps) <sup>-s</sup> , </p><p>  Where: </p><p>  AP - monthly annuity payment; </p><p>  About - the amount of the main debt; </p><p>  ps - monthly interest rate of the bank; </p><p>  s - the number of months in the loan term. </p><p>  Knowing the formula, you can easily make the necessary calculations yourself.  It is enough to substitute the initial data of the proposed loan instead of letters, and make the necessary mathematical calculations using a conventional calculator.  But in order to make the calculation of loan repayment by annuity payments the most understandable, consider it as an example. </p>

    <h2>  Calculation Example </h2><p>  Suppose that the borrower took a loan in the bank in the amount of 50,000 rubles for a period of 5 years.  Under the terms of the loan agreement, the annual interest rate on the loan is 20%. </p><p>  Based on the formula, for calculations you need to know the monthly interest rate.  Banks rarely indicate this figure in a loan agreement, so you need to find it yourself.  To do this, use the formula: </p><p>  ps = P / 100/12, </p><p>  Where: </p><p>  P - annual interest rate. </p><p>  Payment: </p><p>  ps = 20/100/12 = 0.017. </p><p>  Knowing all the initial data, you can begin to find an annuity payment on the loan.  It looks like this: </p><p>  AP = 50,000 * 0.017 / 1 - (1 + 0.017) <sup>-60</sup> = 1336.47 rubles. </p><h2>  Calculation of annuity loan payments in Excel </h2><p>  Excel is not just a big table.  In it you can make a huge amount of calculations, knowing only which formulas you need to use.  To calculate the annuity payment in Excel there is a special function - PMT.  To use it correctly, you need to follow the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Fill in the source data (amount, interest and loan term in cells B2, B3, B4, respectively). </li><li>  Set up a loan repayment schedule by month (A7 -A <sub>n</sub> ). </li><li>  Make the column ‚ÄúCredit Payments‚Äù (B7 - B <sub>n</sub> ). </li><li>  Opposite the first month, in the column ‚ÄúLoan payments‚Äù enter the formula </li></ol><p>  = PMT ($ B3 / 12; $ B $ 4; $ B $ 2) and press Enter. </p>

    <p>  You can double-check the data with the help of a credit calculator for annuity payments.  It is on the websites of all banks that issue loans with this repayment method.  To use the loan calculator, you will need the same initial data as for the previous calculation methods.  They must be entered in the fields provided for filling.  And then the program will do all the calculations on its own within a few seconds, giving the potential borrower the opportunity to evaluate the amount received and think carefully about the upcoming loan. </p>
