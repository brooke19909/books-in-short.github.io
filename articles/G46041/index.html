    <p>  An enterprise is created in order to carry out entrepreneurial as well as economic activities of a non-commercial nature. </p><p>  It is a person of legal and other legal entities in its composition does not include.  The company has its own bank account, independent balance sheet and separate property.  It is also required to have its own seal with the identity code and name supplanted on it. </p><p>  Types of enterprises may depend on <span>ownership.</span>  In this case, distinguish: </p><p>  1) Utilities, which operate on the basis of the territorial community and the ownership of the communal services. </p><p>  2) Private, existing on the basis of the <span>private property of a</span> legal entity, as well as several citizens or one (it does not matter whether it is a foreigner or not).  Private enterprise hires workers. </p><p>  3) Enterprises that operate on the basis of collective ownership.  It can be <span>production cooperatives,</span> enterprises of various organizations (for example, religious, public). </p><p>  4) Those that are founded by combining several forms of ownership into one. </p><p>  5) State, the functioning of which is based, respectively, on state ownership. </p><p>  By the method of establishment, as well as the formation of the charter, there are the following types of enterprises: </p><p>  - corporate; </p><p>  - unitary. </p><p>  Corporate enterprises are formed, as a rule, by the decision of several founders.  They unite their assets, engage in one activity, manage affairs together, and share risks and revenues.  Among corporate distinguish the following types of enterprises: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - those that are created in the form of a business company; </p><p>  - those based on the private property of two or more persons. </p><p>  A unitary enterprise has one founder.  He allocates the property necessary for the development of his business, forms a charter that does not contradict the law.  The founder does not depend on anyone in deciding on the restructuring of the enterprise or its liquidation.  He can distribute income himself and form a team, or he can appoint a leader for this.  The following types of unitary enterprises are found: </p><p>  1) Utilities.  On the basis of part of the communal property, they are created by competent state authorities. </p><p>  2) State.  About their creation give orders to state authorities.  They are formed on the basis of some part of the property, separated from the state.  The <span>state enterprises</span> themselves manage <span>state enterprises</span> . </p><p>  3) Enterprises based on the basis of religious organizations. </p><p>  4) Enterprises formed on the basis of the private property of their founders. </p><p>  Depending on the number of employees involved and the amount of annual income from products that were sold, there are the following types of enterprises: </p><p>  1) small; </p><p>  2) medium; </p><p>  3) large. </p><p>  The first include those whose number of employees does not exceed fifty people per <span>financial year,</span> and the volume of income from the sold services, works or products does not exceed five hundred thousand euros at the rate of the National Bank taken on average per year.  The types of small enterprises are determined not by the method of their creation, not by who is their founder, but by the size and number of employees. </p><p>  Large enterprises are those in which the number of employees per year (accounting) exceeds one thousand people, and the annual income from the sale of services, works or products exceeds five million euros at the rate of the National Bank, taken on average per year. </p><p>  All other enterprises are considered medium. </p><p>  Separately, there are <span>transnational corporations.</span>  They have branches in several countries at the same time.  Corporations can produce their products and sell them where it is most profitable for them at the moment, and thereby make a profit that supplements the main one. </p>
