Moscow metro stations on the map</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Poklonnaya Gora (Park Pobedy metro station) is a gentle hill west of the center of Moscow, spread between the small rivers Filka and Setun.  In ancient times, Poklonnaya Mountain was located outside of Moscow, and from its top a city panorama was visible.  A tract passed along the slope of the mountain, and everyone who passed by stopped to bow to the church at the top.  These bows were human and gave the name to this place - Poklonnaya Gora.  Metro is the most convenient way to get to the Memorial complex today. </p>

    <p>  The Victory Park station of the Moscow Metro is located quite close to the Poklonnaya Gora Memorial Complex and is a large interchange hub that combines two Moscow metro lines - Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya and Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya.  The passenger flow is transplanted through two halls, which are structurally identical, but with different decorative designs.  The halls have been operating since May 2003, when the section from Kievskaya station was continued, one stage west of the Ring Line.  Since January 2014, a previously unused section was opened, today part of the radius of the new line - Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya, passes through it.  Train traffic is open to the Delovoy Tsentr station. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Currently, work is underway to lay the second leg of the Kalinin-Solntsevskaya line in the south-west direction, to the stations "Ramenki", "Lomonosovsky Prospect" and "Minskaya". </p><p>  The opening of new hauls is planned for November-December 2015, and this will add potential opportunities to get to the main <span>attraction of Moscow</span> - the Memorial complex on Poklonnaya Hill - by the shortest route. </p><h2>  Poklonnaya Gora, 19th century </h2><p>  The current Poklonnaya Gora (Park Pobedy metro station - the closest to the memorial) was mentioned in the Chronicles of Bykhovets, a chronicle that reflects the relations between the two great principalities, Moscow and Lithuania, from 1368 to 1370.  Poklonnaya Gora appears in separate documents of the 16th century, which trace the history of the campaign of Khan Gaza-Girey to Moscow.  Later, on Poklonnaya Hill, credentials were presented to newly appointed ambassadors in Russia.  In 1812, on the famous hill, Napoleon Bonaparte was waiting for the keys to Moscow, which he never brought. </p>

    <p>  "Memory Book" is an electronic archive that includes data on all participants in the war.  The book contains 1,500 volumes with information about each defender of the Fatherland, historical references and biographies. </p><p>  In the open air in Victory Park there are exhibits of military equipment, numbering more than three hundred: tanks, guns, armored vehicles, Katyushas, ‚Äã‚Äãanti-aircraft guns and many other means of warfare. </p><h2>  Church of St. George </h2><p>  The Orthodox Church, founded by Patriarch Alexy II on Poklonnaya Hill in December 1993, was opened and consecrated in May 1995.  In the architecture of the temple, the influence of the modernist style is felt, the sacredness of the church is slightly diluted with free interpretations of the authors. </p><h2>  Mosque of Muslim memory </h2><p>  On Poklonnaya Hill stands a Muslim memorial mosque - the memory of Muslims who died during the war.  The architecture of the mosque combines the styles of Tatar, Uzbek and Caucasian.  The author of the project is the architect Tazhiev Ilyas. </p><h2>  Synagogue </h2><p>  In 1998, on Poklonnaya Hill, a memorial was erected to commemorate Jews who were victims of German fascism.  The synagogue keeps the memory of the victims of the Holocaust, and it can quite be called a museum of Jewish history.  Expositions in the synagogue concern not only wartime, they talk about the appearance of Jews in Russia, the resettlement of Jewish communities and the assimilation of the Jewish nation. </p>
