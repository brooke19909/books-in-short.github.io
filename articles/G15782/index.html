  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Clutch pattern. Simple sewing methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Currently, more and more new types of accessories are appearing.  These are unusual scarves, straps, jewelry, handbags and so on.  Many fashionistas prefer to carry clutches in their hands.  These are small handbags, usually rectangular in shape, which are a kind of "continuation" of clothing.  Although few things fit in a clutch, and even it is not as functional as an ordinary handbag, it does not become less in demand from this. </p><p>  A prerequisite of the clutch is that it must be in harmony with clothes and shoes. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the coolest clutches in specialty stores are expensive.  But needlewomen found a way out of this situation!  They began to create original hand-made wallets.  Next, we consider in more detail the options for clutch patterns. </p><h2>  Fashion accessory </h2><div class="photo" data-original="abeautifulmess.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clutch pattern" class="if uuid-2243639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45228/2243639.jpg"></div><p>  There are quite a lot of clutch patterns (with your own hands you can make such a handbag in just one evening).  It is very important to choose the right material.  You can make such a purse from leather, suede, tapestry, tweed, dense cotton, denim and wool. </p><p>  Clutches are everyday and evening.  They can be decorated with rhinestones, beads, straps, beads, a bow and so on.  You can make an interesting and original embroidery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Clutches are rectangular in shape.  Color can be in tone with a dress or shoes.  Of course, you can carry a purse in a contrasting color. </p><h2>  Clutch envelope pattern </h2><p>  Stylish and original clutch envelope can be made of leather or suede fabric. </p><p>  Almost everyone in the house has an old leather bag.  Usually they don‚Äôt use it, and it‚Äôs a pity to throw it away.  Then you can use your imagination and give things a second life. </p><p>  To create a clutch envelope you will need: the material itself (leather from an old bag, suede), scissors or a sharp knife, half rings, an awl, a carbine, nylon threads, pencils, a ruler, and a clasp. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.handmadiya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clutch bag pattern" class="if uuid-2247007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45228/2247007.jpg"></div><p>  First, a rectangle of the desired size (approximately 27 cm x 10 cm) is drawn on the wrong side of the material. </p><p>  It must be drawn taking into account the fact that there will also be a lid covering the future clutch (27 x 5 cm in size).  The cover can be made rectangular, triangular or rounded. </p><p>  Then a second rectangle is drawn (the same size as the first, i.e. 27 x 10 cm, but already without a cover).  This will be the front of the clutch. </p><p>  Next, two parts are folded with the front sides to each other.  Having retreated approximately 2.5 mm from the edge, holes are pierced with an awl.  On them, the parts are sewn together with a strong thread with a simple seam in one direction.  Then the details are stitched in the opposite direction. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Two parts of a fastener or button are fixed to the front part and the cover.  They are needed to close the clutch. </p><p>  The clutch is ready.  It can be decorated at your discretion with jewelry, a bow, figures, flowers or a simple strap. </p><h2>  Clutch pattern (photo attached) with a bow in a classic style </h2><p>  For such a purse, you will need: the material itself, the fabric for the bow, the lock, the fabric for the pocket, and the seal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pattydoo.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clutch pattern photo" class="if uuid-2243628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45228/2243628.jpg"></div><p>  First, a clutch pattern is made.  Two details need to be revealed: the front and back parts of the future product, one pocket detail, two bow parts and a bow strap. </p><p>  First, two details of the strap for the middle of the bow are stitched.  Then the bow details are sewn with the front sides inward.  Then the part needs to be turned out.  The finished strap is worn on the bow. </p><p>  A seal and a pocket are applied to the main material of the future product.  The finished bow is sewn onto the front of the clutch.  Next, a lock is taken and sewn between the parts of the main fabric.  Then the clutch is stitched on the sides and turned out. </p><p>  The bag is almost ready.  If desired, it can be supplemented with decorative elements. </p><p>  This clutch pattern and the progress of the work are simple, do not require high labor costs.  Even a person who is far from sewing can handle the task of sewing a purse-purse. </p><h2>  Bag decoration </h2><p>  Any clutch bag can be decorated.  From this product will only become more interesting, jewelry emphasize the individuality of the owner of the clutch.  The main thing is to have a healthy imagination, a sense of style and measure.  For example, metal buttons and rhinestones, wristbands, patch, spikes and buttons, brushes, chains, brooch, appliqu√©s and so on can become a decoration. </p>
