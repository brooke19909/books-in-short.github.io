Went on sale November 3, 2017.  Cost - 80 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Why are buyers so impressed with the iPhone 10?  This is due to the use of a new type of display, previously in Apple smartphones a completely different screen was used.  The new one added support for HDR10, True Tone, the glass is covered with an oleophobic coating, thanks to it, the phone is not affected by moisture and there are no fingerprints left. </p><p>  The display perfectly displays HDR quality content.  Density - 458 dpi.  Due to the wide range of color shades, anyone will be delighted with the use of this phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photos from iPhone 10 to computer" class="if uuid-2864437" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2864437.jpg"></div><h2>  Iron and operating system </h2><p>  Photos of iPhone-10 do not convey how well the phone works and why.  The device runs on an A11 processor, six cores are installed, the nominal clock frequency is 2.5 GHz.  Graphic acceleration is at a high level, the coprocessor is M11.  There is a neural connection, thanks to it, machine learning is implemented and artificial intelligence works perfectly.  Due to the installed chipset, smartphone performance is at the highest level.  The smartphone is faster than some MacBooks.  As mentioned above, the RAM in the phone is 3 GB, built-in - 64 and 256 GB.  The release of the operating system that is installed on the phone took place on September 19 of the same year. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camera phone </h2><p>  If you copy a photo from iPhone-10 to a computer, you will notice the highest image quality.  In the new smart, a pair of 12-megapixel modules received double stabilization.  The first has aperture f / 1.8, the second - f / 2.4.  Such indicators in modern conditions are the best.  The front-facing camera with a resolution of 7 megapixels has support for the Retina Flash on-screen flash, as well as HDR. </p><p>  The main camera has augmented reality support.  The ARKit function is already available to a large number of users, but in the "top ten" it is implemented using the TrueDepth rear camera. </p><p>  In the reviews they write that any objects are obtained perfectly on images taken on the iPhone-10.  Photos of flowers or a small butterfly - all this will be beautifully detailed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bgr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photo screen &quot;iPhone 10&quot;" class="if uuid-2864443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2864443.jpg"></div><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Inside the case is a lithium-polymer battery.  The manufacturer claims that the phone works two hours longer than the iPhone-7.  In music playback mode, the device operates for about 60 hours and 21 hours - with constant conversations.  The company installed fast charging, but the adapter that comes with the kit is not able to provide the required power. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sales in Russia and cost </h2><p>  The phone went on sale on November 3, not only in Russia, but also in other countries of the world.  On October 27, a pre-order smartphone was opened.  By that time, a large number of iPhone-10 photos appeared on the Web.  The device is sold in shades: silver and gray space. </p><p>  The cost of the phone is about 80 thousand rubles for a configuration with 64 GB of memory, and the top-end configuration with 256 GB will cost 90 thousand.If you want the phone to be able to quickly charge, you will have to pay 4 thousand rubles, the same will cost wireless. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;IPhone-10S&quot; photo" class="if uuid-2864435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2864435.jpg"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The phone operates at a transfer rate of 1.2 Gb / s.  In addition, the smartphone was able to work with fast Wi-Fi.  Installed "bluetooth" version 5, NFS and Glonass.  The smartphone also works with a mobile payment system, stereo speakers, a voice assistant are installed. </p><h2>  IPhone 10 Plus </h2><p>  Photos of the regular version and the ‚ÄúPlus‚Äù are given below for comparison.  If we consider their technical characteristics, then the difference between them also becomes noticeable. </p><p>  The Plus version has: </p><ul><li>  The diagonal of the display is 6.5 inches. </li><li>  Extension 2800 x 1400, OLED type matrix. </li><li>  A12 processor. </li><li>  The main camera is dual - 12 megapixels. </li><li>  Frontal - 8 megapixels. </li><li>  RAM - 4 GB, internal - 128 GB and 512 GB. </li><li>  Battery - 4 thousand mAh. </li><li>  Weight - 200 g. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="bgr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;IPhone-10&quot; photo of flowers" class="if uuid-2864439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2864439.jpg"></div><h2>  External features of the "Plus" </h2><p>  The case has a steel frame.  Users who use the usual "top ten" complain that it peels off over time, so a different application method is used here.  Near the frame are glass panels. </p><h2>  How to distinguish iPhone 10 from the new version - S </h2><p>  You need to understand that X and XS at first glance look the same, there are no distinctive markings on the rear panel.  However, there are special differences between the buildings.  In the XS line there is a model of a golden shade, among the modifications of the usual ‚Äútop ten‚Äù there is no such shade.  In addition, the new version received two additional antenna bands.  They are located on the side faces, the headphone port is located above the microphone and speaker holes.  The camera module has a greater width and length than the usual "tens". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone photo &quot;iPhone-10&quot;" class="if uuid-2864442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2864442.jpg"></div><h2>  IPhone XS cameras </h2><p>  The iPhone 10S photo does about the same quality as its predecessor.  In fact, the cameras have not changed - the same 12 and 7 megapixels.  However, the sensor size has changed from 1.2 to 1.4 microtons.  Thanks to this, the photosensitivity of the device has become higher.  The matrix transmits more light by 50%.  Due to this, in poor light conditions, the phone shoots much better than the usual ‚Äútens‚Äù.  Added depth of field adjustment.  Added Smart HDR mode.  This allows you to take multiple shots with different exposure levels. </p><h2>  X / XS Performance Comparison </h2><p>  If we compare the processor of the usual ‚Äútens‚Äù with the updated version, then it is noticeably weaker.  In "Antutu" XS took more than 350 thousand points in performance.  The smartphone can truly be called one of the most powerful in the world.  The A12 processor is made according to a special technological process.  The chip consumes 50% less energy.  It is 30% more powerful.  The speed and quality of work along with artificial intelligence at the highest level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;IPhone-10 Plus&quot; photo" class="if uuid-2864446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2864446.jpg"></div><h2>  X reviews </h2><p>  The article has already described the advantages of the phone, so you should not focus on the pros that users are talking about.  Consider the negative points. </p><p>  The screen slows down the phone and slows down the interface.  This is due to the fact that its frequency is 120 Hz.  Another minus - on the sides there are sensors and a camera that will interfere during the gameplay. </p><p>  Sometimes the face recognition scanner is buggy, autonomy is not impressive.  The manufacturer compared it with a relatively old smartphone - the ‚Äúseven‚Äù.  However, users note that in reality the battery life is not enough, as for a large-screen phone. </p><p>  At the presentation, four modifications were announced: 64 GB, 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB.  However, the second and fourth did not go on sale.  If the rejection of the 512 GB version can be justified by the high cost, then why 128 GB was abandoned is not clear. </p><p>  Reviews of the S and Plus versions are more positive.  The developers have fixed some errors.  The interface has become smoother, faster.  The face recognition scanner has also been enhanced.  It began to work faster, and during the day the pin-code has to be entered much less frequently than in the first version of the ‚Äútens‚Äù. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The first thing that impresses the phone is the screen.  Photos of "iPhone 10" amaze anyone.  To date, the device has slightly decreased in price, but you should still think about buying carefully.  The article describes the negative aspects associated with the tenth iPhone.  They do not greatly affect the impression of the device, but still leave an unpleasant feeling.  The phone is quite expensive, so many buyers would like to see in their hand a really perfect device. </p><p>  For undemanding users, a modification of 64 GB is suitable.  If this is not enough, you can take the option with 256 GB.  But it should be understood that the cost of the second modification will be higher than the base. </p><p>  The technical characteristics of the device are impressive right away.  The phone works quickly, smoothly, rarely slows down.  It supports most modern games and allows you to work with 3D-graphics. </p><p>  If you want the phone to support any application, then it is better to give preference to the XS version.  She works on a new processor.  It provides not only better performance, but also faster scanner operation. </p>
