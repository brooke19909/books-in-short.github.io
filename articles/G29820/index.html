According to the director, there is hardly a museum somewhere in the world that can boast of a concentration of installations (per 1 sq. M).  5 Bolshaya Morskaya Street - The Museum of Illusions is located at this address. </p>

    <h2>  Magic or science? </h2><p>  The museum fully meets its name: everything that is perceived by the organs of vision does not coincide with reality.  Three-dimensional images are difficult to distinguish from real objects, which is why the visitor has the impression that the person is one of the characters in the picture.  This is an almost realistic walk on the roofs of buildings, escape from a hungry crocodile, the presence inside the famous comedy film.  Or maybe you want to become Alice and visit Through the Looking Glass, or will you be inspired by the embodiment of an opponent‚Äôs goal with a ball as a boxer or soccer player?  The cruise on the fateful Titanic will surely appeal to dreamers and romantics.  Where is this "dreamland" located?  Address - Bolshaya Morskaya, 5 (Museum of Illusions). </p><p>  Confirmation of this kind of effects can serve as photographs.  Each adult is given the opportunity to plunge into the world of childhood, having been in a different dimension, and thereby make sure that the human brain is easily misleading.  Anyone can leave feedback about the exhibition.  If you read them, you can make sure that the exposure gives people a lot of positive emotions and joy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Interactive Museum "Illusion" </h2><p>  Almost half a year later, another event took place - the opening of the Illusium interactive museum.  On display are sound effects combined with visuals that miraculously change the picture of the real world.  It seems incredible the transformation of an adult into a very small child.  And, on the contrary, the baby instantly "grows" several times.  Everyone is allowed to not only take a picture on the background of the exhibit, but even touch any of them with his hands.  Location - Bolshaya Morskaya street, 5. The Museum of Illusions, whose photo is fascinating, invites adults and children to its exhibition halls. </p><h2>  Dwarfs and Giants </h2><p>  The contemplation of the dynamics of a three-dimensional canvas can be a real test of how mentally stable a person is.  And how much adrenaline is released from the one who tried the "flying" chair ... </p><p>  Where else but in this museum can one go beyond the bounds of the reasonable - to where all the surrounding objects are in a different spatio-temporal dimension.  As an exhibit in the museum, the brainchild of the American psychologist and ophthalmologist Adelbert Ames is presented - a room that has a trapezoidal shape.  Although viewed from the front, it seems that this is an ordinary cubic room.  Two people located in opposite corners of Ames‚Äôs room, due to 3D optical illusions, will be visually perceived by each other, respectively, as a dwarf and a giant.  5 Bolshaya Morskaya Street (Museum of Illusions) can be reached by metro.  To do this, go to the Admiralteyskaya station. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  In the giant's house </h2><p>  Passing through the door, made in the form of a <span>keyhole, the</span> visitor is in the giant‚Äôs house.  Here, interesting surprises await in the spirit of surrealism, that is, a person finds himself in unexpected guises: </p><ul><li>  transforms into a tiny trinket on a huge couch; </li><li>  It appears in the middle of pea bean and cabbage leaf in a plate hundreds of times larger than usual; </li><li>  It appears near a can with condensed milk, which is more like a 500-liter <span>wooden barrel</span> with wine; </li><li>  sits on a six-meter highchair. </li></ul><p>  The imaginary giant's favorite pastime is reading classical literature.  It seems to be nothing unusual: in the office on the desktop is the book ‚ÄúCrime and Punishment‚Äù by F. M. Dostoevsky, and next to it are glasses.  If not for the size of these things ... This accessory is not intended for reading in the understanding of ordinary people.  If you put the tallest person next to the glasses, he will be smaller than the temple.  A pet like a hamster in this room can compete with an elephant in size.  Are you intrigued by this place?  Then rather go to Bolshaya Morskaya Street 5 (Museum of Illusions).  Reviews from visitors to this institution are only positive.  People are happy to return to this place with their friends and relatives. </p>

    <h2>  Glass maze </h2><p>  In a person who has fallen into a glass maze, everything seen with his own eyes cannot be comprehended.  It is almost completely impossible to determine your location and where to move.  Especially from all sides surround mirrors.  Therefore, the visitor has no choice but to extend both hands in front of him and, clinging to the wall, carefully go forward.  The exhibition complex is located on Bolshaya Morskaya, 5 (Museum of Illusions).  How to get there by metro?  First you need to get to the Admiralteyskaya station, from there go to Nevsky Prospekt. </p><p>  It is recommended to wear disposable gloves on your hands, which are prudently issued at the entrance.  A visitor lost in a maze will not be left in trouble; in any case, the administrator will help to find a way out.  If you still do not understand where Bolshaya Morskaya, 5 (Museum of Illusions) is located, then you obviously did not walk around the center of St. Petersburg.  From <span>Palace Square</span> it is necessary to move to the Arc de Triomphe, behind this object is located. </p>

    <h2>  Relax in the room with tropical butterflies </h2><p>  The room with tropical butterflies is specially designed in order to relax the overloaded brain and relax.  This is an island of warm summer in the middle of the Northern capital.  Nothing constrains the flight of lovely representatives of the fauna.  Therefore, respecting the request of the owners, one must be very careful not to accidentally step on an innocent creature.  And what a blessing it is to witness a butterfly appearing in a special aquarium from a cocoon!  Corresponding conditions are created here, which are constant throughout the year.  In a nearby contact zoo, children are allowed to not only feed its inhabitants, but even touch them with their hands and gently stroke them. </p><p>  A trip to the museum is advisable to make the whole family.  The fact is that it‚Äôs better to be photographed.  Hurry up to Bolshaya Morskaya, 5 (Museum of Illusions).  Metro is the easiest way to get to the right place.  At the entrance to the exhibition hall there is a huge clown, it is impossible not to notice it, passing under the <span>Arc de Triomphe.</span> </p>
