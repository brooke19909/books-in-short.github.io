The self-governing body of this estate, which appeared in 1766, acquired legislative force in 1785 from the moment the "Charter of the Nobility" entered into force. </p><h2>  Beautiful and durable </h2><p>  The noble assembly was also called "noble", by the very name making it clear that this is a self-governing body of people with <span>blue blood.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="noble house" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/849411.jpg" width="592"></div>  Naturally, to hold meetings that took place once in three years, an appropriate atmosphere was needed.  The decoration of society required a decent frame.  The houses of the Noble Assembly in the capitals and main cities of the provinces were erected in the centers;  The best craftsmen from all countries were invited to build them.

The houses of the Noble Assembly in such cities as Smolensk, Vologda, Vladimir, Ufa, Kostroma, Tver and others are decorations of these settlements and historical and architectural monuments of these regions.  Cultural objects are still located in them - where is the philharmonic society (St. Petersburg, Smolensk), where is the Academy of Arts (Ufa).  For many years in Moscow, in the building of the Noble Assembly, the House of Unions has been located (it was known under this name).

The most famous celebrities performed on the stage of these houses, the most refined and brilliant balls were also given here.  The Moscow building was built by the most famous and sought-after domestic architect Matvey Fedorovich Kazakov, who rebuilt the entire central part of Moscow.  New buildings, including the House of the Noble Assembly (in Moscow it was officially called the House of the Noble Assembly), were erected in the style of early classicism, known as "Palladianism" (in honor of the architect from Italy <span>Andrea Palladio).</span> </p><h2>  Moscow House </h2><p>  One of the <span>most beautiful buildings in Moscow,</span> located in the Okhotny Ryad, was built by him no later than 1755. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="when the house of the noble assembly appeared" class="if" height="245" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/849414.jpg" width="328"></div>  This is one of the answers to the question of what the House of the Noble Assembly is, to what time it refers.  According to some documents, the first owner of the building, Prince V. M. Dolgorukov-Krymsky, who died in 1754, built the building for himself.  But after leaving for another world, the Moscow Noble Assembly buys a huge mansion for its needs, namely for holding social events in it.  During the big holidays, all the nobility of Russia flocked here.  It was here that the famous ‚Äúbrides' fair‚Äù was held, to which Tatyana Larina was brought by aunts.

Such was the Moscow House of the Noble Assembly.  It is difficult to say what time <span>this building</span> belongs to, because in its original appearance it existed until 1917, but then, as noted above, life did not stop here for a minute.  In this building, several meetings of the World Chess Championship were held.  The Christmas tree in the columned hall of the House of Unions, held since 1935, was without exaggeration known throughout the vast country.  We can say that despite the radical change of power, from the very time when the House of the Noble Assembly appeared, and to this day the most significant and important events take place in it.  One of the last is a mourning event related to the funeral of Yevgeny Primakov. </p><h2>  House of the Noble Assembly of the Northern Capital </h2><p>  Maybe because these houses were built for some important and joyful events, they did not suffer the sad fate of destruction and oblivion.  This also applies to the famous building in St. Petersburg, which now houses the world famous Concert Hall of the D. D. Shostakovich Conservatory - one of the cultural centers of Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="noble house of the year" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/849415.jpg" width="600"></div>  When did the Noble Assembly House appear in the northern capital and by whom was it built?  The building, part of the ensemble of the Square of Arts, was erected according to the design of K. I. Rossi.  The building was built by architect Paul Jacot in 1834-1839.  One of the main advantages of this building is the hall with amazing acoustics.  It is not surprising that there is a philharmonic society in it.  Three floors were originally counted by the St. Petersburg House of Noble Assembly.

    <p>  The year 1901 went down in the history of the building with a superstructure of the four attic floors located above the crowning cornice.  This reconstruction, which affected both the main staircase and the exterior of the building, was carried out by the architect A.P. Maksimov according to the design of V.A.Shreter.  In 1948-49 (after the war), the architect I. G. Kantsyug, who led the <span>restoration work,</span> restored the building according to the drawings of K. I. Rossi. </p><h2>  Years of Soviet Power </h2><p>  When the Noble Assembly House in St. Petersburg was created, intended for social gatherings, no one thought that the building would become famous around the world.  The St. Petersburg Academic Philharmonic Society, which opened on June 12, 1921, will thunder not only with the shameful process in the case of Metropolitan Veniamin and 86 Orthodox priests, but also with the great performance of the D. D. Shostakovich Seventh Symphony, played here on August 9, 1942. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="when the noble assembly house was created" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/849416.jpg" width="600"></div>  This performance became a symbol of the invincibility of the besieged Leningrad.  For many years, the orchestra has been led by Yu. Kh. Temirkanov.  VV Putin called the St. Petersburg Philharmonic "a prayer place."
