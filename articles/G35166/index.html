However, those wishing to spend a vacation there should competently approach the choice of place and time.  If we talk about the temperature regime, it can be noted that the climate in this country is tropical and subtropical.  Winter and summer are not much different from each other.  Here, even in the cool season, it is much hotter than, for example, here in Sochi or the Crimea.  The difference in seasons is especially noticeable only in the northern part of the country.  The temperature in the summer in Vietnam often rises to +50 ˚.  People who tolerate heat well will enjoy their holidays at this time of year.  According to weather conditions, a dry period and a rainy season can be distinguished here.  At a time of heavy rains, the disadvantages of rest can be considered increased humidity and hordes of mosquitoes. </p><h2>  Rain season </h2><p>  Weeks of rain, huge streams of water ... This is how the Vietnamese rainy season in American films seems.  However, this is somewhat different from a real natural phenomenon, which can be observed here from May to October.  The peak of the rainy season falls on May-September.  At this time, you can relax here, saving up to 80% of the money deferred on vacation.  What is a period of constant downpours?  And when is the best time to go on holiday to Vietnam?  The holiday season is open year round.  However, tourists should be aware that it becomes very humid during the rainy season.  Many people suffer this almost worse than the heat replaced by daily showers.  But still, not everything is so bad.  It rains mostly in the evening or at night.  And the duration of the rain hardly exceeds 30 minutes.  Local residents are well adapted to this time.  Bypass structures around the settlements and the irrigation system in them minimize possible damage from the elements. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  <span>South Vietnam:</span> an unforgettable vacation </h2>

This is the south of Vietnam.  It is perhaps the wettest region in comparison with other territories.  From May to November, the rainy season begins in Vietnam, more precisely, in its southern part.  It has its own characteristics.  Showers here are very short-lived.  As a rule, it rains heavily for 10-15 minutes in the afternoon.  Many tourists prefer to travel to the south of the country during this period, since at this time there is no scorching sun.  However, often inconvenience can be caused not so much by showers as by a strong gusty wind, the sky, which is completely covered by clouds, and high waves in the ocean.  But on the <span>island of Fukuok,</span> located in the southern part of the country, the rainy season is very short.  This happens due to the proximity of this territory to the equator.  Showers go here no more than one month.  As a rule, this happens mainly in October.  The water temperature here is +30 ˚.  December-April here is the best tourist season.  In Vietnam, in its southern part, it is dry and sunny at this time.  Weather in this period will not deliver unpleasant moments.

    <h2>  North Vietnam </h2><p>  Depending on weather conditions, this country can be divided into three zones: North, South and Center.  All regions here are examined in detail in terms of the attractiveness of the climate for tourist trips.  Holidays in Vietnam in April-May is considered the most interesting.  This is a time of transparent ocean, peace and quiet on the coast, sunny weather, active water sports.  But it’s better to go to the northern regions of the country (Ha Long, Hanoi, Sapa) a little later - in May – October.  This is a period of active sun and good weather.  From November to April, hotel prices fall, which is good news for tourists.  However, do not flatter yourself.  Indeed, at this time it is pretty cool here.  In the winter months at night the temperature drops to +10 ˚, and during the day - to +20 ˚.  But this is not all the disadvantages of rest in this period.  In winter, the region often rains heavily.  In the Hanoi region, during the rainy season, about 80% of the annual rainfall falls.  From August to February it is cold and cloudy.  In the mountainous provinces of Lao Cai and Khao Bang, frosts are not uncommon.  A strong wind will also not add optimism to vacationers.  In winter, tropical typhoons are not uncommon in the north of the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Center of vietnam </h2><p>  You can relax in this country at any time of the year.  However, there are some subtleties that need to be taken into account so that then there are no unpleasant surprises and a well-deserved vacation was not spoiled when traveling to <span>Vietnam.</span>  <span>Nha Trang,</span> which opens in May, is one of the most visited places by tourists.  In the central part of the country there are also such popular resorts as Dalat, Danang.  The best time to relax here is from May to October.  During this period, the center of Vietnam is dry and hot, with a lot of sun.  It’s getting wet closer to November.  The rainy season begins.  Moreover, from September to November, the likelihood of hurricanes is high.  And in December-February a strong wind rises here.  Typhoons often arise.  The ocean is getting restless.  Swimming during this period can be very difficult due to large waves.  The ocean can be especially dangerous for surfers and scuba diving enthusiasts.  The air temperature in winter drops to +25 ˚.  In the mountains of the central region of the country, the coldest month is January.  And precipitation falls here a little earlier than on the plain.  The rainy season is September and October.  From all of the above it follows that it is better to plan a vacation in Vietnam in May, at least in its central part. </p><h2>  Excursion tourist places of Vietnam </h2>

One of the most interesting places in this country.  It is located in the north of Vietnam.  They rarely come here for 2-3 weeks.  Often tourists visit this small town, staying all day for 2-3.

Near the city there are many villages where you can get acquainted with the way of life and lifestyle of the local population.  Holidays in Vietnam in April can be simply unforgettable.

    <p>  • Hoi An.  The place is in central Vietnam.  Here you can combine a sightseeing vacation with a beach. </p><p>  • Hanoi.  The capital of country.  This city is also called the soul of Vietnam.  Its history goes back over 1000 years.  There are many attractions: museums, temples, a mausoleum, beautiful lakes.

Therefore, it is worth a little talk about the name of the best vacation spots in Vietnam:

    <p>  • Nha Trang.  This is the country's most popular beach resort.  The city of Nha Trang is quite large.  At its base, a beautiful beach area was formed.  Here you can sunbathe and enjoy yourself in the gentle warm waters of the ocean, and have fun and see some sights.  Prices for tours to this area are among the lowest.  Holidays in Nha Trang will be additional evidence that the beach season in Vietnam is open year round. </p><p>  • Phan Thiet / Mui Ne.  This resort area has already been chosen by our compatriots.  There are perhaps more Russian tourists here than all the other tourists.  The nearest town of Phan Thiet is just 5 km away.  The resort stretches for 10 km along the beaches.  This place is great for a beach holiday.  However, in terms of attractions and the activity of tourist life, this region is inferior to the Nha Trang resort.  The weather here is beautiful.  It doesn't matter if the period is dry or rainy in Vietnam, Phan Thiet is the best place to stay, according to many of our compatriots.  The prices here are quite low.  There are many shops, restaurants, hotels, where there is everything that a traveler needs.  This is the best place in all of Vietnam for sports such as surfing, windsurfing and kiting.  But lovers of snorkeling and diving should find a more successful area.  Many of our compatriots consider this pastime as the best vacation in Vietnam.  In May, it becomes very crowded. </p><p>  • Phu Quoc Island.  Located in the southern region of the country.  There are very good beaches, but few attractions.  There are very few nightlife.  A big plus of the island is the wild nature untouched by civilization.  Prices are slightly higher than in other resort areas.  Going here just to lie <span>on the beach is</span> not worth it.  After all, the same pleasure will cost much cheaper in other resort areas of the state.  But if a tourist wants to explore the wild jungle, live in his own bungalow on a deserted beach or explore the underwater world of the island, then he cannot find a better place. </p><p>  • Danang.  It is one of the largest cities in this country.  Located in the center of Vietnam.  Not a very popular tourist destination.  There are no attractions at all.  The city is a commercial point of sale.  Its only plus is its excellent beaches. </p><p>  • Hoi An.  The town is near Danang.  It is a good excursion and beach place at the same time.  The city is very interesting.  It is famous for its ancient architecture.  There are many buildings and monuments preserved from the Middle Ages.  Everything is permeated with a special romantic atmosphere.  There are excellent beaches a few kilometers from the city. </p><p>  • Vung Tau.  This city is the most important industrial zone of the country.  Exotic and attractions are not here.  But there are good beaches.  It is not very popular with foreign tourists.  Local residents and visitors from neighboring areas who come here in order to spend weekends and holidays on the beach are more in demand. </p><h2>  Choosing the best time to visit the country </h2><p>  In order to find out when to visit this state, it is recommended to use the following table: </p><p>  Resort <em> </em>  season in Vietnam for months </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Resort / month </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Jan </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Feb </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  March </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Apr </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  May </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  June </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  July </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Aug </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Sep </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Oct </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Nov </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Dec </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Hanoi </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  + </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  + </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  + </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  + </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  !

In August, there are few tourists.  Therefore, prices, respectively, are lower.  As a rule, a decline in the cost of travel packages is observed from May to September.  This is the best time to visit the country, see its attractions and save a little.  During this period, many local guesthouses and hotels give good discounts on accommodation for tourists in their rooms.  Sometimes they can reach 30% of the cost.  Also at this time there are many special offers from airlines selling tickets for flights at a reduced rate.  From May to September, the weather in Vietnam will not bring any big unpleasant surprises.  True, in the central part of the country (Nha Trang, Danang, Hoi An) during this period hurricanes are possible.

Despite the fact that Vietnam opened its doors to tourists not so long ago, it has already managed to become one of the most visited resort places.  The prices here are quite affordable.  In all likelihood, this attracts many travelers from all countries.  People say that it seems a little hot here at first.  However, 2-3 days spent in this country allow tourists to get used to the midday heat.  Experienced travelers recognize that the best time to visit this country is March – August.  It is warm and sunny at this time.  It is during this period that people often go on vacation to Vietnam.  Holidays in March, reviews of which are often positive, may be the most unforgettable for every traveler.  Vietnamese cuisine has been enjoyed by our tourists.  A lot of fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs, lean meat and fish - these are the main products that make up the menu of the inhabitants of this country.  The positive reviews of our compatriots who have been here include their statements about the cleanliness and order, calm and friendly atmosphere that prevail in most hotels.  Foreign tourists are struck by the abundance of quality, but at the same time inexpensive goods that can be purchased.  There are, of course, negative comments regarding holidays in this country.  People say that flights to Vietnam are very tiring.  The holiday season is open year round.  But the heat and high humidity are not to everyone's taste.  People say that excursions at this time can be difficult.  In addition, many note that traveling to historical places did not seem interesting to them.  But the winding road to them among the mountains in the heat was very tiring.  Some tourists did not like the fact that you can only hire a Russian-speaking guide for excursions for a rather high fee.

    <h2>  Useful information for tourists </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best vacation time in vietnam" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11668/383874.jpg?1398677713824" width="600"></div></h2><p>  • Time in Vietnam is 3 hours ahead of Moscow. </p><p> • Do not worry about using electrical appliances.  Two-pin sockets are used here, the same as in Russia.  Therefore, no adapters are required.  The voltage in the electric network, like ours, is 220 V. </p><p>  • The Internet in this country is almost everywhere, and for free.  Hotel guests can easily access the Network at any time.  At the reception most often there are computers with free internet access.  Also, in all tourist areas, you can easily find access points to the Network, from where you can call relatives on an international phone.  The call cost is just ridiculous - 2.5 rubles per 1 minute. </p><p>  • Using the services of Russian mobile operators in Vietnam is not profitable.  In roaming, connection fees can be significant.  It is much more profitable to purchase a SIM card of some local operator and call home.  Thus, you can count on the cost of 5 rubles per minute of conversation. </p><p>  • As a rule, a tourist's passport in this country is collected at the hotel reception.  And give on the last day at discharge. </p><p>  • Punctuality and Vietnamese are incompatible concepts.  Therefore, by the appointed time of any event, you can safely add at least half an hour without fear of being late for it.  This is especially true for the arrival time of buses.  If you are assured that the tour will end at 18 o’clock, then most likely it will last until 20 o’clock. </p><p>  • Vietnamese are entrepreneurial people.  Therefore, you need to be careful when buying a sightseeing tour.  You should definitely ask the guide what exactly is included in the price of the trip.  When selling a tour, many companies may simply forget to notify the tourist of an additional fee, for example, for entering or climbing the funicular and so on.  And some practical guides, knowing that everything is already included in the tour, may require additional money from the traveler. </p><p>  • Finding out how soon it will rain is easy.  To do this, just look at the locals.  If they put on raincoats and begin to hide the goods in the markets, then in the next half hour it will rain. </p><p>  • The national currency of the country is dong.  It equals 10 hao or 100 sous.  Currency can be exchanged at banks, exchange offices and markets.  In the latter, the course is somewhat more profitable.  ATMs issue, as a rule, only dongs.  Dollars are accepted almost everywhere.  In large cities, as well as in the capital of Vietnam, they also accept euros, baht, yuan, yen. </p><p>  Thus, we found out that a vacation from March to August is the best vacation in Vietnam.  <span>Nha Trang, reviews of</span> tourists about which is often positive, is one of the most popular places for travelers to visit from all countries. </p>
