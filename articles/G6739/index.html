    <h2>  What is not Spain? </h2><p>  Often this cape is compared with the Spanish coasts.  Or with Italian resorts.  And the similarity is really striking, there is practically no difference!  There are many similar places in the city of Sevastopol.  Fiolent is a cape with several picturesque beaches.  One of the most famous is called Tsarskoye Selo.  By the way, there are not many people on the beach, even in the midst of the season.  The fact is that one must go down to Tsarskoye Selo along the simulated steps cut down directly in the ground, and their number totals several hundred.  Not many people want to overcome this path, but in vain - and the water, and the views there are simply indescribable. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  A rich history is what Sevastopol is famous for.  Fiolent also has a very interesting origin.  For example, it is also called the Cape of St. George.  There is a background to this: the saint appeared to the sailors who were in distress near the cape, and in honor of their salvation they founded a monastery on the rocks.  Now it is St. George‚Äôs Monastery.  But the modern name appeared at the end of the 18th century, which later could be seen on maps, including the one where Sevastopol is depicted.  Cape Fiolent has another name - ‚ÄúGod's country‚Äù.  He was also called ‚Äúfrantic,‚Äù since there were frequent sea disturbances near him.  And the cape was called the word ‚Äúfelenk‚Äù.  From Turkish, this translates as ‚Äútiger cape‚Äù.  It is logical, since on the banks are visible stripes of dark and reddish trachyte.  This color combination is very similar to the skin of a tiger. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Places for a relaxing holiday </h2><p>  If we talk about a topic such as Sevastopol, Fiolent and other places to relax, it should be noted that the base is called ‚ÄúEagle's Nest‚Äù, which is located next to the cape.  15 kilometers from the city center is not so much, but still far from civilization, which is a great location to relax from the noise.  The base is located very close to the St. George Monastery, directly above the famous Jashmovo beach.  This is one of the features that attracts tourists.  The fact is that Jasper beach is one of the best in the whole Crimea.  Clean and warm water of the Black Sea - what could be better?  In addition, there are always few people on the beach.  All basically bathe in the city.  Accordingly, a calm and peaceful holiday is guaranteed.  Many people like to relax on the Lighthouse - however, it is a little difficult to go down there.  The same applies to Caravel, there used to be a staircase, but in 2005 there was a collapse, due to which it was not possible to restore its original appearance.  If you go down - then along the cliff, holding on to the rope attached there.  Between these two places is another one where the same difficult descent leads.  The recreation center "Fiolent."  In general, all these beaches, or rather the path to them, will appeal to lovers of risk and extreme sports.  But the appropriate reward is the rest almost alone. </p>

    <h2>  Route </h2><p>  The most important thing for any tourist is to figure out the route.  Since Sevastopol is a large city, you should take care of this in advance.  There is no transport shortage, so it will be possible to get to a certain place without problems, you only need to know how, since there are fixed-route taxis, trolleybuses, electric trains and even boats in the city.  Accordingly, many have the question ‚ÄúFiolent, Sevastopol - how to get to the place?‚Äù  There are fixed-route taxis in the city that lead directly to the cape.  Their numbers are 72, 19, and 6. They all move through the Central Department Store (TSUM).  This stop can be reached by almost any minibus on which this name is written.  Of course, you can rent a car and, following the navigator, calmly drive around the hero city and its significant places. </p>
