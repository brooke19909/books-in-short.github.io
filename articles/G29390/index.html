In this article, you will learn how to pair with an Apple Watch.  Watches of this model are one of the most popular in the world.  We‚Äôll talk more about how to set up the Apple Watch, connect them to your smartphone and much more. </p><h2>  What to look for </h2><p>  Many modern devices are quite simple to operate and do not need instructions.  But the process of setting up Apple Watch is far from clear to everyone.  In addition, the gadget is not cheap.  There is a risk that with careless handling it will fail.  Therefore, it is very important to thoroughly read the instructions.  Pairing with the Apple Watch is a tricky business.  In addition, the device must be charged, otherwise it will not be possible to establish pairing with the smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yablyk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple ID Data Entry" class="if uuid-3084453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3084453.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  For most buyers who have just purchased an ‚Äúapple‚Äù watch, the question arises: "How to pair with an Apple Watch?".

Connection with a mobile phone is automatic.  The program icons are displayed.  Select Apple Watch. </p><ol><li>  In order to start the synchronization process, click on ‚ÄúStart pairing‚Äù on two devices at once. </li><li>  Combine the smartphone‚Äôs camera with the animation on the watch‚Äôs screen. </li><li>  As soon as the synchronization is completed, a notification will appear on the smartphone‚Äôs display that the operation was successful. </li><li>  Next, click on "Configure as new Apple Watch."

In the future, nothing will have to be configured. </p><h2>  Manual sync </h2><p>  How to set the clock in manual mode?  Detailed instructions: </p><ul><li>  To get started, click on the Apple Watch program icon. </li><li>  Tap the ‚ÄúStart pairing‚Äù option. </li><li>  Select a manual installation.  Click on the i button.  Soon, the smartphone will ‚Äúsee‚Äù the watch.

After that, go to the My Watch app, select the Apple Watch and select the i icon, and then ‚ÄúBreak the pair.‚Äù </p><p>  Not everyone knows that you can erase content and settings without using an iPhone, but directly through the WatchOS operating system. </p><p>  Go to "Settings", then in the "Basic" erase all the information that was on the device so far.  Typically, the cleaning process takes several minutes.  Be sure to backup all the files.  In the future, this will help to avoid losing the necessary information. </p><h2>  Establishing synchronization with a new iPhone </h2><p>  Let's see how to re-pair with the Apple Watch in case you become the owner of a new phone. </p><p>  Before putting an old iPhone up for sale, it is recommended to break the pair.  In the event that your device is already in the wrong hands, and you did not manage to break the synchronization, there is only one way out - return the watch to its original settings before starting pairing with a brand new smartphone. </p><p>  You can do this as follows: </p><ul><li>  In the clock menu go to the main settings </li><li>  Then click on the ‚ÄúReset‚Äù command.  To reset all information, click on "Erase All Content and Settings", then click "Continue" to delete all files and settings.  When the watch returns to its original settings, select the desired language.  After that, you can start pairing the Apple Watch with a newly acquired iPhone. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="geniusbar.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="device pairing process" class="if uuid-3084426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3084426.jpg"></div><p>  After you accept all the conditions of the application, you can install any program from the iPhone compatible with Apple watches.  And although all the information from the watch‚Äôs memory will disappear, all this can be restored, since the clock is easily synchronized with the phone.  If the old iPhone is still with you, you can disconnect the pair.  To do this, enter the Watch program on the phone, then in the "My Clock" tab, click on the clock at the top of the screen.  Select ‚ÄúUnpair Apple Watch‚Äù (Unpair Apple Watch) and simply confirm this step.  Now you know how to pair with the Apple Watch again with a brand new smartphone. </p><h2>  We connect the clock to the computer </h2><p>  <span>Apple Watch</span> easily connects to a computer.  Under the gadget strap is a port where you can insert a cable, then the watch can be connected to a PC. </p><p>  Beginners often ask - how to create a pair of Apple Watch with an iPad?  The connection process is the same as for a smartphone.  If you plan on pairing with a tablet, just follow the instructions for the iPhone. </p><h2>  The clock does not turn on </h2><p>  Inexperienced users may think that if the smart watch does not turn on, then something inside has broken.  This is actually a fallacy.  Almost always, a device is simple enough to recharge, and it will work properly.  If after charging the display does not light up, contact the technical support center. </p><h2>  Gadget loss </h2><p>  Imagine the situation: you lost your Apple Watch.  Do not worry, the gadget can be found.  To do this, download the program ‚ÄúFind iPhone‚Äù on your smartphone.  Enter your username and secret code.  Find the Apple Watch, and then enter the ‚ÄúActions‚Äù.  If the Apple Watch is operational, you can see their location on the map, mark the gadget as lost, and set an audio signal.  If the device is somewhere nearby, you will hear a beep. </p><h2>  Find a watch through a computer </h2><p>  The device can be found not only from a computer, but also from a laptop.  Everything is very simple and does not take much time.  Here are the steps you need to perform to search: </p><ul><li>  Go to the cloud site. </li><li>  In the input field, write your login details. </li><li>  Select the online version of Find iPhone. </li><li>  At the top of the display, click on ‚Äúall devices‚Äù.  Find the Apple Watch in the menu and click the command you need: move files, designate them as lost or give a sound signal. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.re-store.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Search for a lost device" class="if uuid-3084478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3084478.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It is difficult to name the specific reason why you need to disconnect the Apple Watch from the iPhone.  There are so many of them that you need to understand separately in each specific situation.  But the main reasons that the owners of Apple products call are: glitches and errors in the WatchOS system and update, the new owner of the watch or iPhone, restoring factory settings, problems when connecting devices in all modes (both manual and automatic), errors due to notifications.  There are several ways to solve the problem of creating and breaking a pair; you can choose the most convenient for yourself. </p>
