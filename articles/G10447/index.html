    <p>  Pluralism in philosophy is a concept opposed to monism.  The term comes from the Latin pluralis, which literally means "plural".  Thus, pluralism is a direction emanating from many principles or species.  They are independent and are not subject to reduction to each other. </p><p>  The term itself was introduced into the teaching at the beginning of the 19th century.  In accordance with one or another solution to the fundamental philosophical question, pluralism can be either idealistic or materialistic.  Idealistic positions are reflected in the writings of Leibniz, for example.  <span>Materialistic concepts are</span> seen in the thoughts of Empedocles, Spinoza. </p><p>  A special form of multiplicity is dualism.  His postulates reflect the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe independent existence of the ideal and the material. </p><p>  Almost all the philosophical teachings of the past sought to determine the internal relationship of phenomena, reducing their diversity to one foundation.  As a result, they all had a monistic orientation.  However, by the end of the 19th century, there was a reorientation towards pluralism.  This happened along with a shift in emphasis from the question of the initial beginning (s) of the universe to questions of epistemology (the doctrine of cognition). </p><p>  Plurality in epistemology advocates conventionalism, individual post-positivist concepts (for example, <span>critical realism, the</span> "anarchist theory of knowledge" and so on). </p><p>  Epistemological pluralism is a denial of the fundamental unity of knowledge.  In this case, plurality takes as the basis of the <span>theory of knowledge</span> only the idea that there are many independent, equal sources and forms of knowledge.  All these sources and forms function in accordance with their own laws (for example, artistic creation, mysticism, science, <span>ordinary knowledge</span> , etc.), which are mutually exclusive "pictures of the world." </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pluralism is, as a rule, a denial or underestimation of the principle of development, without considering which it does not seem possible to combine many forms and phenomena into a single whole.  The doctrine can be considered beyond the framework of the main problem and the issue of material unity and diversity of the world.  Moreover, the opposition of pluralistic and monistic concepts is not absolute. </p><p>  The methodology and worldview of multiplicity can contain rational moments that can prevent the absolutization of the conceptual structure that has developed historically, as well as the style, picture of the world or thinking, of one or another specific model of knowledge.  At the same time, it is confirmed that there are many options for the development and formation of knowledge, and thus the struggle and competition of different theoretical and cognitive, as well as methodological programs, is stimulated. </p><p>  Political pluralism is a concept that provides for the formation of a rule of law through the consistent implementation of the principle of separation of powers.  According to the principle of functioning and organization, the democratic system in the country assumes the presence in society of diverse independent entities and groups that have the ability to influence the formation of power, while not having a monopoly on it (power). </p><p>  Recently, the term "pluralism" is often used in political theory, as well as in the social practice of socialism.  The concept of socialist plurality captures the rejection of the use of the administrative-command system, of a simplified perception of democracy. </p><p>  The economic basis of pluralism is various forms of ownership.  According to some authors, in order for socialist diversity to exist successfully, a comprehensive democratization of the people is necessary against the background of a decrease in the scope of state regulation. </p>
