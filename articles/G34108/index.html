Alexey Mikhailovich, he was a 14 child, however, for his mother, Natalia Kirillovna Naryshkina, he became the firstborn.  He was a very active and inquisitive boy, and therefore his father had high hopes for him, unlike his half-brothers Fedor and Ivan, who were poor in health.

    <p>  Four years after the birth of Peter, his father, Tsar Alexei, dies.  His half-brother Fedor ascended the throne, who was engaged in the formation of the future Russian Tsar.  Even in early childhood, the Great King aroused interest in <span>history, military art, and</span> geography, which during the reign of Peter the Great provided great help.  The great king independently composed the alphabet, which was easy to remember and easy for the language.  In addition, Peter dreamed of devoting 1 years of rule to writing a book on the history of his homeland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Peter 1 years of reign" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10436/21526.jpg" width="250"></div>

The mothers of the brothers were different representatives of noble families.  The accession to the throne of ten-year-old Peter was supported by the clergy.  Mother Natalya Kirillovna becomes the ruler.  The reign of Peter 1 did not suit the relatives of Ivan and Tsarina Sophia, who belonged to the Miloslavsky clan. </p><p>  Therefore, in the so-called first years of the reign of <span>Peter the Great, the</span> Miloslavskys organized a Streletsky revolt in Moscow.  They started a rumor that the foolish prince Ivan was killed.  Archers discontented with this news moved to the Kremlin, and despite the fact that Natalya Kirillovna came to them with Peter 1 and Ivan, they robbed and killed throughout Moscow for several days.  Sagittarius demanded that Ivan ascend to the throne, and Sophia became regent. </p>

In those years when Sofya Alekseevna ruled Russia, the young tsar lived with his mother in such villages as Semenovskoye, Preobrazhenskoye and Kolomenskoye.  They rarely went to Moscow only for official receptions.

    <p>  Peter the Great, because of his lively mind and curiosity, became addicted to military affairs and began to arrange “military funs” - games in palace villages.  It is worth noting that in the first years of the reign of Peter 1, “fun” develops into real <span>military exercises.</span>  Thus, the Preobrazhensky and Semenovsky regiments became much more impressive than the <span>Strelets army.</span> </p><p>  With the coming of age and the marriage of Peter the Great, he receives the absolute right to ascend the throne.  However, in the summer of 1689, <span>Tsarina Sophia</span> provoked a shooting action, which was directed against Peter.  Then the king takes refuge in the Sergey Lavra, in Troitsk.  The Preobrazhensky and Streletsky regiments arrived here, which suppressed the rebellion.  Sophia was imprisoned in the Novodevichy Convent, in which she died. </p><p>  With the death of the demented Ivan in 1696, Peter 1 becomes the only <span>king of Russia.</span>  However, at that time he was too keen on "military fun", and the relatives of his mother, the Naryshkins, were engaged in state policy.  Peter's idea to go to sea was grandiose and crowned with success.  It was during the reign of Peter 1 that Russia turned into a Great Empire, and the tsar became an emperor.  The domestic and foreign policies of Emperor Peter were very active.  In history, Peter 1 is known as the Russian Tsar reformer, who introduced many innovations.  Despite the fact that his reforms killed the identity of Russia, they became timely. </p><p>  Peter the Great died in 1725 and his wife ascended the throne - Tsarina Catherine the First. </p>
