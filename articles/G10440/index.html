One of the <span>cities of Cyprus,</span> where tourists often come in search of adventure and a great tan, is Limassol.  Here, a pleasant climate and excellent nature are combined with liveliness and fun of the local people.  In order to come to this city, the first thing you need to find a good hotel for yourself.  In terms of price-quality combination, such a three-star hotel in Limassol as Moniatis 3 *, located just a couple of kilometers from the city center, may be suitable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="moniatis 3" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/621394.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel building </h2><p>  Cyprus has been known to many people as a resort island for quite a long period of time.  Therefore, everything is done here so that tourists feel as comfortable and calm as possible.  Hotel Moniatis 3 Limassol 3 * was built at the beginning of the twenty-first century precisely for this purpose.  The building itself was created in a rather simple style.  As the main color with which the walls were painted, white was chosen.  It may seem that this color does not look attractive to tourists, but its combination with light brown tiles makes the hotel very pretty.  The hotel is not large in size, therefore, it can offer only 31 rooms as its rooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="m moniatis hotel 3 limassol" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/621395.jpg" width="500"></div>

Moniatis 3 *.  The hotel itself is located in a beautiful resort town called Limassol.  There is no own airport, which greatly complicates the process of moving to it.  The nearest reception points are located in the cities of Larnaca and Paphos.  Each of them is approximately 70 km away.  So be prepared to drive to the hotel for another hour.  Buses depart from the airport of any of these cities every hour to Limassol.  This type of movement is the cheapest of all, but the level of convenience and speed leave much to be desired.  Taxi in this regard is a more attractive option.  For a large fee, it will take you to the hotel in about 40 minutes.  If there is no desire to search for a taxi to Limassol, then you can pre-book a transfer service to the hotel.  As a rule, it comes out even cheaper than if you went from the airport to the hotel in a regular taxi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="moniatis 3 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/621397.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Services </h2><p>  The service provided by the <span>hotel M. Moniatis Hotel</span> 3 * (Limassol) includes a very good range of services.  From free here you can find car parking and wireless Internet.  Moreover, the latter is available absolutely at every point in the hotel, which is an indispensable plus for it.  The hotel also provides photocopy, laundry and luggage storage services.  True, it will be necessary to pay an additional amount of money.  If you need a safe in your room, and you want to get a key from it, then you will also have to pay for it.  But it‚Äôs worth it if you want to keep your expensive items safe and sound.  Another convenient service that the Hotel Moniatis 3 * provides is the possibility of exchanging currency without leaving the hotel.  You can do this in a matter of minutes, and the difference between the rate of the hotel and the bank is so insignificant that you will lose almost nothing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="moniatis 3 cyprus" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/621398.jpg" width="550"></div>

This suggests that the size of a three-star hotel from Limassol belongs to small hotels.  But even this fact does not prevent him from winning competition with large hotels and attracting attention from a large number of tourists from different countries.  In total, you can choose from two room options.  The first is for couples or just two people.  They are offered a room with one double or two single beds.  The second option is suitable for three people.  This room has three beds.  Also in each of the rooms you can find a TV, air conditioning and a bathroom with a toilet.  Each room also has a balcony with stunning sea views. </p><h2>  Hotel room rates </h2><p>  Based on the prices that are common in Limassol, the cost of one night at the Hotel Moniatis 3 * is very humane.  If you drive in as a couple, then one night will cost you $ 55.  Three people entering a hotel room will cost $ 65.  It is worth noting that the price of the room also includes breakfast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="moniatis 3 limassol 3" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/621393.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Sports and recreation </h2><p>  The hotel management tries to make every vacationer feel as comfortable as possible here.  Therefore, here you can find two pools at once: indoor and outdoor.  The first is suitable for those who do not want to risk being burnt in the sun.  And those people who came to Limassol to receive the long-awaited Mediterranean tan can relax at the outdoor pool.  For those who like to play billiards, the hotel building has a special room for this game.  Here we have taken care of the smallest visitors.  Especially for children, an indoor playground was built where you can enjoy having fun until your parents can tear themselves away from the pool. </p><h2>  Food and drink </h2><p>  The hotel has a restaurant that provides complimentary breakfast to its guests.  You will have to pay extra for the opportunity to have lunch or dinner in it.  But it's worth it.  An extra-class chef works in this institution, who studied and interned abroad for a long time, so the dishes prepared by him are distinguished by a high level and piquancy.  All products used in the preparation of treats, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, are made exclusively in Cyprus.  Therefore, having tasted the dish in the hotel restaurant, you can be completely sure that you ate exclusively Cypriot food.  In addition to this institution, on the territory of Moniatis 3 * there is a bar where you can find various alcoholic drinks that are not presented in the restaurant menu.  If the food in the hotel restaurant bored you, you can always go out and go to some institution nearby.  Most of them offer a wide range of dishes, the prices of which are very low. </p>

    <h2>  Moniatis 3 *: guest reviews </h2><p>  Among the reviews of tourists who happened to stay at this hotel, you can find both positive and negative, and the first is much more.  Among the positive aspects of the hotel there is a very friendly staff who are always ready to help in case of problems or questions.  The quality of food in the hotel restaurant is also noted.  Visitors note the fact that the dishes here are not only tastier than those that can be found in restaurants on the street, but also cheaper.  Another advantage of the hotel is its relative proximity to the sea.  Among the minuses there was only washed laundry, on which it was already possible to find holes, as well as a rare cleaning of rooms, which was carried out only 3 times a week. </p><p>  In general, the hotel has very good qualities and is worthy of you to choose it.  Here you can find everything for your convenience, especially considering the fact that there is no need to look for a normal restaurant.  After all, the institution at the hotel is one of the best in Limassol. </p>
