Even employees who have vast experience have to face the need to re-search for a job.  There are a lot of reasons for this.  For example, a reduction could occur in production, some have to quit due to serious disagreements in the team or amid too low wages.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for young and ambitious people to find a good job, even if they graduated from a higher educational institution.  However, despite all these difficulties, today there remains a huge number of unreached vacancies, which many may not have thought of before.  Today, bank employees are widely required in the labor market. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.boh.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="At the table" class="if uuid-3049025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3049025.jpg"></div><p>  Some are confused by the fact that there are too many such vacancies, and employers promise too good financial support, as well as an interesting work schedule.  In order to understand whether it is worth applying for such a vacancy, you need to consider reviews about working in banks.  It will also not be superfluous to get acquainted with the positive and negative sides of such activities. </p><h2>  Pros of working in a bank </h2><p>  Back in the early 2000s, it was believed that getting a job at a financial institution was a huge success.  Work in a prestigious organization was an indicator that a person really has a special mentality and is able to conduct business.  Gradually, a huge number of different vacancies formed in this area, and there were much more offers than demand.  At the same time, banks began to dictate their terms, and job seekers gradually lost interest in such employment.  However, this does not mean that there are no positive aspects in such work today.  First of all, it is worth highlighting comfortable working conditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This is definitely one of the positive arguments in favor of getting a job at a bank.  In this case, there are 2 options: you can get an operator in a bank branch or work at home and do the work in the bank's call center.  Feedback on both types of employment is mostly positive.  Regardless of the type of work chosen, a person can work in the most comfortable conditions. </p><p>  If we talk about offices, they are usually equipped with very good offices.  They have air conditioners, heaters, modern office equipment and everything that is necessary for normal operation.  This is not surprising, because banks strive to make a good impression on their customers. </p><p>  If you choose the second option, then in this case it will be possible to work at all without leaving your home.  You don‚Äôt have to rack your brains on how to pick up a child from a kindergarten, or worry that you need to stand in traffic jams daily.  Also, according to reviews of working in banks, this activity has other advantages. </p><h2>  Official employment and salary level </h2><p>  First of all, you need to understand that the so-called gray salary is not practiced in banks.  This means that you will not have to receive money in an envelope without official employment.  In the course of the financial institution, deductions to the Pension Fund are made for each employee.  In addition, you can get sick leave and not lose money. </p><p>  Financial organizations adhere very clearly to the Labor Code of the Russian Federation, so you can be absolutely calm for the legality of such work.  The same goes for salaries.  Any processing and other additional time costs on the part of the employee are necessarily encouraged with bonuses.  Advances are always charged clearly and on time, without any delay. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The ability to use profitable bank products </h2><p>  Any employee of a financial institution automatically enters the loyalty program.  This means that, if necessary, he can get a loan at a lower rate or a credit card on favorable terms.  Of course, each operator of the bank is much better than any client understands the varieties and features of tariff rates.  He understands which contract is more profitable to conclude, and which conditions are better to refuse.  In their reviews of working at the bank, many say that they have gained invaluable experience that will be useful throughout life. </p><p>  In addition, the employee always has growth prospects.  If he will competently cope with the tasks, then the leadership will definitely pay attention to him.  Banks value those people who do not want to be just ordinary operators.  Financial institutions are spreading at a tremendous speed today.  Hundreds of offices open in cities.  Of course, when the question arises of hiring a manager there, first of all, the candidates are considered not for those people who came ‚Äúfrom the street‚Äù, but for their own employees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.careersinpoland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank job" class="if uuid-3049023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3049023.jpg"></div><p>  However, if you read the reviews of employees about working in a bank, you can find information about the minuses of such employment.  Therefore, it is worthwhile to examine in more detail the negative aspects. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Disadvantages of working in a bank </h2><p>  First of all, many note that several decades ago it was really much easier to work in the banking sector, with significantly fewer requirements for employees.  They felt comfortable.  However, today there are often problems with the bosses, the team, or just unfavorable conditions for employment are provided.  Fortunately, of course, this does not happen in large banks, but there are some nuances that may be important in making the right decision. </p><p>  Considering reviews about working in a bank, one can stumble upon information that, first of all, an employee must sign a liability agreement.  In principle, there is nothing terrible in this, since a person is really constantly in contact with large amounts of money.  However, it is worth considering that even if the applicant gets a job where contact with the banknotes is not implied, then in this case he will still have to sign the relevant documents.  This is what causes many fear and apprehension. </p><p>  Another drawback noted by some former employees is that they are obliged to obey the senior manager and other people in higher positions without a doubt.  Of course, there is nothing reprehensible in this, but problems in the banking sector very often arise against the background of such a hierarchy.  Some unscrupulous managers begin to literally morally mock employees and criticize them.  But in this case, it all depends not on the bank, but on specific people.  Such a leadership can be found in absolutely any field. </p><p>  Another unpleasant minus is noted mainly by the fair sex.  The fact is that at such work it is necessary to adhere to a certain dress code.  Moreover, most often in financial organizations it is stipulated that all employees should wear black-and-white clothing.  Some companies even issue special vests or uniforms. </p><p>  According to feedback from employees about working at the bank, some had to deal with the fact that the volume of work was too large.  Others complain that the work schedule in such institutions is not always standardized.  Sometimes you have to stay up late.  But all overtime hours are paid according to the law. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth noting the disadvantages in reviews about working at home.  The bank offers fairly convenient conditions, but the problem lies elsewhere.  The fact is that you have to ring up a large number of people.  At the same time, you need to talk about new promotions and other products of a financial organization.  Potential customers are far from always ready to listen to such advertising.  They can easily cheat and call the operator the latest words.  If the nervous system is stable, then this should not confuse when applying for a job. </p><p>  Having considered the pros and cons of such work, it is worthwhile to study in more detail the specific financial organizations and the opinions of the employees who worked in them. </p><h2>  Reviews on work at Tinkoff Bank </h2><p>  Since this financial institution is the only bank that does not have any branches and branches, in this case only work from home is offered.  In the case of this institution, we are talking about complete freelance with the possibility of drawing up a flexible work schedule.  This means that a person does not have to get attached to the office and spend a lot of time getting to him every day.  In reviews of work at Tinkoff Bank, many say that you can find a job both on the Internet and on the company's official website. </p><p>  Getting a job is not difficult.  Since it is mainly a question of working in a call center, the requirements are not very strict.  Therefore, many note that such work can be a great start in building a career for students who graduate from institutes. </p><h2>  Features of work </h2><p>  If we look at the reviews of employees about working at Tinkoff Bank, then most employees are satisfied with a flexible schedule and terms of cooperation.  However, since this financial institution has no branches, only call center operators are required. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.voipreview.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Talking on the phone" class="if uuid-3049022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3049022.jpg"></div><p>  The duties of such an employee include phoning potential customers and offering the latest banking products.  You can work from any city in Russia.  At the same time, you can work at any time (even at night). </p><p>  Calling is made using a special online system that is installed on the Tinkoff internal platform.  You can work optionally every day.  If desired, even an hourly work schedule is possible.  For example, work an hour after an hour or according to another schedule.  However, you need to read reviews about the remote work at Tinkoff Bank more carefully. </p><p>  The fact is that each employee has a certain limit, which must be fulfilled.  How much it was achieved (in 1 day or several weeks) is absolutely unimportant.  The main thing is that there are positive results. </p><p>  Also, positive reviews about remote work at Tinkoff Bank say that despite the fact that all work is not carried out in the company‚Äôs office, employees are still officially employed.  Even if a potential employee lives in some remote village, then in any case they will conclude an employment contract with him.  It is worth noting that when it comes to freelance, then this is extremely rare, so we can say that cooperation with Tinkoff Bank is mostly positive. </p><h2>  Work as an operator in Tinkoff Bank: reviews and features </h2><p>  This area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity of this financial organization is calling up potential customers and selling various products.  For example, the operator must call people and offer them profitable deposits, insurance, credit cards and much more.  The customer base has already been compiled, so you do not have to look for anyone on your own. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.scoopnest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank logo" class="if uuid-3049016" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3049016.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs very convenient to work, and the system developed by the organization is intuitive, so there should not be any problems.  It is also necessary to do additional work on advising clients.  This means that any employee should know all the information about existing products of the bank.  Accordingly, the operator will need to answer questions and be able to navigate the financial nuances. </p><p>  At the same time, the call center operator must behave with restraint, and even if there is a provocation from the client‚Äôs side, in no case should he begin to act aggressively.  According to reviews of working at a bank, about 95% of the time the job is to sell credit cards.  This is not surprising, because such products are the main ones for this organization. </p><h2>  How much can you earn? </h2><p>  When working at home with a flexible schedule, wages will directly depend on the volume of products sold.  This means that the employee should not only just call and talk about new credit cards, but also motivate customers to get them.  Payment is only for completed transactions.  Thus, we can say that the salary of an employee is a percentage of sales.  The more transactions you can complete, the greater the income. </p><p>  It will be useful if the employee has the appropriate marketing skills.  In all other respects, there are pros and cons in this organization.  Some people are simply incapable of active sales, or they expect another job. </p><p>  If we consider the feedback on the work of the representative of "Tinkoff Bank", then in this case we are talking about going home to clients in order to conclude an agreement.  The work is paid higher, but there are practically no such vacancies from this financial organization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fortune.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank card" class="if uuid-3049015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3049015.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of work at Alfa Bank </h2><p>  This financial organization appeared in the early 90s.  During this time, the bank had jumps and falls.  However, at present it is one of the most reliable financial organizations of the Russian Federation, which provides a full range of services to its customers.  Alfa-Bank serves a huge number of both individuals and legal entities.  Each city has a large number of offices, each of which may require employees.  Therefore, it is worth considering the opinions of network users. </p><p>  According to reviews of work at Alfa Bank, in the first place, of course, the highest salaries are received by logistics directors and people holding other managerial positions. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the operators are provided with rather favorable conditions.  Many say that Alfa-Bank has a very high rating not only in Russia but also abroad.  That is why, in relation to both customers and employees, this financial institution adheres to the law and fulfills its obligations. </p><p>  As a rule, there are more vacant vacancies for the position of an operator who will work in the office.  In this case, you can count on comfortable conditions and a good salary. </p><p>  You can find a lot of useful information in the reviews about working at Alfa Bank.  For example, if a specialist copes with his duties, then he has excellent prospects for career growth.  Many of today's managers started recently with work in the lowest positions.  Therefore, mostly all leave positive feedback.  Of course, unpleasant situations also happen.  But not a single person is safe from this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="themoscowtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Showcase Bank" class="if uuid-3049012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3049012.jpg"></div><h2>  "OTP Bank" and features of work in it </h2><p>  This is one of the many financial organizations in which there are a large number of vacancies.  Moreover, according to reviews of work at OTP Bank, you can get both an office and a trading floor.  In the second case, as a rule, wages depend solely on active sales.  When working in the office, you can count on a stable salary and bonuses.  In this regard, it all depends on the preferences of the applicant.  When working on trading floors, you can constantly move around the city, and if you choose the second option, then in this case the activity will always be carried out in the same place. </p><p>  Also, according to reviews of working in a bank at OTP Bank, it‚Äôs easy enough to move up the career ladder, as the organization lacks senior specialists.  Based on this, it is not difficult to conclude that there is a huge growth prospect for novice employees.  Some complain about the periodic need for refining.  However, a similar practice exists in many other financial institutions. </p><p>  If necessary, the employee can pass certification, after which he can count on a higher position as soon as the corresponding vacancy appears.  Each young operator has a separate curator who helps him and further directs him to higher positions.  This bank is quite loyal to students who recently graduated from higher educational institutions.  Therefore, they should try their hand at this organization.  For example, at first you can work on trading floors, and when the necessary experience appears, go to the office. </p><h2>  Bank "Vostochny" </h2><p>  This financial institution also appeared a very long time ago.  It is not so widely known to the public, since the parent branch was opened in Blagoveshchensk.  However, this is a rather promising institution in which you can build a good career. </p><p>  According to reviews of work at Vostochny Bank, mainly banking agents are required in the company.  The applicants are expected to find official employment, a salary of 15,000 rubles, paid tablet and phone.  Agent responsibilities include issuing bank cards.       .  ,      .           . </p><p>    ,    ,        600 .      8 ,       800 . ,      ,       ,       20 000 . </p><h2>      </h2><p>     ,         .  ,        ,      .  ,      .       .         . </p><p>        ,  ,  ,   ,        .         ,          . </p><p>              ,         .          .        ,    .     ,       .    .       . </p><p>      .       ,      .      ,         . </p><p> Of course, greater preference is given to those who studied in the banking sector.  Such graduates have much more choice and there is a chance to immediately take a higher position.  There are also vacancies for accountants. </p><p>  If we talk about the standard skills that a new employee should possess, then banks most of all require people who are familiar with at least superficiality with 1C Accounting.  However, if the applicant does not possess the necessary skills, but manifests himself as an active and purposeful person, then he will be taught everything directly during his labor activity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="solo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alfa Bank" class="if uuid-3049011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3049011.jpg"></div><p>  On the Web you can find a large number of reviews about the work of the operator in the banks of Moscow.  Thanks to this, you can choose an organization with the best reputation and conditions.  However, you can search for other vacancies.  For example, capital banks lack programmers, system analysts, administrators, and many others.  Also, if there is a higher education in the financial sector, there are prospects to take the post of head of the regional department.  In addition, you can get a job as a full-time engineer, lead manager, head of the analytical department. </p><p>  The doors of many banks are open to layout designers, designers, and web development specialists.  Since global computerization is being observed today, financial institutions are desperately short of specialists in this field.  We need developers of mobile applications, programs and much more. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Thus, we can say that work in the banking sector is a rather promising direction.  Of course, in such an activity there are minuses and pluses, but in the world, perhaps, you cannot find a single company where absolutely all employees were pretty much everything.  Therefore, choosing one or another vacancy, you should rely primarily on your impressions.  Do not mindlessly conclude an employment contract.  First you need to talk with a bank representative.  Do not be afraid to ask questions regarding future responsibilities and wages.  These are perfectly normal questions that any applicant has the right to ask. </p>
