All available equipment will wear out sooner or later or, even worse, break down.  Sometimes this is due to careless use, sometimes due to marriage.  In fact, there can be a huge number of reasons, so it‚Äôs better to immediately understand them, because even an inexperienced user in some cases can cope with problems on his own. </p><p>  Televisions can also sometimes crash.  Sometimes the problems are unpredictable, they can scare the owner of the device.  For example, the Samsung TV itself turns on and off.  If this happens for the first time, any person will be scared, especially if it happens at night. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nbcnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV options" class="if uuid-2815209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2815209.jpg"></div><h2>  Problem </h2><p>  Why Samsung TV turns on and off itself is not easy to figure out.  But there are several reasons for this phenomenon.  Sometimes in this way it can turn out to fix the problem yourself.  But in most cases, it can be technically difficult, so only a specialist can cope with it. </p><p>  If you notice that the TV has begun to "live your life", you do not need to panic.  And although this is not the most common problem, it still occurs in some device models.  Therefore, ways to solve it have already been found. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Causes </h2><p>  If the Samsung TV turns on and off itself, the reasons for this will allow you to understand how to proceed.  Sometimes this is a series of simple failures, and sometimes serious breakdowns. </p><p>  The power supply may also be to blame, but it, by the way, is easy to replace.  Sometimes the inverter breaks down or poor care of the equipment becomes the fault.  Each of these problems has a solution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smartplugs.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung setting" class="if uuid-2815203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2815203.jpg"></div><h2>  Simple glitch </h2><p>  If the Samsung TV itself turns on and off, this does not mean its irreversible failure.  A similar problem is often found in modern device models.  Even some already obsolete devices can behave in a similar way. </p><p>  Sometimes the device turns off when the user turned it on.  Sometimes it activates on its own, and then goes out.  But the cause is not always a technical breakdown.  Sometimes to blame: </p><ul><li>  Errors with device setup. </li><li>  Setting up a special utility. </li></ul><p>  In the first embodiment, the problem may be in the included automatic option, which is designed to turn off the device that does not pick up reception signals.  For example, you turned on your favorite TV show and for a certain time did not pick up the remote control, did not switch or even adjust the volume.  Disconnection usually occurs after 2-4 hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the second option, the option to turn off the TV after a certain time was possibly installed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="osxdaily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung shuts down" class="if uuid-2815193" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2815193.jpg"></div><h2>  Troubleshooting </h2><p>  To prevent this from happening, you just need to understand the settings of the device.  The TV menu usually shows all the main technologies that are available in the model.  You can also change and customize the available functions. </p><p>  It‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that another problem can be the reason for this behavior of the device.  For example, power outages can lead to errors.  If the outlet is poor-quality or unreliable, it can supply unstable electrical voltage, which will affect the performance of the TV. </p><p>  In this case, you will have to check the voltage.  To do this, you either need to invite a specialist, or acquire a special device that will show the stability of the current. </p><h2>  Bad power supply </h2><p>  If the Samsung TV turns on and off immediately, you should look for the problem in the power supply.  Experts recommend diagnosing the indicator.  For example, if in the standby menu the device light responds to switching on but blinks, there may be problems with the power supply.  Although sometimes the problem can be related to the breakdown of other parts of the device.  The TV will have to be taken to a service center. </p><p>  The indicator may turn on continuously when turned on.  There may be a power failure on the TV.  BP refuses to respond to user commands, respectively, the indicator will not manifest itself in any way. </p><h2>  Complex damage </h2><p>  If the Samsung TV itself turns on and off, you will have to think about more serious consequences.  Sometimes this behavior is caused by low frequencies of signal reception.  Often this is why the TV works at one time or another. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Board Inspection" class="if uuid-2815195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2815195.jpg"></div><p>  For example, one TV channel can work fine until the device itself goes into standby mode.  On the other channel, such a story will be observed when the frequency is not enough, so the device works only a couple of minutes. </p><p>  Complex problems include: </p><ul><li>  stress problems; </li><li>  inverter breakdown; </li><li>  board pollution; </li><li>  software crash. </li></ul><h2>  Device cleanliness </h2><p>  If the Samsung TV spontaneously turns off and on, it‚Äôs worth considering cleaning the device.  Few users realize that you need to be careful about any technology.  Dust or dirt can be harmful.  Therefore, it is important to take care of the TV regularly. </p><p>  What can harm ordinary dust?  It can hardly be called an effective conductor, but even a small amount may be enough to close the contacts.  Therefore, it is better to use a vacuum cleaner or spray can with compressed air. </p><p>  If you have never cleaned the TV, it is better to invite a specialist.  But you can do everything yourself: just remove the back panel and carefully clean the device board. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.electronicspoint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Board cleaning" class="if uuid-2815206" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2815206.jpg"></div><h2>  Inverter problems </h2><p>  When the Samsung Smart TV turns off and turns on on its own, it is worth considering the operability of the inverter power circuit.  As practice shows, this is one of the most common problems that occurs due to cracks on the board. </p><p>  Cracks may occur due to: </p><ul><li>  unstable voltage; </li><li>  overheating of elements; </li><li>  temperature jumps; </li><li>  excessive humidity; </li><li>  capacitor problems. </li></ul><p>  All these issues are best solved with a specialist, because without proper knowledge and experience, it will not be possible to fix everything on your own. </p><h2>  Troubleshooting </h2><p>  If the Samsung TV itself turns on and off, you will have to determine the cause of this yourself.  It is not difficult to do this, the only question is whether it will be possible to figure out the details. </p><p>  First you need to turn off the power, and then remove the back cover.  Experts recommend carefully inspecting the board.  To do this, under good lighting, look for defects that would catch the eye.  You need to look for darkening the board, bloating capacitors or cracks. </p><h2>  Troubleshooting </h2><p>  Depending on what causes the failure to be found, they should be eliminated.  First, it is recommended to check the integrity of all connections: router, antenna and power cable.  Next, you can begin to inspect the board.  What should I look for? </p><p>  First you need to look at capacitors that can swell.  They look like finger batteries.  Their shell should not be damaged, and the shape should be cylindrical, without bumps and cracks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="forum.videohelp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Capacitor issues" class="if uuid-2815198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2815198.jpg"></div><p>  If there is rust on the contacts, it is better to clean everything yourself.  To do this, it is enough to use alcoholized napkins.  If there are problems with the capacitor, power supply or cable, everything can be purchased at the store and replaced. </p><p>  If none of the above helps, it is best to contact a service center.  Professionals can find more complex problems and help fix them. </p>
