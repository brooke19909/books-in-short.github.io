Naberezhnye Chelny - a combination of traditions, culture and modernity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Russia is famous for its sights.  In each district, republic, city there is something to see.  Traveling around the country, a tourist leaves for Tatarstan.  This republic is colorful and multifaceted in many aspects, in some even unique.  Kazan, Naberezhnye Chelny, Nizhnekamsk, Bulgar, Sviyazhsk, Bugulma - perhaps this is an incomplete list of cities that are famous for their attractions.  This article will be devoted to the second largest settlement of the republic.  Visit Victory Park (Naberezhnye Chelny), the attractions of this city, its monuments and memorials, mosques and churches, museums and theaters and make sure that this place is truly beautiful. </p><h2>  Victory Park in the city of Naberezhnye Chelny </h2><p>  Of course, there are many attractions in the city, but I would like to dwell on some of them.  Even foreign tourists come here to visit the famous Victory Park.  Naberezhnye Chelny is a colorful city with a rich history.  And after the reconstruction of some objects, there are more and more people who want to verify the veracity of the spoken words. </p>

    <p>  Take, for example, Victory Park.  Naberezhnye Chelny carried out work to restore the facility.  Since the construction of the park, it has never undergone a major overhaul.  But it's nice to spend time here not only thanks to walks in the park area, but also to 50 different attractions.  Among them stand out ‚ÄúCaterpillar‚Äù, ‚ÄúOrbit‚Äù, ‚ÄúZodiac‚Äù, ‚ÄúFlying Dutchman‚Äù.  Those who wish can visit the shooting range and the karting track, enjoy playing table tennis or have fun on the trampoline. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thanks to the reconstruction, several attractions appeared here, which are considered one of the best in the country.  The Ferris wheel, erected in 2016, successfully competes with its competitors in Russian million-plus cities.  The pride of the park, perhaps, can be a small, but very beautiful fountain.  On hot summer days there are a lot of visitors enjoying the cool water. </p><p>  The <span>Logistics Workers</span> Alley is located not far from the memory zone of the fallen in the Great Patriotic War.  Here you can see military equipment: howitzers, heavy tank IS-3, self-propelled gun "Gvozdika", MT-12 cannon. </p><h2>  Borovets Church </h2><p>  The city of Naberezhnye Chelny is famous for its cultural architectural monuments.  Among them, there are those that relate to memorials of republican significance.  They are protected by the state.  These include the Holy Ascension Church.  These include the Borovets Church. </p><p>  Initially, her walls were wooden, later they became stone.  The Three Altar Church of Borovets was erected (for the most part) at the expense of the famous writer and Elabuga merchant Dmitry Ivanovich Stacheev. </p><p>  Before the revolution, the parish of the temple totaled 2 thousand people.  After the revolution, the building left almost ruins.  And only the efforts of the parishioners, workers and builders in 1989 helped to rebuild the temple (by the way, the highest in the area).  Thanks to their efforts, a new high bell tower appeared at the church;  a beautiful openwork fence around the territory of the parish.  And the area around the temple is more like a park area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Nur Ihlas Mosque </h2><p>  About 20 years ago, the largest Muslim religious building appeared on the territory of the city.  "Nur-Ihlas" (translated as "Fidelity") is a building built according to all the canons of modernity, but the style of architecture is more reminiscent of post-modern. </p>

    <p>  According to various sources, the construction of the mosque began in 1993 and continued until 2005. V.A. became the project architect.  Manukyan.  The building can accommodate 500 people.  Remarkably, different entrances are intended for men and women.  High portals at the doors, a hemispherical dome, mosque volumes of different heights, flat coverings, a high steeple-shaped minaret - it would seem that all this does not combine.  But how beautifully and restrained it reflects at the same time the culture of stone architecture of the Volga Bulgaria and the modern Tatar style. </p><p>  How wonderful it will be if you manage to visit Victory Park.  Naberezhnye Chelny is beckoning to see cultural and architectural monuments.  Nur-Ihlas is the only mosque of its kind in size and beauty.  The picturesque volumetric composition attracts tourists due to the unique combination of East Muslim, traditional Tatar and Bulgarian cultures in the external and internal decoration of the religious building. </p><h2>  Taub Mosque </h2><p>  Not only in Victory Park Naberezhnye Chelny invite its guests.  Tourists with reverent awe visit historical, cultural, religious monuments.  In the old part of the city there is a cult landmark known as Tauba (translated as ‚ÄúRepentance‚Äù). </p>

    <p>  The mosque was erected in 1989-1992.  on the occasion of a significant date: 1100th anniversary of the adoption of Islam by the Bulgarian state.  According to the ideas of the authors of the project, the construction was erected in the Art Nouveau style, while the tent covering of the hall and minaret remained traditional.  On separate sides of the facade are separate entrances for men and women.  On the north side is a 53-meter minaret, crowned with a gilded crescent moon, on which craftsmen engraved sayings from the Koran. </p><p>  Bright glass stained glass windows deserve special attention.  They became the decoration of the northern facade of the mosque.  The interior of Tauba was decorated with white marble with carved floral ornaments and medallions. </p><p>  Of course, these are far from all the sights of a unique city.  It is worth coming here to enjoy the beauty and rich history of the ancient city. </p>
