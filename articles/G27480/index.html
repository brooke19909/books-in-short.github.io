Most often just for fun.  After all, I really want to admire this beauty as long as possible in the autumn and become a part of this miracle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maple leaf wreath" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/718852.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  In Western countries, there is a fashion to decorate entrance doors with wreaths before the holidays or just like that, but in accordance with the season.  A maple leaf wreath is best suited for this. </p><p>  Well, who doesn‚Äôt have at least one photograph in the autumn park?  Of course, the main attribute here will be the king-wreath. </p><p>  <span>Maple leaves</span> for these purposes are used for several reasons.  They have long roots and a very beautiful leaf blade.  Wreaths from them turn out strong and magnificent - really royal. </p><h2>  The simplest wreaths </h2><p>  Unfortunately, not everyone knows how to make a wreath of leaves.  There are several ways: from the simplest to the relatively complex, but very effective. </p><p>  First, try to make beauty in the simplest way.  You need to take the right number of sheets with a thick and not very long leg.  A small hole is made exactly in the middle of the leaf with the nail so that the root of the next leaflet can crawl into it.  We string it on a leaf and on it we make the same hole.  In this way weave a chain to the desired length.  Of course, a magnificent wreath will not work, but it will take very little time to make it.  In the same way, you can make garlands or ribbons to the wreath of a more magnificent texture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a wreath of leaves" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/718850.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second simple way consists in the fact that several leaves overlap each other and are pierced together with tails in two rows, so as not to crumble.  In this way, you can make a neat crown.  Now you already know two ways to weave a wreath of leaves.  You can move on to more complex options. </p><h2>  Maple leaf wreath based </h2><p>  It is easy to make a wreath of leaves if you use a base for these purposes.  If it is intended to be worn on the head, then the base should be thin and light.  For example, you can take a piece of wire.  For a door wreath, a thick and voluminous base made of wood or foam is more suitable. </p><p>  We take pre-prepared leaflets one by one or in small bunches and begin to wind them to the base with the help of threads, scotch tape or <span>floral tape.</span>  The latter is the most unreliable, but very beautiful.  Weaving continues in a circle.  When we get to the start of work, we hide the free ends of the roots under the leaves and carefully wrap them. </p><p>  In this way, you can knit wreaths of any diameter.  In addition, it is easiest to follow the pattern, alternating red leaves with yellow and greenish.  The disadvantage of this method is that the size must be selected in advance, since in the process of weaving it will not be so easy to change it. </p><h2>  Simple weaving of tails </h2><p>  There is another interesting way how to weave a wreath of leaves.  He is known to us more by dandelions.  It is in this way that many children make themselves <span>jewelry on their heads</span> from yellow flowers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to weave a wreath of leaves" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/718849.jpg" width="324"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The essence of weaving is that gradually the root of the leaf braids on the previous roots.  The technology is as follows: take two leaves with long ends.  We hold one of them in the right hand, and with the left we put the second in front of the work sheet and wrap it around the spine through the bottom, leading the tip between the two plates.  Then we clamp both roots in the right hand.  Thus, it turns out that we crushed <span>a maple leaf with</span> its tip.  To spin the wreath of maple leaves, we continue to braid the same bunch in the right hand.  This fixes the ends of the leaves and prevents the product from crumbling.  It is better to finish weaving if you first tie the worked ends together with a thread, and then close the circle to make a finished wreath. </p><h2>  Pigtail weaving </h2><p>  We offer another interesting master class.  A wreath of leaves in it is braided by a French scythe.  You can imagine what it looks like if you saw wicker bow garlands.  As a rule, this is done exactly with a pigtail. </p><p>  Each braid of three strands can weave.  To make a wreath in this way, you need to add one leaf with a long leg every time you cross the bunches. </p><p>  At first it will be difficult, but over time, weaving will go much more fun.  So that the wreath does not fall apart and holds more securely, you can take three long, durable threads of medium thickness as the base.  They will be additional "fittings" for future decoration. </p><p>  If you do not know how to make a wreath of leaves very lush, try adding not one, but two or three leaves to each strand.  Only in this case, you can‚Äôt do without threads.  Very thick weaving holds poorly and falls apart. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to weave a wreath of leaves" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/718848.jpg" width="339"></div>

    <p>  And one more nuance: choose leaves with long and thin roots for a wreath.  Thick ones will break and crumble. </p><h2>  Wreath of roses </h2><p>  A very effective decoration is obtained from roses made from the same leaves.  But this is a time-consuming task that is not suitable for a walk, but can perfectly entertain children.  In addition, such a wreath will be an excellent decoration for both the door and the queen of the autumn ball. </p><p>  We start by making flowers.  They will need a lot.  Therefore, it is worth stocking up a large number of leaves in advance.  We take one leaf and fold it in half with the top to the spine.  We turn it into a tight tube.  Next, prepare the next sheet in the same way and wrap it around the tube.  We continue weaving the roses until we get the flower of the right size.  At the bottom, we fix the rose with a thread and cut the ends under it.  The smoother the cut, the easier it will then be to attach the flower to the base. </p><p>  The second stage consists of gluing the base with our flowers.  The main thing is to plant them as close to each other as possible.  To make the maple leaf wreath beautiful, you need to take either a flat ring or a very wide base as a base, which will look spectacular on your head. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maple leaf wreath" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/718847.jpg" width="407"></div>

    <h2>  How to extend the life of the wreath? </h2><p>  Now we know how to weave a wreath of leaves.  But there is another problem - its fragility.  If the decoration is made only for a walk and a photo shoot on it, then you should not worry about this.  But decorative wreaths I want to keep in their original form for as long as possible. </p><p>  Of course, a wreath of maple leaves consists of dead material.  Anyway, sooner or later they will fade and dry.  To slow down this process a bit, try creating a humid atmosphere.  Spray the wreath with water, but do not overdo it.  From very large moisture, the leaves will begin to darken and rot.  Try adding a little antiseptic to the water to avoid this.  You will beat off a couple of days of beauty with these events from the inexorable laws of nature. </p><h2>  Wreath Holidays </h2><p>  And finally, a few words about how popular the wreath of maple leaves is in the world.  Every fall in the West, almost every door is decorated with this product.  This makes the exterior of any homestead elegant in the autumn.  In some cities, it is so popular that they have been holding maple wreath festivals for decades.  They hold competitions for the best product, and recognized masters show beginners how to weave a wreath of leaves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="master class wreath of leaves" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/718851.jpg" width="452"></div>

    <p>  In our country, people do not worship this subject so much, but every fall in the park you will meet a <span>happy man</span> with a wreath on his head.  And a smile appears on your face in response.  This is wonderful when people can enjoy the pleasant things that surround them in everyday life. </p>
