Creative Ideas</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For a creative person, nothing is impossible.  He is able to make DIY crafts from everything.  Ideas for such needlework are enough.  The main thing is to choose the material that will be to your liking.  Very original models are made of napkins.  What can be done, how to work with napkins, where to apply such a craft - this will be discussed in the article. </p><h2>  DIY materials </h2><p>  Material for crafts can be divided into two groups. </p><p>  The first will include specially prepared material that you can buy in the form of various kits designed to do DIY crafts.  This can be a set of polymer clay, a set of floss threads, a set for embroidery with beads, a set of elastic bands for weaving, and many others.  This group also includes items that we buy in the store for domestic purposes, but they can also be used to make crafts.  These are matches, napkins, cotton buds and discs, coffee beans, flour, cereals, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="From napkins what can be done" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1205890.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <p>  In the second group we take the so-called <span>waste material.</span>  <span>This</span> is what is at hand, for which you don’t have to go to the store on purpose, moreover, it goes to waste: empty bottles, shells, milk cartons, egg comb, juice boxes, various plastic, etc. .d. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In this article, we will consider <span>crafts from napkins:</span> what can be done and how to apply such a craft. </p><h2>  Rules for working with napkins </h2><p>  As an ornamental material, paper napkins are valued for their softness, suppleness, beauty and variety.  They are convenient to bend, they do not stain the skin.  They are affordable and inexpensive. </p><p>  It is necessary to name some rules when working on crafts from napkins: what can be done, how to fold, what bonding materials to use. </p><ol><li>  When folding and bending the napkin, it is necessary to apply a minimum of effort, since this is a very fragile material and can break from strong pressure. </li><li>  When working with napkins, make sure that your hands and the surface of the table are dry, as the napkin can get wet from water. </li><li>  When working with napkins, your hands should be clean, otherwise the material will quickly get dirty. </li><li>  Origami is most often made of napkins, so no bonding materials are required. </li></ol><p>  Following these rules, we will try to make a lotus out of napkins. </p><h2>  Paper flower </h2><p>  The real decoration of the table will be <span>a lotus flower</span> from paper napkins.  Made using this technology, it can perform several functions on the festive table.  This beautiful decoration combines a vase for sweets and a set of original decorated napkins that are used for their intended purpose. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Napkin Lotus" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1205882.jpg" width="600"></div>

It will consist of napkins folded as follows.  Take a napkin, fold it in half diagonally, then at right angles to the folded side.  Next, open and start the sides to the midline.  Turn over and bend the small triangles up.  Turn over, fold in half.  Thus, we will prepare five triangles of the same color for the base and twenty for the petals. </p><p>  We take an awl and make two punctures on the short side.  With a needle and a thread, we fasten the base first along the lower puncture, then along the upper one and carefully straighten the petal to make a boat. </p><p>  Napkins of a different color, which will act as petals, are inserted into the place of fastening the two lower ones at the base with the long side.  We help them snap into place using a fork.  The second row of petals is staggered.  There will be four rows in total. </p><p>  Ready lotus from napkins can be used as a vase for sweets. </p><h2>  Figures from napkins </h2><p>  For this craft you will need two-color napkins, cardboard, scissors, glue. </p><p>  First, we will prepare a number template, cutting it out of cardboard with scissors. </p><p>  Next, we begin to manufacture the item from a napkin.  To do this, unfold the paper towel and fold it diagonally.  Now, very carefully, to get an even thin tube, roll it diagonally, leave 4 cm. From one end we start twisting into a tight ring.  Turn the tip up and hide it behind the wall.  The remaining triangles are very carefully turned out so that the bud is inside them.  It turned out a very beautiful unblown rose. </p><p>  On the cardboard in the middle, we glue the basis of the figure from such roses, for example, a unit.  On the sides we decorate it with roses of a different color. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Figures from napkins" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1205889.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <p>  Using this technology, you can make any numbers from napkins. </p><h2>  Unusual tree </h2><p>  This craft can be used as a decorative element in the hallway or living room.  The tree is bright, original, does not require watering and lighting. </p><p>  First we make a tree element.  To do this, the napkin must be cut into four squares and put one on top of the other.  It is better to take a three-layer napkin, so the element will turn out more magnificent.  Then we fasten the stapler in the middle, cut out a circle, make small cuts around the perimeter and begin to bend inwards in layers.  We leave the last layer not bent and gently open the flower from the middle.  It turns out a very magnificent elegant element. </p><p>  Next, we make the basis for the crown of the tree.  To do this, we will make a dense ball out of old newspapers, tie it with thread and glue a napkin to the flowers to match it. </p><p>  We take a decorated stick, fasten a ball on it and fix the whole structure with plaster in a flower pot.  It remains to decorate the ball with prepared elements, and the tree from napkins is ready. </p><p>  Also, a tree of napkins can be laid out on the festive table.  Then they can be used for its intended purpose. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tree made of napkins" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1205901.jpg" width="416"></div>
