Starts of sales began simultaneously with the newer version of the Lumia 920 phone. Nevertheless, the 820th model became one of Nokia‚Äôs most sold mobile products.  The reason for such a high popularity lies in the hardware and multimedia features of the phone. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  "Lumia 820" is a powerful universal smartphone with an interesting design.  Underneath is a 2-core Qualcomm Krait S4 series processor.  The total frequency of data processing is 3 GHz.  The chipset is developed using the 28 nm technology. <br><br>  Nokia Lumia 820 also has high specifications regarding the integrated memory slats.  The internal volume is 8 GB.  As for RAM, here are the standard 1024 MB, traditionally included in all new Nokia models. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia lumia 820 specifications" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/698400.jpg" width="600"></div>  Among the technical features of the model, we can distinguish an 8-megapixel camera with support for recording video stream in FullHD.  The screen is simple, but has its advantages, such as hypersensitivity. <br><br>  The smartphone supports almost all commonly accepted mobile interfaces.  Power is supplied by a 1650 mAh battery.  Case dimensions - 124 by 68.5 mm.  The thickness is 9.9 mm.  The weight of the device in the factory form is 160 g.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  For Nokia Lumia 820, it‚Äôs best to start the review with external data.  In the development of design, the engineers of the Finnish company decided to move away from the usual traditions.  That is why this model is so unlike its predecessors.  "Lumia 820" is not a classic monolith.  The case has a removable back panel.  In addition, corners and faces have become more even and rounded.  Thanks to this, the smartphone is comfortable and pleasant in your hand.  Also, this fact is facilitated by the optimal case dimensions - 5.6 inches diagonally. <br><br>  At the moment, the devices are black, red, orange, white, yellow, gray, green and <span>purple.</span>  The panels on the Nokia Lumia 820 are another story.  Each of them has its own functionality.  There are protective ones with rubber tabs, there are those supporting the <span>wireless charging</span> method <span>,</span> and there are standard ones.  Each of them is colorful and useful in its own way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia lumia 820" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/698401.jpg" width="600"></div>  In developing the model, Nokia engineers had to sacrifice the convenience of changing / removing panels.  To access the battery or additional external cards, you need to make a lot of effort.  Fastenings hold the panel so firmly that you have to hook it with something thin metal. <br><br>  The speaker is located at the bottom.  Nearby is a micro-USB slot.  On the top face is the entrance for headphones.

This is one of the primary problems of the WinPhone 7.5 axis.  On the other hand, the transition of the flagship mobile industry to FullHD also does not justify itself.  This resolution requires not only a powerful graphics processor, but also an enhanced battery. <br><br>  Therefore, the developers of "Lumiya 820" decided to kill two birds with one stone - to reduce screen support to a minimum that would not affect the quality of the display.  Such a risky step made it possible to introduce a medium-sized processor and a standard battery into the system.  This ultimately significantly affected the affordability. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia lumia 820 review" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/698402.jpg" width="600"></div>  The display is made using the well-known AMOLED technology.  Color rendering - True RGB.  It is worth noting the lack of PenTile.  But on the screen there is already a polarizing ClearBlack layer.  Thanks to this, the optimum depth and contrast of colors was achieved.  Viewing angles - almost 90 degrees.  AMOLED technology allowed to obtain maximum clarity of the text.

    <h2>  Hardware platform </h2><p>  For the performance of Nokia Lumia 820 meets the 2-core chipset on the Qualcomm Snapdragon platform.  The graphic part is left over to Adreno 225. These fourth-generation accessories allow you to achieve maximum device performance.  A plus of the model is the fact that the chipset is developed using the 28 nm technology.  Testing showed that the data processing speed of the ‚ÄúLumiya 820‚Äù is not worse than that of many flagships like the HTC One X or <span>Sony Xperia T.</span> <br><br>  Memory performance is a bit more modest.  Here, only 1 GB of RAM is allocated, and 8 GB of integrated memory.  It is possible to add disk space due to an external memory card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 820 lumia update" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/698403.jpg" width="500"></div>  The package includes a standard hardware kit, thanks to which the smartphone can freely interact with such interfaces as Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, LTE, NFC.

    <h2>  Camera specifications </h2><p>  The quality of shooting photo and video materials does not differ.  The camera has a reserve of 8 megapixels, so the resolution of recording in FullHD format is quite justified. <br><br>  Optics of the middle class, made by Carl Zeiss technology.  Aperture high - F2.2.  However, in poor lighting conditions, the quality of pictures will deteriorate significantly.  The backlight of the camera is weak, so at night it is better to refrain from photo shoots. <br><br>  From useful wired modes, you can distinguish dynamic shots and the ability to erase excess objects from the frame. </p><h2>  Multimedia features </h2><p>  The smartphone operating system is based on the WP8 platform.  The interface engine is standard.  It is worth noting the active lock screen, which displays the dynamics of the weather, clock, the status of the main applications, various system notifications.  On the desktop there is a familiar panel with live tiles.  It is important that Nokia 820 Lumia updates the OS automatically, although there is a manual search function. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="repair nokia lumia 820" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/698404.jpg" width="600"></div>  Applications such as Microsoft Office, Skype, and Internet Explorer are built into the standard firmware.  Of the additional programs in the OS, Nokia Music and Nokia Maps are integrated.  The first application is a proprietary player, which makes it possible to get full access to the entire multimedia base of the service.  Nokia Cards display up-to-date information about traffic, proximity to landmarks, etc. <br><br>  Like all new smartphones, Lumia 820 supports any video file format, so they do not need to be converted beforehand.  It is important to note the high GPS positioning in the Nokia Lumia 820.

    <h2>  Expert Reviews </h2><p>  Experts believe that the 820th model of the Lumiya contains only the most necessary hardware components.  During development, the chipsets that were optimal in price and quality were used.  Compared with the flagships of other <span>well-known brands, the</span> Lumia 820 has a much simpler configuration.  Nevertheless, the performance of the model is at a high level. <br><br>  When developing the screen, a 800 x 480 matrix was used. However, coupled with <span>AMOLED technology, the display</span> received amazing brightness and saturation of the entire color palette.  Even the 920th Nokia model has no such display depth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia lumia 820 reviews" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/698405.jpg" width="600"></div>  The case is made of durable plastic, so the smartphone, according to experts, is protected from shock.  In any case, if the panel does not prevent breakage, Nokia Lumia 820 repair will not take much time, since the components are freely available in all services.  According to experts, to many of the latest models of Samsung and Sony it is extremely difficult to find individual parts.

    <h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  Lumia 820 is definitely worth the <span>money</span> spent <span>.</span>  <span>The cost of the</span> device varies within 20 000 rubles.  For this amount, the buyer receives a high-quality and productive smartphone, which has a minimum of complaints. <br><br>  Of the advantages noted by users: beautiful design, high speed, excellent sound, bright screen, durable housing, convenient built-in software. <br><br>  The only significant drawback of the model, as buyers say, is the low sensitivity of the camera to light.  At night, the pictures are of terrible quality.  The disadvantage can be called too tightly pressed back panel. </p>
