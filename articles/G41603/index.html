The structure has organized full support for the investment activities of its clients.  Brokerage services are provided by a division of Sberbank CIB JSC. </p><div class="photo" data-original="businessman.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Benefits of Collaboration" class="if uuid-3198303" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3198303.jpg"></div><p>  Beginners do not need to study the features of this market, since a financial and credit organization offers a set of ready-made investment portfolios.
