Employee reviews about this corporation will help draw the right conclusions about integrity.  Should I get a job here?  Or is it better to find another company?

    <p>  Accordingly, the organization is engaged in the field of IT-technologies and the Internet.  It is in great demand among the population.  Why?  What distinguishes a company from a number of similar corporations? </p><h2>  About Services </h2><p>  The fact is that Enforta is a company that is really in demand.  She, as already mentioned, is a company offering one or another type of connection. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  More precisely, among the services that can be obtained in the organization, there are: </p><ul><li>  conducting the Internet to a private home; </li><li>  multi-apartment internet connection; </li><li>  mobile communications services; </li><li>  holding and providing a landline telephone. </li></ul><p>  Nothing surprising or specific.  Nevertheless, the organization really pleases the population with its activities.  Customers are satisfied with the cooperation with the company.  In any case, this is demonstrated by numerous reviews of the population.  Pleased with the service "Internet - in a private home."  After all, private owners are very problematic to host the World Wide Web without the help of a mobile router.  But with Enforta it becomes possible! </p><p>  It turns out that we are talking about a well-known and large company.  She is constantly looking for and gaining new personnel.  And in different cities.  After all, the company is not only in Moscow.  It is distributed throughout Russia.  Should I contact this employer? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prestige internet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1585863.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About tariffs </h2><p>  Before answering this question, it is recommended to learn a little more about the company from customers.  Indeed, it is often the positive or negative reviews about the company that attract the attention of applicants or scare away new personnel. </p><p>  Enforta offers a variety of tariffs for communication services.  A distinctive feature of the organization is that all plans are ideal for business.  After all, it is with the corporate clients and businessmen that the organization under study mainly works. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Rates depend on the number of employees in the company.  For example, you can pay attention to the following types of access to the Network: </p><ul><li>  1 Mbps, unlimited access, email, free antivirus - for 10 employees maximum; </li><li>  2 Mbps, as well as all the previously listed features - for companies with 30 employees to the maximum; </li><li>  4 Mbps, unlimited, mail, antivirus, if we are talking about a company up to 50 people. </li></ul><p>  These are not all tariffs, but the listed options attract most.  As already mentioned, Enforta receives mostly positive feedback from customers.  Although sometimes a company is spoken of as a company that does not work very stably.  The Internet from Enforta is not much different from access to the Network offered by any other competitor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="company enforta moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1585864.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About the interview </h2><p>  Now you can think about how the company is a conscientious boss.  It has already been said that the organization is constantly looking for and hiring new subordinates.  But how risky is the applicant‚Äôs appeal to Enfort? </p><p>  To understand this fully, it is important to consider all the nuances and experience of each employee.  For example, pay attention to the interview.  Enforta employees reviews about this process are far from the worst. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Basically, applicants and subordinates are pleased that the first meeting with a potential boss will take place in a clean and comfortable office.  Her cultural and friendly managers lead.  They are ready to tell all about cooperation with Enforta.  And it pleases.  Only occasionally do job seekers complain that HR managers are not friendly. </p><p>  The interview does not have any features.  It goes according to the standard scheme - studying the resume of the applicant, filling out the questionnaire, as well as a personal conversation with the representative of the employer.  Enforta is a provider, the advantages of cooperation with which are described very actively at the first meeting with applicants. </p><h2>  Promises </h2><p>  How exactly?  What does the specified company promise its subordinates?  After all, with something she attracts new employees!  The promises made by the employer are not much different from the standard guarantees found by most companies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="internet in a private house" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1585867.jpg"></div>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  More precisely, in the "Enfort" we can hope: </p><ul><li>  on the possibility of part-time work and combination; </li><li>  career growth and development; </li><li>  flexible and convenient work schedule; </li><li>  competitive earnings with the prospect of higher wages; </li><li>  official registration; </li><li>  work in a friendly team; </li><li>  developed corporate ethics. </li></ul><p>  It sounds really attractive.  But how promises are true?  Is Enforta company so good (Moscow or any other city - it‚Äôs not so important)? </p><h2>  About employment </h2><p>  It‚Äôs hard to answer.  The thing is that opinions can be divided into 2 categories - positive and negative.  There are approximately the same number of them about the studied employer. </p><p>  The ambiguous "Enforta" employees receive reviews for the design features of subordinates to work.  Someone says that everyone is obligated to work officially within the organization.  And some emphasize the absence of the promised signing of the contract and the entry of the corresponding entry in the citizen‚Äôs work book. </p><p>  What to believe?  Prestige-Internet (Enforta) is a large company.  She has been working in Russia for a long time.  And this employer formalizes all his subordinates officially.  The corporation does not violate labor laws.  But some time without an employment contract will have to work. </p><h2>  Training </h2><p>  In particular, in training.  This is a mandatory process that every Enforta employee faces.  Without the so-called internship, the applicant will not be able to find a job in the corporation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="enforta provider" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1585866.jpg"></div>

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <p></p>
    <p>  Learning gets mixed opinions.  Some employees say that it is training that allows you to get acquainted with the upcoming work, team and responsibilities.  Allegedly, it is beneficial.  And sometimes Enforta is not the best employee reviews.  Some doubt the relevance of training.  After all, in fact, a citizen will perform the duties of an official employee without documenting.  Doubtful joy for the applicant. </p><h2>  Working conditions </h2><p>  Prestige-Internet offers good working conditions in general.  They delight employees.  There is no excitement, but people leave positive opinions about their employer. </p><p>  They try to comply with the work schedule, and all processing and overtime work are paid.  In the workplace, employees have everything necessary for the performance of labor duties. </p><p>  Complaints can arise only for technicians who conduct the Internet.  They are not provided with official transport; often they have to travel to the client on their own.  But this is not such a big drawback. </p><p>  Sometimes Enforta does not earn the best reviews from employees of the call center and sales managers.  After all, you have to work in the office.  Yes, in the premises there is everything necessary for labor, but sometimes it is problematic to carry out labor duties without interruptions. </p><h2>  Environment </h2><p>  Enforta is a company in which even beginners will be warmly welcomed.  Workers emphasize that this employer has a truly friendly team.  Not everywhere, but at many points. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="enforta communication services" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1585865.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Accordingly, it will be necessary to work in a friendly and close-knit team.  Colleagues will always support, prompt, help.  Conflicts rarely occur, they try to resolve them as quickly as possible.  Beginners are helped to get used to a new place. </p><p>  It is noted that Enforta is a company ideally suited for outgoing people.  For some, the team literally became a second family.  Unfriendly and reserved subordinates, as a rule, do not stay here for a long time. </p><p>  But the bosses are not getting the best reviews.  Some say that the leaders of Enforta are understanding and fair people.  And part of the subordinates emphasizes that the management of the corporation is not distinguished by conscientiousness and justice. </p><h2>  Earning </h2><p>  Enforta has reviews of employees of various plans for the earnings of subordinate providers in various positions.  Often you can find opinions indicating a lack of real income.  The main profit is the percentage of transactions. </p><p>  And someone emphasizes what exactly Enforta teaches to sell and work.  This is a very good place as an initial step in building a career as a sales manager.  You can learn something and earn money.  The employer tries to pay on time, without delay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="enforta rates" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1585868.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Enforta offers communication services to the public.  This is a good corporation in every sense.  The employer receives standard claims from his subordinates.  But not a single negative review has been confirmed.  Therefore, they should not be trusted. </p><p>  Most employees are happy with their place of work.  Enforta really helps to develop and make new acquaintances. </p>
