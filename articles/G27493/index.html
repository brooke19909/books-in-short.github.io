This is one of the main natural attractions of the country.  Therefore, all guides recommend that tourists see the waterfall in the original.  It is called along the river, where it forms a beautiful cascade.  The flow height is negligible.  But it‚Äôs still worth going to the waterfall in order to temporarily change your sea vacation to a river, enjoy new experiences, sit in a fish restaurant or cafe under shady trees and leave, taking with you colorful photos.  In this article we will tell you how to get to Manavgat waterfall.  A self-guided tour will be dedicated not only to this one attraction.  Near the waterfall is the ancient city of Manavgat.

    <h2>  Manavgat (waterfall): how to get </h2><p>  This amazing attraction is located just five kilometers from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  So the tour, distracting you from a beach holiday, will not be long and will take a maximum of half a day.  There is a waterfall in the province of Antalya.  But it is about eighty kilometers from the main city of the coast.  More precise address of the <span>attraction: Turkey,</span> Side.  Manavgat waterfall is located literally three kilometers from the city of the same name.  Therefore, you first need to get to it.  In the city of Manavgat follow minibuses, called dolmushi in Turkey.  It can be reached from Antalya and, of course, from Side.  And already in Manavgat itself you need to transfer to dolmush with a sign on the windshield ‚ÄúSelale‚Äù (shelale, which means ‚Äúwaterfall‚Äù).  These minibuses depart at an interval of a quarter of an hour.  Using your own or rented car, you can reach the city via the D400.  To the north of the waterfall (twelve kilometers) is the Oimapinar Dam. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Side Waterfall Manavgat" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1014667.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Self-guided tour </h2><p>  For city minibuses from Managavt with the inscription "Selale" this is not the last stop.  It is necessary to warn the driver and get out in the parking lot.  Where parking for sightseeing buses and dolmushes from Side, Manavgat Falls has an official entrance.  Need to get a ticket.  It costs (for an adult) three and a half lira.  Near the checkout you will find guide dogs, camels, ponies and donkeys.  But it is better to go to the waterfall on foot.  Go straight between the rows of souvenir shops, teahouses and cafes.  And now, turning behind the white building, you will find yourself on the observation deck right in front of the waterfall.  Reviews of tourists are divided in opinions when it is best to visit this natural attraction.  After rains in <span>the Taurus Mountains, the</span> waterfall turns into a threshold.  He just hides in a rising river.  But in the dry period, the waterfall flows down from a height of five meters.  On the other hand, in a rainy season a natural attraction makes a more powerful impression.  Water floods part of the observation deck, and you can estimate the temperature of a mountain river - somewhere around ten degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manavgat waterfall how to get" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1014690.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is Manavgat waterfall (Antalya) </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, the height of this stream is small - only five meters.  But the width is quite significant.  For forty meters it spills between two banks.  Falling water breaks into many splashes.  In fact, there are several viewing platforms.  They are also cascaded, one above the other.  And from all of them you can make great pictures.  There is no water on the upper viewing platform, but on the lower you need to protect the camera and camera from splashes.  Reviews are advised to go to them in shoes that are fixed on the feet or barefoot, because flip flops and flip flops can blow Manavgat waterfall with their fast and powerful current.  It‚Äôs difficult to take photos and selfies - both because of splashes and because of a large crowd of people.  After all, about a million people visit the waterfall annually, and most of them come in the summer.  In addition to foreign tourists, many Turks come to this natural attraction.  Hiking enthusiasts can take walks along the river. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manavgat waterfall antalya" class="if" height="432" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1014675.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where to eat </h2><p>  The Manavgat River is rich in trout.  And therefore, many fish restaurants huddle near the waterfall.  The portions are huge, and the prices are sparing.  Many restaurants are built so that visitors can watch the meal in all its glory Manavgat waterfall.  Reviews even mention one cafe that stands in the river itself, like a large raft that is about to be carried away by the stream.  Since this place is loved by the Turks, there are many classic teahouses with traditional low tables and pillows instead of chairs.  Reviews recommend ordering trout and tasting the thinnest flat cakes.  You will always want to come here again - just to have a romantic candlelight dinner overlooking the waterfall.  And, of course, you cannot leave this place without a souvenir.  And there are more than enough shops selling these goods. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Side Waterfall Manavgat" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1014678.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  City Manavgat </h2><p>  To inspect the waterfall, even taking into account the queues for creating beautiful photographs, it will take you about an hour and a half.  Do not rush to return to Side.  Better take the opportunity and visit the city of Manavgat.  It is very ancient - the first buildings date back to the sixth century BC.  Like many cities of antiquity, it was abandoned for many centuries.  And the first mention of the new city (called Melas) dates back to 1329.  Founded by the Seljuks, it became part of the Ottoman Empire in the fifteenth century.  The city is located closer to the sea than Manavgat waterfall.  At the main bridge on the river is a marina where you can catch a tourist boat.  The program on board varies.  Some motor ships go to the waterfall.  But most ships set off downstream. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manavgat river waterfall" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1014698.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tour selection </h2><p>  The waterfall on the Manavgat River is not the only attraction of these places.  And this can be seen by joining the excursion on the boat.  The trip can last about two hours, or it can take up to six hours - it all depends on the program.  Some ships just go to the ‚Äúzero‚Äù kilometer, to where the Manavgat River flows into the Mediterranean Sea.  Different densities and temperatures of the water make the junction seem flaky.  Reviews are advised to take a swim first in the cold river, and then in the warm sea.  On the way back, lunch and a performance by folk groups are offered.  Some ships sail into the Altinbesik cave, where you can see stalactites, stalagmites and small dams.  Reviews recommend going to Lake Titreengel.  There are many <span>trout farms.</span>  In addition to predatory fish, quite friendly and sociable turtles are found here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterfall Manavgat photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1014679.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Outdoor enthusiasts </h2><p>  You can go down the river not only on tourist steamboats.  Active tourists go to zero kilometer by boat and canoe.  A sand spit has lapped between the river and the sea - a great place for hiking or cycling.  Where Manavgat waterfall flows, there is the opportunity to ride horses or camels.  You can go upstream - to the artificial dams Barazh and Oimapinar.  On the beauty of the last reservoir, tourists leave the most positive reviews.  The beauty of the dam, surrounded by sheer cliffs with coniferous forests, is simply mesmerizing.  Some sections of the Manavgat River are suitable for rafting.  Great rafting in <span>Kepryulu canyon.</span> </p><h2>  Reasonably Build Your Day </h2><p>  Reviews recommend arriving at Manavgat Falls early in the morning.  Most tourist buses arrive by noon.  Then it becomes very crowded, it is difficult to take good photos.  After admiring the waterfall and having a snack in one of the restaurants, go to the mountains or return to the city of Manavgat.  In its vicinity are the ruins of ancient Side.  After visiting the temple of Apollo, the basilica and the amphitheater, you can visit the ancient Seleucia.  And you can end the day with a boat trip to the mouth of the Manavgat River. </p>
