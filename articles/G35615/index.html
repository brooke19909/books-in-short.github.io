    <h2>  Kazan is a connecting link between the West and the East </h2><p>  The geographical position of the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan is unique in that it is located between two parts of the world: Asia and Europe.  The city has been over a thousand years old, and it has always been a connecting link between East and West.  It so happened historically that many events taking place in Russia and the world are connected with Kazan.  For example, the Great Volga Route, which connected Scandinavia and the Arab countries, passed near modern Kazan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazan central bus station address" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40448/1203467.jpg" width="600"></div>  Bulgaria, in particular, Kazan, played an important role in the struggle against the Mongol conquerors.  Then, however, a tax collection center for the Golden Horde was founded here.  One way or another, Kazan was and continues to be a key trading and economic point, first Bulgaria, then Horde, now Russia.

    <p>  For a large city, the role of bus stations is great.  The economic and financial well-being of the entire settlement and even the Republic depends on the quality of their work and their reliability.  In anticipation of a large flow of Universiade participants (2013) and tourists in Kazan, another bus station was built - Yuzhny.  This is a modern building equipped with the latest technology.  The station is designed for daily public services in the amount of up to five thousand people.  It carries out transportation mainly in the south-east and south directions. </p><h2>  Other points of external trunk transportation in Kazan </h2><p>  In addition to bus stations, Kazan has railway stations, a river port, and an airport.  <span>Kazan</span> Passenger <span>Train Station</span> is located in the center of Kazan.  Some of the city's attractions are within walking distance from it: the magnificent promenade, the famous Sports Palace.  You can also get to Millennium Square, near which the main attractions of the city are located, including the UNESCO <span>Kremlin</span> ensemble of the <span>Kazan Kremlin.</span> </p><p>  Station "Uprising - Passenger" is a new railway station located at the metro station "North Station" on Vorovsky street.  An additional railway junction has existed on this site since the 1960s.  The Universiade built a modern station complex.  Twenty-six kilometers from Kazan is Kazan Airport.  This is the only airport in Russia that has a 4-star quality level. </p>
