The history of the city causes disagreement among historians.  Rather, the stumbling block is not so much the bookmarking date of the city, but the question of what was in the place of Nizhny before the annals and why the specification ‚ÄúNizhny‚Äù is attached to the name ‚ÄúNovgorod‚Äù. </p><h2>  Strengthening Russia </h2><p>  The year of foundation of the city is considered to be 1221st.  The following year, after a successful campaign on the Volga Bulgars, <span>Prince Yuri Vsevolodovich</span> ordered the city to be placed at the mouth of the Oka River: "he decided to strengthen an important place for Russia."  In the annals it is said that he ordered to establish a ‚Äúnew city‚Äù, from where the name came.  But there are other versions of the appearance of the name.  According to one of them, they began to build a new city on the site of the Mordovian settlement, and according to another, Nizhny Novgorod received its full name in connection with its position: it was built along the Volga below the Old Town. </p><p>  There is a version that many new cities were laid along the river bed, and in order to distinguish them, they gave a double name.  One way or another, the new settlement was named Nizhny Novgorod, the history of the name of the city is hidden for centuries, perhaps there is a chronicle of ancient years that shed light on this issue. </p><p>  Initially, earthen fortifications and a wooden Kremlin were built, at that time it was enough to gather a squad and give it a refuge.  Also from this strategic place it was convenient to repel the attacks of militant tribes and walk with aggressive campaigns.  A few years later, white-stone churches rose inside the fortifications, and Nizhny Novgorod began from this place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  History of the city, a brief summary of hiking </h2><p>  From the moment the Kremlin was built, the city began to grow and be used for the intended purpose for which it was being prepared.  In 1226, several Erzyan settlements were conquered by the forces of the squads of Svyatoslav and Ivan, who were brothers of the Grand Duke.  Two years later, another attempt was made to conquer the Zyryan villages, the nephew of the Grand Duke and his governor took this campaign.  The enterprise was not successful, but few people stopped this fact.  In 1229, in winter, the Grand Duke made an invasion of the possessions of the Erzyan king Purgas, where he was defeated.  Purgas did not remain in debt and in April of that year made an unsuccessful attack on Nizhny Novgorod. </p><p>  The history of the city (a brief summary of it and a full-fledged study of the annals of the folios confirm this) is replete with military campaigns.  This indicates the important purpose of the city.  The geographical location was very advantageous in terms of military strategy.  On the one hand, the Kremlin was built on Mount Chasovaya, where two water arteries were visible.  On the other hand, the city had a natural defense in the form of the steep banks of the Volga, threatening to constantly crumble when a large number of people approached them.  The Grand Duke wished for achievements, relying on the Russian outpost, but the Tatar-Mongol horde forced everyone to reconsider their plans. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Feudalism in Russian </h2><p>  Since Nizhny Novgorod was located on the border of Russia and poorly fortified, it is assumed that the Mongol-Tatars burned the city during the invasion, it is impossible to confirm or refute this assumption, there are no written sources.  They rebuilt it quickly, significantly strengthening it with earthen ramparts.  Over its long century, the city has repeatedly passed from hand to hand between Russian princes.  Some time later, at the end of the 13th century, the Principality of Gorodets appeared, where the son of Alexander Nevsky ruled, Nizhny Novgorod entered it. </p><p>  The history of the city, a summary of which can be found on the ancient pages, tells that at the beginning of the 14th century the Principality of Gorodets was completely subordinated to the Vladimir Prince.  The struggle for a strategic place did not stop: in 1311, Moscow Prince Yuri captured Nizhny Novgorod and put his brother Boris to reign in it. </p><p>  Viceroyhood lasted until the death of the prince.  In 1320, the city again passed into the possession of the Principality of Vladimir.  Then in the history of Rus came the dark times of conquest, where the Russian princes, together with the Mongol-Tatar conquerors divided the lands, established new borders of possessions with the help of military campaigns.  This continued until the 15th century, only at that time a relatively stable, almost peaceful time was established.  Prince of Moscow Vasily I finally annexed the city to his principality.  The destructive wars did not end there, but in the 16th century the construction of a stone Kremlin instead of a wooden one began.  And now it is the main attraction for residents and visitors to Nizhny Novgorod.  Photos of the city, attractions are abundant, but the main one is the fortress.  At the time of construction, the stone Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin is the same age as Moscow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Seven Boyars </h2><p>  In 1605, Tsar Boris Godunov died, and the Troubles came with his death.  The poisoning by the envious commander Skopin-Shuisky in 1610 spurred the internecine princely wars, the Polish gentry did not fail to take advantage of the situation.  The so-called seven-boyars reigned in Moscow: having entered into a conspiracy, the sovereign boyars allowed Sigismund, the Polish king, into the capital. </p><p>  At the same time, Nizhny Novgorod traitors conspired with the Swedish commander Gustav Adolf and let him in with the army into the city.  So, Nizhny Novgorod was plundered, the son of the Polish king Sigismund Vladislav began to take over in Moscow.  Most of the Russian people murmured against foreign rule, Nizhny Novgorod became the liberator. </p>

    <h2>  History of the city, a summary of the liberation movement </h2><p>  Moscow, as the capital and heart of the country, was in a deplorable state.  Vladislav ruined the country, created lawlessness, trampled the Orthodox faith.  Moscow boyars asked Sigismund to become the ruler of Russia, but <span>Patriarch Hermogenes</span> opposed this <span>.</span>  He wrote appeals and sent them to monasteries.  There they became accessible to many people - appeals were read in the squares, they sounded a call for a liberation movement.  Hermogenes was captured by the gentry and died in hungry dungeons.  This fact was the reason for the long-ripening rebellion against foreign rule. </p><p>  The movement was led by Nizhny Novgorod: the merchant <span>Kozma Minin</span> and the military with the princely title Dmitry Pozharsky.  In February <span>1612, the</span> army went to liberate Moscow, on the way they liberated Yaroslavl and stood in it until August.  By the end of summer, the army moved to Moscow, but it was almost gone, the Poles burned the city.  The remnants of the Polish army locked themselves in the Kremlin and held the defenses in China Town.  The militia of Dmitry Pozharsky burst into Kitai Gorod and knocked out the enemy from there.  The remains of the Polish invaders disappeared behind the walls of the Kremlin.  The siege of the <span>Kremlin walls</span> was short-lived, the Poles realized the hopelessness of their situation and surrendered.  So Minin and Pozharsky saved Moscow and Russia from invaders with the full support of the whole people. </p>

    <h2>  Historical justice </h2><p>  The feat of Minin and Pozharsky, as well as the entire popular movement, glorified Nizhny Novgorod.  A photo or a Moscow monument to Minin and Pozharsky are known to every resident of Russia.  Nizhny Novgorod all over the world raised funds for a monument to national heroes in order to install it in Nizhny Novgorod.  But it was installed on Red Square in Moscow, and Nizhny Novgorod got only the obelisk, which was spent on public money. </p><p>  It was possible to fulfill the desire of the townspeople only in 2005, when Zurab Tsereteli cast a copy of the Moscow monument, and it was installed on the main square of such a city as Nizhny Novgorod.  Photos of this monument can now be seen everywhere, residents took this fact as historical justice and are rightly proud of their heroes. </p>

    <h2>  The heyday of the city </h2><p>  After the time of troubles, the country comes to stability, and flourishing begins in Nizhny Novgorod.  Actively developed trade, construction, agriculture, fisheries.  Shipyards were built, crafts received a new breath and an impetus to universal prosperity.  This was facilitated by the neighborhood of the city with the Makaryevskaya Fair.  Peter I, in 1722, having celebrated his half-century anniversary, decided to reform the city.  From now on, Nizhny Novgorod becomes the capital of Nizhny Novgorod governorship.  In the second half of the 18th century, pharmacies, hospitals, printing houses, a public school and the first theater in Russia opened in the city.  But it was time to defend the country from the Napoleonic army. </p><p>  The war with Napoleon, the burning of Moscow made the city a place of settlement for many eminent citizens of the country.  At that time, it was said that the capital would be transferred to Nizhny Novgorod.  During this period, a literary circle was opened in the city, the backbone of which became Karamzin N. M., Batyushkov K. N. and many other famous word artists.  The Nizhny Novgorod militia did not shame the memory of Minin and Pozharsky and fought with honor with the invaders. </p><p>  The golden age in the development and heyday of Nizhny Novgorod was the fact of the transfer of the Makaryevskaya Fair to the city.  It was then that they began to call it "the pocket of Russia."  During the trading months, there were nine visitors for each native.  Bidding at the Nizhny Novgorod Fair formed world prices for gold, furs, silver and much more.  In the same period, several railway lines were brought to the trading floor, which strengthened the position of the city, and trade gained a new scope already at the world level.  Shopping arcades and now adorn Nizhny Novgorod.  A photo of an old building shows the beauty and scope of the building.  Fair premises are a landmark of the city. </p>

    <h2>  Revolution and World War II </h2><p>  The revolution was not easy for anyone, for Nizhny Novgorod new times came immediately - in the fall of 1917.  The master of the thoughts of the revolutionary masses of Nizhny Novgorod was Maxim Gorky (Peshkov), a local native.  Later, on November 7, 1932, the city was renamed Gorky.  The period after the revolution and before the Great Patriotic War was marked by the industrialization of the region. </p><p>  In May 1930, the construction of an automobile plant began, and it was completed in two years.  Initially, trucks were produced at the Gorky Automobile Plant (GAZ), and a few months later the production of cars was arranged.  In 1933, a bridge was built across the Oka, which fully connected the two parts of the city, a little later, in the same year, the bridge across the Volga was put into operation. </p><p>  Since 1941, the entire industry of the region has been working towards the Victory.  Volunteers are sent to the front.  At the automotive plant, new models of equipment ‚Äî armored vehicles ‚Äî were designed and put into production.  During the war, tanks, weapons, armored vehicles were produced in the Gorky region, military personnel were trained.  It was at the Gorky Automobile Plant in the post-war years that the legendary Pobeda passenger car was launched into production. </p><p>  After the war, life in the city was getting better, industry was developing, the basis of which was the defense industry.  For this reason, in 1959 the city became closed to foreign citizens and unreliable people.  This status was withdrawn in the 90s of the 20th century, then the city was returned to its historical name - Nizhny Novgorod.  Photos of the city, the sights of ancient times replenished with the achievements and victories of our grandfathers. </p>
