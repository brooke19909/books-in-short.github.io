Hundreds of thousands of tourists come to these places to personally feel goosebumps on their skin. </p><h2>  What it is </h2><p>  A bone temple in the Czech Republic is called a church in another way and the international community has recognized it as the most terrible place and the most terrifying attraction in the world.  This is because more than forty thousand real human bones are collected inside the building, which are not randomly scattered around the perimeter, but carefully collected in various compositions.  The smallest interior details are also made from bones.  Every year, the temple of bones, despite its terrible history, attracts tens of thousands of tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hayo.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Barbara's Cathedral" class="if uuid-3230334" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3230334.jpg"></div><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  In the second half of the thirteenth century, in 1278, the minister of the Catholic monastic order in the suburbs of Kutna Hora, which separated from the main one, the Benedictine, was sent to the Holy Land, now known to belong to Israel, by order of the king.  The monk fulfilled the assignment and returned to his homeland with a small amount of land, which he brought from sacred places.  He evenly scattered the earth over the cemetery at the abbey.  Very quickly, rumors spread about this everywhere, and the churchyard became the most popular burial place.  The dead were brought here from all over Central Europe.  The burial place grew incredibly quickly, which was facilitated by numerous wars and epidemics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.prague-airport-transfers.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ossuary in Siedlec" class="if uuid-3230353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3230353.jpg"></div><p>  This went on until 1400.  During this period, a building was erected nearby, a tomb, which was supposed to serve as a kind of repository of bones that were dug from the ground to make way for new burials or construction.  The tomb was also rebuilt.  The architects added an additional entrance, which was supposed to protect the outer wall, as it significantly tilted and could collapse.  It is precisely known that in 1784 the Czech emperor ordered the closure of this tomb.  The former monastic lands were sold to the ancient noble family of the Schwarzenbergs along with all the buildings.  After about a century, the descendants of the dynasty hired a talented woodcarver, Frantisek Rint.  He was tasked with bringing the pile of bones to the maximum order.  The master approached the matter with imagination and did what we call the temple of human bones in the Czech Republic. </p><h2>  Internal organization </h2><p>  Outside, the temple is beautiful, built in the best traditions of Gothic art.  However, the interior decoration can seriously shock a tourist unprepared for the sight. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.civitatis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a vase of bones" class="if uuid-3230328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3230328.jpg"></div><p>  From the first steps, temple visitors are greeted by four rows of skulls stacked with bones.  It should be noted that earlier this composition was decorated with small cute gold cupids, love angels, but they were soon removed, as their presence did not fit in with the grim beauty of the installed skulls. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  One of the most frightening exhibits, but at the same time grandiose, is a chandelier under the roof.  It is possible that among tourists around the world it is the chandelier that is considered to be the main property of the bone temple in the Czech Republic.  It is mainly collected from the bones of limbs and small vertebrae.  The spurs are decorated with skulls, which are erected on special pedestals of scapula and humerus.  There are wax candles on the turtles. </p><p>  To the left of the main entrance, for public viewing, the coat of arms of the Schwarzenberg family was created.  In the first version of the coat of arms, one detail was missing, telling about an interesting historical fact: one of the family members at one time saved the country from an unexpected invasion of the Turks.  He grabbed a scout, intercepted a letter, and reported this to the king.  After the death of the hero, his skull was installed in the lower right corner of the coat of arms.  There you can clearly see the crow, as if symbolically pecking the eyes of the enemy. </p><p>  Vases and columns inside the temple made of human bones in the Czech Republic are also amazing.  Almost all parts of the human skeleton were used for their device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="s9155.pcdn.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bone composition" class="if uuid-3230350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3230350.jpg"></div><h2>  Uniqueness and sacrilege </h2><p>  The bone temple in the Czech Republic is a unique structure throughout the world due to the fact that all the interior details in it are assembled from bones.  There are many ossicles in the world, but it is Czech that is recognized as a cultural heritage.  A distinctive feature of the temple is the presence in it of the coat of arms of the city and the monastery.  The master did not forget about himself: next to the wall he left a kind of autograph.  Naturally, also from bones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irmanaanworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="interior details" class="if uuid-3230366" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3230366.jpg"></div><p>  The history of the bone temple in the Czech Republic, however, is not to everyone's taste.  Many consider this construction a mockery and blasphemy, since, in their opinion, the bones should belong to the earth.  Before being indignant, it is worth familiarizing yourself with the fact that, firstly, the ossuary is located below ground level, so they are considered buried.  Secondly, the temple is operational, church services are regularly held in it, candles are lit.  Any of the visitors can donate a few euros and put a candle for themselves and their loved ones.  Thirdly, from the very beginning, the bodies of the dead were buried according to all the canons, and the ministers of the church confirm this.  Of course, a photo of a church made of bones in the Czech Republic is shocking and disturbing.  However, it is worth remembering that this is a historical monument, which has no equal in the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.private-prague-guide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kutna Gora Temple" class="if uuid-3230351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3230351.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is located </h2><p>  The ossuary, or, in other words, the Church of All Saints, is located in Siedlce.  This is one of the districts of the town of Kutna Hora, which also has an interesting and rich history.  Arriving in the town, you can use local public transport.  A city bus ride takes about ten minutes.  And you can, armed with a good mood, walk independently on foot.  All signs and maps are conveniently located on the city streets with free access for everyone. </p><p>  Almost all the locals know how to get to the temple from the bones in the Czech Republic.  First of all, the shortest way to the temple surroundings lies through Prague.  Having landed in the Czech capital, use one of the methods convenient and familiar to you. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="49.95243139999999" data-lng="15.268653599999993" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/7/7/8/17778.png"></div><h2>  A train </h2><p>  Since the temple is located in the Czech city of Kutna Hora, you must first get to it.

Contrary to popular belief about the splendor of the ossuary, some travelers claim to have expected more from this attraction than it actually is.  They were delighted and surprised by the Cathedral of St. Barbara, which initially seemed to tourists not worthy of special attention.  In addition, silver mines, which are located near the temple, are an obligatory place to visit.  With them, travelers recommend taking still water and a light snack on the road.  Well, on the spot you can go to any cafe and taste the local cuisine. </p>
