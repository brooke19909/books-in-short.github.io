    <p>  It is positive that the owner of the hotel complex most of the time he is present in it: tastes food, checks the operation of services.  Such continuous control, of course, helps to improve the quality of staff work. </p><p>  However, against the background of friendly reviews of tourists, there is a place for recommendations that contribute to improving the quality of leisure.  This is a tip - to fix broken fitness equipment and to establish the full-fledged work of the gym.  Tourists also make serious comments regarding the quality of hotel animation.  The transfer of newly arrived tourists to the hotel requires revision.  2.5 hours at a distance of 95 km - this is certainly a bit much. </p>
