    <p>  <strong>Ancient Russia: culture and its features before the <span>adoption of Christianity</span> and after</strong> </p><p>  As you know, the ancient state was subordinate to the pagan religion, as a result of which we can talk about several characteristic features of that society.  Firstly, oral folk art prevailed.  It was then that the epics, songs and tales began to arise.  People passed from generation to generation the most important information that has survived to this day.  Secondly, wooden architecture was developed.  Then in Russia there were no stone buildings, but after the whole world there were strong wooden temples and huts.  Thirdly, there were no written sources.  Yes, before the adoption of the new faith, such monuments of art were not on the territory of our country.  Fourth, there were a lot of <span>pagan gods.</span>  Features of the <span>culture of Ancient Russia</span> after the adoption of Christianity have changed a lot: </p><ul><li>  book business appeared and great literary works began to appear actively; </li><li>  stone architecture began to develop (the most striking example is St. Sophia Cathedral in Kiev, which was built in honor of the defeat of the Pechenegs); </li><li>  new, non-existent, art forms appeared - fine, as well as jewelry. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of culture of ancient Russia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10508/218155.jpg" width="326"></div></li></ul><p>  <strong>Ancient Russia: culture and its embodiment</strong> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The whole culture of that time can be conditionally divided into three areas: this is writing, architecture and art.  So, let's start with the literature.  The first kind of messages to each other (and this can be called the emergence of <span>literary works)</span> were found in Novgorod, where they were called <span>birch bark letters.</span>  After the adoption of Christianity, the <span>Tale of Bygone Years appeared, the</span> Illarionov's ‚ÄúWord of Law and Grace‚Äù, as well as the ‚ÄúOstromir Gospel‚Äù (attributed to the scribe Gregory).  In addition, one cannot help but recall the fact that the alphabet was created by the great brothers Cyril and Methodius, also at that time.  The history of the culture of Ancient Russia, in particular, stone architecture, is the richest heritage of the whole country.  What are the examples of the cross-domed style: <span>St. Sophia Cathedrals in Novgorod</span> and Kiev and the Kiev-Pechersky Monastery.  One cannot but recall the single-domed creations of Andrei Bogolyubsky: the Assumption and Dmitrov Cathedrals, the Golden Gate, the Church of the Intercession on the Nerl.  All this is the property of our homeland.  As for the fine arts, here it is worth mentioning such creations as the mosaic ‚ÄúOur Lady of Orant‚Äù, the icon ‚ÄúAnnunciation of Ustyug‚Äù, as well as the fresco ‚ÄúProphet Zachary‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="features of the culture of ancient Russia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10508/218150.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <p>  Thus, Ancient Russia, whose culture laid the foundations for the development of the Russian soul, became an example for subsequent creators.  We study her works and enjoy the achievements of that time so far, and this is one of the main reasons to be proud of our history. </p>
