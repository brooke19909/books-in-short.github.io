    <p>  There are many historical events associated with this city, so another place that Belarus is known to the whole world is Brest.  The sights of the city are headed by the famous Brest Fortress, whose defenders detained the German invaders for several months.  During the war, the fortress was almost destroyed, but now there is a grand memorial in memory of the defenders of the motherland.  In 1965, the fortress was awarded the title Hero Fortress and the Golden Star Award. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The memorial consists of a whole architectural and artistic ensemble, it includes monumental sculptures, battlefields and the old fortress itself.  Also, in the part of the defensive barracks, a museum was equipped.  The main entrance of the Brest Fortress is crowned with a five-pointed star, and on both sides of it you can see the casemates of the main shaft.  In the east, some stone fragments of the buildings of Brest-Litovsk are preserved, which are one with the defensive barracks, the White Palace and the Ceremonial Square.  In the very center of the ensemble there is a huge burial place, where the remains of more than 800 soldiers are buried, the grave was erected in the form of 3 tiers of memorial plates. </p><h2>  Ancient sights of Belarus: castles </h2>

    <p>  It is impossible to ignore the incredibly beautiful and magnificent castles, which are numerous in the country.  If we consider the main attractions of Belarus, the first thing worth mentioning is the Rumyantsev-Paskevich Palace in Gomel.  Peter Rumyantsev was a famous military man, and the best architects of that time worked on his castle: Moscepanov, Blank and others.  The building offers a magnificent view, as it is located on the banks of the Sozh River. </p><p>  The castle is famous for the rarest collections of art collected by the general.  Therefore, after his death, the castle gradually became a museum.  During the Second World War, all valuables were taken out of the building.  Initially, there were about 8 thousand, but only 200 units returned home.  The collections contain the most incredible things, from ancient coins and things of the Rumyantsev family itself to marine organisms and ancient books. </p><h2>  Mir Castle </h2>

    <p>  The name of the castle comes from the village of Mir, where this magnificent building is located.  Not all the sights of Belarus can boast such an achievement as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but Mir Castle has received such an honor.  The castle-fortress had several owners: Ilyinichi, then Radziwills, Wittgenstein and, finally, Svyatopolk-Mirsky, the last owners. </p><p>  However, after 1940 the castle passed into state ownership, so it was made the National Art Museum of Belarus.  Today the building is being reconstructed, however, some of its parts are still available for visiting. </p><h2>  Lida Castle </h2><p>  The castle was built by special order of Prince Gediminas in the city of Lida.  Construction began in 1323 on a hill between the Kamenka and Lidea rivers.  The ancient history, which is famous for almost all the sights of Belarus, also affected Lida Castle.  He was besieged many times, but the fortress survived.  But in the 18th century the castle lost its former strategic importance and gradually began to crumble. </p><p>  Lida Castle is built of brick and rubble stone, and in shape is an irregular quadrangle crowned with towers.  A whole infrastructure existed on the territory of the fortress: churches, a court, an archive, and various outbuildings were built here.  Living rooms were located in towers on the upper floors. </p>

    <p>  Since 1384, the castle was repeatedly attacked: first by the crusaders, then by the Crimean Tatars, and in 1659 the Russian soldiers captured the fortress.  After 50 years, the Northern War began, and the castle was again destroyed, but by the Swedes who blew up the towers. </p><h2>  Grodno Castle </h2><p>  Famous sights of the cities of Belarus do not leave indifferent any visitor, and castles have especially succeeded in this.  One of the most powerful, Grodno, was built during the time of the Crusades, but reached its peak during the time of Stefan Batory, when it was rebuilt and restored many times.  Like Lida Castle, Grodno was subjected to numerous attacks by the crusaders, however, despite the numerical superiority and efforts of the invaders, they failed to take the fortress. </p><p>  At that time, the castle was considered an incredibly strong building, able to withstand any siege.  The fortress was erected around the perimeter of the mountain, and the walls formed an irregular triangle.  5 towers were built in the castle: 3 square, 1 round, as well as a vezha-brahma. </p><p>  As a result, after all the attacks and perestroika, only fragments of a monumental structure survived to our time: the ruins of the Upper and Lower Church, the palace itself, parts of the defensive walls, princely chambers, and also the bridge. </p><h2>  Nesvizh Castle </h2><p>  If you are going to visit the Minsk region, be sure to pay attention to the majestic and mysterious sights of Belarus - Nesvizh Castle.  This building is a palace and castle complex and is located in the city of Nesvizh, as you might guess from the name. </p><p>  The architect of the castle was the Italian Giovanni Bernardoni.  Moreover, the owner of the castle trusted his experience and talent so much that he calmly went on a pilgrimage to Palestine, fully entrusting the construction of Giovanni. </p><p>  The castle was erected on a peninsula near the river Ushi.  Also, the castle was protected by two ponds and a moat, so that it was possible to get to the fortress only through a wooden bridge, which in any danger could be easily dismantled. </p><p>  At one time, Nesvizh Castle was a real cultural center, and now it is one of the favorite attractions of tourists, because the fortress still looks impregnable and majestic. </p>
