Previously, about 5 thousand people lived in the village.  But this does not take into account the rapidly built residential complexes over the past few years: Garden Park Edalgo, Edalgo. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews about the complex </h2><p>  The already fully built and commissioned Garden Park Edalgo residential complex has mostly positive reviews.  The developer offers everyone in the immediate vicinity of the Moscow Ring Road business-class housing, not inferior to the capital.  Therefore, everyone who decided to move from a stuffy, gas-filled metropolis to the suburbs does not feel restrained in anything.  This also affects their comments on social networks and on the official website of the developer. </p><p>  Kommunarka is a very promising area for further construction, the residents of which receive Moscow registration.  By the way, not far from the residential complex, construction of metro stations is underway, the social infrastructure in the village is developing more and more.  After all, this <span>residential complex</span> is not the only one, in the immediate vicinity of it many more houses of other <span>residential complexes</span> are being built. </p><p>  Some residents complain that the Kaluga highway is very busy, especially at rush hour.  And that on personal vehicles, that on public sometimes to get to the city is not easy. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  It is not even worth discussing the benefits of living in this particular residential complex.  The distance from the metropolis, from the Moscow Ring Road, the location near Butovo Forest Park - all this makes it possible for residents of the complex to inhale clean air, not exhaust gases.  Kaluga highway passes nearby, but the harm from it is incommensurably less than, for example, from millions of cars in the capital. </p><h2>  About the developer </h2><p>  The developer of LCD Garden Garden Edalgo is the KROST concern.  This company has existed for a long time and was one of the first to appear on the building construction market.  KROST mainly implements the city-in-city projects.  In Moscow and the Moscow region in various places you can see the projects of the company already implemented.  At the same time, only the most advanced technologies and all the best achievements in this area are used in construction. </p><p>  The designers of the concern were the first to propose and began to implement the concept of “a courtyard without cars”, which allows you to protect the leisure of children in the yard and turns it into a truly paradise, where you can safely walk without breathing exhaust fumes.  In addition, when designing, an indispensable condition is the landscape decoration of courtyards, which allows the developer to provide their future customers with maximum comfort. </p><h2>  The embodiment of the ideas of the developer </h2><p>  The developer pays special attention to the issue of parenting.  Therefore, together with residential buildings, the plans of the complexes at the same time include equipping them with innovative kindergartens and schools.  Moreover, the latter are built with bright facades that attract attention, with bright spacious rooms, equipped with the most modern technological devices.  Together, this is intended to develop the child's interest in the educational and cognitive processes. </p><p>  Over the entire period of its existence in the construction market, the KROST concern has established itself as a reliable partner, embodying highly successful projects.  Every year, companies are awarded numerous prizes and awards.  To date, more than 450 objects have already been commissioned.  These are prestigious residential complexes, and business centers, and industrial facilities, and modern kindergartens and schools, and sports complexes, even churches of the Russian Orthodox Church. </p>
