    <h2>  Andrei Petrovich Kislov: birth </h2><p>  The boy‚Äôs parents met when the singer was a student at the Moscow Art Theater, and Kislov already helped the tutor of the course - Igor Zolotovitsky.  The novel developed rapidly.  Soon, a 19-year-old girl reported pregnancy.  The wedding took place in 2007, and two months later the couple had their firstborn.  The joyful event occurred in October, the 14th.  The name was selected according to the calendar.  The couple agreed: if a girl is born, it will be Gagarina, the boy - Kislov.  So the name problem was solved - Andrey Kislov. </p><p>  Difficult times began for the family.  The newlyweds rented housing on Krasnoselskaya Street, the baby's mother continued to study, and the father, who had to leave the Moscow Art Theater and focus on the film career, had to sit with the child.  Only at the age of 8 months the baby had a nanny.  Both temperamental, the couple often quarreled.  Everyone in the career did not work out quite well.  In 2010, the couple divorced, which was the logical conclusion of the conflict between two talented individuals who did not want to give in to each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the divorce, Andrei Kislov stayed with his mother, and his father only worried about one thing that they would not be allowed to meet.  But that did not happen.  Former spouses continue to communicate well, and at Eurovision, the son who accompanied her to Vienna, the new husband and Peter Kislov was the most sick singer. </p><h2>  Today </h2><p>  In 2013, Polina Gagarina met with photographer <span>Dmitry Iskhakov.</span>  A year later, the couple signed.  Iskhakov is a calm and very homely person.  Andrei Kislov considers him his adult friend, they have a great relationship.  Turns to him a boy by name.  They see their father on a regular basis.  In between filming, he takes his son for 2-3 days in his bachelor apartment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Andrey Petrovich Kislov" class="if" height="493" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/1699440.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Six-year-old Andrey Kislov for the first time took part in a fashion show, which was held in the GUM.  He showed off baby clothes at the Bosco Bambino show.  Mom was proud of her son, who felt completely relaxed on the podium.  The boy is in 3rd grade, loves tennis and goes to music school.  In 2016, there was talk of a possible participation of Andrei Kislov in the project ‚ÄúVoice.  Children ‚Äù, but so far he has only starred in the video for Polina Gagarina‚Äôs song‚Äú I Will Become the Sun ‚Äù.  The family is expected to replenish and, possibly, this is due to its absence in season 4.  Still to come. </p>
