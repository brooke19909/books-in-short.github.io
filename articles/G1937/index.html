    <p>  How to disable MTS Mobile Assistant?  Here you are able to choose the solution to the problem yourself.  For a private client, it would be better to call the operator at 0890 and inform about their intentions.  There, they will quickly fill out an application for you and complete this process. </p><p>  But <span>corporate clients are</span> preferable to choose between a personal visit to the MTS office and sending an electronic request.  In the first case, as with the connection, you will have to directly fill out the application and give it to the store employee.  In the second, the questionnaire is sent directly by e-mail.  Next, wait for the request to be processed.  If you personally come to the mobile phone salon, then the process will take you about 10 minutes.  Otherwise, disabling the "Mobile Assistant" may take 1 day. </p><h2>  Service Opinions </h2><p>  At MTS, the customer self-service service receives mixed reviews.  Some people like him, but some don't.  The vast majority of users still prefer to work with the "Mobile Assistant" to a minimum.  And if possible, abandon it.  After all, as already mentioned, SMS requests and USSD commands are in great demand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile assistant pay pay bill details" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1128495.jpg"></div>

    <p>  But in some cases (especially if you have the time) the Mobile Assistant may be useful.  It is enough to study his menu well to quickly navigate when working.  Connect this service or not?  Each subscriber decides this independently.  But for most, the MTS Mobile Assistant seems redundant and unnecessary. </p>
