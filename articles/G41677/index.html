The Dorians were backward tribes that were at the stage of decomposition of tribal relations, but they were able to smelter iron, which gave them an advantage in wars with the Achaeans - the indigenous population, which had a higher level of civilization.  Having settled in Laconia, the territory of the Peloponnese peninsula, the Dorians founded Sparta - a city-state that at first was no different from other Greek policies. </p><h2>  From an ordinary policy to a barracks state </h2><p>  Until about the VI century BC.  e.  Spartans lived like other Greeks: they were engaged in craft, agriculture, trade, periodically fighting with neighboring policies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travels.co.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the emergence of the state in sparta reform of Lycurgus" class="if uuid-2569281" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39409/2569281.jpg"></div><p>  However, soon in their state there was a rapid decline in the level of material culture, and many crafts simply disappeared.  Craving for beautiful things began to be considered as indecent for a real Spartan and even anti-social.  In the history of the policy came a turning point, when, in fact, it turned into a barracks state. </p><p>  He was distinguished, on the one hand, by his desire to push other Greek policies, and, on the other, by a policy of extreme self-isolation.  Sparta unceremoniously interfered in the affairs of other city-states, wanting to establish its hegemony.  Military power and internal stability were combined with cultural and economic backwardness.  Such changes were associated with the reforms of Lycurgus, which is considered the founder of Spartan statehood. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Legendary legislator </h2><p>  Historians know about the life of Lycurgus only from the writings of ancient Greek authors.  This evidence is sometimes so contradictory that some researchers even question the very existence of the Spartan legislator.  Disputes are being held not only around Lycurgus‚Äôs reforms, which are summarized below, but also about the timing of their implementation. </p><p>  It is believed that the legendary legislator came from the royal family.  He carried out a series of reforms that changed the Spartan state.  It is known that Lycurgus received a favorable prediction from the Delphic oracle regarding his lawmaking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fineartamerica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sparta Lycurg reforms" class="if uuid-2569276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39409/2569276.jpg"></div><p>  And although at first not everyone in Sparta agreed with the reformer, but in the end the changes were accepted by the majority of citizens. </p><p>  By that time, the Spartans had already conquered Messiah - a vast area west of Laconia, enslaving the local population.  Therefore, Spartan society inevitably had to acquire all the features of a military camp, ready at any moment to crush the rebellion of slaves.  This is precisely what Lycurgus‚Äôs reforms in Sparta were aimed at. </p><h2>  Briefly about the social structure </h2><p>  According to the laws introduced by <span>Lycurgus, Spartan</span> society was divided into three social groups: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  The Spartians are the descendants of the conquerors of the Dorians, full citizens of the state. </li><li>  The Perieks are descendants of the Achaeans, the indigenous population of Laconia, who retained personal freedom, but did not take part in governance.  They lived outside the polis and provided the Spartans with the necessary crafts. </li><li>  Helots are state slaves, descendants of the conquered Achaeans. </li></ol><p>  The Spartans ruled and fought, the Perieks paid taxes and were engaged in crafts, the Helots - in agriculture.  In the V century BC, approximately: </p><ul><li>  9 thousand Spartiats; </li><li>  40 thousand periods </li><li>  140 thousand helots. </li></ul><p>  This imbalance predetermined the cruel attitude towards slaves that existed in the society of Ancient Sparta.  Representatives of the ruling social class were constantly afraid of a large-scale uprising of the Helots.  Therefore, once a year games were held during which young men from the Spartan camps declared war on slaves, after which the extermination of the latter began.  So, according to their mentors, two goals were achieved: </p><ul><li>  the number of helots was under control; </li><li>  future soldiers were instilled with a ‚Äútaste‚Äù for war. </li></ul><h2>  Unique Ancient Greek Policy </h2><p>  Sparta was a completely unusual state, more like a military camp.  About the endurance of the Spartans there were legends that have survived to this day. </p><p>  From the age of 12, young people took part in campaigns.  It is noteworthy that, according to the laws of Lycurgus, there were uniform rules for all citizens, whether it was a simple Spartiate or a king.  By the way, the military training of the latter was no different from the training of ordinary citizens.  They did not live in luxury and did not taste the best dishes like the rulers of other states. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="U8h6ebM3sE0" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8h6ebM3sE0" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/4/7/6/2/4762.jpg"></div><p>  It can be argued that absolute equality reigned among the citizens of the policy, which makes Sparta a unique state in the history of human civilization.  Such a public order was established by the reforms of Lycurgus and continued to be maintained after his death. </p><h2>  Control system </h2><p>  Barracks society was consistent with its internal structure, which also did not bypass Lycurgus reform.  In Sparta, the <span>emergence of a</span> military <span>state</span> led to the domination of the slave-owning aristocracy, while the popular assembly did not play a big role in public life and convened from time to time.  Only full citizens from the age of 30 years participated in it.  It resolved issues of election of officials, disputes about succession to the throne, about alliance with other states, etc. </p><p>  At the head of Sparta were 2 kings, who served as priests, military leaders and judges, but did not have political power.  In addition, there was also a Council of 28 elders - representatives of noble families who had reached the age of 60.  Membership in the Council has been lifelong. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the real management of the state was in the hands of the ephors.  They were elected for a year and held an exceptional position in Spartan society.  Ephora made its decisions by a majority vote.  They were in charge of foreign policy, internal management and control over the activities of all officials, including the kings.  Ephors reported only to their successors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lycurg reform in Sparta where is it" class="if uuid-2569279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39409/2569279.jpg"></div><p>  This separation of powers led to the fact that the Spartan social system did not change for more than 400 years, which the Greeks of other policies admired, since there was no tyranny here. </p><h2>  Land issue </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the famous Spartan legislator lived more than 2500 years ago, historians still show a keen interest in his work.  Moreover, Lycurgus‚Äôs reforms are studied in the 5th grade of high school, which, undoubtedly, proves their importance not only for the society of Ancient Sparta, but also for European civilization as a whole.  What were these laws remarkable for? </p><p>  According to Lycurgus' reforms, in Sparta all the land was the property of the state.  And only full citizens had the opportunity to use it.  The fertile lands were divided into several thousand equal plots.  Each Spartiate received his allotment by lot.  True, he was not allowed to cultivate the plot by law.  Helots were used for this. </p><p>  In addition, citizens were forbidden to engage in crafts and trade.  As a result of such restrictions, none of the Spartans could get rich, therefore, in no way could stand out from the society of equals.  Moreover, even full citizens of the policy dressed equally. </p><h2>  Measures against hoarding </h2><p>  The Spartan money itself, which, according to Lycurgus‚Äôs reforms, was big and heavy, hindered the desire to get rich.  They were minted not of gold or silver, as in other ancient states, but of iron and copper.  Therefore, it is unlikely that anyone would be tempted to steal them or make them a means of accumulating wealth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thalamofilakas.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lycurgus reforms" class="if uuid-2569273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39409/2569273.jpg"></div><p>  Lycurgus also brought Sparta out of the Greek market, since iron money in other states was not in circulation.  From this desire for equalization, the economic life of the polis has been in decline for centuries.  On the other hand, the laws allowed the Spartans to steal other people's things with impunity. </p><h2>  Education system </h2><p>  The state intervened in the personal lives of citizens, while parental feelings were not taken into account.  If a child was born in the family, the most important question was how valuable it would be for the state. </p><p>  In accordance with the reforms of Lycurgus, in Sparta, the education system was divided into three age stages: </p><ul><li>  from 7 to 12 years; </li><li>  from 12 to 20; </li><li>  from 20 to 30. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="worldhistoryvolume.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the battle of Kadesh of the Lycurg reform in Sparta" class="if uuid-2569291" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39409/2569291.jpg"></div><p>  The state actually subordinated the process of raising children to its military needs.  At the age of 7, boys were taken from their families to camps divided into groups.  The main qualities that were brought up in a little Spartan are unquestioning obedience, perseverance, endurance and the desire to win at any cost.  They were taught to endure pain, not to cry, to remain silent for a long time, but to speak briefly. </p><p>  At the age of 12, teenagers joined groups under the supervision of older youths.  At this stage, the Spartans learned to own weapons, act as a phalanx, got acquainted with the tactics of battle.  One of the last exams for all young Spartans was to kill a slave at night.  Moreover, the main thing in this ritual was not the murder itself, but the ability not to get caught.  Otherwise, the examinee would face severe punishment. </p><h2>  Hoplites of Sparta </h2><p>  By the age of 18, young men became warriors (hoplites) and could marry, but they were allowed to spend only nights with their wife.  Compulsory military education ended at 30, when the Spartan became a full citizen of the policy. </p><p>  The heavily armed hoplites, whose equipment weighed 30 kg, entered the phalanx, which consisted of 8 thousand people and was divided into 8 lines.  In fact, the war was a rest for the Spartans from preparing for it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.quora.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sparta Lycurg reforms" class="if uuid-2569282" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39409/2569282.jpg"></div><p>  However, the girls also did not sit locked up.  They were divided into units in which they practiced throwing spears and discs, wrestling, and running.  Such exercises were not inferior to men's ones in complexity.  Therefore, Spartan women were famous for their physical strength. </p><p>  In repelling the Persian invasion (5th century BC), Sparta played a huge role.  Her army was led by the Greek army.  The high combat readiness of the hoplites is the result of Lycurgus's reforms in Sparta.  Many people know where this happened, that is, where the battle preserved in the annals of history took place.  This is a battle at Thermopylae, in which three hundred Spartans led by Tsar Leonid stopped a huge army of Persians at the cost of their lives. </p><h2>  The flip side of the coin </h2><p>  In the entire history of the existence of the Spartan state, there was not a single cultural figure here, which strikingly distinguished him from other Greek policies, especially Athens.  The Spartans were literate only enough to read the commander‚Äôs order and sign the document if required. </p><p>  While speaker competitions were held regularly in Athens, in Sparta, on the contrary, speaking beautifully and was considered a sign of poor education.  Its citizens spoke little, and their thoughts were stated briefly and clearly, that is, succinctly.  All this was also a consequence of Lycurgus' reforms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.socialmatter.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lycurg reform 5 grade" class="if uuid-2569284" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39409/2569284.jpg"></div><p>  Having subordinated a large part of Greece in the 5th-4th centuries BC, the Spartans were unable to take on the burden of government because of their limited cultural level.  They were not adapted to peaceful life and the solution of its problems.  Because of this, there was a fall in all the foundations of the military society that formed after the reform of Lycurgus.  The emergence of Sparta and the features of its development led to stagnation in the political and socio-economic life of the policy. </p><h2>  Sunset statehood </h2><p>  The victory in the Peloponnesian war over Athens gave impetus to the development of commodity-money relations in Sparta, which led to the growth of social contradictions and property differentiation.  All this weakened the state from within.  Like other Greek policies, in the middle of the II century BC.  e.  it came under the rule of Rome. </p><p>  However, this did not mean complete oblivion.  And today, events of ancient history, such as the Battle of Kadesh and Lycurgus's reforms in Sparta, are of interest to those who are interested in Antiquity. </p>
