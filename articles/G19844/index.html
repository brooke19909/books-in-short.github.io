Do you want to sell real estate in 2015?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Is it worth selling real estate now?  Surely this issue worries a huge number of residents of our vast country.  One way or another, the crisis in the economy and the uncertainty of buyers' intentions to part with their savings in order to purchase housing today scare apartment sellers, as a result of which the real estate market is “marking time.” </p><p>  It must be emphasized that at present “cheap” and profitable offers for the sale of the choir did not appear, and what was significantly “dropped in price” was not in demand in the bulk. </p><h2>  Real Estate Market Situation </h2><p>  If you are seriously worried about whether it is worth selling real estate now, then be aware that most of the owners of "good" apartments are in no hurry to bargain with potential buyers.  However, revalued apartments continue to fall in price, which may ultimately lead to some upsurge in the market as a whole. </p><h2>  Profitable or not </h2><p>  Should I Sell Real Estate?  Now is 2015, because this question is really relevant. </p>

    <p>  Some owners of the apartments for sale boldly declare: “Let's contact you in six months and maybe I will make a final decision.”  What is the reason for this behavior?  Naturally, they cherish the hope that their apartments will rise in price after a certain period of time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The question of whether it is worth selling real estate now, especially worries investors.  Of course, they are forced to constantly "keep abreast" so as not to lose out after they invested in real estate. </p><h2>  Real estate market dynamics </h2><p>  The collapse of the ruble exchange rate could not but affect the mood in society, as this is one of the brightest indicators of the impending crisis.  Against this background, prices began to rise.  And, of course, the question of whether it is worth selling real estate now has become of paramount importance.  It is natural that the cost of apartments and houses should increase. </p>

    <p>  Experts note: over the past year, real estate prices increased by an average of 10%, economy class houses and apartments went up by 15%, premium apartments - by 9%. </p><p>  One way or another, but those who want to know whether it is worth selling real estate now must understand that there is a “reverse side” to the coin.  Currently, there is a decrease in activity on the market, which is gradually transforming into the “rest” stage.  This can be explained quite simply: Russians are wary of investing “their hard-earned money” in a house or apartment at such a difficult time.  As a result of this, demand in the real estate market today is low.  Thus, it is very difficult for the apartment seller to find “his” buyer.  It is easy to guess that over time, an increase in the number of offers will lead to a drop in prices. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  So is it worth selling real estate now or can you <span>postpone it?</span> </p>

    <p>  It should be noted that at present, analysts have expressed several points of view on this subject, which are radically different from each other.  We will talk more about this later. </p><h2>  Sellers of apartments in Moscow and St. Petersburg can profitably sell real estate </h2><p>  Some experts confidently declare that the dynamics of falling prices for apartments and houses is in the initial stage, and it touched far from all Russian regions.  If we talk about large megacities, then the value of real estate in them, on the contrary, has increased, although not so significantly.  It turns out that for residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg the question is: “Is it worth selling real estate now - in 2015?”  resolved.  Of course, yes, otherwise later on you can simply miscalculate. </p><h2>  Do not rush with the purchase of housing </h2><p>  Another part of analysts is of the opinion that strong fluctuations will not affect the real estate market.  Residential apartments, as before, will remain in the status of a "reliable" asset, which subsequently pays off "more than". </p>

    <p>  One way or another, but citizens who are interested in the question of whether to sell real estate in 2015 will be interested to know that market demand will remain minimal, and these individual buyers will not rush to buy a home.  Thus, it makes sense to postpone the purchase of an apartment or real estate.  However, in any case, most people do not abandon the idea that the property is a profitable investment.  On the other hand, few dare to accurately predict when the economic crisis will come to an end.  Against this background, many analysts fear a repeat of the 2008 scenario. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  New property tax </h2><p>  Not sure if selling property is worth it?  In 2015, amendments to the law come into force, which introduce a new property tax.  This fact is also an additional justification of why the demand for residential apartments decreased. </p><h2>  What should be focused on potential home sellers </h2><p>  Today, authoritative analysts of the Russian real estate market have developed several recommendations on whether to sell real estate in a crisis. </p>

    <p>  In their opinion, housing will rise in price, but not by much - on average from 1 to 3%.  It should be noted the decrease in the number of buyers for “mansions” of the business and premium categories, since the new real estate tax will be calculated taking into account the cadastral value of the property. </p><p>  Do not have the slightest idea about whether to sell real estate now?  In 2015, potential sellers of residential apartments need to be mentally prepared for the fact that prices for apartments and houses will fall by an average of 10-15%. </p><p>  Instability in the Russian real estate market will prevail at least until the summer of this year. </p><h2>  The conditions under which it is advisable to sell an apartment </h2><p>  Experts have identified several conditions when it makes sense to sell residential apartments in a crisis. </p>

    <p>  Firstly, we are talking about a situation where the seller immediately invests capital in another property.  Secondly, if a cheap apartment in a new building is for sale.  Thirdly, if the seller urgently needs a large amount of cash.  It is also necessary to take into account the fact that procrastination should not be delayed: the maximum period is the first two months of the current year.  In other cases, it is better to wait a while with the sale of a house or apartment, otherwise you can lose about 15% of the real value of the object. </p><h2>  What is important to remember </h2><p>  Today, the deal will look absolutely unprofitable today, under the terms of which the apartment will be sold, and the money earned for it will be placed on a bank deposit, and the seller intends to use them after some time.  In any case, a residential real estate object is a stable asset, and after the end of the economic crisis it will bring “real” profit, but the financial capital received for the sale may depreciate in a short time, especially against the background of a constantly falling ruble rate. </p>

    <p>  It must be emphasized that at present the “construction boom” in our country continues, and the demand for new buildings remains unchanged.  However, experts are confident that during the period of economic instability, activity in the <span>secondary</span> real estate <span>market</span> will be low.  In any case, this does not mean that you need to try to find a buyer for your apartment as soon as possible - after the crisis, the situation will straighten out. </p><p>  When deciding whether to sell real estate now, one important thing to keep in mind is that the market is cyclical, the recession is followed by a rise, and therefore, after the crisis, the seller has every chance of selling his apartment more expensive. </p><h2>  Three postulates on which the real estate market is based </h2><p>  There are several factors that determine the development of the real estate market: </p><p>  1. A home-based business determines supply and demand.  Naturally, when there is no first, it makes no sense to work on the second.  Any reputable realtor can competently analyze the situation and figure out for yourself what are the real chances of making a deal profitably.  If the owner of the apartment does not want to sell his property 20% lower than the real value or even lower than the cost, then an experienced real estate agent will understand that it is hardly worth the effort and time to spend on such a deal. </p><p>  2. Work in the real estate market is also determined by causal relationships.  In other words, a sharp decline in activity leads to a collapse in prices, so you should not expect a quick recovery in the market. </p><p>  3. The real estate market is cyclical: the recession goes up, and then the recession sets in again.  Given this factor, you can always calculate approximately when housing will go up or down. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Of course, each for himself decides whether to sell real estate.  Now 2015, at this difficult time from an economic point of view, one cannot fully rely on the statistics provided on forums and portals.  As a rule, they publish information that is beneficial to a particular person.  Also, one should not completely believe in rumors, especially when it comes to a deal amounting to several tens of thousands of dollars. </p><p>  Each homeowner should understand that at present those apartments that are faultless in their basic parameters and for which they are asking for an “adequate” price are selling well. </p>
