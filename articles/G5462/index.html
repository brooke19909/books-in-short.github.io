    <p>  As for the weather conditions in the city, they are due to its location in the temperate climatic zone.  The winters are cold, the summer months are warm and sometimes hot.  Spring and autumn in Cherepovets are characterized by frequent rain and cloud cover. </p><h2>  History of Cherepovets </h2><p>  According to archaeologists, as early as the second millennium BC.  e.  there were settlements in the place where today Cherepovets is located.  What <span>area it</span> was in those days, you should not even think about it, since it is not known what territorial division was then.  However, the first written records of this settlement date back to the 15th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the IX-X centuries on the right bank of the Sheksna there was a city, which later turned into a modern Cherepovets.  In 1360, the Resurrection Monastery was founded on its territory, around which a peculiar trading and economic center was formed.  In 1777, Empress Catherine issued a decree according to which Cherepovets received city status. </p><p>  As for the name, there are several versions of its appearance.  According to one of them, Cherepoves is the Finnish name for the settlement, which means ‚Äútribe on the Fish Mountain‚Äù.  The last, apparently, was the Cathedral Hill.  Specialists in the Old Russian language translated this name as "settlement on a hill."  Which of these versions to believe, everyone decides for himself.  Although for a modern person, to get acquainted with this city, it will be enough to find out in what area Cherepovets is and visit it. </p>

    <h2>  Famous personalities of the city </h2><p>  Like all of Russia, the <span>Vologda Oblast,</span> Cherepovets, among other things, has become the birthplace of famous personalities that have been proud of more than one generation.  Among them A. Alekseeva is a drawing teacher in Cherepovets.  On her initiative, art and music schools were opened in the city.  In addition, she made a great contribution to the development of local history.  The name Alekseeva A.A. today bears the Cherepovets Palace of Children and Youth Creativity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Residents of the city are proud of the Heroes of the Great Patriotic War, whose birthplace is Cherepovets.  What area is it, in those days it did not matter, the main thing is that all the cities were able to maintain their independence.  Among the famous people of that period are the navigator Malygin, the pilot V.I. Shchelkunov, A. Rumyantsev, M. Sorokin and many others. </p><h2>  Cherepovets areas </h2><p>  The city consists of five districts: Northern, Industrial, Central, Zarechensky and Zasheksninsky.  The oldest of them is Industrial.  Many houses here were erected in the Stalin era.  It is in this area that such streets as Metallurgov, Vereshchagina, Sovetsky Prospekt and Lunacharsky are located.  The city administration and federal institutions are concentrated in it. </p><p>  From the Industrial District through the Oktyabrsky Bridge you can get to Zasheksninsky.  By the way, this crossing is the first cable-stayed bridge in Russia.  Zasheksninsky is a <span>sleeping area.</span>  Its advantage is a more cheerful appearance, because the houses here are more modern and colorful. </p>

    <p>  Zarechensky differs from many other areas of the city in good ecology, since it is located far from the industrial enterprises that Cherepovets has on its territory.  What area is this, many know only because the largest Severstal enterprise operates here.  But, fortunately, it is far from Zarechensky.  Severny is the youngest and smallest district of the city, but the level of its development is very low. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  City industry </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the most famous and powerful company in the city is Severstal CJSC.  This holding combines three industries: metallurgy, resource and engineering.  The company provides jobs and high salaries to most of the city‚Äôs population.  In addition, Severstal employees are provided with good social protection.  Although it is worth noting that the requirements for them are quite high. </p><p>  Among the largest enterprises of Cherepovets can also be attributed CJSC Metal Processing Plant No. 17, which produces galvanized reinforcing profiles for PVC windows, as well as special profiles used in engineering, shipbuilding and many other fields. </p><p>  Another powerful manufacturing complex is PhosAgro.  This company is engaged in the manufacture of chemical products, including phosphorus fertilizers.  Thousands of people are employed here, whose place of residence is the city of Cherepovets.  It is hard to even say which region has more enterprises on its territory than the Vologda region, and most of them are concentrated in Cherepovets. </p>
