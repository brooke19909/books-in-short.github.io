    <p>  Located on the Vltava River, the historical center of Prague attracts millions of tourists every year.  The magical Old Town, the royal Hradcany, the charming Small Country are places that are unforgettable and most visited by tourists coming to the Czech capital. </p><h2>  Old Town Square and Old Town Hall </h2><p>  The city received royal permission to build its own town hall, and it was completed in 1338.  Of course, a tower is a striking attraction for tourists.  Its most popular aspect is the astronomical clock and calendar, in which during the day at certain times windows open and you can watch the procession of the apostles. </p><h2>  The Charles Bridge </h2><p>  Originally, the wooden bridge structure was washed away during the flood and replaced by a more solid stone structure, which became known as the Judith Bridge.  It was decorated and further renamed in honor of King <span>Charles IV.</span>  <span>Charles</span> Bridge has 30 statues of saints (15 on each side), each with its own history. </p><p>  On Charles Bridge you can see crowds of tourists who want to touch the plate on the statue of Jan Nepomuk (there is a sign that this is for luck).  The statue commemorates the saint, who was the Queen's confessor and was dropped from the bridge for refusing to reveal the sacrament of confession to the king. </p>

    <p>  Next to the Charles Bridge on the side of the Old Town is a group of buildings, including: The Old Town Water Tower (with clock) and the Bed≈ôich Smetana Museum.  This is a great place for a cup of coffee and panoramic shots of Charles Bridge with Prague Castle in the background. </p><h2>  Church of St. Nicholas </h2><p>  St. Nicholas Church is the most famous baroque church in Prague.  Construction began when the Jesuits chose the plans for Giovanni Dominic Orsi in 1673 and lasted about a hundred years. </p><p>  The Jesuit Thomas Schwartz in 1747 built the main organ in it, which has 4 thousand pipes.  Mozart himself played this organ during his stay in Prague.  St. Nicholas Church in Prague is also the venue for chamber music concerts. </p><h2>  Prague Castle and the Old Royal Palace </h2><p>  The Royal Palace is one of the original buildings in the castle complex, adjacent to the Chapel of All Saints.  In 1483, King Vladislav Jagiellon transferred the city court to Prague Castle and began the last large-scale reconstruction of the Old Royal Palace.  The complex was added to the hall of Vladislav in the late Gothic style, combined with fashionable elements of the Renaissance.  After the fire in 1541, the Sejm and the Church of All Saints were restored. </p><p>  The exit from the hall of Vladislav passes through the stairs of the riders, specially built for equestrian knights, so that they enter the room on horseback, to participate in knightly tournaments. </p><h2>  Hotel Juno 3 * (Prague) reviews </h2><p>  What do travelers say about the hotel?  The rooms of the hotel Juno 3 * (Prague), according to reviews, clean.  Freshly renovated in simple furnishings with comfortable large beds and windows.  Pros - a separate bathroom and toilet.  There is an opportunity to dine in the restaurant, with a good quality of served dishes, but the menu is limited.  According to the feedback from visitors, the positive thing is that the hotel is a 5-minute walk from the metro station, which is on schedule, and therefore you can get to the city center in 10 minutes.  Nearby is a Billa supermarket. </p><p>  Vacationers spoke well of the breakfast buffet in Prague Juno 3 * (Prague).  It was delicious, with a good selection of dishes, but with a negative point - juice packaged and diluted with water.  The staff of the complex is diligent and friendly.  There is free internet access in the lobby. </p><p>  On the other hand, guests did not like that there was no normal choice of restaurants and cafes near the hotel.  The shower drain was partially clogged and the quality of the toilet paper was extremely poor.  No soap and shampoo.  Some note that there was no hot water on the first day of settlement, but after complaints the problem was quickly fixed.  There is only one towel in the bathroom.  The view from the rooms overlooks apartment buildings and factories. </p><p>  There is no table in the rooms.  The rooms are cool due to insufficient sealing of the windows.  Super slow Wi-Fi, with a limited reception area, it was almost impossible for hotel guests to work normally. </p><p>  Another negative point was the stay at the hotel during national holidays.  The hotel was crowded with tourists, and despite two elevators, vacationers had to wait to go down or go up. </p><p>  There is a possibility to have dinner at the restaurant, but the menu is limited. </p><p>  This is a budget hotel, which is usually preferred by private travel agencies.  Many visitors note that the worst part is the culinary smell coming from the restaurant complex, and even penetrating the rooms on the upper floors.  All the clothes smelled, and this delivered a lot of unpleasant moments to the guests.  In addition, a large crowd gathers at the restaurant during breakfast.  Two elevators are not enough, it takes too long to wait.  The staff practically does not speak English, although this is stated in the provided hotel services. </p><p>  All rooms of the Juno 3 * hotel are simple, but with a fresh repair.  Equipped with new furniture and have a private bathroom with shower, toilet, satellite TV, direct dial telephone and safe.  Numbers are locked by electronic locking system.  The hotel is located close to the main tourist attractions of Prague with convenient transport interchange.  In general, it will satisfy the unpretentious tastes and needs of guests. </p>
