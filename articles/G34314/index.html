One of these smartphones is the A706 state employee. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Quite often, a company brings small design highlights to its devices.  The device <span>"Lenovo A706"</span> also could not do without some correction of a bored look. </p><p>  The front side of the change has not been touched, it is difficult to distinguish it from the rest of the mass of phones, but the back panel has a glossy insert.  A similar solution significantly diluted the bored look of the ‚ÄúA‚Äù series. </p>

    <p>  In addition to inserting special changes in the device is not observed.  The case is made entirely of plastic, and not very high quality.  When compressed, the phone creaks, this suggests that the build quality is a little down. </p><p>  The location of the buttons and parts will not surprise a person who has already encountered Lenovo devices.  The display is adjacent to the camera, earpiece, sensors, and control buttons. </p><p>  The main camera, naturally with a flash, and the company logo were sheltered on the back side.  In addition, there is a speaker below.  There are no special changes besides the insert here. </p><p>  The left end of the <span>Lenovo A706</span> has a cable connection jack, and the right has a volume control.  At the top is the power button, as well as an input with a 3.5-inch headphone jack. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The device is made in several colors: black, white, and also pink. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Equipped the device with a diagonal of 4.5 inches in size with an IPS matrix.  This is quite enough for the Lenovo A706, but the quality of the display itself is poor.  It seems that it is not small for 2013, the screen received a resolution of only 854 x 480 pixels.  Accordingly, pixels are noticeable during operation, and this spoils the impression of the device. </p>

    <p>  In the sun, the screen also does not behave in the best way.  Even at the highest brightness, the display fades.  A good-quality viewing angle improves the impression a little, but overall the screen leaves much to be desired. </p><h2>  Filling </h2><p>  The MTK processor commonly used in Chinese devices was replaced by Qualcomm.  Better or worse it is for the Lenovo A706, it‚Äôs hard to say.  Each processor has its own advantages. </p><p>  The performance of the smartphone is pretty good for the budget <span>Lenovo A706.</span>  <span>The</span> processor frequency <span>characteristic</span> is 1.2 GHz.  This allows him to compete with newer inexpensive devices. </p><p>  In principle, the entire filling of the device corresponds to modern state employees.  There is a whole gigabyte of RAM, and this is an excellent indicator for a smartphone manufactured in 2013. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  But the internal memory fails slightly.  Only 4 gigabytes were installed, taking into account the cost of the system, there will remain about 3 GB available for use.  Of the remaining applications, only 1 GB is allocated, and 2 - for other needs.  Such a solution will significantly reduce the ability to install volume games and the number of programs. </p><p>  The ability to install flash cards on as much as 32 GB smooths out a little.  Having such a memory capacity, the user can be sure of the absence of braking and work problems. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The company announced performance indicators at 16 hours are somewhat exaggerated for the Lenovo A706.  The characteristic of the volume of the battery is as follows: only 2000 maH.  Given the screen and the entire filling of the device, you can expect about 5-6 hours of work without additional charge.  And in standby mode, with minimal use, the phone is able to work for a day. </p><p>  In general, the battery meets all the needs of the phone, but if desired, you can replace it with a more voluminous analogue. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  As always, the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù devices of the Lenovo company use a proprietary shell.  The device operates in version 4.1.2, which is pretty good for a smartphone of past years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Most advanced and modern programs may not start, but there will be plenty to choose applications for every taste.  In case of urgent need, it is possible to update the system to a new one, although the choice of firmware will be reduced to various assemblies. </p>

    <h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The main advantage of the phone is the work with several SIM cards.  Of course, it is difficult to surprise someone with such a feature, but the A706 has two radio modules. </p><p>  It is the connected modules that allow two SIM cards to work simultaneously.  For example, a user can immediately receive calls and use the Internet. </p><p>  Such a pleasant advantage is also supported by work with all the useful communication functions.  Quick connection of the device to GPS, the presence of Wi-Fi, as well as Bluetooth, sets the smartphone against the background. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The device has good sound due to the use of Dolby Digital with the Plus prefix.  The quality is really better both in the headphones and the speakers. </p><p>  Naturally, when comparing the sound of the A706 and recognized music leaders, the ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù loses.  But for a budget android is quite acceptable. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The present filling may seem rather mediocre, but the phone produces good results.  There is no lack of RAM or processing speed.  The device quickly and easily launches medium-demanding games, as well as applications. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  When shooting with ‚ÄúLenovo A706‚Äù the photos will turn out pretty decent, because the resolution of 2592 x 1944 is not bad for a state employee.  It‚Äôs even a little surprising that a camera with 5 megapixels has this quality. </p>

    <p>  Of course, there were some drawbacks: the noise suppressing filter robs the picture of small details. </p><p>  The device also has a front camera, but it is not capable of causing special enthusiasm.  The simplest camera for video communication without frills. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The delivery set is standard.  In the box, the buyer will see, in fact, the Lenovo A706 itself.  Instructions, headphones, a network adapter, a USB cable and a warranty card are included. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  Among all the advantages of the device, I would like to highlight the presence of a radio module that allows you to work with several cards. </p><p>  It should also be noted a good filling for a budget device.  In total, these advantages make the A706 an excellent smartphone to work with. </p><p>  An entertaining design can be noted in passing, which slightly distinguishes the smartphone from the general background.  In fact, all the advantages on this end. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The phone has about the same number of cons.  This includes a poor resolution display for such a diagonal and an average power battery. </p><p>  More minor will be the shortcomings of the camera and the small amount of internal memory. </p><p>  A tangible minus is the poor assembly of the device.  The creak and plastic of the case can scare away the buyer and lead to the choice of a more reliable phone in terms of quality. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  At one time, users appreciated the device.  The <span>Lenovo A706 reviews</span> were mostly positive.  Given that the smartphone was released in 2013, the ratio of cost and functionality pleased many. </p>

    <p>  There were grievances, but in most cases the problem was in the details.  Some owners did not like the small amount of memory or the quality of the screen. </p><p>  Now, with the advent of many budget devices, less and less people are inclined to choose the A706.  Most likely, this trend has developed due to the not-so-advanced camera and the bored appearance of the A-series devices. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Reviewing your ‚ÄúLenovo A706‚Äù review will not help.  After all, it is possible to come to certain conclusions only by feeling and testing the device yourself. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the device justifies its cost in full.  For everyday use and not the most demanding of user functions, the phone will come in handy. </p>
