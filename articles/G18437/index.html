    <h2>  13th district of Paris </h2><p>  <span>Another <span>sleeping area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe</span> city, which is suitable for budget accommodation of tourists.</span>  <span>By tradition, it is considered Asian, because many immigrants from China, Japan, Vietnam and Korea live here.</span>  <span>There are many inexpensive hotels and restaurants of oriental cuisine where you can quickly have a bite before a walk around the city.</span>  <span>Most of the territory here is occupied by high-rise buildings, in which people from working families live.</span>  <span>As a rule, this area is almost not visited by tourists, but it is considered calm and safe.</span>  <span>The 13th district of Paris is not distinguished by a large number of attractions.</span>  <span>By jumping here, you can take a look at the new building of the National Library, Paris</span> <span data-num="24">Chinatown</span> <span>, Tapestry Factory.</span>  <span>The only minus is the remoteness of the district from the historic city center.</span>  <span>If you decide to stay in this district, then choose hotels located in its northern part, and not in the</span> <span data-num="25">southern part.</span> </p><h2>  20th district </h2><p>  <span>As a rule, the most dangerous areas of Paris are located on the outskirts of the city.</span>  <span>Such is the 20th district, which is located in the east of the capital.</span>  <span>Historically, immigrants lived here.</span>  <span>At first it was considered a Jewish district, but in recent years, people from Arab countries have most often lived here.</span>  <span data-num="26">Housing</span> <span>in the district is very cheap, but it is dangerous to stay here, and getting to the city center is long and</span> <span data-num="27">costly.</span>  <span>As in other disadvantaged areas, it is dirty and noisy, and the crime rate is going off scale.</span>  <span>However, in recent years the situation has begun to improve, and the district itself has received developing status.</span>  <span>If you still decide to stay in the local hotels, we strongly recommend that you return to your room before dark.</span> </p>

    <h2>  In which area of ‚Äã‚ÄãParis is it better to stay? </h2><p>  <span>Without a doubt, the best districts of the city are those located near the historical center.</span>  <span>However,</span> <span data-num="28">housing</span> <span>there is very expensive, and not everyone can afford a chic room in a luxury hotel.</span>  <span>People looking for a budget place to stay choose sleeping areas, such as 9th or 13th.</span>  <span>For some, saving is more than safety, so they choose disadvantaged districts, but the number of such tourists is very small.</span>  <span>"What are the best areas for travelers in Paris?"</span>  <span>- often this question is asked by people who are going on a trip to France.</span>  <span>If you don‚Äôt have enough money to check into luxury hotels, then choose quiet and peaceful sleeping areas that border historic districts.</span> </p>
