International Consumer Society MPO "Kamena"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Financial pyramids are perhaps the most common variant of cheating unsuspecting users.  Only not everyone understands exactly how they operate.  Moreover, modern pyramids try to be encrypted so as not to arouse suspicion.  Not so long ago the Kamena company was published.  She began to receive negative and positive reviews almost immediately after the start of her work.  But what kind of company is this?  What does she do?  Is it possible to invest in it and make a profit?  About all this further.  After all, no one is exactly able to say whether the scam is in front of us, or the real way to profit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kamena reviews are negative" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227513.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  First meeting </h2><p>  To begin with, what do we learn about this company.  Kamena is an international <span>consumer society.</span>  What is it?  What does it do?  Why are many interested in them? </p><p>  Here you can answer very simply - everyone wants to get money without doing anything.  Or practically without any special effort.  And consumer societies offer just such services.  You invest money in them, and in return make a profit, as well as some special benefits and opportunities. </p><p>  For example, in our case, this is a specific business.  In the course of participating in the project, you will be able to accumulate profit not only in the form of money, but also in the quality of securities, jewelry and other similar components.  Here is such a non-standard approach to earnings at Kamena.  Should I believe all this? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Get in and live </h2><p>  It is very difficult to answer this question.  After all, you always want to believe only in the best.  And the fact that you can easily make money on the Internet, once investing in a particular company, too.  The MPE Kamena programs, as already mentioned, are of a somewhat specific nature.  Here you can find a variety of activities, as well as choose a special direction that you will support. </p><p>  However, this does not affect your earnings.  It is enough to invest money in a corporation only once, and you will immediately begin to receive passive profit.  And for life, nothing special needs to be done.  In principle, this is a scheme that has long been known to everyone.  Therefore, Kamena receives mixed reviews from investors.  On the one hand, there is every reason to believe that we are faced with an ordinary financial pyramid, on the other hand, you are given evidence of the real work of the corporation and its "subordinate" organizations.  This makes you think once again about investments and investments.  Maybe it‚Äôs really worth trusting, and then getting good money? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kamena investor reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227514.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  On the map </h2><p>  In principle, many do just that.  It is enough to check whether Kamena really exists.  Very often, a scam is not confirmed by any contacts, you can not find the head office of a corporation, it is impossible to get in touch with managers.  It‚Äôs either hard to do. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But "Kamena" (negative and positive reviews are presented to our attention) actually has an address.  This company, according to published information, has an office in Kazakhstan.  Here you can chat with the organization‚Äôs management.  In addition, now in Russia and many other countries its mini-branches are starting to open.  For each region there are detailed contacts that can be easily checked. </p><p>  It turns out that in fact, Kamena is an officially registered company.  And for an ordinary scam or money-laundering, such a technique is not used.  So you can still trust?  Honestly, some especially incredulous users try to check first all possible moments that can indicate fraud, and only after that they make a decision.  This is normal - scammers are developing every year more and more universal schemes that should inspire confidence among victims, learn to crank up their vile deeds so that there‚Äôs nothing to ‚Äúdig into‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="igo kamena pyramid" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227515.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Website </h2><p>  The official page of any company is its peculiar face.  Only here, many organizations simply do not really think about creating a site.  And if we are talking about deception, then even more so.  In this sense, Kamena receives negative reviews more often than positive ones.  Why is this so? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are reasons for that.  The thing is that the general appearance of the official page of this association, to put it mildly, is not credible.  All due to the fact that it is structured and not quite high quality.  Here you can find a lot of praise for the activities of the company, many illustrations and pictures, reviews and even contacts of branches around the world.  But here it will not be possible to detect essentially important information, as well as some important documents and confirmations of the official activities of the company.  Instead, you will see a vivid description of the benefits of Kamena. </p><p>  In addition, on the official page you can create a "My Account".  Kamena offers to go through a simple and free registration process to become a contributor and start making profits.  And rather big.  You will be lured by bright and promising phrases, as well as words about high interest rates.  This is a common move that fraudsters often use.  Remember this moment if you still do not know whether it is worth trusting the company or not. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="igo stone programs" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227516.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to make money </h2><p>  Well, you should also pay attention to the fact that our company today has a variety of ways to make a profit.  That is, you have the right not only to receive interest from your investments, but to somehow diversify your activities. </p><p>  For example, start your own business.  "Kamena" supports, as already mentioned, a variety of specific activities in which you can take part.  Of course, for all this you will make a profit.  Quite an interesting offer for those who do not just want to earn money, but also do something. </p><p>  MPO "Kamena" is a pyramid, moreover, a financial one.  So, how else can you get income from it?  That's right, from affiliate programs.  You invite new participants, and then interest on the profit of others is charged to your account.  A fairly common scheme that many projects use is not necessarily fraudulent.  In principle, everything is fair - you attract new investors, for this you get a reward.  This is a normal occurrence. </p><p>  Nevertheless, numerous promises of the company, which are expressed in high profits, should alert you.  About 10% of your investments in the project every month is now not a fairy tale, but reality.  Hence, some people have a desire to invest in the corporation more and more money.  And for the Kamena phenomenon of this kind, the feedback from investors most often earns negative.  This is too suspicious - such high interest rates, and on an ongoing basis.  Is there really another scam before us? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kamena International Consumer Society" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227517.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Does the project pay </h2><p>  To answer this question, it is enough to see if the project really pays you what you have earned.  After that, all doubts should simply be dispelled, it will immediately become clear whether it is possible to believe all those high-profile promises that are so widespread. </p><p>  One may find that Kamena is a deception, but very dexterous.  And indeed it is.  Indeed, in practice, you will not receive any money at all.  Earnings counters in your profile is the most common fake.  So before us is the usual financial pyramid, which is very cleverly hiding and conducting its activities. </p><p>  Investors note that all transfers that have been executed either disappear with time or they ‚Äúhang‚Äù in orders, but are never made.  It turns out that you are simply bred for money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal account of stone" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227519.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the positive </h2><p>  Well, then where does the Internet have so many positive opinions about this company?  Understanding everything is extremely simple - modern scammers buy reviews in order to attract a new audience. </p><p>  That is, someone pays someone for a lie.  Most often, the praise looks stereotyped; in fact, you will not see any useful information there.  Unless forged evidence in the form of screenshots from the screen, as well as videos.  This is a long-known scheme for everyone, which has long been working with great success. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  What conclusions can be drawn from all of the above?  "Kamena" receives negative reviews for a reason.  This is truly a project that is best avoided.  The financial pyramid is a great way to divorce gullible users for money.  This is precisely the scheme used in our society today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kamena cheating" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227518.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  It is also worth noting: officially, ‚ÄúKamena‚Äù burned out and collapsed in 2013.  Thus, joining the project, in principle, makes no sense.  If you do not want to be deceived, stay away from this society. </p>
