    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the Severnaya Hotel, travelers note not only positive aspects, but also some disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Having settled in the room, do not be surprised if some bulbs do not light; </li><li>  the sconce above the bed is located directly above the head, and therefore it is inconvenient to read and there is always a risk of bumping; </li><li>  although there is a free shuttle service to the mountain, you have to wait so long that it is easier to call a taxi; </li><li>  there are no air conditioners in the rooms, and only a small window opens on the window, and therefore the room is incredibly stuffy; </li><li>  the beds are very small, and therefore, if you have a large physique and high growth, then it will be very uncomfortable to sleep; </li><li>  spiky springs stick out from the mattress; </li><li>  the curtains on the windows are very short (above the window sill), and therefore they let in light and do not give you the opportunity to sleep longer in the morning; </li><li>  the TV works very poorly - the image is snowing, but the sound hisses and is interrupted; </li><li>  incredibly slippery tiles in the hall (it would not hurt to lay tracks); </li><li>  the water from the tap flows very muddy - it would not hurt to clean the pipes. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Guests of Kirovsk highly value the Severnaya hotel, which is why there are always plenty of guests here, and rooms must be booked in advance.  This is largely due to the incredibly convenient location.  There are mountains with ski slopes nearby.  By the way, the hotel provides a free shuttle to the descent.  In addition, it is the central part of the city, which opens up many opportunities for entertainment and business. </p><p>  The Severnaya Hotel (Kirovsk) provides its guests with excellent food.  The restaurant of this restaurant is famous for simply excellent food (even red fish and other delicacies are on the menu).  In the mornings, guests can enjoy a rich buffet.  This restaurant is liked not only by hotel guests, but also by the townspeople, which in itself is a positive feature.  The menu mainly contains European dishes, as well as traditional Russian cuisine. </p><p>  It should be noted that the title of the best hotel in the region, this institution received a well-deserved.  Despite the general simplicity in design, as well as in the list of services provided, it is incredibly comfortable and cozy here.  In addition, one cannot help but praise the staff who are ready to help you at any time.  Arriving here once, you will certainly want to return to this hotel again. </p>
