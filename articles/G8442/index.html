  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is the story of the creation of the Internet over?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Back in the sixties of the twentieth century, the Agency for Advanced Research Projects (ARPA) under the United States Department of Defense created the very first network, which was the prototype of the now-known global Internet.  The created network, called ARPAnet, was experimental, and it was created to support military research.  The basic principle of ARPAnet was considered the ability for any computer to contact any other computer connected to the network at any time.  Thus began the story of the creation of the Internet. </p><p>  Already in December 1969, four nodes were already integrated into the network, which used the NCP (Network Control Protocol) protocol to transmit data packets.  Ten years later, work began on the creation of the current and now TCP / IP protocol, when the experimental network ARPAnet in 1975 was declared operational. <br>  So, the history of the creation of the Internet began with the ARPAnet network, the development goal of which was initially the opportunity for all participants in military development not only to maintain communication over computer networks, but also to share the resources of all the few powerful computers that were available at that time, located in different cities of the country. </p><p>  These promising studies have attracted the attention of many research groups and individual researchers with whom DARPA has held numerous coordinating meetings.  The history of the creation of the Internet also suggests that a special Group for Internet Configuration and Management was created to coordinate and manage the development of Internet protocols, which lasted until its reorganization into the Internet Activity Group in 1983.  The need to create this group stems from the fact that so many researchers have already participated in the TCP / IP project. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The TCP / IP protocols in 1983 were adopted as military standards in the United States.  After this important step, which influenced the activity with which the history of the Internet in the world began to develop, all computers in ARPAnet, called hosts, began to be required to work only with these protocols.  It was at this time that the term Internet began to be used, which denoted both a separate MILNET network, which was an unclassified part of the DDN (Defense Data Network), and a new, greatly reduced in size ARPAnet.  Thus, the history of the emergence of the Internet is closely connected precisely with the ARPAnet network, which has become the prototype of the modern Internet. </p><p>  In 1985, the history of the Internet in the world received a new impetus: on the basis of ARPAnret, a new network was created, called the National Science Foundation NETwork (NSFNET), or the National Science Foundation Network, which connected the six largest research centers located at different ends America and equipped with powerful supercomputers.  The new network, called Internet TCP / IP or Internet, was created with the aim of organizing researchers from different universities in America access to the computing resources of supercomputers integrated into the Network so that every engineer and scientist in the country could have a connection to a single network, and already in 1985 the number of organizations connected to the network has increased dramatically. </p><p>  Many institutions, including educational and commercial ones, have discovered great opportunities for exchanging data that the new technology is fraught with.  A large number of computers connected to the Network overloaded the networks and control computers, so soon faster telephone lines were used to organize the network. </p><p>  A completely revolutionary change in the structure of the Internet occurred in May 1993, when instead of a core network, so-called ‚Äúaccess points‚Äù or NAPs began to function, in which small private core commercial networks could also interact.  Thus, the NSFNET network, which was the backbone, was closed, giving way to the NAP architecture, which essentially turned into the Internet. </p><p>  However, the true heyday of the Internet coincided with the advent of the Web - the World Wide Web or WWW, based on a new technology that uses hypertext documents, which allows users to have access to any information posted on the Web.  Teperb WWW technology is the main Internet service, unlike the previous service of access to remote Telnet supercomputers. </p><p>  Currently, the story of the creation of the Internet is far from over.  Improving the global network is continuous and inevitable.  The number of users and their needs is growing, which leads to the growth of the Web, new problems, the search for their solutions and further improvement of technology.  Now, as the history of the emergence of the Internet shows, the Network is used not only by professionals, but also by many students, schoolchildren and other people around the world who want to keep up to date. </p>
