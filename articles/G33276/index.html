Basic models have become available to the average citizen due to strong competition and market congestion.  Cheap quadrocopters can be bought for less than $ 100, and a gadget with a good camera and review can be found in about a couple of hundred, while really high-quality and more complex models have exceeded the mark of $ 1000. </p>

    <p>  The complex, which means expensive design allows you to configure and reprogram almost all the basic functions to your needs, turning the drone into a truly autonomous device that is able to independently make decisions and follow a certain nature of behavior in a given situation. </p><p>  Most fans of this kind of gadget prefers models equipped with the FPV (First Person View) function, that is, the ability to see everything that happens in the first person.  Moreover, the signal receiver can be anything: FPV-glasses, smartphone, laptop or desktop computer - it all depends on the specific model of the drone. </p><p>  Below will be presented small reviews of quadrocopters, which differed in front of the general public and experts in quality, autonomous operating time and functionality, and somewhere simplicity and balance of characteristics.  The selection includes devices for different tasks and different budgets, so you can choose something for your needs without problems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  UDI U818A </h2><p>  One of the most popular (and not in vain) models of a drone for beginners.  The price tag starts at $ 50, so the line can be classified as ‚Äúcheap quadrocopters‚Äù.  The check may vary depending on the bells and whistles of the drone, but for a beginner, the simplest model is suitable without advanced functionality and unnecessary canopies. </p>

    <p>  The first thing you should familiarize yourself with after buying a quadrocopter is the instruction.  Once you learn the main points of safety, you can begin training in the management of the drone.  The only thing that is required at this stage from a beginner is to try to prevent accidents that lie in wait at every step. </p><p>  The model has a solid set of advantages for its low price: a four-loop frame protects the rotors from collisions, and the screws themselves are inexpensive (about $ 3 per set) and change relatively quickly and easily. </p><h2>  To buy or not? </h2><p>  Included with the drone, you can see a camera standard for such devices with a resolution of 640 by 480 pixels, but judging by the reviews of the owners, <span>the video quality is</span> very mediocre, as the device constantly vibrates in flight, due to which the output rollers are shaking.  But even with all the shortcomings that the UDI quadrocopter (FPV, RTF) has, for beginners this is the best option both in terms of price and in terms of design reliability. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Blade Nano QX </h2><p>  After trying the pen on low-cost models, you can switch to more serious middle-class drones.

    <p>  The minimum amount you need to pay for the basic kit is $ 100.  There are no protective frames, additional awnings for strength and video broadcasts.  But if you want, you can go broke for the maximum configuration with automatic flight controllers and an FPV headset. </p><p>  The Blade Nano quadrocopter is much more maneuverable than its cheaper counterparts, if you seriously catch the rotors on the top of a tree or a similar obstacle, then replacement and even repair will cost you a significant amount. </p><p>  Despite the apparent fragility of the screws and design, the device copes with small obstacles (but it‚Äôs better to avoid them), so I won the respect of many UAV lovers, especially since the reviews about the model are almost all in a positive way (especially about the most complete version). </p><h2>  Phantom 2 Vision + </h2><p>  This FPV quadrocopter is a great option for most experienced pilots.  The drone easily takes good quality pictures, shoots excellent video without ‚Äúshaking‚Äù and interference, and also has an advanced and intuitive first-person control functionality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  For a thousand and a few dollars you will get a flight machine that is completely ready for flights.  FPV quadrocopter is equipped with a good camera with 14 megapixels, which is capable of processing video in high resolution up to 60 frames per second (1080 p.). </p><p>  Very often, owners in their reviews complain about insufficient reviews of quadrocopters (small angles of rotation of the camera), but the Phantom model is devoid of these shortcomings: the video eye is fixed under the drone and has an independent design, so you can easily change the viewing angle during flight.  Tracking a specific object has become much easier with this model, and this item is one of the most important for some owners of drones. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  In the kit you can see a convenient and multi-functional control panel that meets almost all the requirements for drones.  The model has an enviable synergy with smartphones, tablets and laptops, allows you to take photos and shoot videos via Wi-Fi protocols, so you can watch video on your device and at the same time record it. </p><p>  If during the flight there was a disconnection, the device will automatically return to the last point where the connection was disconnected.  In addition, the model has a relatively lightweight and easily replaceable 5200 mAh battery.  According to the manufacturer, the drone can stay in the air for about half an hour, and this is slightly more than that of competing expensive models.  If you are a fan of long flights, then you can purchase an additional battery (about $ 100), then the battery life will increase by about 70%. </p><h2>  Air Hogs RC Helix X4 Stunt </h2><p>  Give someone a big quadrocopter with all kinds of gadgets and autonomous flight for the whole day, but someone, on the contrary, is interested in small but nimble models that can fly inside buildings or in small courtyards.  One of the distinguishing features of this kind of drones is the hull materials, which are usually made of rubber (for greater safety of the pilot and others). </p>

    <p>  Small spool, yes expensive ($ 90) - this is exactly about the Helix X series. Helicopter FPV RC helicopters are equipped with ringed propellers and reliable protective gaskets made of soft and foam rubber, which can protect the device from falling and the blades from damage.  It is worthwhile to immediately warn that drones of such a plan are very fast and have good maneuverability, so be careful not to overturn fragile objects during flights. </p><p>  The design of such a plan gives a significant advantage to novice pilots in view of the rubberized body and the ability to fly in tight spaces.  Judging by the reviews of the owners of the model, many fans made their first flights with Helix. </p><h2>  3D Robotics Iris + </h2><p>  This FPV quadrocopter is one of the best options for professional flights.  If you like to improve the design of your drone specifically for your needs, such as reducing weight or reprogramming for walking your dog, then this model is your option. </p>

    <p>  The device is easily synchronized with a computer to install additional software, and the programs used are open source, so you can redo everything and everything.  You can create your own GPS flight map, monitor and intervene at any stage of the drone, add automatic balancing with the given wind parameters, time of day, and much more. </p><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  Naturally, the price of such a miracle of technology cannot be low.  The basic kit can be purchased for about $ 600, and the full kit, which can be further enhanced, starts at $ 2000.  But for the money, Iris + offers its owner the best set of functions, in addition, enthusiasts will have full access to program codes for even more flexible configuration. </p><h2>  Parrot MiniDrone Airborne Night </h2><p>  Many fans of unmanned gadgets have called this model, so to speak, light in the dark.  The device ($ 130) with its half-kilogram weight is capable of speeds up to 18 km / h and fly at maximum speed for nine minutes. </p>

A three-axis gyroscope, with the same accelerometer and ultrasonic sonar, provides the model with a stable position in the air, and the multifunction camera attached to the body can be easily used for ‚Äúairborne‚Äù selfies. </p><p>  Many owners respond very positively about the model, especially since the amount for the device is quite acceptable for the mid-price segment of this kind of gadgets.  The strength and simplicity of the design are also pleasing, but alas, it is impossible to advise this model to beginners - to manage you need skill and solid experience. </p>
