    <p>  Idea number 1.  Spring charm </p><p>  To prepare a small container, a glass jar with a rounded lid is suitable.  We draw the inner bottom and a little side with blue and white acrylic paints in the form of a sky with fluffy clouds.  Then draw a bright yellow sun in the same place.  After drying the paint, open the entire can from the inside with varnish in two layers.  The next step is to attach the plastic figures of birds to the painted sky.  It is best to take miniature swallows or pigeons (one pair).  Using superglue to the birds (in turn), glue the pieces of fishing line, and attach the other end to the painted clouds.  In order for the fishing line to adhere well to the glass, it is necessary to additionally attach a small circle to it, cut from the <span>nylon cover</span> for the can. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second step will be the design of the screw cap.  It is necessary to stick decorative plastic grass on it from the inside.  Attach a beautiful small flower pot in the center of this lawn.  The colors of all materials should be bright and saturated. </p><p>  Filler for the jar will be distilled water with glycerin (1: 1).  The liquid can be dyed a little yellow by adding food coloring.  Using this technique creates the illusion of sunshine.  After pouring the mixture into a jar, tighten the lid.  If desired, the threads of the container can be pre-lubricated with glue to avoid unwanted leakage. </p><p>  The craft is almost ready, it remains only to turn it over and tie a ribbon with a bow below.  Such a souvenir can be safely presented to mom, grandmother, daughter and girlfriend on March 8 or another holiday. </p><p>  Idea number 2.  Miracle Clock </p><p>  With this idea, you can create beautiful fairy-tale watches from a simple electronic watch and can mechanism. </p><p>  For work you will need: a glass jar with a lid, <span>a</span> small-sized <span>clockwork mechanism</span> , pieces of colored fabric, nylon tights, cardboard, glue, scissors, black beads, fluffy knitting threads, cotton wool and a thick white knitted cord. </p><p>  In a flat round jar, place a piece of thick cardboard with a clockwork in the center.  This must be done in such a way that the mechanism itself is on the back of the cardboard, and the arrows are located in front of the makeshift dial.  It should be <span>decorated beautifully,</span> in a fabulous style. </p><p>  A jar clock needs to be decorated in the form of a cartoon girl.  Therefore, it is necessary for her to sew a fluffy skirt, sweater and hat.  Glue the blouse so that it does not cover the clock.  Make the doll‚Äôs head with the help of a capron, placing a ball of cotton wool in it.  Sew the eyes-beads, and draw a mouth, nose, eyebrows and freckles.  Form hair with fluffy golden threads.  Put a hat on the doll-watch and make arms and legs from the cord, attaching them with glue under the clothes. </p><p>  Such a magic watch will decorate any home and can be a good gift to a loved one. </p>

Therefore, they need to be decorated in such a way that it is clear which product is inside the container.  Knowing how to decorate a glass jar with your own hands correctly, you can decorate a lot of them and, placing them on shelves, thereby creating warmth and comfort in the kitchen.  Kitchen jars can be decorated in different ways, borrowing some ideas for their transformation from the masters of handmade: </p><p>  Fabric upholstery </p><p>  Pieces of burlap with disheveled edges tie to the bank with golden cords or twine.  Additionally, you can decorate the container with artificial flowers or slices of dried citrus. </p><p>  Cereal decoration </p><p>  A wonderful idea is to spread each jar with glue completely and shake the cereal in the form for which it will be intended for storage.  When the material dries, it can be painted in silver or golden paint. </p><p>  Jars in bags </p><p>  Buy the right amount of organza bags and sew the edges in such a way that each can fits into them and there are no voids around.  On separate pieces of fabric embroider the name of the groats with golden threads and sew them in the center of the bags.  Tighten the tapes under the neck so that they do not interfere with closing the lid. </p><p>  Decoupage </p><p>  To make a decoupage of a glass jar, you will need such materials: PVA glue, acrylic paint of any color, alcohol, acrylic varnish, brushes, decoupage napkins, scissors.  Working process: </p><ul><li>  Degrease the jar with alcohol. </li><li>  Paint with acrylic paint and let it dry. </li><li>  From a napkin for decoupage, select and cut the necessary patterns. </li><li>  Apply glue with a brush to the application and gently stick to the surface of the can.  The following action should be performed only when the glue is completely dry. </li><li>  The final step is the application of acrylic varnish on the entire surface of the container (2 layers). </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="glass jar with a lid" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46256/1603498.jpg" width="374"></div></h2><h2>  Lovely vases </h2><p>  You can make very beautiful vases from ordinary kitchen cans that will look beneficial in any interior.  And how to decorate a glass jar with your own hands, so that it looks no worse than the purchased one?  It is very simple, you can apply the decoupage method, which was mentioned above, or complicate it using egg shells. </p><p>  Using decoupage glass jars with their own hands using shells, it is possible to give a texture and unique shape to a future vase.  The progress in this case remains the same as before, only after cleaning the cans with alcohol, it is necessary to glue the crushed eggshell onto it. </p><p>  The vase from a glass jar has an unusual appearance if it is decorated in a marine style.  To do this, you need to stick shells and small sea pebbles on a jar so that there are no empty spaces.  Such a vase will always delight and remind you of the time spent on the sea coast. </p><h2>  Flickering glare </h2><p>  From any glass jar you can create a unique nightlight using small candles in tin cans.  In order for the room to fill with various shadows from such flickering, it is necessary to paint the entire glass surface of the nightlight with beautiful patterns on the outside.  For example, cut out stars from paper and attach them to the jar with tape, then paint everything with dark paint from a spray can.  After the paint has dried, remove the paper stars.  You will get many starry windows through which light from a candle will pour. </p>
