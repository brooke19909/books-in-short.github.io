The reviews that the owners post on the Web say that you can buy it without connecting services, but the cost will be much higher.  If you believe the manufacturer‚Äôs statement, the gadget easily copes with all everyday tasks.  Also its indisputable advantage is the extremely low price ($ 40) and compactness.  But what characteristics he possesses, we will consider in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet irbis tx 22 reviews" class="if" height="426" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1768249.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  The gadget is delivered to store shelves in a simple white box.  At it, the manufacturer presented brief technical specifications.  Laconicism of design continued in a complete set.  Inside the box, the buyer will find the minimum set, which consists only of a USB cable, and there is also an Irbis TX 22 tablet manual.  Given that the device can be purchased for 2,000 rubles with Beeline services, it is unlikely that anyone expects the maximum delivery package.  According to users, of course, an OTG adapter, a case and other accessories would not be in the way.  But they can be purchased separately at any specialized store. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Irbis TX 22 tablet specifications" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1768250.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The tablet "Irbis TX 22" ("Beeline") is presented in black.  It is decorated in a classic design with striking features of minimalism.  The developers abandoned the use of aluminum inserts.  There are also no other chrome elements.  Everything is very simple and concise.  Users have comments on the assembly, but the quality of the materials deserves attention.  The tablet can be called reliable and durable.  It is definitely worth the money spent. </p><p>  The front panel has a front camera module, only the logo flaunts behind.  The dimensions of the device are quite compact - 19 √ó 11 √ó 1 cm. Thanks to this, the tablet can always be carried with you without any discomfort. </p><h2>  Irbis TX 22 Tablet: Specifications and Screen Reviews </h2><p>  In their reviews, users highlighted the screen.  It is undoubtedly the virtue of a tablet.  The display is manufactured using IPS technology.  This is more than enough to not doubt its quality.  Wide viewing angles, high brightness, excellent color reproduction - all this model owners can enjoy.  Screen size - 7 ∫.  The image is displayed in a resolution of 1024 √ó 600 px.  Granularity and pixelation with the naked eye are not visible, since the density is 170 ppi per inch.  The only thing that can upset users is the fading of the screen in the sun.  But this drawback is visible only on the street, and in the room information is displayed clearly. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The Irbis TX 22 tablet began to receive not very good reviews when users got acquainted with the characteristics of the processor.  Frankly, they are pretty weak.  For the performance of the gadget meets the chipset company MediaTek.  The dual-core MT8312 model is capable of overclocking each computing module to 1300 MHz. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Modest indicators are relevant in relation to the amount of RAM.  Its only 512 MB.  Expecting something more from a tablet worth about 2,000 rubles was clearly not worth it.  In their reviews, users noticed that the device copes with surfing, playing music, viewing documents or e-books on a solid four.  But modern resource-intensive applications will not be within his power.  With a heavy load, the tablet freezes, there are malfunctions.  There is only one conclusion: the gadget is designed to perform standard tasks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet irbis tx 22 beeline" class="if" height="465" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1768252.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Which Irbis TX 22 tablet received reviews on battery life?  Most owners said that the 2500 mAh battery is not enough.  The instructions say that the resource is enough for 4 hours.  However, this figure is a relative concept.  The battery life will depend on the load.  The smaller it is, the longer the battery charge will last.  Those owners who have already fully tested the device claim that it is Wi-Fi that drains the battery very much. </p><h2>  Camera Reviews </h2><p>  Only one camera has the Irbis TX 22 tablet.  The optics are pretty weak.  According to users, the manufacturer installed a 0.3-megapixel matrix for video only.  This decision was made in order to save.  This can be found not only in Irbis devices.  This practice is quite common and is used by other brands. </p>
