  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do you need handwriting analysis</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As a rule, when a person writes, he does not think about how he does it.  At the same time, everyone has their own style of fixing information.  Each handwriting is individual, like fingerprints.  In order to understand the features, character <span>traits, temperament of the</span> author, a psychological analysis of handwriting is used. </p><p>  Explores the special <span>qualities of man,</span> reflected in his writing, a separate science.  Graphology (analysis of handwriting), according to experts, allows you to not only understand other people, but also often understand yourself.  The way of writing can tell a lot about a person. </p><p>  It should be noted that in many European countries, handwriting analysis has long been used in testing people.  More recently, this system has become officially recognized in America. </p><p>  Handwriting analysis is best done on a sample written on a sheet of plain white paper, without margins, lines or cells.  To get the most natural style, it‚Äôs better to ask to write something that comes to mind (do not rewrite text from a newspaper, for example).  A lot about the person says his signature.  In addition, the writing of the letters in it is different from the usual writing of the text.  Therefore, it is desirable to obtain a signature as well. </p><p>  Of course, handwriting analysis is best done with a sample written by an author who did not know about the study.  If a letter consisting of several pages is taken for study, the researcher should pay more attention to the last page.  As a rule, by the end of the letter people least of all think about the "beauty" of letters.  Thus, the handwriting becomes as natural as possible. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For a better review of all writing elements (dashes, hooks and other details), experts recommend using a magnifying glass. </p><p>  Handwriting analysis is carried out in several directions. </p><p>  The first is the "geometric persistence of writing."  Here, uniformity of pressure, uniformity of gaps between lines and words, evenness of fields and lines of lines are evaluated.  The handwriter with a high degree of "geometric consistency" is endowed with a large supply of energy, will, able to maintain internal balance, act deliberately, suppressing unwanted emotions. </p><p>  The second criterion by which the study is conducted is harmony.  Here, as a rule, more attention is paid to the overall impression of the letter.  When, looking at the written text, the researcher has a feeling of a single whole, then most likely the author of the sample is endowed with a rich internal culture and good taste. </p><p>  When analyzing handwriting, the graphology of the letter is also taken into account.  This criterion represents the level of deviation from calligraphic writing.  And the stronger the difference, the more original and individual the author. </p><p>  It should be noted that graphology has some limits.  So, for example, one cannot say, looking at the text (if there is no signature), what gender is the author.  Sometimes light pressure and small letters that a woman might seem to possess belong to a really shy man. </p><p>  The researcher cannot reliably determine the age of the author from the written text.  It should be said here that the way of writing letters reflects not chronological, but mental age. </p><p>  Of course, by handwriting it is impossible to determine the <span>marital status of the</span> author, occupation, hobbies.  However, the features of the writing of letters can reveal the presence or absence of prudence in a person, perseverance in achieving a goal, gentleness, firmness in decision making, clarity of thoughts. </p><p>  Each sample for the graphologist is individual.  The researcher's task is to identify weak and strong character traits reflected in the hand-written text. </p>
