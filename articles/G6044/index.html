A striking example of this is the FS501, which has many advantages.  What will surprise this user with the novelty? </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  <span>Fly FS501</span> got a very attractive appearance.  The design of the device without any frills, but the rounded corners make it stylish.  The device is made entirely of good quality plastic.  The back panel is a little rough, which makes using a smartphone more convenient. </p>

    <p>  Present on <span>Fly FS501</span> and oleophobic coating.  Accordingly, fingerprints and dirt on the device‚Äôs body do not remain.  There may be slight scratches on the back cover, although this is a problem with most phones. </p><p>  On the front part there is a display, a camera, a speaker, sensors and controls.  A microphone was sheltered at the bottom end, and a headset jack at the top.  On the side of the right is the volume control along with the power button, and on the left is a USB socket.  No changes are observed on the rear panel, where the camera, flash, logo and main speaker are located. </p><p>  The smartphone turned out to be very overall.  The thickness of the gadget is 9.9 mm, and the weight is as much as 177 grams.  This greatly reduces the usability of the device.  Given the use of plastic, there is a misunderstanding about such a large weight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among the many cheap models, this gadget clearly stands out.  Pleasant outline and solid material create perfect harmony.  Only the color of the phone brings a general impression.  The device is made exclusively in white and black versions, although a greater variety of colors would not hurt. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Equipped smartphone Fly Nimbus 3 FS501 with only five megapixels.  Even for an inexpensive gadget, such a camera is not the most suitable.  Resolution also leaves much to be desired - only 2591 by 1944 pixels.  Such a camera could be relevant a couple of years ago, but now it is hopelessly outdated. </p><p>  <span>Pictures</span> taken by <span>Fly FS501</span> are full of noise and low detail.  Even under ideal conditions, the camera does not perform well. </p><p>  Present in the device is video recording with a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels.  This characteristic of the device is also quite low.  Only 15 frames per second are recorded, as a result, the image turns out to be twitchy. </p><p>  The device has a front camera, or rather a peephole with 0.3 megapixels.  A camera will be enough for video calling, but it's better to forget about self-portraits. </p><p>  Saving the manufacturer led to disastrous consequences.  The user will most likely not use the camera features.  With the same success, it was possible not to install it at all. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Lame in all respects and the screen Fly FS501.  Despite the fact that the smartphone has acquired a diagonal of 5 inches, it has not received more advantages. </p>

    <p>  It‚Äôs worth starting with the ‚Äúancient‚Äù TFT matrix installed by the manufacturer.  As a result, the device cannot please not only with viewing angles, but also with brightness.  With a slight tilt, the picture is distorted, it is impossible to work with the device.  In the sun, the display fades noticeably and fades. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The resolution of 854 by 480, which is not suitable for such a screen, worsens the impression.  The device has only 196 ppi, which is very small for five inches. </p><p>  The owner of the Fly FS501 Nimbus 3 Black will face not only the grain of the screen, but also difficulties in working in bright light.  Confidently, this display can be considered a failure of the company. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  Installed in the Fly FS501 Nimbus 3 an unfamiliar Spreadtrum processor.  Judging by the specifications, this chip is similar to MTK, which means that the device received good power.  The success is ensured by the presence of four cores with a capacity of 1.2 GHz each. </p><p>  The weak point of the device was 512 MB of RAM.  As you know, in passive mode, "Android" consumes 200 MB, and the user remains a mere trifle.  The Mali-400 video accelerator does not show itself very well either.  This frankly weak part does not allow the processor to show its maximum. </p><p>  Summed up the Fly FS501 Nimbus 3 and the native memory.  The company allocated only four gigabytes for its new products.  Approximately 2 GB is spent on Android. The only good news is the ability to expand the volume of the card to 32 GB. </p><h2>  System </h2>

    <p>  Uses the new "Android" a little outdated version 4.4.  The system is perfect for the hardware.  Together with it, the shell of the company was also established.  The owner will find many applications from the manufacturer in the device.  Naturally, most of the programs are not of particular interest.  If necessary, using FOTA, you can update the gadget to a newer system. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost of the device ranges from 5 to 6 thousand rubles.  In general, a very affordable price for not the worst phone.  Although the manufacturer is able to offer more relevant models in the same category. </p><p>  For example, the smartphone FS502, released almost simultaneously with 501, has more impressive characteristics.  The difference in cost is several hundred rubles. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Together with the phone, the user will receive an adapter, a USB cable, a headset, as well as instructions.  It is a familiar set for a budget employee.  The owner must immediately include in the price of the device and a flash card. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with a battery with 2000 mAh capacity.  The battery is able to provide the device with an average battery life. </p>

    <p>  Despite the low brightness of the screen and low functionality, the phone will live a day in standby mode.  Minimal use of the gadget will reduce the operating time to 8 hours, and the maximum load will reduce it by half. </p><h2>  Positive opinions </h2><p>  The reviews left about the Fly FS501 Nimbus 3 highlight the gadget's stylish exterior and workmanship.  The plastic in the device is really high-quality, but there will still be scratches. </p><p>  Attention should be paid to the filling.  Although the processor is not very well known, its power is enough for many tasks.  Of course, there is no question about 3D games, but ordinary casual applications work perfectly. </p><p>  Attracts the cost of the device.  Despite the high performance, the device is more than affordable. </p><h2>  Negative opinions </h2>

    <p>  An incredible number of shortcomings is present in the Fly FS501 Nimbus 3. Owner reviews note the low quality of the screen.  The outdated matrix and low resolution even for a budget employee spoil the whole picture. </p><p>  The gadget's camera is also disconcerting.  Pictures of poor quality are unlikely to please the user. </p><p>  A significant drawback is the small amount of RAM.  Only 512 MB is the minimum for any modern device. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  If the design distinguishes the device, then the functionality is inconspicuous among analogues.  The advantage over the 501th has many representatives of the budget class.  Even among the brothers in the workshop there are more successful models.  We can say that this is not the most successful device of Fly. </p>
