    <h2>  Main goals </h2><p>  Firstly, it was urgent to return all the lands that were lost as a result of the Time of Troubles.  Secondly, the rulers of the country had the task of annexing back all those territories that had once been part of Kievan Rus.  Of course, in many respects they were guided far not only by the ideas of reunification of once divided peoples, but also by the desire to increase the share of arable land and the number of taxpayers.  Simply put, Russia's foreign policy of the 17th century was aimed at restoring the country's integrity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The time of troubles affected the country very seriously: the treasury was empty, many peasants became so impoverished that it was simply impossible to charge taxes on them.  Obtaining new lands not plundered by the Poles would not only restore Russia's political prestige, but also replenish its treasury.  In general, this was the main foreign policy of Russia in the 17th century.  The table (the 10th grade of the school should know it perfectly), given later in the article, reflects its most global goals. </p><h2>  Access to the sea </h2>

Firstly, the existence of these routes would make it possible to strengthen economic ties with Europe without problems, arranging supplies of not only rare goods, but also technology, literature and other things that could help close the country's lag in the industrial sphere.

    <p>  Finally, it was time to decide something with the Crimean Khan: a solid large country at that time was suffering from the raids of some "shallow" allies of the Turkish Sultan.  However, do not forget about the old army saying about paper and ravines ... There were a lot of difficulties along the way. </p><h2>  Promotion east </h2><p>  We should not forget that the foreign policy of Russia in the 17th century largely pursued the goal of expanding the country to the East with the goal of further development and exploitation of those lands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In particular, export required a huge amount of sable furs, which were in incredible demand in the world.  The only problem was that in the European part of the country these valuable animals were long ago killed.  Finally, it was urgent to reach the Pacific Ocean and establish a natural border along it.  And further.  In the country there were enough "violent heads", which were a pity to chop.  It was decided to send the most active, but troubled people to Siberia. </p>

The table clearly demonstrates that not a single decade was complete without war, while success did not always accompany our state. </p><h2>  What prevented the solution of the most important tasks? </h2><p>  The main one was not even the activity of ‚Äúeternal friends‚Äù in the person of Great Britain and France, but their own technological backwardness.  Europe during the next Thirty Years War was able to completely rethink the theory of weapons and the organization of troops on the battlefield, as well as the tactics of their application.  So, the main striking force again became the infantry, which since the end of the Roman Empire has been on led roles.  The means of its strengthening was the regimental artillery, which was intensively developing at that time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Backwardness in military affairs </h2><p>  And here Russia's foreign policy in the 17th century stalled.  The table (grade 7 should know its main points) is not able to show this, but the army was extremely weak.  The fact is that in our country the backbone of the armed forces has so far been the noble cavalry.  She could fight the remnants of the once powerful Horde with success, but when she met the army of the same France, she would surely have been waiting for serious losses. </p>

    <h2>  About weapons issues </h2><p>  The huge country depended heavily on arms imports.  The backwardness in tactics and armaments was planned to be eliminated by intensive import of weapons from European factories, as well as by recruiting officers.  All this resulted not only in dependence on the leading powers of that period, but also very expensively for the country. </p><p>  Thus, the foreign policy of Russia in the 17th century (the main directions of which we described) was based on paradoxes: on the one hand, no one doubted the need for war with the Europeans.  On the other hand, it was from them that expensive weapons and ammunition were bought, which increased the military and economic power of the powers of the Old World, but greatly weakened Russia, which was already bleeding from the Time of Troubles. </p><p>  So, on the eve of the Russo-Polish war mentioned in the table, a lot of gold had to be spent.  At least 40 thousand muskets and 20 thousand pounds of selected gunpowder were purchased in Holland and Sweden.  This amount was at least 2/3 of the total number of infantry weapons.  At the same time, tension continues to increase on the part of Sweden, which not only blocks access to the Baltic, but also continues to lay claim to a considerable part of Russian lands. </p><h2>  Attitude to the country in the international arena </h2><p>  The fact that in the West Russia was perceived only as an extremely backward, ‚Äúbarbaric‚Äù country, the territory of which was subject to mandatory expansion, and the population was planned to partially assimilate, affected very badly.  Otherwise, everyone was destined for the sad fate of the Indians of North America. </p><p>  Thus, the strong foreign policy of Russia in the 17th century was more important than ever.  Its main tasks were aimed at ‚Äúcutting through the window,‚Äù which Peter later did.  Economic and military backwardness was largely due to banal territorial isolation, since a powerful Turkish-Polish-Swedish barrier stood in the way of establishing normal relations. </p>

    <p>  This is the main foreign policy of Russia in the 17th century.  In short, the most important tasks lay in the West, from where the military threat was increasingly felt. </p><h2>  Western wars </h2><p>  All this led to the fact that in 1632, immediately after the death of <span>Sigismund III,</span> a war broke out in <span>the Commonwealth</span> for the revision of the Deulins Agreements.  Our country was the instigator.  Unfortunately, the forces were clearly unequal.  In general, Russia's foreign policy in the 17th century (a brief outline of which we have already discussed) largely failed due to the extreme imperfection of the administrative, military and <span>diplomatic corps.</span> </p><p>  We give the most obvious and annoying example.  Due to extremely poor diplomacy, the Polish king Wladyslaw managed to establish contact with the Crimean Tatars.  The slow-moving Russian army, headed by M. Shein, consisted of service people.  When they found out that the Tatars began regular sorties inland, they simply left the army, leaving to defend their own estates.  All this ended with the signing of the Polyanovsky world. </p><p>  I had to return to Poland all the lands conquered at the beginning of the war, but King Vladislav completely renounced all claims to the Russian lands and the throne.  The governor M. Shein and A. Izmailov were declared guilty of defeat, who were subsequently cut off their heads.  Thus, the foreign policy of Russia in the 17th century is not a particularly successful way for us. </p><h2>  Territory of present Ukraine </h2>

    <p>  The culprits were the Zaporozhye Cossacks.  In general, they led a pretty good life: protecting the borders of Poland from the raids of the same Crimean Tatars, they received a decent reward (not counting military booty).  But the Poles were not happy with the fact that the Cossacks accepted into their ranks any runaway slave and had never betrayed him back.  A methodical ‚Äútightening of nuts‚Äù began, a cutback in the Cossack freemen.  Bohdan Khmelnytsky led an immediately flared uprising. </p><h2>  Successes and failures of the rebels </h2><p>  Already in December 1648, his troops occupied Kiev.  In August of the following year, amicable agreements were signed.  They envisaged an increase in the number of ‚Äúofficial‚Äù Cossacks, to whom the authorities had no complaints, but the list of achievements ended there. </p><p>  Khmelnitsky understood that without outside help he could not correct injustice.  The only candidate for allied relations was Russia, but its authorities were no longer eager for battle, as it took time to completely reform the army.  Meanwhile, the Poles did not tolerate the shameful world;  already in 1653 the rebels were in danger of complete extermination. </p>
