  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The tool and the subject of labor. Difference of concepts. Types of movement of objects of labor</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Objects of labor are objects of the material world.  These things in the course of consumption transfer their own material substance to another thing or change to the material substance of another thing.  In connection with these circumstances, the subject of labor is subjected to full expenditure in the process of economic use. </p><p>  The tools, on the contrary, do not exchange or transfer their material substance to another thing.  This is their main difference from the objects of labor. </p><p>  For example, the machine on which the manufacture is carried out does not transfer its material substance to the part.  Thus, the machine tool.  At the same time, the material substance of the material used for manufacture passes into the product in the process of consumption (use).  Thus, the material is the subject of labor.  As a result, the machine is disposed of after complete wear.  And the material, transferring its material substance to the product, transfers the product and value. </p><p>  Specialists, meanwhile, pay attention that the division of things into tools or objects of labor depends on the nature of their application.  So, the same part (thing) can be used in different ways.  Thus, the same material object can be classified as an object of labor or as its tool. </p><p>  The same machine is considered a typical tool.  However, under certain circumstances (for example, at the time of sale to third parties) it will become an item. </p><p>  It should be noted that the distribution of objects cannot always be straightforward.  An example would be a ballpoint pen.  When figuring out what this thing is, some facts should be taken into account.  So, the handle body undoubtedly acts as a tool.  Inks are consumed in the process of writing, transferring their material substance to a sheet of paper.  Thus, ink is the subject of labor.  As a result, an object used uniformly in a property complex may relate to an instrument.  However, along with this, the object in question also has an expendable part related to the category of objects of labor. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Objects in storage are not classified.  Although during this period you can build certain assumptions.  Conclusions about the features of the upcoming use of things can be made taking into account the intentions of the owners or based on established practice.  However, existing knowledge may be refuted, and intentions may undergo changes. </p><p>  The nature of future use of an object can be determined on the basis of ideas about the object in the material world.  Thus, certain categories of things as objects or tools are practically unsuitable.  However, only the practice of their application allows us to establish the truth. </p><p>  Objects of labor are called an integral part of production facilities.  This category includes everything that undergoes any processing.  Human objects are directed at these objects. </p><p>  Some such objects are found in nature and are natural.  These include wood, coal, oil and more.  Others are the result of labor - "raw material."  These include cotton, metal, wood. </p><p>  In the production process, the final, intermediate and initial form of the state of the objects of labor is distinguished. </p><p>  When determining the duration of the production cycle, different <span>types of movement of</span> objects of labor can be used. </p><p>  In a sequential order, the beginning of each new operation is carried out only upon completion of processing of all products from the previous operation.  In parallel movement after the first operation is completed, each product is transferred to another operation, without waiting for the initial processing of the entire batch.  Thus, the period of passage of the subject of labor in all operations is reduced. </p><p>  Parallel-sequential order involves the beginning of a subsequent operation until the processing of a batch of products of the previous one is completed.  This reduces time and ensures uninterrupted loading of all jobs. </p>
