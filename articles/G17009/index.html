    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  The enterprise, which became Soviet-American, was created in the summer of 1989.  The formation initiative was voiced by the vice-president of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union - Evgeny Velikhov.  Components were produced on conveyors of defense companies. </p><p>  Models Supercolor 635CL and 636 Closeup differed from each other only in the shape of the case, these Polaroid cameras have no other differences. </p><p>  These devices were made for ordinary people who are not very versed in the design and process of creating photographs.  In order to use this device, it was not necessary to have special theoretical knowledge. </p><p>  It was considered quite attractive for buyers that the film did not need to be processed.  Also, I did not have to work with special paper and printing.  After shooting, you could immediately get a ready-made color photograph. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="polaroid 636" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1941720.jpg"></div>

The device was produced for 10 years.  Type - a camera with a single-stage processor.  For printing, a special material called Polaroid 600 film was used.  The dimension of the resulting photographs is 78 √ó 79 mm. </p><p>  As a shutter, a central shutter-diaphragm is used.  Plastic lenses are used for the lens.  Non-removable type lens.  There is no focusing in automatic mode - the device is set to hyperfocal distance.  As for metering, shutter speed and aperture are automatically set.  There is <span>a</span> flash on the <span>swivel bracket</span> .  It is, as already clear, built-in type.  An optical and parallax viewfinder is installed. </p><p>  Such characteristics are inherent in both the Polaroid 636 and 635 cameras. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="polaroid camera reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1941721.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  More details about the characteristics </h2><p>  The body of the device is made of shockproof plastic, mounted on a rotary bracket flash.  The light that passed through the shooting lens fell on a special part - the pentazerkalo.  Thanks to this, the image was turned over.  Tripod socket and self-timer were absent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Polaroid 636 and 635 cameras had a special strap.  It was made of synthetics and was used to conveniently carry the device.  A special automatic counter was installed.  Thanks to him, on the screen of the device it was possible to see how many pictures can still be taken.  After the flash was brought into a transport state, the lens was removed from the lens.  It happened in automatic mode. </p><p>  The cassette for the Polaroid camera is designed to work with 10 photos.  Processing them is not required.  The process of creating a picture began with exposure in the device and ended in natural light just a few minutes after the card was removed. </p><p>  On the bottom of the device you can see a special cover.  It is underneath the cassette loading area.  After the lid closes, the automatic drive process begins.  Through the gap in it came out protection against exposure.  Immediately after that it was already possible to start taking pictures.  The cassette also has an electric type battery for flash and electric drive. </p><p>  The viewfinder is great.  When working with a nozzle lens, immediately after its extension, a frame appeared.  On it is a visible oval.  It was in him that the face of a man was visible.  So the portrait type was shot. </p><p>  The photo that the device gives out has color shades.  It consists of thin plastic sheets that are distinguished by their flexibility.  They are framed in cardboard.  Here is the paste responsible for the manifestation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cassettes for the polaroid camera" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1941722.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Lens and flash </h2><p>  The lens works with a simple lens.  Its focus is set to hyperfocal distance.  If we talk about sharpness, the depth is calculated from 1.2 meters to ‚Äúinfinity‚Äù.  If desired, you can change this range by 0.6-1.2 m. This is done by introducing the handle lens on the front panel of the device. </p><p>  After the flash case was moved, namely, the bracket was rotated, charging of the camera began.  When it was completed, the green LED was on.  Until charging took place, the shutter refused to work. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Polaroid cameras (reviews of models 363 and 365 are good) are considered automatic machines.  You can not change the combination of shutter speed and aperture in them.  If desired, you can change the exposure compensation.  This is done due to the handle on the front side of the device.  In order to work without flash, you must click on a specific button. </p><p>  After pressing the trigger, the electric drive instantly issued a photograph.  How did this happen?  The photo passed by the rollers, the capsule with the developer was crushed, and printing began.  It was impossible to expose the newly extracted picture to too bright light in the first few minutes. </p>
