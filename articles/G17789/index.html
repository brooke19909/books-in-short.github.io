It is one of the oldest objects of great importance.  The history <span>of the</span> Russian <span>strategic missile</span> shield began precisely with the Kapustin Yar region.  At the same time, this area is still a research, testing center and cosmodrome. </p><h2>  Landfill History </h2><p>  Kapustin Yar polygon (Astrakhan region) <strong> </strong>  It began to be created after the Second World War, when Soviet scientists gained access to German technology.  Despite the fact that the USSR got only the remnants of technical documentation, this was enough to start the reproduction of the FAU 1 and 2 missiles. </p><p>  In May 1946, the leadership of the USSR decided to create a specialized testing ground.  As a result, the district of the village of Kapustin Yar was chosen for these purposes.  The first head of the training ground was appointed V.I.  Wozniuk, lieutenant general of artillery.  He managed the facility for 27 years.  The landfill was named after the village Kapustin Yar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kapustin Yar Astrakhan Oblast" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1626546.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The secrecy of the object </h2><p>  When the military landed on its shores with the first cargo, no one knew about the creation of the Soviet cosmodrome.  Information about the goals and objectives of the training ground was kept secret, and even local authorities received orders from the leadership only to provide all possible assistance to the arriving military in their arrangement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The seriousness of the object became clear when the boundaries of the village and the resettlement of 200 families in other areas were changed.  People received good compensation at that time.  The resettlement ended in 1949. Many of the remaining residents got jobs in settlement groups, KECh and the service sector.  Some went to long service. </p><h2>  Polygon Extension </h2><p>  Initially, the test facility Kapustin Yar (Astrakhan region) had only a concrete stand.  In 1947 the following were built: </p><ul><li>  hopper; </li><li>  launch pad; </li><li>  temporary technical station; </li><li>  bridge; </li><li>  assembly station; </li><li>  rocket fuel storage. </li></ul><p>  A little later there appeared a highway and a railway connecting the facility with Stalingrad (now Volgograd).  Life at the training ground was very difficult.  People lived in dugouts and tents in the bare steppe.  The management of the training ground huddled in a special train car.  The first normal residential buildings began to be built only in 1948. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kapustin Yar village, Astrakhan region" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1626547.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  First test </h2><p>  In the fall of 1947, the first tests were carried out at the Kapustin Yar training ground (Astrakhan Oblast).  The first ballistic missile of the USSR was launched.  The tests were successful, the shell hit the right square.  The space-rocket Soviet era was opened on 10/10/1948. In a short time, new weapons appeared for the USSR Armed Forces.  For 10 years, the village of Kapustin Yar (Astrakhan region) <strong> </strong>  was the only place to test ballistic missiles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the same time, the range began to be used to launch geophysical and meteorological shells.  In 1951, the first series of missiles with dogs on board were launched from the cosmodrome.  Since 1956, tests of nuclear missile weapons began.  At the same time, the landfill developed more and more.  New technical and launch complexes were built, the volume of research work, etc. increased. </p><h2>  Cosmodrome </h2><p>  In the early 60s.  object Kapustin Yar (Astrakhan region) was prepared to begin space exploration.  The landfill received the status of a cosmodrome in March 1962. Then the first Soviet satellite was launched into Earth‚Äôs orbit.  In 1969, the spaceport received international status.  Indian satellites were sent from space to the space.  Over time, launches began to decline until they stopped altogether. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kapustin Yar training ground Astrakhan Oblast" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1626545.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 1987, all tests were stopped at the training ground, and the country's leadership mothballed the facility for 10 years.  Its revival began only in 1998. Testing and the launch of missiles and research facilities began again.  In 2007, a cruise missile was tested, and in 2011, the Iskander-M OTRK. </p><p>  In 2015, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation announced early tests at the training ground of robotic systems.  Preparatory work and modernization of the transmission system began.  Tests of combat robot systems are planned, which should be responsible for beacons, signaling devices, etc. </p><p>  <span>Save</span> </p>
