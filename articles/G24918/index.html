It is especially pleasant that each of these great people had Ukrainian roots. </p><p>  The works were not always committed in Ukraine, which many had to leave.  However, it is always worth remembering that you can change your place of residence, but it is impossible to remove the memories of the Motherland from the heart. </p><h2>  Igor Sikorsky </h2><p>  <span>Famous Ukrainian</span> scientists have made a huge contribution to the development of world science.  Our story opens <span>Igor Sikorsky.</span>  Without exaggeration, this surname is known on all continents, in every forgotten corner of the world. </p><p>  The inventor was born in 1889 in Kiev.  Leonardo Da Vinci became the ideological inspiration for young Igor.  Already in early childhood, the designer set a specific goal - to create a helicopter. </p><p>  By the age of twenty, he had built dozens of aircraft, most of which crashed during testing.  The best samples received prizes at various tournaments, and this fact could not but inspire further research, which was tens of years ahead of its time.  So, Sikorsky invented the largest biplane at that time, which had as many as four motors.  Subsequently, the aircraft was used as a bomber. </p>

    <p>  In 1918, Igor Ivanovich moved to France, and then to the United States.  Without a penny of money in your pocket, friends and support. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thanks to hard work and an amazing ability not to lose heart and philosophically treat failures, the predecessors of modern airliners rose into the sky.  A little later appeared and freight, completely changing the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlogistics. </p><p>  Already in 1939, the designer realized the dream of his life - he built a helicopter.  At the moment, these machines serve civilians, the military, and even the US president. </p><p>  A wonderful story of a strong man, which clearly shows that you can achieve a dream if you really want to. </p><h2>  Joseph Timchenko </h2><p>  The contribution of Ukrainian scientists to the development of world science is truly enormous.  The representative of the direction of mechanics Joseph Timchenko presented mankind with a mercury barometer, an electronic clock, a device for checking manometers.  The designer was born in Kharkov, after which he moved to Odessa, where he lived his interesting life. </p><p>  In the memory of grateful descendants, Joseph Andreevich will forever remain the embodiment of the fact that it was Ukrainian scientists who created the prototype of the kinescope.  Unfortunately, the device was not patented.  And the other person went down in history as its creator. </p><p>  By the way, the jump mechanism found by Joseph Andreevich became the basis for the strobe too. </p><h2>  Sergey Korolev </h2><p>  The list of "famous Ukrainian scientists" would not be complete without a person who presented people with nothing more than space. </p><p>  The story of Sergey Korolev is largely unfair and dishonest.  Studying his works, one can only be surprised at how strong the faith in science, mankind, and simply the will to live was in him. </p><p>  Like Igor Sikorsky, the boy was interested in everything that flies.  It is not surprising that he decided to devote his life to traveling in the air. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sergei Pavlovich and designed the aircraft, and he flew them.  Even aerobatics were commonplace for him. </p><p>  The most important development that was introduced by the young scientist was a ballistic missile, which brought the country's defense to a completely different level. </p>

    <p>  But not only the military were happy.  The creation of a rocket made it possible to reach completely different horizons even beyond the borders of the Earth! </p><p>  On October 4, 1957, the world was shocked by the launch of the first artificial satellite into the orbit of our planet.  Needless to say, it was Sergei Korolev who led the development process. </p><p>  The next stage of development was the active conquest of space, the peak of which was the sending of man into space <span>on April 12,</span> 1961. </p><p>  The scientist died on January 14, 1966, not having time to realize the dreams of exploring the moon.  An orbital station was also not built. </p><p>  But successfully achieved amazes even contemporaries.  That is why Sergey Korolev takes an honorable place in the list of ‚Äúfamous Ukrainian scientists‚Äù. </p><h2>  Fedor Pirotsky </h2><p>  It is difficult to overestimate the contribution made by Ukrainian scientists to the development of world science.  The surname of this person is not so much heard as the previous ones. </p><p>  But he made a revolution in transportation.  Pirotsky invented a tram. </p><p>  The meeting with electrical engineer Pavel Yablochkov had a huge impact on the future inventor.  The result of many years of research was an electric vehicle. </p>

    <p>  Despite the protests of the owners of horse-drawn trams, the cars have won a worthy place in the life of mankind, and we still use them today. </p><h2>  Nikolay Pirogov </h2><p>  Hearing the phrase "Ukrainian scientists", one of the first to recall a magnificent doctor, whose name forever entered the history of mankind. </p><p>  The founder of field surgery and an active proponent of anesthesia is only a small part of his interests.  In addition, the scientist was fond of anatomy, and was also a wonderful teacher. </p><p>  Thousands of people affected by military conflicts are forever grateful to Nikolai Ivanovich for the opportunity to forget about the wounds.  The plaster dressings invented by the doctor have preserved hundreds of limbs and are still used today. </p>

    <p>  Sorting the wounded is also Pirogov‚Äôs idea.  With an equal number of personnel, the effectiveness of primary care has increased many times over. </p><p>  Almost a hundred and fifty years have passed since the death of the outstanding master, but his name will forever remain in the most sincere and positive memories of grateful descendants. </p><h2>  Other Ukrainian scientists who have made an invaluable contribution to the development of world science </h2><p>  Ivan Puluy - is considered one of the creators of the apparatus, which today is usually called "x-ray." </p><p>  Vladimir Khavkin - the creator of the vaccine against plague and cholera. </p><p>  Yuri Voronoi - made a kidney transplant. </p><p>  Vyacheslav Petrov - was engaged in the creation of a compact disc. </p><p>  And, of course, Leonard Kleinrock, who participated in the creation of our beloved Internet. </p>

I would like to hope that every distinguished name will not remain undeservedly forgotten and will forever remain in the memory of grateful descendants. </p>
