In its capital city of Kerkyra, approximately 115 thousand people live.  An interesting fact is that initially the island bore the name of this city.  That was the name of the beautiful nymph that Poseidon stole and brought to live here.  In Corfu, she bore him a son, Feak, who later became the leader of the people of the <span>greatest sailors.</span>  A dry and hot climate is one of the reasons why tourists choose a holiday in Corfu.  It is located between Greece and Italy, which largely affected its culture. </p><p>  The island is strewn with flowers, olive groves, acacias and citrus plants.
