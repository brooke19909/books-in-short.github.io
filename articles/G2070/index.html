A huge medieval power arose in the 9th century as a result of the unification of East Slavic and Finno-Ugric tribes.  During its heyday, Kievan Rus (in the 9-12th centuries) occupied an impressive territory and had a strong army.  By the middle of the XII century, the once powerful state, due to feudal fragmentation, split into separate <span>Russian principalities.</span>  Thus, Kievan Rus became easy prey for the Golden Horde, which put an end to the medieval power.  The main events that took place in Kievan Rus in the 9-12th centuries will be described in the article. </p><h2>  Russian Kaganate </h2><p>  According to many historians, in the first half of the IX century on the territory of the future Old Russian state there was a state formation of Rus.  Little information has been preserved about the exact location of the Russian Haganate.  According to historian Smirnov, public education was located in the region between the upper Volga and Oka. </p><p>  The ruler of the Russian Haganate bore the title of Hagan.  In the Middle Ages, this title was very important.  Kagan ruled not only over nomadic peoples, but also commanded over other rulers of different nations.  Thus, the head of the Russian Haganate acted as the emperor of the steppes. </p><p>  By the middle of the 9th century, as a result of specific foreign policy circumstances, the Russian Haganate was transformed into the Great Russian reign, which was weakly dependent on the Khazaria.  During the reign of the <span>Kiev princes</span> Askold and Dir managed to completely get rid of oppression. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2142961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2142961.jpg?1572079529"></div><h2>  Rurik Board </h2><p>  In the second half of the 9th century, East Slavic and Finno-Ugric tribes, because of fierce hostility, called the Vikings overseas to reign on their lands.  The first Russian prince was Rurik, who began to rule in Novgorod in 862.  The new state of Rurik lasted until 882, when Kievan Rus was formed. </p><p>  The history of the rule of Rurik is full of contradictions and inaccuracies.  Some historians are of the opinion that he and his squad are of Scandinavian origin.  Their opponents are supporters of the West Slavic version of the development of Russia.  In any case, the name ‚ÄúRus‚Äù in the X and XI centuries was used in relation to the Scandinavians.  After the Scandinavian Varangian came to power, the title ‚Äúkagan‚Äù gave way to the ‚ÄúGrand Duke‚Äù. </p><p>  In the annals of scarce information about the rule of Rurik.  Therefore, praising his desire to expand and strengthen state borders, as well as to strengthen cities, is quite problematic.  Rurik was also remembered for the fact that he was able to successfully suppress the rebellion of <span>Vadim the Brave</span> in Novgorod <span>,</span> thereby strengthening his authority.  In any case, the rule of the founder of the dynasty of future princes of Kievan Rus made it possible to centralize power in the Old Russian state. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Prince Oleg </h2><p>  After Rurik, power in Kievan Rus was to go into the hands of his son Igor.  However, due to the small years of the rightful heir, Oleg became the ruler of the Old Russian state in 879.  The new <span>prince of Kievan Rus</span> turned out to be very belligerent and enterprising.  From the first years of his stay in power, he sought to take control of the waterway to Greece.  To achieve this ambitious goal, Oleg in 882, thanks to his cunning plan, dealt with the princes Askold and Deere, capturing Kiev.  Thus, the strategic task of conquering the Slavic tribes that lived along the Dnieper was solved.  Immediately after entering the captured city, Oleg announced that Kiev was destined to become the mother of Russian cities. </p><p>  The first ruler of Kievan Rus really liked the favorable location of the village.  The gently sloping banks of the Dnieper River were inaccessible to the invaders.  In addition, Oleg conducted large-scale work to strengthen the defense structures of Kiev.  In 883-885, a number of military campaigns took place with a positive result, as a result of which the territory of Kievan Rus was significantly expanded. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2142951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2142951.jpg?1572079529"></div><h2>  Domestic and foreign policy of Kievan Rus during the reign of Oleg the Prophet </h2><p>  A distinctive feature of the domestic policy of the reign of Oleg the Prophet was the strengthening of the state treasury by collecting tribute.  In many ways, the budget of Kievan Rus was filled thanks to requisitions from conquered tribes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Oleg‚Äôs reign was marked by a successful foreign policy.  In 907, a successful trip to Byzantium took place.  The key role in the victory over the Greeks was played by the trick of the Kiev prince.  Over the impregnable Constantinople threatened with destruction, after the ships of Kievan Rus were put on wheels and continued their movement on land.  Thus, the frightened rulers of Byzantium were forced to offer a huge tribute to Oleg, and to provide generous benefits to the Russian merchants.  After 5 years, a peace treaty was signed with Kievan Rus with the Greeks.  After a successful trip to Byzantium, legends began to form about Oleg.  Supernatural possibilities and a penchant for magic began to be attributed to the Kiev prince.  Also, a grand victory in the domestic arena allowed Oleg to get the nickname Prophetic.  The Prince of Kiev died in 912. </p><h2>  Prince Igor </h2><p>  After the death of Oleg in 912, her rightful heir, Igor, the son of Rurik, became the full-fledged ruler of Kievan Rus.  The new prince was naturally modest and respectful of his elders.  That is why Igor was in no hurry to throw Oleg from the throne. </p><p>  The reign of Prince Igor was remembered by numerous military campaigns.  After entering the throne, he was to suppress the rebellion of the Drevlyans, who wanted to cease to obey Kiev.  Successful victory over the enemy made it possible to take an additional tribute from the rebels to the needs of the state. </p><p>  The confrontation with the Pechenegs was carried out with alternating success.  In 941, Igor continued the foreign policy of his predecessors, declaring war on Byzantium.  The reason for the war was the desire of the Greeks to free themselves from their obligations after the death of Oleg.  The first military campaign ended in defeat, as Byzantium was carefully prepared.  In 944, a new peace treaty was signed between the two states, because the Greeks decided to avoid battle. </p><p>  Igor died in November 945, when he collected tribute from the Drevlyans.  The prince's mistake was that he released his squad to Kiev, and he himself, with a small army, decided to additionally profit from his subjects.  Outraged Drevlyans brutally dealt with Igor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2142973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2142973.jpg?1572079529"></div><h2>  The reign of Vladimir the Great </h2><p>  In 980, Vladimir, the son of Svyatoslav, became the new ruler.  Before occupying the throne, he was to emerge victorious from fraternal strife.  However, Vladimir managed to collect the Varangian squad after escaping ‚Äúoverseas‚Äù and avenge the death of his brother Yaropolk.  The reign of the new prince of Kievan Rus was outstanding.  Also, Vladimir was revered by his people. </p><p>  The most important merit of the son of Svyatoslav is the famous Baptism of Rus, which took place in 988.  In addition to numerous successes in the domestic arena, the prince became famous for his military campaigns.  In 996, several fortified cities were built to protect the land from enemies, one of which was Belgorod. </p><h2>  Baptism of Rus (988 year) </h2><p>  Until 988, paganism flourished on the territory of the Old Russian State.  However, Vladimir the Great decided to choose Christianity as the state religion, although representatives from the Pope, Islam and Judaism came to him. </p><p>  The baptism of Rus in 988 still took place.  Christianity was adopted by Vladimir the Great, close boyars and combatants, as well as ordinary people.  For those who resisted moving away from paganism, they were threatened with all kinds of oppression.  Thus, from 988, the Russian Church began. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2142955" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2142955.jpg?1572079529"></div><h2>  The reign of Yaroslav the Wise </h2><p>  One of the most famous princes of Kievan Rus was Yaroslav, who was not accidentally nicknamed the Wise.  After the death of Vladimir the Great Troubles embraced the Old Russian State.  Blinded by a thirst for power, Svyatopolk sat on the throne, killing 3 of his brothers.  Subsequently, Yaroslav gathered a huge army of Slavs and Varangians, after which in 1016 he went to Kiev.  In 1019, he managed to defeat Svyatopolk and ascend to the throne of Kievan Rus. </p><p>  The reign of Yaroslav the Wise was one of the most successful in the history of the Old Russian state.  In 1036, he managed to finally unite the numerous lands of Kievan Rus, after the death of his brother Mstislav.  The wife of Yaroslav became the daughter of the Swedish king.  Around Kiev, on the orders of the prince, several cities and a stone wall were erected.  The main city gate of the capital of the Old Russian state was called Golden. </p><p>  Yaroslav the Wise died in 1054, when he was 76 years old.  The reign of the Kiev prince, 35 years long, is the golden time in the history of the Old Russian state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2142957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2142957.jpg?1572079529"></div><h2>  Domestic and foreign policy of Kievan Rus during the reign of Yaroslav the Wise </h2><p>  The priority of foreign policy of Yaroslav was to increase the authority of Kievan Rus in the international arena.  The prince managed to achieve a number of important military victories over the Poles and Lithuanians.  In 1036, the Pechenegs were completely defeated.  At the place of the fateful battle appeared the church of St. Sophia.  During the reign of Yaroslav, the last time was a military conflict with Byzantium.  The result of the confrontation was the signing of a peace treaty.  Vsevolod, son of Yaroslav, married the Greek princess Anna. </p><p>  In the domestic arena literacy of the population of Kievan Rus significantly increased.  In many cities of the state, schools appeared in which the boys studied church affairs.  Various Greek books were translated into Old Slavonic.  During the reign of Yaroslav the Wise, the first collection of laws was published.  "Russian truth" has become the main asset of numerous reforms of the Kiev prince. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2142970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2142970.jpg?1572079529"></div><h2>  The beginning of the collapse of Kievan Rus </h2><p>  What are the reasons for the collapse of Kievan Rus?  Like many early medieval powers, its collapse was completely natural.  There was an objective and progressive process associated with an increase in boyar tenure.  The principalities of Kievan Rus appeared to know, in whose interests it was more profitable to bet on the local prince than to support a single ruler in Kiev.  According to many historians, at first, territorial fragmentation was not the cause of the collapse of Kievan Rus. </p><p>  In 1097, on the initiative of Vladimir Monomakh, the process of creating regional dynasties was launched in order to end the strife.  By the middle of the XII century, the Old Russian state was divided into 13 principalities, which differed in terms of area, military power and solidarity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-2142965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2142965.jpg?1572079529"></div><h2>  The decline of Kiev </h2><p>  In the XII century, there was a significant decline in Kiev, which from the metropolis turned into an ordinary principality.  Largely because of the Crusades, a transformation of international trade communications took place.  Therefore, economic factors significantly undermined the power of the city.  In 1169, as a result of princely strife, Kiev was first stormed and plundered. </p><p>  The final blow to Kievan Rus was dealt by the Mongol invasion.  The scattered principality did not constitute a formidable force for numerous nomads.  In 1240, Kiev was dealt a crushing defeat. </p><h2>  The population of Kievan Rus </h2><p>  There is no information about the exact number of inhabitants of the Old Russian state.  According to the historian <span>George Vernadsky, the</span> total population of Kievan Rus in the 9-12 centuries was approximately 7.5 million people.  About 1 million people lived in cities. </p><p>  The lion's share of the inhabitants of Kievan Rus in the 9-12 centuries were free peasants.  Over time, more and more people became stinkers.  Although they possessed freedom, they were obliged to obey the prince.  The free population of Kievan Rus due to debts, captivity and other reasons could become servants who were powerless slaves. </p>
