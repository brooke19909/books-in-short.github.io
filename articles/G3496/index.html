    <h2>  Briefly </h2><p>  The location of the beach is as follows: Vladivostok, Bezymyannaya Bay, stop.  author  Dalpress.  The distance from it to the place of bathing is small.  you need to go only 1 km.  Entrance to the beach is free. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The place for rest is equipped with everything necessary.  There is: </p><ul><li>  Locker room. </li><li>  Dry closets. </li><li>  Shower. </li><li>  Volleyball Court. </li><li>  Deck chairs. </li><li>  Playground. </li><li>  Sand beach. </li><li>  Summer cafes, barbecue area. </li></ul><h2>  History </h2><p>  Residents have long chosen Cape Kungasny - Vladivostok can be proud of it.  However, for a long time it was considered one of the least comfortable places for leisure activities.  There was scattered debris and dirt everywhere.  Local catering establishments were then accused of violating sanitary standards.  In 2014, Alexey Shlykov, General Director of Device Pro, decided to improve the city beach, turning it into a convenient and beautiful vacation spot.  For a short time, the territory was freed from garbage, illegal buildings.  The implementation of the project has begun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But during the transformation of the beach, the entrepreneur unexpectedly had to face problems.  At the height of the reconstruction, Cape Kungasny (Vladivostok) was closed for passage and access to water throughout the territory.  The townspeople outraged by this fact.  The prosecutor‚Äôs office began an audit, as a result of which the director of the company ‚ÄúDevice Pro‚Äù was charged with ‚Äúarbitrariness‚Äù.  Moreover, during the course of the work it turned out that a local gas pipeline runs through this territory.  The owners of the pipe literally drove off excavators from it.  And yet, in spite of everything, in the summer of 2014, visitors were able to enjoy a vacation on the renovated beach. </p>

    <h2>  Cape Kungasny (Vladivostok): beach.  Facilities </h2><p>  As a result of reconstruction, the beach has become a very convenient place for leisure activities.  It was equipped with several changing rooms, which, however, did not provide for the possibility of closing the doors.  To understand whether someone is inside, you can only look under the booth.  If someone‚Äôs legs are visible from below, you won‚Äôt be mistaken: there is really someone in the locker room.  But in each booth there is a mirror. </p><p>  The beach also has a free toilet.  It is not difficult to find him.  A huge sign informs everyone about the <span>purpose of the</span> structure.  Unfortunately, there is a rather strong unpleasant odor in the booths, and there is no toilet paper.  It was also decided to do without toilets here - they are replaced by an impressive hole in the floor.  Equipped showers, even bypassing the beach several times, are not found here.  Do not get into the room of the mother and child, because, as the security explains, it is closed for repairs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where can I eat? </h2><p>  Cape Kungasny (Vladivostok) has several summer cafes on its territory.  The first is almost at the entrance.  It looks more like a kiosk, near which plastic tables with chairs are installed.  The assortment is small: chocolate, several types of ice cream, soft drinks.  Nearby is a grill cafe, consisting of two arbors.  If desired, they can be rented by frying barbecue on an existing grill.  It should be noted that meat is allowed to cook only in this place, it is strictly prohibited on the rest of the beach area. </p><p>  Near the car park is another cafe.  It is more equipped: there are tables, gazebos and even menus.  Prices are relatively low, the cost of some dishes is even slightly cheaper than in urban establishments.  At the very end of the beach, another catering facility is being completed.  At this time, the territory still gives the impression of being <span>groomed</span> .  Reconstruction continues here. </p><h2>  What can you do here? </h2><p>  Cape Kungasny (Vladivostok), with the beach of the same name located on its territory, is ideal for families to relax.  There are trampolines on which children can jump for a small surcharge.  In addition, there are several play areas for toddlers on site.  Sports enthusiasts can use the large volleyball court located nearby.  It is fenced in on all sides by a net. </p><p>  Also, to the pleasure of vacationers, an original art object has been equipped - a heart with white and blue stripes, on which the inscription "Vladivostok" flaunts.  Vacationers, arriving at the beach, are often photographed against the backdrop of this exhibit and post photos on the networks.  The second part of the ‚ÄúHealth Shore‚Äù, a project organized by the city administration, has already been partially completed.  The beach is crossed by a wooden path equipped with lighting.  The plans for the trail are waiting for expansion and docking with the main site. </p>
