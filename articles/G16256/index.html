How to get to the Nurgush ridge?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the majestic mountain ranges of the South Urals is the Nurgush Range, located in the center of the Zyuratkul junction.  It is located at a distance of 200 kilometers from Chelyabinsk and 300 km from Yekaterinburg.  The nearest settlement is the village of Sibirka (about 7.5 km). </p><h2>  About the origin of the name </h2><p>  The name of the Nurgush Range in translation has a beautiful meaning.  It received its name from two Bashkir words: “nur”, which translates as “radiance”, “light” or “splendor”;  “Kush” or “kosh”, translated as “bird”.  Together, this means "a radiant and shining bird." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nurgush Range" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1981626.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Most likely, the view of this magnificent mountain range caused associations with a bird shining at a height.  Many see in the outlines of the slopes something like a flying bird, sparkling in the sun.  And the epithet about radiance is explained by the sparkling of quartzites in the sun. </p><p>  There is still a less poetic version of the name, based on the <span>Turkic-Mongolian language.</span>  In this case, the word "nuru" ("nura") means a mountain range. </p><p>  Local residents associate "nur" with <span>flying lights</span> surrounding the Nurgush ridge <span>,</span> the origin of which is unknown to them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Geographic location </h2><p>  The ridge is located between the Iremel mountain range and Lake Zyuratkul.  It connects with the Urenga and Berry Mountains ranges in the east.  The western neighbors are the Uvan and Moskal ranges.  Nurgush itself belongs to the central belt of the Southern Urals (Taganai-Yamantaus belt). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ridge Big Nurgush" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1981599.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  From the northeast, the ridge stretches from the city of Lukash to the southwest to the mouth of the Berezyak River.  The chain length is approximately 50 kilometers.  The average height is 1200 meters, with a maximum height of 1406 meters.  The highest point of the ridge is Mount Big Nurgush, which is also the highest point of the Chelyabinsk region. </p><p>  The mountain range belongs to the territory of the national park, called "Zyuratkul". </p><p>  Conventionally, the mountain range is divided into 3 parts or ranges: Small Nurgush, Sredny and Big Nurgush. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The Bolshoi Nurgush ridge has the highest monolithic mountains stretching in a chain.  Its tops are relatively flat, and the slopes are gentle.  The surface consists of many quartzite outcrops that take on a variety of forms: geometric cones and trapezoids, ridges, pillars, walls, and ruined ruins.  Slopes and peaks at heights of more than 1000 meters are covered with numerous curums.  Stone piles of various sizes are scattered along the slopes (from the smallest to stones weighing about 5 tons). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nurgush Range: Ascent" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1981623.jpg" width="600"></div>

Further along the height, the taiga gradually turns into a light forest, while some areas of the wasteland are occupied by placers of stones.  Here reigns forest-tundra with rare trees and lots of moss.  Then the trees disappear.  The uppermost part of the Big Nurgush is a mountain tundra.  The flattest part of the entire Chelyabinsk region, called the plateau, is located exactly on the top of this ridge.  Its surface, covered with moss, stones and lichen, covers an area equal to 9 square kilometers. </p><p>  Middle Nurgush looks more like a solid wall.  Its western slopes are very steep.  The heights of its peaks are lower than that of the Great Ridge.  Small Nurgush differs in more smoother forms of slopes than in the Middle Range.  And its individual peaks reach a height of 1000 meters.  The largest animals of the Ural forests are found here - elk and bear.  For example, the Urenga and Nurgush ridges are a real bear angle, where animals such as marten, mink, red fox, as well as about 150 species of various birds feel great. </p>

He goes through the village.  Siberia and through the former Olympia Cordon (now the Shelter at the Three Peaks of the National Park).  Here you can get quite comfortable while relaxing. </p><p>  You can also use the Yuryuzan-Tyulyuk road to get to Maly Nurgush and Sredny.  To do this, follow the sign (to Sibirka) to the old road that goes along the small river Bolshaya Kalagaz through the Olympia cordon (about 3 kilometers).  Then in Sibirka you should turn right to the fountain (an object in the form of an icicle is more interesting in winter). </p><p>  If you don’t turn, but head straight, you can get to the same Olimpiev cordon, where you can also take a halt, relax, however, the shelters are organized upon reservation. </p><p>  A path passes through the swamps to Middle Nurgush, if you get to it from the Tyulyuk-Meseda highway. </p><p>  The road through the Nurgush Range is quite accessible not only for walking, but also for off-road equipment and for bicycle transport.  Of course, you can travel here on skis and on foot. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It should be noted that one of the main goals of travel is to find the golden root.  It has long been believed that ginseng (Rhodiola rosea) Ural heals many diseases. </p><p>  Another interesting fact regarding these places is that it was possible to photograph the snowman for the first time in the world in the Nurgush region. </p>
