    <p>  But the will of the sovereign was nevertheless fulfilled by Alexander I, who began construction.  Mikhailovsky Palace in St. Petersburg was built thanks to the architect K.I. Rossi.  The building was planned to be created in the form of a Russian estate, consisting of the main building and two side wings.  In 1823, construction work was completed, and in 1825 the decoration began.  Remarkable artists, sculptors, furniture masters, and stone-cutters worked on the interior.  At the entrance to the building there is a wide staircase made of granite.  It is decorated with two lion statues on the sides.  In 1895, an order was signed by Nicholas II that the palace is now the Russian Museum of Emperor Alexander III. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the moment, visiting the building, you will see a huge collection of Russian art, paintings by famous artists such as A.

It consisted of fifty rooms, a large hall and gallery.  After the revolution, the Stroganovs were expelled from their family nest.  The palace was looted, the richest collections were destroyed. </p><p>  For many years, the building was used by government agencies.  And in 1990 it was given to the Russian Museum.

The name is given in honor of Princess Mary (daughter of Emperor Nicholas I).  Construction began in 1839.  During the construction, technical innovations were used, such as rafters made of metal.  The interior of the palace is impressive.  The architect created a suite of halls.  Inside the palace there was even a church, which was created in the spirit of Byzantine temples. </p><p>  After the February Revolution, various government departments were housed in the building for many years.  Since 1994, the Legislative Assembly of St. Petersburg has been located here. </p><h2>  Yusupov Palace in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  Initially, the palace was built for Count P.I. Shuvalov.  And then he went to Countess A. V. Brannitskaya.  After 35 years, the palace was bought by Prince N. B. Yusupov.  One of the best architects and decorators worked on the creation of the masterpiece. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mikhailovsky palace in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15383/396082.jpg" width="525"></div>

Today, tourists and residents of St. Petersburg are enjoying the sixth building of 1754-1762.  Each owner considered it his duty to make changes to the layout of the interior.  The best architects worked on the appearance - D. Trezzini, A.P. Bryullov, V.P. Stasov. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the palace was damaged and was reconstructed.

The order for the construction of a summer residence was given by Catherine I in 1717.  The building was planned to be recreated in the late Baroque style.  Everything was controlled by an architect from Germany, I.F. Braunstein. </p><p>  In 1743, <span>Elizaveta Petrovna</span> decided to expand and improve the palace.  I entrusted this to the Russian architects A. Kvasov and M. Zemtsov.  And in 1752, F. B. Rastrelli rebuilt the palace again, since the Empress considered that the building had become old-fashioned.  As a result of the grandiose dismantling, a modern palace appeared, which is made in the Russian Baroque style.  The architect makes a bold decision in the color of the facade.  He uses sky blue, combining it with white and gold. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="their palace in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15383/397604.jpg" width="600"></div>

The palace is considered the first building, which is faced with natural stone.  It was built for the favorite of Catherine III.  But, alas, G. Orlov did not wait for the end of construction, he died.  The apartments were left in the ownership of the imperial family. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Menshikov Palace in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15383/397603.jpg" width="600"></div>
