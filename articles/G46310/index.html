The new car is not only the pride of the owner, but also a tidbit for car thieves.  Therefore, it is necessary to foresee all modern protection measures in a timely manner.  Of course, it will cost a lot of money, but the result will pay off all expectations.  The production of anti-theft devices is improved every year, however, in the criminal world they do not stand in one place.  They constantly come up with different ways in order to freely take possession of the vehicle. </p><p>  Currently, to fully protect the car from theft, it is recommended to install a whole range of devices: alarm, immobilizer, mechanical protection.  Of course, they do not guarantee a one hundred percent result, but in most cases they stop the attackers. </p><p>  In this article, we will review a modern protective device - the Pandect IS-470 immobilizer, whose price is about 6 thousand rubles.  We will provide information on its principle of operation, configuration, advantages and much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pandect is 470" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1037948.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Immobilizer prescription </h2><p>  In order to understand what the essence of this device is, it is necessary to understand its purpose.  Installing an immobilizer allows you to block the motor, which interferes with the movement of the machine on its own.  Such devices protect not only from hidden penetration, but also from the capture of the car.  The immobilizer blocks and breaks all the main circuits, and this, in turn, leads to a complete stop of the vehicle.  It is worth noting that only the owner can start the car again, using the keychain tag. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pandect Brand: Introducing the IS-470 </h2><p>  Immobilizer Pandect IS-470 is currently considered the most high-end device.  It is a power relay (20 A) of small size, which is controlled by high-frequency signals (frequency 2.4 GHz).  The device is equipped with a high transmission rate (2 Mbps) with a low level of power consumption.  Manufacturers, using the latest developments in microelectronics when creating it, made it almost impossible: with small sizes, such an immobilizer has a reliable dialog radio channel, ultra-high protection against interception of the encoded signal.  Importantly, it is fully compatible with the standard wiring of all modern vehicles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="immobilizer pandect is 470" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1037957.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  Immobilizer control Pandect IS-470 is available only to the owner of the machine.  Activation and deactivation is carried out using a special digital key (keychain), which is an electronic circuit with a recorded special code.  It is large enough, so it is almost impossible for attackers to pick it up.  The circuit is enclosed in a special building.  To start the car, the mark must be within a radius of no more than 5 meters.  In its absence, the anti-theft device will allow you to make multiple attempts to start the engine.  However, at the beginning of the movement, the unit will be blocked, as well as additional elements for which the Pandect IS-470 immobilizer is programmed.  The instructions included with the device contain detailed information on the proper use of this device and its installation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that even in case of failure of the immobilizer, all vehicle systems remain locked and the attacker will not be able to continue driving.  Installation of Pandect branded devices allows for additional protection complete with standard alarms.  After all, they have a function to automatically turn on after a specified time interval from 10 to 60 seconds.  If the mark is not used during this period, the vehicle will be completely blocked. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pandect is 470 reviews" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1037976.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The Pandect IS-470 immobilizer consists of three main components: a control unit, a locking module, and key tags.  Also included is a bipper, batteries, case, grounding contact, plastic ties and an instruction manual (instruction). </p><ul><li>  The control unit is the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of this device.  It is to him that signals are sent about the need to activate the anti-theft system, all the regulatory and control functions are carried out.  It contains a microprocessor device that checks the key, and then delivers the appropriate enable signals. </li><li>  The blocking module is the executive element of the system.  It is he who, when applying the corresponding signal, opens and closes the circuit. </li><li>  The keychain tag is a contactless key that runs on two batteries.  As a rule, a special case intended for hidden carrying is sold with the device. </li></ul>

    <h2>  The difference between the Pandect immobilizer and standard devices </h2><p>  The installation of an immobilizer may not be required in most modern cars, as manufacturers have already addressed this issue and equipped the car with a standard device.  However, the principle of their operation is somewhat different from the Pandect IS-470 model.  The reviews of most drivers allow us to draw the following conclusion: a regular system is much easier for attackers to crack.  They immobilize without relays.  The device is interconnected with the engine injection system.  In the absence of a permission signal, the controller does not allow the engine to start.  Simply put, the lock is not carried out physically, but with the help of a software motor control system. </p><h2>  The new generation of anti-theft devices </h2><p>  Immobilizers are contact and non-contact.  The location of the former is known in advance by an experienced attacker, so such systems are almost never used. </p><p>  Today, the Pandect IS-470 immobilizer is popular, since it works on a non-contact basis.  Such an anti-theft tool is more difficult for an attacker to determine.  Moreover, a non-contact immobilizer with a wide range of action allows the driver to ‚Äúnot shine‚Äù his key at all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pandect is 470 price" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1037951.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Some tips </h2><p>  Installing an immobilizer will guarantee to protect your car from theft.  And in order to avoid unpleasant situations, you should follow these recommendations: </p><p>  1) Installation of the Pandect IS-470 immobilizer should be carried out only in special centers, ideally at authorized dealers. </p><p>  2) Before use, be sure to read the instructions. </p><p>  3) In order to achieve the greatest recognition range, the immobilizer must be directed parallel to the reader antenna, and the card perpendicularly. </p><p>  4) To avoid the loss of tags, you should have an active spare key, which is best stored separately. </p><p>  5) It is better not to wear the key fob from this device in a common keychain. </p><p>  Do not forget that installing the Pandect IS-470 immobilizer does not cancel the alarm.  Best of all, if the presence of such a device in the car will be unknown to others.  In addition, the immobilizer is not able to prevent the penetration of intruders into the interior of the car. </p>
