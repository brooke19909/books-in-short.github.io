As a new sport and as an unknown viral disease, this game captured not only dozens, but hundreds and thousands of people with its excitement.  Experienced embroiderers and beginners share their knowledge and tricks with each other in the process.  And in the end, everyone gets an unforgettable experience, an invaluable canvas that has bypassed several cities or even countries. </p><p>  The essence of the game is to create for each participant their own robin (the so-called embroidered canvas in this game).  She walks around each needlewoman in a circle, and she, in turn, leaves an embroidered pattern on her fabric section.  As a result, such panels return to their mistresses, but already filled with all the participating craftswomen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="round robin bust girls" class="if uuid-2527383" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2527383.jpg"></div><h2>  We deal with the name </h2><p>  To make it clearer, it‚Äôs better to start with the basics of theory.  The name of the game comes from the English language, in the translation "Round Robin" what does it mean?  The <span>concept is embedded in the content of the game.</span>  <span>This is a "circular</span> system <span>."</span>  <span>That is, all participants move in a circle to each new stage.</span> </p><p>  To make it even clearer, we will analyze in detail all the stages of this game, which is gaining popularity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="doidaporti.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="round robin frogs" class="if uuid-2527388" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2527388.jpg"></div><h2>  Who and how much </h2><p>  The first step is to determine the number of participants in the game circle.  If you decide to organize everything yourself, you will have to start with the preparatory phase.  The number of embroiderers can vary from two to infinity.  Although it is clear that the more people there are, the longer the round Robin game will take place.  But you should always know the measure.  The most optimal is considered from four to 10 participants.  If there are participants, then it is better to divide into groups for individual games. </p><p>  It is also worth deciding on a circle: acquaintances, friends, work colleagues, to unite city needlewomen, regional, and maybe affect several countries.  It is clear that the farther you live from each other, the longer the game will last in time (sending by mail between cities, and even more so countries). </p><p>  For the first experience, you can gather some close friends who are fond of the same hobby and work out before going to the big arena. </p><h2>  Your responsibilities </h2><p>  In addition to collecting participants in the embroidery game, on your shoulders (as an organizer), you will be responsible for collecting complete information and regulating contentious issues during the game. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="round robin lego" class="if uuid-2527386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2527386.jpg"></div><p>  That is, you will need to collect the correct postal addresses of each of the participants, regulate the forwarding of robins (from whom and to whom they are transferred).  It is better to have enough contact information from each player, for example contact mobile and home phones, electronic mailboxes, Skype or other types of communication.  Although this is a game, but everyone should feel responsibility to other needlewomen.  On your shoulders will be responsible for regulating the timing of the embroidery.  Yes, the only thing you will not affect is the speed of mail (here, of course, no one will help). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, pre-arrange with all participants the following points: </p><ul><li>  materials used (brand of threads); </li><li>  additional possible decorations (beads, rhinestones, sequins and so on), </li><li>  terms for embroidery of each stage (it must be borne in mind that someone works, someone on maternity leave, not everyone can afford to devote the game to Round Robin all day), usually two or three weeks are determined for one stage; </li><li>  allowable drawing sizes for each, it is better to try to make equivalent conditions; </li><li>  possible situations with force majeure (someone may get sick, delivery problems); </li><li>  other organizational issues. <div class="photo" data-original="blog.fiberholic.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="round robin christmas" class="if uuid-2527389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2527389.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  Such issues require a preliminary solution so that later conflicts do not arise.  Indeed, from the game you need to get only positive emotions. </p><h2>  Everyone needs to smash his head </h2><p>  Before the game in the "Round Robin", each participant contributes.  Not only the organizer solves all issues.  At the discretion of each embroiderer, a series of actions remains. </p><ol><li>  Acquisition of the canvas itself (it is better to clarify in advance whether anyone has vision problems in order to take into account the density of the tissue). </li><li>  Layout for future images.  Most often, they use the option where there is a division into squares or rectangles of the desired size (there is already even a standard 70 x 70 cells).  But this is your choice and your imagination, even in the form of stars. </li><li>  Selecting the theme of future drawings on the canvas for each of the embroiderers.  It can be: cats, dogs, teapots, flowers, angels, landscapes, village houses, but at least multi-colored balloons.  The remaining participants will create patterns on the fabric for your motives. </li></ol><h2>  Work process </h2><p>  Everything is agreed, prepared.  The matter is left to the process of the game "Round Robin".  Each of the participants creates the first plot on their canvas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="brownieschair.blogspot.com.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="round robin halloween" class="if uuid-2527385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2527385.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the picture, embroider the name, city, date or other information agreed in advance. </p><p>  After going to the package: </p><ul><li>  canvas; </li><li>  a notebook or notepad where other participants can leave any wishes, comments, personal opinions about the game, photos of the embroidery process, patterns, any comments. </li></ul><p>  At the agreed time, when everyone has finished their work, amicably sent to the mail to send to the next participant.  The organizer must carefully manage the forwarding scheme in order to avoid uncomfortable moments (two canvases to one player or an incomplete recipient address). </p><p>  The next participant, having received the envelope, proceeds to embroider the desired picture.  Again, the agreed completion date passes, again a valuable parcel is collected, and a happy walk to the post office.  And so in a circle, that is, through each of the Round Robin participants, each of the fabrics passes. </p><p>  At the end of the circle, the housewives get their canvas in their hands and enjoy the result.  Yes, enjoy, rejoice even more, because you participated in such an exciting game! </p><div class="photo" data-original="doidaporti.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="round robin birdies" class="if uuid-2527384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2527384.jpg"></div><p>  As a result, you can put the resulting work on the Internet as a whole company. </p><h2>  It is worth noting some nuances and notes. </h2><p>  For embroidery it is best to choose popular enough motifs so that other participants can easily find suitable patterns.  Otherwise, you will have to take care of yourself to create a drawing scheme for the rest and send them. </p><p>  For uniformity of the panel, pre-negotiate the selected brand of thread.  Pick the canvas, considering its future travels.  For the game it is better to buy high-quality fabric.  And the most optimal canvas in terms of density is Aida 14.  Do not strain the eyes of other participants in small cells. </p><p>  Mark the fabric preferably with threads.  A pencil or marker tends to wear off over time.  In addition, it is worthwhile to pre-process the edges of the canvas to avoid its shabbiness. </p><p>  Discuss embroidery techniques in advance.  Usually this is a cross, half-cross, tapestry.  Keep in mind that beginners also play an embroidery game. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sewscrapmuse.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="round robin girls" class="if uuid-2527387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2527387.jpg"></div><p>  Try to get in touch with other participants at least once a day.  After all, unforeseen questions can always arise. </p><h2>  Do you need a win? </h2><p>  Usually, the word ‚Äúgame‚Äù associates people with victory, the best result.  But the goal of the round robin game is to have fun, a souvenir and new friends. </p><p>  There are no losers or winners.  But from this the taste of excitement will not become less.  The essence of the ‚ÄúRobin Round‚Äù is to unite needlewomen from all over the world, expand their horizons and skills. </p><h2>  Variety for the sake of </h2><p>  This game is dedicated not only to craftsmen to embroider.  The essence of the game is communication.  The output is an original and unique plaid of connected squares, rectangles or other given shapes, as well as various paintings, panels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.purlsoho.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="round robin knitting hedgehogs" class="if uuid-2527382" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2527382.jpg"></div><p>  Do not stop there.  Your type of needlework can also be the reason for starting a new game in Round Robin.  Perhaps it is you who will begin the new species. </p>
