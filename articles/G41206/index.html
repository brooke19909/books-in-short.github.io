The spirit of liberty flows in the veins of the dignified Chechen nation.  For a long time, Dzhokhar Dudayev was an example of the unique willful nature of this small country.  The biography of the ruler of the <span>Chechen Republic,</span> as well as the fate of Chechnya itself, is quite rich and tragic.  The son of his proud nation defended the interests of his small republic until the end of his life.  What was he like, General Dzhokhar Dudaev? </p><p>  The biography of the highest elder of the first Chechen military operations leads us back to 1944.  It became very fateful for the Chechen population.  It was then that Stalin gave the order to expel Chechens from the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic to the Central Asian and Kazakh lands.  This action of the central authorities was explained by the fact that the male population of the Chechen state was engaged in robberies and robberies.  It was this year that Dzhokhar Musaevich was born, who in the future will lead the process for Chechnya leaving the USSR. </p>

    <h2>  The formation of the future commander </h2><p>  So, after the deportation, the Dudaev family found themselves in Kazakhstan (in the Pavlodar region).  How did Dudaev Dzhokhar Musaevich spend his youth?  A biography of a Chechen celebrity leads to the village of Pervomaiskoye, in the Galanocho district of the Chechen-Ingush state.  It was here that Johar was born.  In some materials, the date of birth is February 15, but there is no exact confirmation of this.  His father's name was Musa, and his mother was Rabiat.  They raised 13 children, the youngest was Dzhokhar Dudayev.  The family consisted of 7 children born in this marriage, and 6 children of the father from the previous marriage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The boy's father died when he was only 6 years old.  Johar was a diligent student, which cannot be said about his brothers and sisters.  Once, for his leadership qualities, he was elected the dominant in the class.  Upon returning to their native places, in 1957, the Dudaev family stopped without a father in Grozny. </p><p>  After leaving school (in 1960), Johar became a student at North Ossetian Pedagogical University.  He chose the direction of physical and mathematical.  But he studied there for only one year.  Where does Jokhar Dudaev go further? </p><p>  His biography continues at the Tambov Higher Military Aviation School, where he studied for 4 years.  During these years, Johar had to carefully hide his Chechen origin, calling himself Ossetian.  Only after receiving a document on education, in 1966, he insists that his true origin be inscribed in personal documents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dudaev Dzhokhar Musaevich biography" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42358/1623823.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Army and military career </h2><p>  In the combat units of the Air Force, Dzhokhar Dudaev began his military service.  Photos perfectly demonstrate his military bearing.  As soon as he graduated from a military school, he was sent as an assistant commander of an aircraft to the Shaykovka airfield in the Kaluga Region.  After 2 years of service, he joined the ranks of the Communist Party. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Where does the biography of Dzhokhar Dudaev go further?  Briefly it is worth mentioning his studies at the Air Force Academy.  Yu.A. Gagarin (1971-1974).  Dudayev‚Äôs track record included many military duties: deputy commander of an air regiment, chief of staff, detachment commander.  He was remembered by his colleagues as a highly moral person, sometimes a little temperamental and ardent. </p><p>  The armed conflict in Afghanistan also affected part of the life of the future general.  There he was the commander of the Tu-22MZ bomber and made combat sorties on it, although he later denied this fact.  Then for three years he served in the Ternopil Bomber Brigade.  After that, he became commander of a military garrison in Estonia (Tartu), where he was awarded the title of Major General of Aviation. </p><p>  What kind of commander was Dzhokhar Dudayev?  The biography suggests that he was a knowledgeable commander.  After the Soviet army left Afghanistan, he was awarded the Order of the Battle Red Banner.  Dudaev was distinguished by obstinacy, self-control, presence of mind and concern for his subordinates.  In the unit entrusted to him, strict regimen and discipline always reigned, the life of subordinates was always perfectly equipped. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="General Dzhokhar Dudaev" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42358/1623833.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Immersion in political activity </h2><p>  In 1990, Dzhokhar Dudayev began to chair the Executive Committee at the Chechen National Forum, held in Grozny.  A year later, he initiated the dissolution of the Supreme Council of CRI and became the head of the public movement for distrusting the government.  The general initiated the introduction of parallel management bodies, declaring deputies of Chechnya incompetent. </p><p>  After the August incidents in Moscow in 1991, the political climate in the Chechen Republic escalated.  General democratic organizations took power into their own hands.  Dudaev‚Äôs people captured the Grozny City Council, the airport and the city center. </p><h2>  President of the self-proclaimed republic </h2><p>  How did Jokhar Dudaev become president?  The biography of the general in the political channel was very rich.  In October 1991, he was elected <span>president of Chechen-Ingushetia</span> and announced the separation of the republic from the RSFSR.  In response to such actions, Boris Yeltsin decided to declare a particularly dangerous situation in Chechnya.  Dudaev, in turn, allowed the Chechens to acquire and store firearms. </p><h2>  The struggle for independent Chechnya </h2><p>  After the collapse of the USSR, Moscow no longer controlled the events in the Chechen Republic.  Ammunition from military units was stolen by private individuals.  In 1992, an unexpected change of power took place in neighboring Georgia.  Together with the Georgian leaders, Dudaev took up the formation of an armed organization of Transcaucasia.  The purpose of such a union was the formation of republics separated from Russia. </p><p>  Moscow made every effort to seat the Dudayev government at the negotiating table, but he demanded recognition of the independence of the republic.  In parallel, the same actions took place in neighboring Georgia, which demanded its independence.  Unofficially, the rulers of Saudi Arabia showed their affection for independent Chechnya, but they were afraid to directly support Dudayev‚Äôs power.  As president, Dudayev is visiting Turkey, Cyprus, Bosnia, and the United States.  The purpose of the American meeting was to sign agreements with the founders for oil production in the Chechen Republic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dzhokhar Dudaev family" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42358/1623836.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Loss of trust and support </h2><p>  After a year of Dudayev‚Äôs presidency, the situation in Chechnya is beginning to aggravate, disagreements arise in the position of parliament and the head of state.  Dzhokhar Dudaev decides to dissolve the parliament and impose a curfew.  At that moment, opposition forces began to form; the president was assassinated, but he managed to escape.  All these events entailed armed clashes. </p><h2>  Clashes in Chechnya (1993-95) </h2><p>  The summer period of 1993 in Chechnya turned out to be hot, the opposition forces had to retreat to the north of the republic.  There, the opposition formed its governing bodies.  Dudaev managed to ensure that Chechnya did not take part in the Russian State Duma elections.  But the contradictions within the reign of Dzhokhar Dudaev increasingly weakened his management.  The opposition formed the Provisional Council, which was headed by Umar Avturkhanov.  Dudaev began the active liquidation of the opposition, which was supported by Russia.  After the National Congress, which was held by Dudaev, it was decided to declare a "holy war" of Russia.  Thus began the first <span>Chechen war.</span>  The merciless struggle for independence of Chechnya is saturated with the biography of Dzhokhar Dudaev.  Briefly it is necessary to mention the creation of camps for him to keep people who disagree with his position. </p><p>  In December 1994, with the help of helicopters, the special services managed to liquidate Dudaev‚Äôs aircraft at the Grozny airport.  Opposition forces broke into Grozny, but could not gain a foothold there; Moscow needed support.  The head of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, ordered the destruction of illegal gangs in Chechnya, led by Dzhokhar Dudaev.  Such an order led to the tragic events in Budyonnovsk.  This is a city in the Stavropol Territory, which was elected by a detachment of militants under the command of Shamil Basaev to take hostages and present his demands to the central authorities.  As a result of such actions, 100 civilians of Budennovsk died.  The Russian authorities did not make concessions to Basayev‚Äôs detachment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="liquidation of Dzhokhar Dudaev" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42358/1650787.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Liquidation of Dzhokhar Dudaev </h2><p>  From the first days of the Chechen war, the Russian intelligence department kept the Generalissimo of the Chechen Republic under the gun.  There were 3 assassination attempts on him, and all failed.  The first ended with a miss of the sniper, the second - luck after the explosion of his car, the third - the timely departure from the building, which was subjected to air strike. </p><p>  In 1996, the parties to the confrontation reconciled briefly, Yeltsin even intended to recognize the independence of Chechnya.  But soon terrorists fired at a detachment of Russian soldiers near the village of Yaryshmardy, and the president instructed his head of security and the head of the FSB to destroy Dzhokhar Dudayev.  The operation was developed very carefully and various methods were thought out.  The "elusive leader" was especially careful. </p><p>  To carry out this operation, a special device has been developed that can perceive the waves of a mobile phone.  This device transmitted to the military the location of the subscriber.  The operation was carried out on April 21, 1996.  The developed device caught the location of Dudaev, and 2 SU-24 bombers flew there.  From the planes in the car where the Chechen leader was, several very powerful anti-radar missiles were launched.  This is how Dzhokhar Dudaev died.  Death occurred a few minutes after the shelling.  Next to Dudaev was then his wife Alla, but she managed to escape in a ravine.  Johar died in the arms of his wife.  The media announced only the next day that Dzhokhar Dudayev was liquidated (photo in the article). </p><h2>  Reaction to the death of Dudaev </h2><p>  The world press in great detail informed about the removal of the President of Chechnya.  So Dudayev Dzhokhar Musayevich was not able to fulfill his dreams.  The biography of a talented leader ended tragically.  Many journalists said that this campaign was carried out specifically for the re-election of Yeltsin for a second term.  Since then, Russia has taken a tough stance and offered the militants their conditions.  This led to the resumption of hostilities.  Chechen fighters decided to avenge the death of their leader by attacking Grozny.  For some time, the Chechens managed to keep the superiority of hostilities on their side. </p><p>  At that time, rumors circulated that the president of Ichkeria was still alive.  But all of them were dispelled after a videotape with the burnt corpse of Dudaev was made public in 2002. </p><h2>  The battalion in memory of the Chechen leader </h2><p>  In 2014, with the advent of confrontation in the eastern part of Ukraine, a volunteer armed detachment was created - the battalion named after Dzhokhar Dudaev (to carry out an international peacekeeping mission).  It was formed in Denmark from Chechens who emigrated from Chechnya after the end of hostilities there.  The battalion of Dzhokhar Dudayev was organized by the socio-political association "Free Caucasus" specifically to protect the interests of Ukraine in the clash in the Donbass.  The battalion assisted the Ukrainian army in the most fierce battles for the liberation of the <span>cities of Donetsk region.</span>  The most famous participants in this military formation are Isa Manuyev, Sergey Melnikoff, Nureddin Ismailov, Adam Osmayev, Amina Okueva. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dzhokhar Dudaev photo" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42358/1651474.jpg" width="479"></div>

    <h2>  Family life after the death of Dudaev </h2><p>  The activities of Dzhokhar Dudaev, like his person, even 20 years after his death are assessed ambiguously.  For a long time, rumors circulated that he managed to survive.  Only 5 years ago, special services declassified the data on its liquidation.  There is a version that among the commander‚Äôs entourage was a traitor who gave him away for $ 1 million. </p><p>  What was the future life of the Dudaev family?  The most famous is the youngest son - Degi.  One of the eldest sons, Ovlur, completely changed his name and surname and lived for some time in Lithuania under the name Davydov Oleg Zakharovich.  Then he moved to Sweden.  Daughter of Dzhokhar Dudaev - Dana - settled with her family in Turkey (Istanbul), does not communicate with journalists. </p><p>  After Dudayev‚Äôs death, Alla‚Äôs wife immediately tried to leave the country and go to Turkey, but was detained by Yeltsin‚Äôs order.  Soon she was released, and she spent three years with children in Chechnya, and contributed to the work of the Chechen Ministry of Culture.  Then the widow was in Baku for some time, then her daughter in Istanbul, then in Vilnius. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dzhokhar Dudayev Battalion" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42358/1623853.jpg" width="340"></div>
