You can relax here at any time of the year.  But most often, tourists rush here in the winter, when the local resorts have sunny and very hot weather.  In Thailand, there are several coastal cities that have their own tourist focus. </p><p>  But Pattaya is considered a universal resort.  Youth companies can stay here in an inexpensive hotel located in the city.  And families with children often choose luxurious complexes built right on the coast of the sea.  For example, a positive reputation among tourists has the resort InterContinental Pattaya 5 *, considered one of the best in Pattaya.  It is about him that we will tell in more detail in the article below. </p><h2>  Features of rest in Pattaya </h2><p>  Pattaya is a lively resort where life boils at any time of the year.  It is considered an inexpensive place to stay.  Therefore, tourists often flock here, trying to save on a ticket.  Its significant advantage is its proximity to Bangkok and a major international airport. </p><p>  Many tourists planning a vacation in winter are interested in the weather in Pattaya in February and January.  These months are considered the peak season of the holidays.  Then, in mid-March, the rainy season begins.  It is still hot at this time, but high humidity and cloudiness can ruin the long-awaited vacation.  But in February, the weather in Pattaya is often sunny and hot.  In the afternoon, the air temperature rises to 33-35 degrees, and the sea itself warms up to 27 degrees.  It gets a little cooler at night.  The temperature can drop to 25 degrees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pattaya is conditionally divided into several large areas, each of which has its own focus.  The northern part is suitable for a democratic holiday.  There are a lot of cheap housing, cafes and bars, but not much entertainment.  Central Pattaya is an ideal place for active tourists.  It is here that the whole resort life is seething.  A huge number of shops, bars, nightclubs and massage parlors are open everywhere.  But in this part of the resort, a lot of people always rest, and not all of them behave decently. </p><p>  If you want to find a quiet place to stay, then choose southern Pattaya in Thailand.  This is where the hotel described in the article is located.  It is here that tourists most often come with young children.  However, the cost of living in this area is significantly higher than in the north.  Often, it is here that the respectable 5-star hotels of Pattaya are located. </p><h2>  Where exactly is the hotel located? </h2><p>  Pattaya Resort is located on the east coast of the Gulf of Thailand in Thailand.  It used to be a fishing village, but now local beaches are considered one of the best in the country.  The hotel itself is built right on the coast, so you can get to the sea in just 5 minutes.  It is noteworthy that all residential buildings here are built on a hill.  Therefore, tourists have to constantly go down and climb the numerous stairs. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.9255763" data-lng="100.86239849999993" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/0/2/8/17028.png"></div><p>  It has already been noted above that the hotel was built in the southern part of Pattaya, therefore it is quiet and peaceful here, day and night.  The resort center is approximately 4 km away.  You can get to it by tuk-tuk, taxi or rented transport.  Near the hotel there are practically no large infrastructure facilities: restaurants, bars and shops.  From almost all sides, it is surrounded by other 5 stars Pattaya hotels.  Among them are such well-known complexes as Royal Cliff Beach Hotel and RCG Suites. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The nearest international airport is located near Bangkok.  The distance to it is approximately 90 km.  This is where most of the Moscow-Pattaya flights fly.  After landing, tourists get to the resort by bus or taxi.  The flight itself takes more than 8 hours. </p><h2>  basic information </h2><p>  This five-star complex was built in 2005.  But do not think that the hotel has an outdated room fund.  In the absence of an influx of visitors, cosmetic repairs are regularly held here.  The last of them was completed in 2016. </p><p>  The hotel itself occupies a large territory located on a hill near the seashore.  Its area is about 25,000 m <sup>2</sup> .  All of it is almost completely planted with tropical trees, shrubs and flowers.  For tourists, 7 four-story and 10 two-story residential buildings have been built here.  For secluded relaxation you can rent a separate villa.  There are only 2 on the hotel territory. At the same time, more than 350 tourists can stay in the complex, who are accommodated in 156 comfortable rooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotels.ctrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Open pool" class="if uuid-3205357" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/3205357.jpg"></div><p>  When buying a ticket, you can pay a paid transfer.  Then, after the flight on the route Moscow - Pattaya, a comfortable bus equipped with air conditioning will pick you up from the airport.  He will take you directly to the hotel.  Upon check-in, an identification card and a credit card are required.  The complex accepts tourists with children of any age, but registration with pets is strictly prohibited.  Check-in starts at 15:00.  After the end of the vacation, the living rooms must be vacated no later than 12:00 local time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  InterContinental Pattaya Resort: room description </h2><p>  For its guests, the complex has prepared a large selection of room categories.

Yes, the cost of living here is higher than in other Pattaya complexes, but this price is fully justified by the high quality of service.  In their reviews, they recommend it for a visit, although they indicate that the hotel has a number of shortcomings, but often they are not able to spoil the impression of a holiday.  So, in the responses they indicate the following advantages of the complex: </p><ul><li>  Excellent location right on the beach.  The beach can be reached in a couple of minutes.  Since the hotel is located on a hill, from the windows of the hotel you can watch spectacular sunsets every night.  The complex is remote from the central part of Pattaya, but tourists can get to it on a free shuttle, which runs from here at least 6 times a day. </li><li>  Large and well-groomed area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel, planted with tropical plants.  The staff carefully monitors it, timely cleaning up the garbage left by the guests. </li><li>  Spacious and clean rooms that have everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Maids do high-quality cleaning every day, without asking for tips. </li><li>  The polite and helpful staff of the hotel, who are always trying to please the guests.  When checking in, guests are treated to tea, and then taken to their room on an electric car.  All problems are resolved as quickly as possible.  All staff are fluent in English. </li><li>  Varied breakfasts.  A buffet is served every morning in the restaurant, which offers 10 types of hot dishes.  Among them are soups, salads, omelets, sausages and bacon, salted fish.  On the table, be sure to eat fresh fruits and pastries. </li><li>  The restaurant does not look crowded even during rush hours.  For all tourists there are always free tables and chairs. </li><li>  Near the pools there are always free towels, which can be taken without a deposit.  There are many beach loungers on the sun deck and beach.  Even if you come in the afternoon, you can find a free place.  Therefore, tourists do not need to occupy a deck chair in the early morning, as in other hotels. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="jp.trip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pool view" class="if uuid-3205354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/3205354.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel criticism </h2><p>  But the hotel also has its drawbacks.  In their reviews, tourists note that the service at the InterContinental Pattaya Resort is not ideal, unfortunately.  Therefore, before the trip, they recommend that you familiarize yourself with the negative feedback so as not to spoil your planned vacation.  What did the tourists most dislike about this hotel?  In the reviews, they indicate the following disadvantages of local service: </p><ul><li>  Lack of infrastructure facilities near the hotel.  Yes, it is close to the sea, but you can‚Äôt get a walk along the promenade or go to a restaurant here.  To do this, you will have to go to the center.  Fortunately, every day free shuttles run to him. </li><li>  The hotel rooms are very dark even during the day.  There are few lamps in the rooms, so they do not save.  Especially severe lack of light in the bathroom.  Tourists complain that in the dark it is difficult to shave and paint. </li><li>  On all buildings, external units of individual air conditioners are installed, which during operation are very noisy.  Therefore, to sleep with the windows open in the hotel does not work.  In addition, in the evenings, many insects appear on the territory. </li><li>  Although the beach at the hotel is completely sandy, the sea has a rocky bottom.  You need to wear special swimming shoes so as not to cut your legs. </li><li>  The sea itself cannot boast of cleanliness.  It is muddy and dirty, algae and small debris floating everywhere. </li></ul><p>  What conclusions can be drawn about the InterContinental Pattaya Resort?  Despite the shortcomings, it can still be called a great place for a family holiday in Pattaya.  Due to its favorable location and proximity to the sea, it can be recommended for tourists with young children.  But if you want to relax in a luxurious place, then it is better to look at other complexes.    -  ,   ,        . </p>
