She at one time took a leading position here in the sale of mobile phones.  To date, the authority of the company is not overwhelming, but still the company has a considerable percentage of sales from the total.  Mainly due to the budget segment.  Incidentally, Fly 452 also belongs to this category, an overview of which will be presented in the article.  Let's talk briefly about this model first. </p><h2>  Basic Provisions Concerning the Machine </h2>

    <p>  <span>Fly FS</span> 452 is a classic example of a company‚Äôs ill-conceived, short-sighted policy related to device names.  The IQ and EVO consoles are so widespread among the devices of the British company (and at the same time they are still combined with three-digit numbers) that confusing one smartphone with another will not be difficult.  And how to remember what you need, among such a variety?  First of all, the question of whether we need this at all should be answered.  What does all this say?  In addition, the British company FLY has recently applied a similarity policy not only to names, but also to the technical characteristics of its offspring.  Each subsequent device begins to copy the previous one.  Something similar can be seen at Microsoft.  If we talk briefly about what the <span>Fly FS</span> 452 can offer the buyer, then, first of all, it should be noted the low cost.  The device is based on the operating system of the Android family, has a quad-core processor, one gigabyte of built-in short-term memory and a pretty good main camera that records video in Full HD quality.  Now let's move on to this analysis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fly 452: specifications.  the main thing </h2>

    <p>  The device belongs to the class of smartphones operating in third-generation cellular networks.  The LTE module is missing.  Although for such a price this is not at all surprising.  The device carries on board not the latest, but still the current version of the operating system.  This is ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù version 4.2.2.  The device easily copes with multitasking mode.  The form factor is represented by a classic variation, that is, the case with us is a monoblock.  In the mode of alternate use in the device, you can use two SIM cards. </p><h2>  Memory situation </h2>

    <p>  Smartphone Fly 452 has one gigabyte of internal short-term memory and 16 gigabytes of flash memory.  It should be noted that in many models that are in the same market niche, you are unlikely to find identical characteristics.  More often, these are smartphones with a maximum of 8 gigabytes of long-term memory designed to store multimedia information. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  With the ‚ÄúRAM‚Äù there is nothing extraordinary.  Everything is as usual.  And if so, the indicator of long-term memory immediately cuts off a considerable number of competitive models at this stage.  Therefore, you can talk further with an eye on a limited number of smartphones.  It is unlikely that someone will not agree that this is an important parameter when choosing a device that is planned to be used not just for calls.  Since you decided to buy a device for eight thousand rubles, it‚Äôs clearly not about voice calls and text messages.  So, in addition, we can embed MicroSD memory cards with a maximum capacity of 32 gigabytes.  However, up to this point, as the reviews show, not all buyers reach.  Often the space provided on the phone is enough even for whimsical users. </p><p>  Smartphone Fly 452 differs from competitive models by this indicator, but the situation with RAM is not so rosy.  The fact is that you need to take into account the fact that part of this amount goes to maintaining the operating system and user interface.  Typically, devices with so many ‚ÄúRAM‚Äù leave from 600 to 700 megabytes of memory for applications.  But in this model, this indicator is at a lower level due to the fact that the shell resource consumption was not optimized by software engineers.  However, this does not always prevent the device from working in multitask mode without failures.  Rather, the failures themselves are an exception to the rule. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  The Fly 452 is equipped with a five-inch display.  If we talk about the screen matrix, then this is IPS.  The display itself is soundly made, the quality is felt.  We are already accustomed to the fact that, compared to previous-generation smartphones, the bar has been raised, and a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels does not surprise anyone.  And this, by the way, is HD quality.  Fly 452, the price of which is from seven to eight thousand Russian rubles, has a <span>capacitive touch screen</span> with a built-in function called ‚Äúmulti-touch‚Äù. </p><p>  Image scaling is available in just two tapas, while the device processes several simultaneous touches.  By the way, the developer did not say anything about any additional protection.  Therefore, if you want to protect your device from unintentional damage, we recommend that you purchase a cover for Fly 452, as well as a <span>protective glass</span> or, in the worst case, film for the screen. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2>

    <p>  As a power source in the device, we have a lithium-ion type battery.  It is designed for a capacity of two thousand milliamps per hour.  Actually, this is not so much, although if used wisely, the device will be able to live for a whole day.  If it is actively used, then the charge will be reduced to a minimum value for a period of five to eight hours.  Well, the developer spoke about this, by the way.  The indicators are as follows.  In third-generation networks, the smartphone works up to four hours, from the Wi-Fi access point for five hours.  Video and music, respectively, can play 5 and 20 hours.  And 8 - in continuous conversation mode.  As we can see, the indicators are not sky-high and are inherent, rather, in the gray mass of models that literally teem with the budget segment of the mobile device market. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  Much more interesting is the situation in this category.  The smartphone we are talking about today is equipped with two cameras: the main and the front.  It is very interesting that the phone, whose cost is estimated at about eight thousand, had a built-in lens that takes pictures with a resolution of thirteen megapixels. </p><p>  If we talk about the functions that the device has, then we can highlight digital zoom, as well as the function of automatic focusing on the subject.  Video is recorded in Full HD quality.  This is 1920 by 1080 pixels.  Near the main camera lens you can see the LED flash.  By the way, there is a small problem.  It illuminates objects well enough within a range of up to two meters.  Further almost nothing is visible.  But due to the fact that the section is slightly recessed inside the case, the lighting turns out to be uneven, which leads to the appearance of greenish marks left in the photographs taken.  If you often shoot in low light conditions, take this fact into account.  The rest of the photos are of good quality for a device of this class.  Now let's talk about the front camera.  Something special cannot be said about her.  She makes good photos, but this is typical for lenses with a quality of 1.6 megapixels.  So nothing new. </p><h2>  Multimedia features </h2>

    <p>  There is also nothing out of the ordinary.  Software is already integrated inside the device, such as video and music players.  There is also an analogue radio.  About the camera, we have already said that it takes images and shoots videos, but what image formats are read by our device?  This is, first of all, JPEG.  Next comes PNG and the three closes the GIF format.  This is the end of the list. </p><p>  Go to the video.  It's simpler: only 3GP and MP4.  But the list of readable audio formats is impressive.  But since the vast majority of files are now recorded in MP3 format, we will not list the rest.  It will only be logical to recognize that the files recorded through the recorder will also be recognized by the device, since this utility is built into the software.  According to the standard of text extensions, only TXT is perceived. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the device has a built-in Wi-Fi module.  It works in the b, g, and n ranges.  There is also ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù version 4.0.  The navigation capabilities are represented by a GPS receiver that works surprisingly accurately and deftly.  For synchronization with a personal computer or laptop, a MicroUSB standard port is provided, and for connecting a wireless stereo headset, there is an input of 3.5 mm format.  Here, in principle, is all that this smartphone model boasts of.  Once again, the device works in second and third generation cellular networks, but due to the lack of an LTE receiver, working with 4G is not possible. </p><h2>  Overall dimensions, equipment </h2><p>  With a height of 145 millimeters, the width and thickness of the device are respectively 72 and 85 millimeters.  The mass of the device is 158 grams.  In addition to the smartphone itself, the package includes, of course, all the necessary documentation.  This is an instruction manual with a brief user manual, a <span>warranty card</span> for a period of two years, a certificate of conformity.  You can immediately find the energy source represented by a lithium-ion battery with a capacity equal to two thousand milliamps per hour.  To connect to a personal computer, a MicroUSB standard cable - USB 2.0 is included in the package.  A wired stereo headset is present. </p><h2>  Fly 452. Reviews </h2><p>  Judging by the comments of those people who purchased this model of smartphone, the main problems of the device are in its software.  If you install <span>custom firmware</span> instead of the factory one, some of the problems can be solved.  This applies primarily to the volume of the phone itself.  Nevertheless, the camera does not pull at the claimed 13 megapixels even after installing the appropriate software, although it takes fairly good pictures.  Yet something is missing, and that is a fact. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  Sometimes there are not enough color indicators that would indicate that voice calls or text messages have been missed.  But this problem is solved by installing the application from the store.  It will highlight the screen in this case.  Another drawback is the lack of RAM with very heavy workload.  Although the multitasking mode is stated, the concept of multitasking is extensible.  You can use three applications, or ten.  It is clear that the performance in these two cases will be different.  Among the advantages are a high-quality screen and a good processor. </p>
