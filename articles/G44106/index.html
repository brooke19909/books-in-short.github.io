However, to swim, sunbathe on the beach or fish, it is not necessary to go on a long journey.  In our country there are many places where you can also organize an excellent beach holiday on the shores of a picturesque lake.  Sverdlovsk region is no exception.  There are more than a dozen beaches in the vicinity of Yekaterinburg where you can have an excellent time - swimming, sunbathing, boating or <span>jet skiing.</span>  If you are attracted to the lakes of the Sverdlovsk region, Peschanoe will probably be the best option.  At least for the reason that it is located almost in the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sandy lakes of the Sverdlovsk region" class="if" height="215" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/298580.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Despite its name, the bottom of the lake and most of its coastline are rocky.  So the name of the reservoir is not entirely true. </p><p>  The surface area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSandy does not exceed half a square kilometer.  The coastline is approximately two and a half kilometers long.  The average depth of the reservoir is about one meter, although in some places it can reach a mark of 3.5 meters.  Only one small rivulet flows out of the lake - Berezovka, and the Cherny stream flows into it.  However, like other lakes in the Sverdlovsk region, Peschanoe feeds on the surface and <span>groundwater.</span>  In shape, it resembles a rectangle with dimensions of 800x500 meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Like many other <span>lakes in the Sverdlovsk region,</span> Peschanoe has the status of a hydrological natural monument of regional significance.

    <p>  <strong>History of Peschanoe Lake</strong> </p><p>  Now it is quite difficult to reliably establish when the <span>Peschanoe lake was</span> formed <span>.</span>  Sverdlovsk region, according to scientists, was once at the bottom of a large lake, the size of which is not inferior to the sea.  The reason for this was a huge glacier that did not allow the waters of the Ob and Yenisei to reach the Arctic Ocean.  The liquid accumulated at the edge of the glacier formed this large natural reservoir.  Over time, the water left, leaving sediment at the bottom, including sand, which now exists along the shores of Lake Peschanoe. </p><p>  If we talk about a later period, then on the shore of Lake Peschanoe in July 1951, the Burevestnik sports and recreation center UGTU-UPI was formed, subsequently renamed the Peschanoe sports and recreation complex.  Then a recreation center for the forestry institute and a pioneer camp appeared here.  After summer houses were intensively built around the lake in 1970, the waters of Lake Peschanoe began to become polluted.  Moreover, this was expressed not only in intensive "flowering" and siltation of the bottom, but also in the deterioration of bacteriological indicators.  In the second half of the nineties, the eastern part of the coast was partially cleared and landscaped, but since then entry into this territory has become paid.  And therefore, in order to get to the Peschanoe lake, sometimes many kilometers of traffic jams line up.  This is especially true for summer weekends. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And yet, Peschanoe Lake is extremely popular among local tourists and vacationers.  Its waters are distinguished by their transparency, and on the shore there are many beaches, separated by beds of small streams and piles of massive granite boulders. </p><p>  According to most tourists who have visited Peschanoe Lake (Sverdlovsk Region), photos of local surroundings are strikingly reminiscent of Switzerland - the same low, forest-covered mountains.  To the north of the lake is Mount Pshenichnaya, having a height of 427 m, and the picturesque Mount Ostrya has joined its western outskirts. </p><p>  In addition, like many other famous lakes of the Sverdlovsk region, Peschanoe is popular among local fishermen.  Minnow, crucian carp, perch, chebak and pike are found in the lake.  Although, compared with other reservoirs, fish are much smaller. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sandy lake Sverdlovsk region photo" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/298738.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  <strong>How to get to Peschanoe lake?</strong> </p><p>  The reservoir is located near the regional center of Yekaterinburg.  To get to the place, you must move along the Moscow highway towards n.  Severka, beyond which there is an asphalt road leading directly to the lake. </p><p>  As for public transport, it is best to get here by train, next to the station.  Severka (direction Kuzino, Shalya, Shamara), and then walk about four kilometers. </p>
