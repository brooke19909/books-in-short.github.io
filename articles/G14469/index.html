  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The origin of oil, its production and use</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most significant <span>minerals</span> is oil.  This is an oily liquid of black color, which refers to the category of flammable substances.  The color of the oil may vary slightly depending on the area in which it is produced.  There is yellow, brown, green, cherry and even transparent appearance of this fossil.  The smell of oil can also vary depending on the chemical composition, which includes hydrocarbons and impurities of other compounds.  These are some common characteristics.  And now a little about what the origin of oil is. </p><p>  In the process of studying it, it turned out that the formation of this substance can last up to 350 million years.  This is a very long process.  Many scientists adhere to the version of the organic origin of oil.  This is a biogenic theory. </p><p>  Its meaning is that the basis of this process are the remains of microorganisms that lived many millions of years ago.  Their habitat is water, mainly in shallow water.  As a result of the death of microorganisms, layers with a high content of organic substances accumulated.  Since the origin of oil is a long process, over time, these layers sank deep into the earth.  There they were affected by the upper layers, which caused an increase in temperature.  The biochemical processes that occur in this case, against the background of a lack of oxygen, converted <span>organic substances</span> to hydrocarbons. </p><p>  <span>These hydrocarbons</span> were in a different physical state.  Some were motionless and solid.  The other part was in a liquid or gaseous state.  As a result of the pressure, she moved up through the <span>rocks</span> that could be overcome. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As soon as hydrocarbons collided with impermeable formations, the movement ended.  Thus, their mass accumulation appeared.  This place became a mine.  This is the organic origin of oil. </p><p>  Oil has been known to people since antiquity.  But initially it was collected exclusively from the surface.  If the oil flows did not meet any special underground obstacles, then they made their way up.  In those days it was used not so actively.  Oil was added to the mortar in the mixture for building construction for better sealing.  It was also used as a medicine to combat skin diseases.  To a lesser extent, oil was used as fuel. </p><p>  After the invention of the <span>kerosene lamp, the</span> demand for fuel increased significantly.  Extracting kerosene from this fossil was the cheapest way.  People are interested in the origin of oil.  Thus began the development of the oil industry. </p><p>  The first <span>oil rig</span> was drilled in Baku in 1847.  Over time, it became a city where there were already several wells. </p><p>  Methods of oil production in those days were manual.  But in the fall of 1864 there was a transition to a mechanical shock-rod method.  At the same time, a steam engine was used to power the drilling station. </p><p>  Oil drilling laid the foundation for the extraction of this mineral in a cheaper way. </p><p>  Water, which is contained in oil, has a high density.  Therefore, oil is located above water.  And gas is lighter than oil, so it sits above oil.  When <span>developing wells,</span> sometimes in the first place gas appears. </p><p>  Oil can be from several tens of meters to 5 kilometers inland.  In this interval, oil and gas are found in different proportions.  The lower the production, the more gas. </p><p>  Those places where oil lies are called reservoirs. </p><p>  Oil is one of the most important minerals.  Its value is difficult to overestimate.  The economic stability of the state depends on the availability of oil in the natural resource complex of the state. </p>
