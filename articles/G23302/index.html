    <h2>  Bodrum, Gumbet, Bitez </h2><p>  This city is unique in its attractions.  The castle, beautiful museums, trips in the surroundings on wooden boats, picturesque islands and rocks - all that your soul desires!  Therefore, many tourists, getting here, book themselves an "azure journey" - a real sea cruise to the local beauties.  Well, and, of course, it is worth visiting one of the <span>seven wonders of the world,</span> located nearby - Halicarnassus.  Shopping here is fascinating, but quite expensive for Turkey.  If you are looking for something authentic, take a trip to the village of Chokmagdak.  Here you can look at how the Turks live “in the outback”, as well as watch how to manually make silk and weave carpets.  On the island of Kara Ada (Black) you can visit the hot natural springs.  And if you have a “Schengen” and time, you can even take a ferry to Greek Rhodes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The best beaches of the resort are located in the bays of Gumbet and Bitez.  The first of them is very close to the airport, as well as to numerous entertainment centers.  In addition, beaches are better here than in Bodrum itself, and very picturesque cliffs overgrown with pine trees.  This place has long been chosen by European youth, but Russian tourists are also increasingly coming here.  The nearby Bitez Bay, resembling a crescent shape, has a blue flag for the cleanliness of the beaches, and the slopes of its mountains are completely covered with citrus.  There are many secluded places, and the rest is calmer than in Gumbet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Riva bodrum resort 4 Bodrum" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/623558.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Five Star Hotels </h2><p>  Bodrum hotels stretched as much as twenty-five kilometers.  This is evidenced by the resort map of hotels.  Bodrum (Turkey) is a fairly old resort, and hotels began to be built here since the seventies of the last century.  In the city itself there are small budget "treshki", and outside it - upscale palaces.  Many Bodrum "five stars" hotels are better than Antalya.  They work both with the all inclusive and ultra systems.  In Gumbet there are also quite a few such hotels.  The best of these is WOW Bodrum Resort.  A huge territory, a lot of services and entertainment, its own water park ... No wonder it tops the rating of Bodrum hotels.  A lot of services and interesting bonuses can be offered by this hotel even to the most avid sybarites.  The first places in the reviews are also occupied by Kariya Princess and Ersan Resort and Spa. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bodrum 4 star hotels.  Budget hotels </h2><p>  The “fours” of the resort are good for those tourists who want to get excellent service for little money.  Almost all of them have excellent stylish rooms with all necessary equipment, cosmetics and even a bathrobe with slippers.  Near the sea there are many such Bodrum hotels.  Line 1, of course, is mainly occupied by the Fives, but also a place near the beach was found for the Quartet.  Therefore, most hotels of this class offer their guests snacks and drinks on the beach.  Sun loungers and sunbeds for guests are free, the beach is clean and equipped.  Examples include hotels like Bodrum Boutique, Salmakis, and Latania Beach Resort.  In Gumbet, because of the rocky and mountainous terrain, “fives” are located on the first line.  But the Quartet often use their beaches and even sometimes bars, and they provide their guests with a free shuttle to the sea.  Gumbet's “treshki” are located even further from the sea.  Here, the price of accommodation is lower, the territory too, and there is practically no animation.  But its absence is compensated by the proximity to the discotheques and nightclubs of the village. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews Riva bodrum resort 4" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/623572.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews: Riva Bodrum Resort 4, what they write about it </h2><p>  This hotel is preferred by local residents and Europeans for relaxation.  So far, there are not so many Russian tourists.  In general, the holiday in Bodrum itself, as many tourists write, does not resemble Turkey, but rather Greece.  Many historical monuments, beautiful architecture.  In the evenings, you can go to Gumbet, smoke a hookah, admire the night city, and then return by minibus.  Near the hotel there are streets with souvenirs, night clubs, restaurants by the sea.  The attitude of the staff towards the vacationers is very decent and welcoming.  They respond to all claims adequately and efficiently.  Wifi catches even at sea.  There are a lot of youth to whom such a vacation is very suitable.  The hotel is budget, the food is good, the service is "five", the management is sensible. </p>
