It is a good opportunity for citizens to use the various services of this bank, without leaving home.  If you open your personal account on the official website, you can almost completely eliminate the need to visit the offices of this financial institution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cardoteka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to register with Sberbank via phone" class="if uuid-2989720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2989720.jpg"></div><p>  So, we’ll figure out how to register with Sberbank Online. </p><h2>  Registration Terms </h2><p>  For successful registration, you must first be a client of this banking institution.  This means that the user is either a cardholder or has a bank account. </p><p>  The second main requirement is the availability of the activated Mobile Bank service, which is necessary in order to receive a one-time password and the right to confirm operations.  You can connect such a service: </p><ul><li>  using any ATM of Sberbank; </li><li>  in person visiting a bank branch; </li><li>  using the contact center. </li></ul><h2>  The registration process in your account (step by step instructions) </h2><p>  Signing up for Sberbank Online is quite simple.  You can do it yourself.  To do this, go to the official website of this organization on any gadget or PC.  On the left side of the main page of the site there is a form for authorization, and a button below for registration is located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="caribbeannewsservice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank register in the computer" class="if uuid-2989712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2989712.jpg"></div><p>  Entrance is the first step.  After that, the bank card number is entered in the appropriate window and the "Continue" button is pressed.  After this procedure, an SMS message with a code will be sent to the client on the phone number that was specified when the Mobile Bank application was connected.  It will be necessary to enter it in the appropriate line, and click the “Continue” button again.  This is the next step to register with Sberbank in your personal account. </p><p>  And the last: after checking the password by the operating system, the client should be prompted to enter a username, email and password.  Previously, they were automatically issued by the system.  Many clients complained about the inconvenience and complexity of logins and passwords.  Not so long ago, Sberbank worked on this issue, and users were given the opportunity to invent such data on their own.  However, a number of specific requirements are put forward for the username and password. </p><p>  So, to register in the personal account of Sberbank, you need a username and password. </p><h2>  Login and Password Requirements </h2><p>  The login must contain at least 5 Latin characters or Cyrillic letters, including uppercase letters, as well as numbers.  More than three identical characters in a row should not be.  Symbols such as “dash”, “dog”, “dot” and “underscore” are not allowed in the username. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pymnts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to register with Sberbank" class="if uuid-2989713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2989713.jpg"></div><p>  Password Requirements: </p><ul><li>  it must consist of at least 8 characters and not coincide with the login; </li><li>  do not contain more than three identical characters in a row; </li><li>  do not have more than three characters that are in the same row on the keyboard.  For example, the letters WDRP or the numbers 4567. </li></ul><p>  In password, unlike login, you can use almost any character.  The more difficult the client will come up with a password, the more reliable.  When you create it, an indicator of complexity will be indicated under the corresponding line.  Ideally, it should be green.  This is how you can register on a computer at Sberbank Online. </p><h2>  Login </h2><p>  After creating an account with a username and password, you can proceed to authorization.  In order to get into your personal account, on the main page of the official website you must enter the above information.  After that, using the already activated Mobile Bank service, a one-time password and notification of entry should automatically come to the phone number.  It will also need to be entered in the appropriate field.  The introduction of a one-time password is necessary in order to confirm the identity of the user. </p><div class="photo" data-original="creditsoviets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank register in personal" class="if uuid-2991034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2991034.jpg"></div><p>  If a similar SMS message arrives on the phone and the user doesn’t log in to Sberbank Online, it is recommended to call the bank immediately. </p><h2>  Interface and functional features of your personal account </h2><p>  The functionality of this system is quite extensive.  So, for example, using this service you can pay various bills, open deposits, arrange loans, order cards, receive statements on debit or credit cards and much more.  Such services can be used through the main menu. </p><p>  In the top ribbon, it’s easy to jump between sections: </p><ul><li>  “Deposits and accounts”; </li><li>  “Payments and transfers”; </li><li>  “Credits”; </li><li>  "Cards"; </li><li>  "Other". </li></ul><p>  It is not advisable to dwell on each point.  In the "Other" section, you can select the subsections: "Certificates", "Insurance", register on the website of the State Service, get acquainted with some pension programs, etc. </p><p>  The center of the main menu provides information about accounts and cards.  In addition to the card number or balance, you can request a more extensive amount of information.  For example, you can get a statement for each card or account, in which all the latest transactions will be indicated. </p><h2>  Settings </h2><p>  To set up Sberbank Online, you need to click on your surname (profile picture) or on the “Gears” icon on the main page of your personal account, which are located in the upper right corner.  Here you can adjust the security, interface, your profile, alerts, Mobile Bank and applications.  In the "Personal Information" section, you can change your data, add or remove an avatar, set up alerts and notifications. </p><div class="photo" data-original="litbang.kemendagri.go.id" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank register in your account" class="if uuid-2989708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2989708.jpg"></div><h2>  Auto Payment Connection </h2><p>  Another useful function of this service is the connection of auto payments and the creation of templates, so that you do not need to constantly enter the same details to pay any bill or make a money transfer.  For those who use a bank card to pay for telephone, utilities or the Internet, it will be even easier to activate auto payment.  As soon as the user is billed, the necessary amount of money is automatically deducted from the card to pay for a particular service.  This eliminates the need for users to manually pay all bills. </p><p>  In addition, there is a section in the Sberbank Online system, after which you can change the settings.  Here you can set the parameters that are most convenient for the user, or change any information. </p><p>  How to register with Sberbank Online in a mobile application? </p><h2>  Mobile app </h2><p>  For customers who need access to the service outside the home, there is a special mobile application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sberbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="register in your account" class="if uuid-2991033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2991033.jpg"></div><p>  Many people ask how to register via phone at Sberbank Online. </p><p>  You can install the application on devices with Android and iOS operating systems.  In terms of functions and other features, such an application is in no way inferior to the main version of Sberbank Online.  If we talk about security, the full version of the service requires confirmation with an SMS code, and the mobile application uses either its own password, or a face scan, or a fingerprint, if the mobile device supports such functions.  Before that, you need to register your face or fingerprint in the system. </p><p>  We examined how to register with Sberbank Online. </p>
