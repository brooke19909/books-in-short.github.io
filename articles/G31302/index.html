But a fascinating journey to the Alps, during which guests of the country will get acquainted with unusual sights, will give an unforgettable experience. </p><p>  Those who have visited iconic tourist destinations in Italy admit that they experienced a feeling of disappointment due to the huge number of tourists who prevented them from enjoying the cultural heritage of a state with ancient history.  Therefore, many think about visiting no less interesting, but more comfortable cities located in the north of a diverse country. </p><h2>  The history of the ancient city </h2><p>  In our article, we will consider a wonderful corner, which is called the heart of the Italian Alps.  In a calm city, deprived of crowds of tourists, you can fully feel the breath of history and feel the unhurried rhythm of life of the local population. </p><p>  Ancient Trento (Italy) is the administrative center of the province of the same name.  Located near the Austrian border, the city surprises with an unusual combination of diverse architectural styles.  Scientists suggest that the founders of the small settlement were the Gauls, who used the village as a place for defense against barbarians in the 4th century BC. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trento sights" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1330839.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Later this territory was captured by Roman legionaries, very interested in a strategically important area.  The province of Trento was part of Austria, Austria-Hungary, and after World War I joined Italy.  In the 50s of the last century, the region was granted wide autonomy, which affected economic growth.  The province is rapidly developing agriculture, food processing, trade and tourism. </p><h2>  <span>A reverent attitude</span> to ancient monuments </h2><p>  In the city of Trento (Italy), German, French, Austrian and Italian traditions were closely intertwined, affecting the appearance.  Local authorities are sensitive to historical monuments, so most of the sights are restored, and the buildings of the Renaissance epoch restored original pastel colors and all wooden balconies were repaired. </p><h2>  Amazing landscapes </h2><p>  The beauty of the surrounding nature of Trento will delight anyone who visits this tranquil Italian corner.  Amazing landscapes of majestic alpine peaks and mirror-like surfaces of wonderful lakes will make you forget about all the problems.  New forces come to a pacifying city in Italy, and proximity to nature will allow you to fully recover, forgetting for a while about a busy life in noisy megalopolises. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trento what to see" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1330881.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Trento: what to see? </h2><p>  The small city boasts attractions, the memory of which will remain in the hearts of tourists forever.  And the main historical monument is the old Gothic castle of Buonconcillo, striking with unusual beauty.  Built in the 13th century, Castello del Buonconsiglio served as the residence for the bishops of Trento. </p><p>  Italy is proud of the architectural ensemble, which became one of the most magnificent palaces of the time.  In a grandiose complex hospitably welcomed the person of royal blood and the heads of the Catholic Church. </p><h2>  A masterpiece of medieval architecture </h2><p>  Restored a hundred years ago, the example of medieval castle architecture, restored one hundred years ago, will surprise you with its stunning beauty from the inside.  It is known that the most famous artists of the country were invited to decorate the castle, painted the walls of spacious halls with colorful frescoes on biblical and mythological themes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trento italy" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1330859.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Now within the walls of the palace is a museum in which tourists freeze with delight in front of collections of stories about ancient and modern art and archaeological finds that reveal the secrets of history.  A visit to the gloomy dungeon, in which tortures and executions took place, makes us think about the transience of our lives. </p><h2>  Cathedral Square </h2><p>  In the center of the historical part of Trento (Italy) is the main square, resembling a square in its shape.  On the territory of Piazza Duomo there is a unique fountain, which is a symbol of the city.  Erected in the Enlightenment, it rises above the square, representing a magnificent sight.  This masterpiece of architectural and engineering thought impresses with masterfully executed statues, among which bronze Neptune seems to soar in the sky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trento province" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1330841.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another fountain that attracts close attention is located at the old house of Rell.  Above the oval pool is an image of an eagle appearing on the coat of arms of the city of Trento.  Sights in which the architectural aspect prevails over the main function of water supply are recognized as real decorations of Cathedral Square. </p><h2>  Frescoes on the facades </h2><p>  Famous for its frescoes on the facades of houses, the city is amazing with medieval buildings - the first painted buildings in Trento.  City visitors admire buildings with images created using an interesting technique of light and shadow. </p><p>  On the frescoes you can see the glorious heroes of Greek and Roman mythology, allegorical medieval figures telling about vices and virtues. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãin italy" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1330850.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Katsuffi Palace </h2><p>  The three-story palace, which retained its original appearance, was built in the 16th century.  The facade of the palazzo was generously decorated with frescoes with floral ornaments and scenes on biblical themes.  Unfortunately, the images suffered from the time and are poorly visible.  Two rows of windows of the spacious palace rest on cornices, and four entrances-portal with a rounded top attract attention. </p><p>  The hospitable city in Italy surprises all tourists with alpine flavor.  The wonderful climate and cultural and historical heritage make it incredibly attractive in the eyes of all foreigners who want to get acquainted with the north of the country. </p>
