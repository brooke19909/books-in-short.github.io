  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Types and forms of ownership in the modern economy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The modern world, as we see and know it, has certainly become such in the course of a long evolution.  This movement and development has touched all areas of life and the universe, starting with the development of man himself as an individual, and ending with rapid technological progress.  The development of the economy and production did not stand still, the types and forms of ownership changed.  They received their final outlines and definitions already at the turn of the twentieth century.  Over the course of the twentieth century, changes in the sphere of organization of property were not so progressive, unlike technological progress, but some types and forms of ownership were only slightly transformed and transformed. </p><p>  What types and forms of ownership exist today, and which of them dominate in various branches of production and industry? </p><p>  Property, as a <span>system of economic</span> relations in various spheres of life, involves a division into various types and forms of ownership, and the harmony of compliance with social and economic laws in modern society depends on this division.  Main types of property: </p><ol><li>  Primitive communal property. </li><li>  Slave ownership </li><li>  Feudal property. </li><li>  Capitalist ownership. </li><li>  Socialist property. </li></ol><p>  All types of property exist and determine a specific <span>socio-economic system.</span>  Today, other than capitalist and socialist, other types of property no longer exist, and these two types in their pure form are increasingly less common in the global economy.  Therefore, greater importance is given to various forms of ownership, which are closely dependent on existing types of ownership. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the modern economy there are three forms of ownership: </p><ul><li>  private </li><li>  state </li><li>  collective </li></ul><p>  These forms of ownership function in the modern system of economic relations not in isolation from each other, but taking into account their specifics, they are invariably interwoven and transformed.  As a result, mixed forms of ownership arise that successfully complement each other and make maximum use of the specific capabilities that were originally laid down in each form of ownership.  For example, forms of ownership in construction, especially in terms of building municipal or mass construction, often have a mixed form of ownership. </p><p>  Each form of ownership in a modern state has its own fields of application.  For example, <span>state ownership</span> successfully operates in an area where market regulation is limited.  The state and municipal forms of ownership are also closely intertwined within the framework of one form of ownership - the state one, and differ only in territorial grounds, where there is also a regional form of state ownership.  Disposed by this form of ownership are local authorities, and not the entire state.  All property under state ownership, municipal or regional, as a rule, cannot be sold or transferred to another person.  The process of exclusion can only be within the framework of privatization, as a result of which <span>private entities of</span> various forms of private property become the subjects of ownership. </p><p>  A very important problem in the development of all forms of state ownership is the overcoming of monopoly, which is characteristic of the administrative-command system.  Although the <span>economic phenomenon of</span> monopolism has also affected private property, in this case the state has all the levers of influence on private capital.  Be that as it may, but it is <span>private property that</span> is most effective in any area of ‚Äã‚Äãbusiness, and only it serves as a source of human well-being, a guarantor of his independence and freedom. </p>
