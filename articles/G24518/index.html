If you know the answer to this question, then you can easily understand how much this organization is conscientious, whether to invest money here, whether future retirees will receive their money if necessary.  In fact, the popularity of private pension funds in Russia is growing every year.  And the number of these organizations is increasing.

    <p>  The positive feedback from the Keith Finance non-governmental pension fund is received for its activities.  This company offers citizens the services of forming pension savings.  Or rather, their cumulative parts.  The case is transparent; the company does not offer any specific tasks or services.  This arouses customer confidence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, "Kit Finance" not only acts as a repository of money put aside for old age, but also allows you to slightly increase deposits.  This is a completely standard package of services of non-state pension funds.  And it attracts potential customers. </p><h2>  Country Distribution </h2><p>  The next indicator, to which some people pay attention, is nothing but the distribution of the organization throughout the country.  Kit Finance (Russia) also makes quite positive reviews in this area. </p><p>  This <span>non-governmental pension fund</span> has been operating in the country for a long time.  Its branches are available in every city.  Even in the smallest village.  We can say that the mentioned organization is a very large corporation in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="private pension fund kit finance customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1446512.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Many are eyeing the Kit Finance Fund due to the size of the firm.  After all, this is a guarantee that the client will deal with a responsible organization.  Or at least not with scammers.  In any case, the size of the pension fund inspires confidence. </p><h2>  Rating in Russia </h2><p>  The position of the organization in the ranking plays a huge role.  CJSC Kit Finance <span>(non-governmental pension fund)</span> receives good <span>reviews</span> for its position among similar firms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The thing is that this pension fund is in the top ten.  According to various sources, Kit Finance is a leader, but always different.  Somewhere he is nominated for 1st place, in some rating tables - for 2-3.  But, as a rule, this fund is considered one of the most successful in Russia.  And usually it is located in the top five. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jsc whale finance private pension fund reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1446515.jpg"></div>

    <p>  This situation is truly credible.  Just because the rating is not formed.  According to statistics, the most stable, reliable and profitable organizations are usually in the first places.  Therefore, most potential customers are interested in Kit Finance. </p><h2>  Trust level </h2><p>  But that is not all!  Due to its stable position, the fund receives a rather high level of trust from the population.  This indicator reflects how much potential and real investors trust the company. </p><p>  Accordingly, the <span>non-state pension fund</span> Kit Finance earns only positive <span>reviews</span> for the level of trust.  According to statistics, in 2016 it is equal to the indicator equal to the value of A ++.  Or, as indicated in some sources, - AAA.  This is the maximum level of trust in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf kit finance profitability rating and customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1446513.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In fact, statistics show that the organization is sustainable, reliable, promising and popular.  Nevertheless, sometimes some doubts arise.  After all, all companies have their pros and cons.  What should potential investors pay attention to besides the features already mentioned?  By what evaluation criteria do users often choose a particular non-state pension fund? </p><h2>  Return on deposits </h2><p>  For example, as already mentioned, these organizations propose to slightly increase the annual contributions made by clients.  It is by this criterion that some are determined by choice. </p><p>  Non-state pension fund "Kit Finance" offers high incomes.  But at the same time, the real picture is somewhat different from the promises.  And therefore, the profitability of Kit Finance is no different.  Some potential contributors indicate that they feel cheated. </p><p>  Why?  This is due to the fact that the NPF itself offers a yield of about 10-11% per annum.  But in practice, this indicator is much less.  It in 2016 is about 7-8%.  There is an explanation for this phenomenon - inflation.  But with all this, as has already been emphasized, some feel cheated.  A similar situation is found in all non-state pension funds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="private pension fund whale finance income" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1446514.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Nevertheless, Kit <span>Finance (Moscow)</span> receives <span>feedback</span> from direct contributors regarding overall positive returns.  Yes, it is less than promised, but more than many similar organizations offer.  Therefore, to increase their funded part of the pension will work here. </p><h2>  Quality of service </h2><p>  The following criterion is not very important, but it is often emphasized by NPF visitors.  It's about quality of service.  It plays an important role for some.  Any conscientious organization will try to provide its services with high quality and do everything to make it pleasant for the client to cooperate with the company. </p><p>  In this area, the reviews of the non-state pension fund Kit Finance are making mixed reviews.  Someone is satisfied with the service, some express a negative opinion in this regard.  Why? </p><p>  Employees answer all questions asked by customers.  But at the same time, you often have to wait a long time for your turn.  Kit Finance also has an online service.  "My Account" allows you to remotely order certificates and statements about the status of the account.  This system only works so far with some glitches.  It is not yet fully debugged.  The conclusion of the contract is quick, all the nuances will be explained to the investor in full.  And it pleases. </p><p>  All these nuances are worth considering.  After all, only then will it be possible to say how much the pension fund suits clients.  There are no direct complaints about customer service, only some comments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kit finance russia reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1446516.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About Payments </h2><p>  Very mixed opinions are formed regarding the payment of savings.  To some extent, customers are even more dissatisfied with the implementation of this function. </p><p>  The non-state pension fund Kit Finance is not receiving the best reviews because it does not always pay the required funds on time.  This causes some potential contributors to doubt the integrity of the organization.  No one is safe from delays; this is normal.  Kit Finance does not appropriate customer money.  The Pension Fund is trying to make payments on time.  But, as already mentioned, delays are possible. </p><p>  Transfers when changing NPFs are also carried out for a long time.  And for this, as already mentioned, will have to prepare.  One thing is known: Kit Finance has no serious problems with payments and transfers.  All customers still get their money.  Even if with slight delays. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what NPF Kit Finance is.  Profitability ratings and customer reviews help to understand how honest the organization is.  What conclusions can be drawn from everything that has been said? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kit finance moscow reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1446517.jpg"></div>

    <p><strong></strong>  Kit Finance is a large private equity fund in Russia, which is notable for its profitability.  It has disadvantages inherent in almost all similar organizations.  They do not plan to deprive him of licenses, he is stable, and on the whole is credible. </p><p>  Should I invest here?  There are no direct negative nuances in the organization‚Äôs work.  Therefore, if you want to apply to a non-state pension fund with high returns, you can become a contributor to Kit Finance. </p>
