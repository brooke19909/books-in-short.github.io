  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a do-it-yourself snake at home?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Almost all parents in one way or another do joint crafts with their children.  Sometimes a child comes and asks to make a snake.  How to make a snake with your own hands?  This is a very unusual choice, and its manufacture can be very diverse. </p><h2>  Manufacturing options </h2><p>  Before you start creating a snake, it is worthwhile to find out from the child what exactly he had in mind when he asked to do it.  The answer to this question will depend on how to make a snake with your own hands.  When asking for such a craft, a child may keep in mind a request to make a kite.  It may also be a request for a soft toy.  It is likely that the child thus asks to make him a snake costume.  The method of manufacturing the product will depend on the clarification of the request. </p><h2>  <span>How to make</span> <span>a kite</span> with your own hands? </h2><p>  One of the most entertaining summer activities is the launch of a kite.  You can buy a ready-made kit for making a kite.  But to do it yourself is not so difficult.  The easiest option is an origami kite.  You need to take a thick piece of paper in the shape of a square. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chroniclesofafoodoholic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Intermediate Stage Origami Snake" class="if uuid-2628782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86989/2628782.jpg"></div><p>  With a pencil, connect two opposite corners - draw a diagonal.  Two sides of the square should be bent to this diagonal.  This action is similar to how we make an ordinary airplane from paper, but you should bend the sides towards the diagonal.  The lower corners of the bent sides should be bent with an accordion a couple of times upwards and glued to them along a piece of thread with a length of at least 30 cm. This is the so-called snake bridle.  The toy is ready. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Making a kite from polyethylene </h2><p>  This method is more complicated and interesting than the previous one.  First of all, a drawing should be made.  The snake itself is made from a rack base and is covered with polyethylene.  The rack frame is made of two racks in a ratio of 4: 5.  Reiki are attached perpendicular to each other.  A short rail is mounted in the middle, and a long rail is 1/5 from the edge.  Reiki can be rewound with duct tape or heavy thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Do-it-yourself kite" class="if uuid-2628770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86989/2628770.jpg"></div><p>  A fishing line or thread should be pulled over the tops of the cross to form a snake frame.  To do this, small notches should be made at the ends of the rails.  The resulting frame should be attached to the polyethylene web and traced with an indent of 1.5 cm. The polyethylene should be cut according to the drawing and the frame should be wrapped.  The canvas can be fixed with glue or duct tape.  Along the edges of a short slat, twine should be tied.  You get a bridle.  A coil of rope is attached down the middle of the string.  The snake should be decorated with an elegant multi-colored tail with bows. </p><h2>  How to make a snake with your own hands: option two </h2><p>  The easiest way to make a soft toy in the form of a snake is an old men's tie.  In addition to a tie, you will need a small piece of red cloth for the tongue, toy eyes and printed material such as sintepon or cotton wool.  Using a pencil, tie the tie with padding polyester or cotton.  The lower edge of the tie is hemmed with a blind seam to the upper, so that the synthetic winterizer does not fall out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="leadingthemtotherock.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tie Snake" class="if uuid-2628784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86989/2628784.jpg"></div><p>  On the rhomboid part of the tie, eyes are glued or sewn on the front side and a red forked tongue is hemmed from below.  Instead of a peephole, buttons of a suitable size can be used.  The snake is ready.  In addition to a man‚Äôs tie, you can make a toy from ordinary material on the pattern.  The pattern can be spiral or straight.  A sewing machine is already required here. </p><h2>  Craft in the form of a bead snake </h2><p>  How to make a snake with your own hands from beads?  First, one bead is strung on a fishing line or a dense thread.  The tip of the thread is fixed around this bead, as if tying it in a circle.  Next, string multi-colored beads from a smaller diameter to a larger one.  You can use beads from old beads, leftovers from various creative sets, from children's lacing.  You can use interesting buttons of large size.  The snake should be completed with a large bead or button, securing the thread at its base.  Instead of thread, you can use a thin wire. </p><p>  In this case, the snake can be given a fixed pose.  If the extreme button or bead allows, an eye contour should be applied with acrylic paints.  This version of the manufacture of the snake should be performed strictly under the control of adults in order to avoid swallowing beads.  When making snakes using thread, use a needle.  This is also done under the supervision of an adult. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.partiescostume.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Children's snake costume" class="if uuid-2628788" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86989/2628788.jpg"></div><h2>  Snake costume </h2><p>  How to make <span>a snake costume</span> with your own hands?  If the question arose about the manufacture of such a suit, then you have to work hard.  First of all, you need to purchase the appropriate material with a snake pattern.  Most likely, it will be knitwear or lycra.  You can download the appropriate pattern from the Internet and sew a jumpsuit with a snake-fabric hood.  You can use the services of a tailor.  In front, you can make an insert from a plain, lighter fabric.  The hood should be decorated in the form of a snake head.  Such a suit is suitable for both a girl and a boy. </p>
