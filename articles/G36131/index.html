Tourists from all over the world have long been fond of the Mediterranean Sea with clear, clear water, beautiful nature and a mild climate.  The coast of Alanya, somewhat reminiscent of a horseshoe, is literally dotted with beaches with small cozy bays.  Here everyone will find relaxation to their liking and affordable.  Fans of secluded relaxation and those who enjoy a holiday with excursions and parties will also be pleased. </p><h2>  Turkish seas </h2><p>  Not everyone remembers from the school bench where exactly Alanya is located in Turkey and which sea washes its shores.  Therefore, we will make a short excursion for those who are going to go on vacation.  On a map of Turkey it can be seen that its northern part is washed by the Black Sea.  The southern part of Turkey is washed by the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas.  By the way, if you look at the map, Alanya is washed by the Mediterranean Sea.  From the west, a small Marmara, located inside Turkey, divides it into European and Asian territories.  Through the Turkish-controlled <span>Dardanelles</span> and Bosporus straits, the Black Sea is connected to the World Ocean. </p>

    <p>  In order not to confuse which resorts belong to which sea, the conditional border passes between the resort towns of Marmaris and Dalaman.  Aegean resorts include cities ranging from Izmir to Marmaris.  The waves of the Mediterranean Sea wash the beaches of resorts from Fethiye to Alanya.  In the Black Sea, that is, in northern Turkey, there is also a large resort area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resort Coast </h2><p>  The Taurus Mountains protect Alanya from the cold north wind.  Fans of warm sea water will like this city.  Alanya Resort is at a respectable distance from the cold Aegean Sea.  An interesting fact is that the watershed between the Mediterranean and Aegean seas is noticeable.  The Aegean Sea with a cool current is dark, with a brownish tint.  The water in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast is well warmed, calm and sapphire blue.  Most likely, it depends on the bottom rock formations. </p><p>  Off the coast of Alanya (Turkey), <span>the water temperature in the Mediterranean is</span> moderate.  Its average annual rate is +21.6 ¬∞ , so the swimming season lasts a long time, and vacationers who suffer from cardiovascular diseases tend to come here.  The climate of Alanya is also useful for those who have pulmonary diseases and various types of neuralgia.  Nevertheless, due to the fact that the city is surrounded by mountains, it is very hot in the summer, so those who can not stand the heat should take a trip in spring or autumn.  The holiday season lasts in Alanya from mid-April to late November. </p>

    <h2>  Alanya beaches </h2><p>  In Turkey, the best sandy beaches of Alanya are considered.  Many of them have the <span>Blue Flag,</span> an international award for cleanliness and well-developed infrastructure.  Creating amenities for their guests, hotel owners fill the sand with a pebble covered sand, creating an artificial sandy beach.  Beaches are tens of kilometers of coast. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is not surprising that, going on vacation with kids, tourists will find out what sea is in Alanya.  Turkey has many resorts on four seas.  Which resort to go with a child?  What is characteristic of the beaches of Alanya is that they are shallow, with a gentle entrance to the sea, and therefore safe for children.  In addition, there are several recreational attractions for children in the city, including a large water park.  You can find a great place to relax with children by looking at the map of Alanya, which was prudently purchased before the trip.  The Avsallar area, surrounded by banana groves, or Incekum, an ecologically clean area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAlanya, is perfect. </p>

    <p>  In addition, as mentioned above, there are many bays on the sea, in which the sea is calm even with strong winds.  In the warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea a large number of sea urchins and various types of starfish.  The best holiday destinations with beautiful beaches on the coast of Alanya include Kekubat and Portakal.  The length of the beach coast of Alanya is two kilometers. </p><h2>  Cleopatra Beach </h2><p>  The most famous on the coast of Alanya is Cleopatra's beach.  For several years in a row, he has owned the Blue Flag.  And in order to receive this international award, the beach must have a high level of service (changing cabins, showers, toilets, cleaning the territory), along with the fact that the entrance to the beach is free and the lifeguard service must constantly work.  In addition to the Mediterranean beaches of Alanya (Turkey), which sea and beaches on it have been awarded such an award?  This is actually a rarity. </p><p>  The beach is named after the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra.  According to legend, this coast on the Mediterranean Sea Anthony gave the queen, and this was her favorite vacation spot.  I wonder what sea in Alanya (Turkey) was in those distant years?  Apparently, it‚Äôs as beautiful and warm as it is today. </p>
