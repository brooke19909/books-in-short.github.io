This is a whole family quarter located in the Russian capital in a new microdistrict, within walking distance from the Pyatnitskoye Shosse metro station.  In this article we will tell you what conditions buyers can count on when buying apartments in this place, whether the developer is reliable and whether you can trust him with your money. </p><h2>  About the complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="onovostroykah.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Residential complex Mir Mitino" class="if uuid-2960341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2960341.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews about the "Mitino World" can be found very different.  Therefore, it is necessary to carefully understand everything.  Currently, this family quarter is being built on the territory of 58 hectares, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Rozhdestveno, on Muravskaya Street. </p><p>  The construction company notes that this is practically the first residential complex in Moscow to be created in the format of a family quarter.  This is its main feature.  Everything around is as if specially created for the comfortable life of a large and friendly family.  Social infrastructure is thought out to the smallest detail, which allows you to create a special atmosphere for relaxation, sports and creativity. </p><p>  The first stage includes twelve buildings of various number of storeys.  Of these, a network of panel buildings (from 11 to 25 floors) and five monolithic (24 floors each).  As part of the implementation of this concept, it is planned to build a polyclinic, two schools, a shopping and entertainment center, a medical and fitness center.  There are seven underground parking lots, as well as ground parking for guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For landscaping in the yards will equip sports and playgrounds, recreation areas.  Walking paths will appear in the park along the river and residential buildings, with a total length of about six kilometers, which will lead an active lifestyle. </p><p>  It is assumed that a landscaped square with springs and a central alley will become a kind of center of attraction. </p><p>  The developer guarantees that in this residential complex it will be possible to provide maximum comfort for everyone. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bonton.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mitino world" class="if uuid-2960340" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2960340.jpg"></div><p>  In reviews of the residential complex Mir Mir Mitino, many admit that they are attracted to original architectural solutions.  The family quarter is being built with semi-closed courtyards.  A certain contribution to aesthetics is made by a single style of color solutions.  From the side of the street, the facades are made in natural and harmonious colors, and in the courtyards - in bright or warm colors, depending on the specific thematic area to which this or that house belongs. </p><p>  Particular attention is paid to the formation of a barrier-free environment.  Between the entrance to the entrance and the level of the sidewalk, a minimum height difference is provided everywhere.  Glass doors let in daylight, and the lobby will always be cozy due to the high ceilings. </p><p>  All high-rise buildings belong to modern panel house-building systems.  They differ from each other in a variety of planning and architectural solutions, a respectable appearance, as well as increased durability, strength and energy efficiency.  Three-layer exterior panels are able to provide thermal insulation that is comparable to the effect of a brick wall.  In the apartments themselves, except for loggias or balconies, a place for the installation of air conditioning is necessarily provided. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beautification </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.novostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Layouts in the residential complex Mir Mitino" class="if uuid-2960338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2960338.jpg"></div><p>  In customer reviews of the "Mitino World", many note that they are satisfied with the accomplishment carried out here.  The territory of the entire <span>residential complex</span> looks modern and attractive. </p><p>  Complex landscaping was carried out, the work of competent landscape designers is visible, small architectural forms are installed.  In the yards, playing, children's and sports grounds, recreation areas are without fail. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Developer LCD Mir Mitino" class="if uuid-2960339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2960339.jpg"></div><p>  Nowadays, when purchasing an apartment in a new building, the infrastructure of the entire microdistrict plays an important role.  The reviews on the family quarter "Mir Mitino" emphasize that it is located in the North-Western District of Moscow. </p><p>  One of the key factors in choosing a home is its transport accessibility.  In this regard, this residential complex is most conveniently located for both motorists and pedestrians. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Within walking distance from the houses there is a Pyatnitskoye Shosse metro station, as well as several highways.  Including the Moscow Ring Road, Volokolamsk and Pyatnitskoye Highways.  So the residents of this family quarter may not be worried because they will regularly be late somewhere and not be in time.  You can comfortably and quickly get from here to the very center of the city in about 30-40 minutes. </p><p>  In general, in terms of its infrastructure richness, this microdistrict is significantly superior to many others that are in the Russian capital.  On its territory there are five clinics at once (including children's, adults and dental), nine schools, including with in-depth study of foreign languages, and as many as 37 kindergartens. </p><p>  There are places for leisurely fun.  Nearby is the <span>cultural center "Mitino", the</span> capital's musical theater "Monoton".  For fans of an active lifestyle, there are several fitness centers, as well as a children's pool called the Pearl. </p><p>  Families with children will find it interesting to attend early development courses for children.  You can make all kinds of purchases and just have fun in the shopping centers "Rook", "Mitino", "Mandarin", "Ark", "Tuk-Tuk". </p><p>  The real natural pearl of these places is the Mitino landscape park, in which most residents of the microdistrict love to spend time with pleasure. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.86281839999999" data-lng="37.372987100000046" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/6/3/1/11631.png"></div><p>  The family quarter is located on the territory of the Mitino intracity municipality, near the village of Rozhdestveno.  The sales office, in which you can be given any detailed advice on the residential quarter, as well as show how finished and under construction apartments look, is open from 9:00 to 21:00. </p><p>  You can get here by car or public transport.  If you are coming by car, then you need to move along the Leningradskoye Shosse from the city center.  Take the Volokolamsk highway, at the intersection with the Moscow Ring Road, turn onto Pyatnitskoe, moving to the metro station of the same name.  Before it, turn right onto Muravskaya Street. </p><p>  If you arrived by metro to the Pyatnitskoye Shosse station, then you can continue on foot along Muravskaya Street or go to bus stop ‚ÄúRozhdestveno‚Äù by bus number 614. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kvartirobox.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about LCD World Mitino" class="if uuid-2960343" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2960343.jpg"></div><p>  You can find very few reviews about the Mira Mitino developer.  This is the company "Rozhdestveno", which was registered in 2005.  Its actual location: Moscow city, Pyatnitskaya street, 6/1, building 8, room, 1, room 14. </p><p>  Currently, the only object that is in her work is the family quarter, which this article is dedicated to. </p><p>  Because of this, you can find quite a lot of wary reviews about the developer of the residential complex "Mir Mitino".  Obviously, the company is small, without a strong reputation.  It is also embarrassing that in her work there is only one object, albeit so large-scale. </p><p>  Often, it is the uncertainty in the builder that makes potential buyers abandon the option to purchase apartments here, choosing in favor of more reliable companies. </p><p>  If you deeply understand the issue, it turns out that evaluating the developer himself does not make any sense, since it was specially created for the implementation of this project.  Moreover, behind it is a fairly large and well-known company - NDV Group.  And the developer is the no less large company Capital Group.  The holding company GVSU "Center" is directly involved in the construction contract.  The financial stability of this structure is added by the participation of Promsvyazbank in it.  As a result, it becomes obvious that the project is carried out by real professionals with extensive experience. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  According to reviews, in the "Mitino World" you are ready to offer apartments of very different layouts. </p><p>  At the moment there are one-room apartments for sale, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã32 square meters or more.  Such living space will cost you five million rubles. </p><p>  One bedroom apartments start at 53 square meters.  Their cost is from 7.170 million rubles.  The smallest two-bedroom apartment that you will find in this residential complex will be an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 70 square meters.  It will cost potential newcomers more than 9 million rubles.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe largest "treshka" available for purchase is 81.5 m¬≤.  Its price is more than 12 million rubles. </p><p>  In each apartment, in addition to a standard loggia or an ordinary balcony, it is possible to install air conditioning.  For these purposes, there are special external structural elements.  A big plus of the houses themselves, according to the company, is the high quality finish.  Errors of manual labor that can be made during the installation and production of buildings are minimized.  In addition, the construction deadlines are minimal - depending on the number of storeys, panel houses are built in a period of six to twelve months. </p><p>  The developer has an interesting proposal, which consists in combining apartments.  The most realistic option is to connect a three-room apartment with a one-room apartment. </p><h2>  Impressions of workers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bonton.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apartments in residential complex Mir Mitino" class="if uuid-2960344" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2960344.jpg"></div><p>  To understand whether it is worth trusting this company, you can be based on feedback from employees about the "Mitino World".  Considering that there is not much information about the developer, I would like to use any, even the smallest opportunity, to understand whether he deserves trust. </p><p>  Employees note that most employees have the opportunity to take shape in accordance with labor law.  At the same time, you need to be prepared for the fact that you will still pay most of the wages paid in envelopes.  Especially for specialists involved in low-skilled work. </p><p>  At the same time, the company has established strict control over the production of works and the quality of decoration.  Therefore, buyers can be sure that they are trying to establish production here, although, of course, they can do without mistakes. </p><h2>  Positive opinions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Family Quarter Mir Mitino" class="if uuid-2960342" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2960342.jpg"></div><p>  In reviews of the residential complex "Mir Mitino", many note the environmental friendliness of this location.  Indeed, in the district there are no plants, landfills, sewage treatment plants and other places that could adversely affect the environmental situation in the area. </p><p>  The only thing in Mitino itself is a cemetery.  But it is located far enough from new buildings.  In fact, it is separated from the complex by Novogorsk Forest Park, which is part of the conservation zone.  Therefore, no one will definitely cut it down. </p><p>  This park can really impress many, it is noted by customers in reviews of the "Mitino World".  The road to the sales office just runs along the green swaying mass of trees.  Nearby is still a small river Skhodnya, along which it is planned to equip the promenade with flower beds, benches and architectural forms.  In the future there should appear a walking area. </p><p>  Another point that confuses many is the power line.  It runs almost in the middle of the first stage development site.  According to the developers, its transfer is planned, and on the site of one of the pillars, the construction of a kindergarten is just planned. </p><p>  Reconstruction of the park is expected in Mitino.  It will be divided into sixteen territories.  In particular, there will be a developing and beach area, a site for winter sports, a historical and archaeological complex, and even a skate park.  A small waterfall and a covered pedestrian bridge are equipped here.  Work will be carried out for budgetary funds.  In total, it is planned to allocate about one billion rubles for this. </p><p>  In reviews of real estate investors about Mitino World, most people recognize that the developer offers interesting plans.  So you‚Äôll definitely not have to invent something when arranging furniture.  True, in some apartments there are still flaws that are immediately evident.  These are not functional corridors and small kitchens.  As if from a distant Soviet past. </p><p>  In customer reviews of the Mitino Mir residential complex, many emphasize that when purchasing a home, everything is as reliable and transparent as possible.  First, you can book your favorite apartment for free for one night.  This can be done by phone. </p><p>  Then, a reservation agreement is concluded at the office, according to which it is required to deposit from 30 to 50 thousand rubles, depending on what is the total area.  If you plan to purchase an apartment on a mortgage, then an additional agreement is concluded that guarantees a refund if the bank refuses to provide a loan.  When you purchase at full cost or in installments, you will not be refunded if you suddenly change your mind. </p><p>  At the next stage, the buyer signs an agreement on shared participation in the construction, which is sent for registration.  A letter of credit is opened at the bank of your choice, for which you need to transfer money.  The first payment under the reservation contract, if you do not change your mind, will be included in the price of the apartment. </p><p>  Residents' reviews of Mitino‚Äôs World also contain information that there are two profitable installment plans.  With interest-free, a contribution of 30% is assumed.  The balance remains to be paid within six months, making payments every month or quarter.  There is also an installment plan for 18 months with exactly the same down payment.  But at the same time, one percent is charged on the balance.  In fact, this is an analogue of preferential mortgages. </p><p>  One of the main advantages of the complex, in general opinion, is an affordable price.  For relatively little money, you get a metropolitan registration and an apartment within walking distance to the metro in an area with developed infrastructure.  All this attracts many potential buyers. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><p>  It is worth recognizing that you can find a lot of negative reviews about the residential complex Mir Mitino in Moscow.  The main complaints are related to the fact that these are prefabricated houses.  Despite the fact that the builder assures that only the most modern technologies are used, the majority are still confident that any panel is much worse than a monolith.  Currently, such options are used only in low-quality houses, mainly economy class. </p><p>  In addition, there is a high degree of development, which also causes a lot of negative reviews about the residential complex "Mir Mitino".  Potential residents fear that there will not be enough underground parking at all, given that now there is a car in almost every family, or even not one.  The number of underground parking lots that are planned in the quarter is much less than the planned construction of apartments. </p><p>  In addition, the houses themselves are being built in the lowlands, where it will be damp all the time, over time, all the rainwater will begin to drain.  Knowing that this will be a significant disadvantage for local residents, the developer is still actively building, which provokes dissatisfied reviews about the "Mitino World". </p><p>  Negativity appears due to the fact that the developer is constantly postponing the deadlines for the delivery of houses.  This indicates either that he does not have enough resources to complete such a large-scale project, or that serious violations are detected during acceptance, because of which it is not possible to complete the commissioning of houses. </p><p>  In reviews of apartments in Mir Mitino, those who faced similar problems claim that they intend to seek payment of a forfeit, including through a court.  Regularly, the deadline for houses is delayed for an impressive period, up to one year.  As a result, plans for repair and settlement collapse before our eyes. </p>
