  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Private hotels: a good alternative</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When you come to a new city, acquaintance with it begins with a search for housing.  The easiest way to rent a room in one of the major hotels in the city, and often it happens.  Still - big hotels are always in sight, if necessary, you can easily find your way home, just by asking the passerby for directions.  The "traditional" hotels have a number of other advantages related to the existing infrastructure: the presence of shopping centers, restaurants, cinemas and conference rooms and a network of media libraries. </p><p>  Nevertheless, it is best to find inexpensive private mini-hotels.  The advantages that these hotels have are obvious.  Private hotels are usually very quiet and comfortable and are located in large cities in almost any area that a guest of a city who wants to spend time in a new city in comfort and coziness only needs.  To mini-hotels can be attributed and private apartments used by the owners for rental.  Such apartments are available at so many addresses. </p><p>  Private hotels, as a rule, are distinguished by increased comfort and absolutely homely cosiness, which is very pleasant for guests.  The relatively low price of accommodation also plays an important role in the growth of popularity of mini-hotels: for example, in St. Petersburg one can find private hotels at a price of 300-400 rubles per day. </p><p>  Private mini-hotels are located not only on the outskirts of the city, but also in the center, there are such hotels and in the immediate vicinity of any cultural or historical values ‚Äã‚Äãand attractions.  If you come to St. Petersburg or another city for business, you can easily find a temporary shelter in any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city that interests you and be sure that you will be guaranteed coziness and comfort for the duration of your stay. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Reviews about private hotels left by guests are usually very helpful.  I spent two days at the Pushkin Mini-Hotel in St. Petersburg, and my impressions of my stay here are the most positive.  There is also a special book in which I left my review. </p><p>  Mini-hotel "Pushkin" is located near Nevsky Prospekt, right in the historical center of the city at 15, Pushkinskaya Street. Its location is very convenient and its windows overlook a quiet little courtyard.  The silence and comfort in the hotel are such that for some reason it was a little sad and our house in Biysk and a gentle and attentive mother were remembered. </p><p>  Absolutely positive moment in ‚ÄúPushkin‚Äù is that there is always hot water, clean drinking water and breakfast, which is included in the total price for accommodation.  In the ordinary, ‚Äústandard‚Äù room there is a shower room, toilet, TV, Internet and other useful amenities. </p><p>  Everything is fine, only the price seemed quite high - I spent two days in the room at a price of 1900 rubles.  There is a suite in Pushkin, but it costs four to five thousand rubles, which was not at all in my plans.  As I understand it, a discount is provided for regular customers at the hotel.  It is nice that the hotel room can be booked in advance. </p><p>  Reading reviews of private hotels in St. Petersburg, I became interested in another business-class mini-hotel.  This is the Nevsky 150 Hotel on Nevsky Prospekt.  The hotel has only four rooms with all amenities.  The range of services is more developed than in Pushkin, but the location in a too busy place and somewhat higher prices determined my choice in favor of the Pushkin mini-hotel. </p><p>  Private hotels in different cities, including Novosibirsk, are a few hours by train from my native Biysk, they are provided by the day, which is very convenient, and prices in mini-hotels of the city are usually lower than in large hotels in the public sector.  Reviews of private hotels in Novosibirsk say that they provide all the necessary amenities to their guests and are located in various parts of the city.  The range of services includes, as a rule, separate bathrooms, high-speed Internet, the rooms have comfortable furniture, air conditioning and many more pleasant and necessary things. </p><p>  In general, small private hotels are gradually becoming a real alternative to large "traditional" hotels in almost all major cities of the country, and not only in large ones.  In small cities like Biysk and in the very small Gorno-Altaysk, private mini-hotels and apartments are also in great demand. </p>
