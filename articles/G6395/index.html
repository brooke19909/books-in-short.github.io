  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Santorini island - tourist gem of Greece</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The romantic island of Santorini, lost in the middle of the Aegean Sea, attracts travelers due to its original architecture - quaint houses painted in white and blue tones and preserved old <span>windmills.</span>  The settlements on the island are completely unlike other Greek settlements, there are noisy freeways and wide streets, and only a narrow staircase leads from the small quiet port to the island capital. </p><p>  <strong>History</strong> : Offering trips to the island of <span>Santorini, Greece</span> and its travel agencies actively advertise the identity of this piece of drying that has risen from the sea, and the guides tell travelers the amazing story of its settlements, which is intertwined with numerous ancient Greek legends.  Locals claim that Santorini created the mighty Poseidon, and legend says how an angry god turned a guilty <span>seahorse</span> into a small island. </p><p>  Scientists testify that the first people settled here about five millennia ago, but the ancient civilization was destroyed due to the strongest <span>volcanic eruption.</span>  It is still active, and the last time the eruption occurred in 1956, which some Greek settlers still remember. </p><p>  <strong>Getting there</strong> : Travelers can reach Santorini in two ways - by air or by water.  Speedboats regularly depart from the Greek <span>port of Piraeus,</span> located in the vicinity of Athens, however, it is recommended to book tickets for them in advance, since the legendary island seeks to visit a large number of adventure lovers.  The boat is on the road for about four hours, so the road to Santorini resembles a boat trip, and if you wish, you can fly to the island from Athens on a small plane. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Entertainment</strong> : An unforgettable vacation in Santorini is a visit to unique beaches covered instead of golden sand with red or black volcanic ash.  However, the water in the <span>Aegean</span> even remains cool in the summer heat, because it does not warm well due to its considerable depth.  The compulsory entertainment program includes photography of a romantic sunset, horseback riding on donkeys that can climb up mountain paths, and tasting the Vinsanto brand wines produced on the island. </p><p>  Arriving on the island of Santorini to combine swimming in the Aegean with nightly entertainment, it is advisable to settle in the city of Fira.  Near midnight, many local taverns turn into ordinary nightclubs, the main visitors of which are local Greeks and European tourists. </p><p>  <strong>Sightseeing</strong> : The main sights of Santorini seem to be scattered throughout the island, so it is recommended to rent a motorcycle or moped for their inspection, as moving along the narrow winding streets by car is not easy.  You can go to the <span>archaeological site</span> where the ruins of the ancient city of Akrotiri cleared of volcanic ash are located, visit the sanctuary of Apollo in the middle of the ruins of ancient Fira, look at the Imerovigli fortress and the monastery of Elijah the Prophet. </p><p>  <strong>Cities</strong> : The administrative center of Santorini is the city of Fira, built up with little white houses, between which blue domes rise.  Small hotels, Greek taverns, clothing boutiques and numerous jewelry shops, unusual museums are concentrated here, and the Cathedral stands out among architectural monuments. </p><p>  Oia is located in the north of a unique Greek island in the shape of a crescent.  There are no old buildings here, because the village was destroyed after a powerful earthquake in 1956, but the locals rebuilt their houses and they look like buildings erected centuries ago.  However, now many buildings have turned into small private hotels awaiting travelers arriving on the island of Santorini. </p>
