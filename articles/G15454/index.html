Many people come to the city not only on business, but also to see numerous sights, for example, its visiting card - ‚ÄúKrasnoyarsk Pillars‚Äù, which is a unique reserve nominated for inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p><p>  Today, five-star hotels do not yet exist in the city.  However, two such facilities are already under construction and will soon receive their first guests.
