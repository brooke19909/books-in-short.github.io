An order for the supply of equipment for lifts to other routes was made among Russian manufacturers. </p><p>  The resort has a tradition of holding annual open competitions in alpine skiing and snowboarding. </p><h2>  Resort Location </h2><p>  The slope is in one of the most beautiful places.  From its top in front of the skiers reveals the splendor of the panorama of the surroundings.  Near the resort there are waterfalls, an open-air museum - a medieval Slavic village, the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, built in 1832.  Everywhere you can visit and see these attractions, having come on vacation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Ski resort Lyubogorye" class="if uuid-2255659" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2255659.jpg"></div><p>  Located near Veliky Novgorod, the ski resort "Lyubogorye" is a fabulous place where you can leave the city with the whole family.

Not everything is debugged with everyday life, and sometimes weather conditions fail.  There is no necessary equipment for snowing the tracks.  Nevertheless, even in the absence of advertising of the ski resort at the weekend, about seven hundred vacationers ride on its slopes. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 2017/2018 winter season, in fact, it was warm and not snowy.  But there is such entertainment as a skating rink, and those who come to rest with pleasure visit it.  In general, everyone is happy with the rest.  I like both the bathhouse and comfortable rooms.  The cafe has good service and delicious food.  Well-organized recreation for children.  Parents believe that children can have a great time on vacation here. </p>
