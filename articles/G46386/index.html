    <h2>  History Center </h2><p>  The Tver Kremlin was built in the 12th century.  The defensive structure was often destroyed and then rebuilt.  Today, only the moat remains from the majestic walls and towers, and on the territory of the object there is the Travel Palace, part of the city garden and the stadium.  The history of the central park zone in Tver begins with the fire of 1763.  The fire then destroyed the entire historic wooden buildings of the city center.  After that, stone construction began on the site of the Kremlin.  Initially, the park was built only around the Travel Palace.  However, already in the 1830s, the park area was combined with the Governor's Garden.  Today it is a beautiful place of rest with an abundance of attractions and related entertainment, which Tver can be proud of.  The city center is still located here, around the City Garden there are many attractions and beautiful places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Imperial Travel Palace </h2><p>  In 1763, during a major fire, the bishop's house burned down.  Initially, it was planned to restore it, but then it was decided to build a palace instead of it for the rest of the royal family during travels from Moscow to St. Petersburg.  Initially, the building consisted of a central building and two symmetrical extended wings.  The building is an example of the classics of the architecture of the XVIII century, with the addition of individual elements in the Baroque style. </p>

    <p>  Over time, representatives of the royal family began to visit the residence less and less.  And then the palace began to be used by the Governor General of the Tver Region Georg Oldenburgsky for hosting receptions of important guests and other special occasions.  His wife, Ekaterina Pavlovna (the sister of Alexander the First), often held creative evenings here, inviting the best, in her opinion, poets and writers.  Subsequently, the Imperial Travel Palace began to be used as an exhibition complex.  The building was badly damaged during the Great Patriotic War, but after restoration, Tver museums were again located here, including an art gallery, as well as expositions devoted to the literature and history of the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Religious sites </h2><p>  In the Tver region there are many Orthodox churches and cathedrals, and some are distinguished by their venerable age.  The most ancient architectural monument from surviving to this day is the White Trinity Church.  This temple was built in 1564 and consecrated in honor of the Trinity Life-Giving.  The church is notable for its architecture: on a cubic base chapters of different sizes are installed, initially there were three, but subsequently four more were added.  The temple was built in such a way that it could also perform the functions of a fortress during an attack by enemy troops.  There are legends about what the church and the underground passage have. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="christ xmas monastery" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1079622.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The city of Tver has a difficult history.  The sights that can be seen here today are for the most part a quality restoration or completely rebuilt less than a century ago.  So, Alexander Nevsky Cathedral was demolished in 1982, and then rebuilt in 2012-2015.  The Church of the Resurrection of Christ, which is beyond the Volga, during the Soviet era lost the bell tower and regained it recently.  But the church of Catherine, located in the left-bank part of the city, is indeed the only survivor.  In addition to the Orthodox churches in Tver, there is the Catholic Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord (built in 1864, after it was destroyed and rebuilt in 2002) and the Cathedral Mosque (built in 1905). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Monasteries and holy places </h2><p>  Not only tourists from all over the country and from neighboring countries come to Tver, but also pilgrims who want to touch the Orthodox shrines.  One of the most interesting is the Nativity of Christ Monastery, or the monastery of the Nativity of Christ.  The date of its foundation is considered to be 1514.  In the Time of Troubles, all buildings on the territory of the monastery were burned, but then rebuilt again.  In modern territory there is the Nativity of Christ Cathedral, built in 1820 in the style of classicism.  Assumption Monastery The monastery has not survived to the present day, only the only church remains from it, and a river station has been erected on the site of other buildings.  In 1999, a memorial plaque on the planned restoration of the shrine appeared near the temple.  Not all holy monasteries have been preserved as well as the Nativity of Christ Monastery.  From the Assumption Zheltikovy, for example, only the lower tier of the bell tower remained, and the Nikolaev Malian was recently rebuilt almost from scratch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="White Trinity Church" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1079628.jpg" width="600"></div>

Saltykov-Shchedrin is very popular.  Not everyone knows that the famous writer for two years was the vice-governor of the Tver region.

    <h2>  Bridges </h2><p>  If you live away from large rivers, you will certainly be impressed by the bridges across the Volga available in Tver.  The most interesting Starovolzhsky, built over a hundred years ago.  Of course, this is not such a significant attraction as the museums of Tver or ancient temples, but it still deserves attention: for its time, the bridge was a miracle of engineering.  It was built in the image and likeness of a similar building in Prague.  At the junction of Kalinin and Lenin Avenues, you can see the railway bridge.  He is one of the oldest in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tver city sights" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1079617.jpg" width="600"></div>
