It is located in the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãEl Arenal.  Tourists who dream of visiting this fabulous island with its amazingly beautiful bays and stunning beaches, but at the same time not incurring debts and not paying a fortune for the trip, are quite happy with their stay in this hotel.  It is quite stylishly decorated, and people who stay here feel comfortable, at home.  Moreover, <span>vacation in Mallorca</span> simply by definition cannot be ‚Äúseal‚Äù.  There are so many beautiful bays, ancient cities and stunning cliffs!  And in order to have money for excursions, travelers often choose economical housing.  The local beach is called Es Arenal, so the same name sometimes appears in the address of the hotel (S Arenal). </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Juan palma 2" class="if" height="213" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/585009.jpg" width="320"></div></h2><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The guest house is located on a small hill.  To get from the Juan Palma 2 * hotel to the beach on foot, it will take about ten minutes.  Half a kilometer from the guest house is the famous Aqualand El Arenal water park.  Not very far from here to the airport - about ten minutes by car.  Therefore, if you have an early departure or a late flight, it will be quite convenient to get there.  Very close to the guest house is a bus stop, and the transport connection is good.  To Palma - the capital of the island - are numbers seventeen and twenty three.  The fact that you need to go to the beach, from the point of view of tourists, is an additional bonus.  Indeed, in season there are so many noisy discos and other entertainments arranged on the coast of the Arenal that one who lives near the sea practically does not sleep.  And the fact that the hotel is located at the end of the street provides relative silence.  One of the largest supermarkets of the Mercadona chain is located a hundred meters from the guest house.  In addition, near the hotel there is a public garden with pines and benches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Juan palma 2 el arenal" class="if" height="236" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/585010.jpg" width="355"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To get to Juan Palma 2 * (Es Arenal), you need to fly to <span>Majorca</span> Son San Juan International <span>Airport</span> .  As a rule, a shuttle service is not provided for this hotel.  If you are not sorry for the money for a taxi, or if you have your own or rented transport, then it takes you about twenty minutes (fifteen kilometers) to go from the airport to the guest house.  But most often, guests of this hotel use public transport.  The first and seventeenth buses, for example, follow the capital of the island of Palma.  When you get to <span>Plaza Espanya,</span> you take the route number twenty-three, the stop of which is two hundred meters from the hotel.  The same bus, by the way, goes to the beautiful Aqualand park, from which all the children who come to the island are delighted. </p><h2>  Mallorca Arenal </h2><p>  This is a very inexpensive and insanely popular with young people from Germany, Britain and the Netherlands resort area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island.  It used to be the noisiest place in Mallorca.  Now European youth also likes to hang out in the Arenal, but for many years Magaluf has been holding the reputation of the coolest place for entertainment.  Therefore, it became a little quieter here, because the most ‚Äúloopy‚Äù part of the public - British teenagers - moved mainly there.  But local bars still make great dishes, loved in the United Kingdom.  German youth also prefer this resort.  Therefore, the bars and restaurants where they speak the language of Goethe, also missing.  There are so many young people here in the summer that it is difficult to find a free place on the beach.  If you come here at the peak of the season, it is better to get to the sea early.  The hotels here are mostly democratic, mainly ‚Äútriples‚Äù and ‚Äúfours‚Äù.  They are all located near the beach, but in summer it is almost impossible to sleep here because of loud music.  ‚ÄúDvushki‚Äù, like Juan Palma 2 * (El Arenal), are located away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Juan palma 2 exclusive" class="if" height="236" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/585011.jpg" width="355"></div>
