    <h2>  Country hotel complexes </h2><p>  The Pectoral Hotel is located in a pine reserve called ‚ÄúKhortitsa Island‚Äù.  At the disposal of guests 53 equipped rooms of different classes, restaurant, parking.  Children under 6 years old stay free of charge.  On the shore of a small bay <span>of the Dnieper River,</span> in a beautiful secluded place among the green park, the Marco Polo country club was built (the village of Ulyanovka, Volnyansky district).  Guests are accommodated in a building with junior suites and suites, as well as in 4 separate cottages.  This club will have fun for everyone: while men are fishing in specially equipped pavilions, women can swim in the outdoor and indoor pools, as well as use the services of the SPA center.  At this time, children can play on the playground or in the games room under the supervision of qualified personnel.  Among other things, visitors have at their disposal a <span>restaurant, a bar, a</span> sauna, a Russian bath, billiards, a conference room, and sports entertainment.  A brief overview on the topic: I would like to complete the hotels in Zaporozhye with the Panska Hata restaurant and hotel complex in the village of Nizhnyaya Khortitsa (Komarova St., 25).  All its buildings are made of hewn logs.  The main building has 17 rooms and a very large restaurant with gourmet cuisine.  Around are one- and two-story cottages.  In the green area there are two outdoor pools, a sauna, a playground, an artificial pond with waterfowl and many gazebos for relaxation.  The highlight of the Panska Hata hotel is the organization of fishing and horseback riding on stallions from its own hotel stables. </p><p>  At any time, I am glad to welcome guests to the city of Zaporozhye, hotels, whose hotels, in turn, will provide services for every taste. </p>
