    <h2>  Drive, hold, watch and see </h2><p>  <span>Marketing wars</span> on the world and domestic markets have led to the fact that buyers in 99% of cases acquire equipment that in fact does not meet the objectives.  This fact is discovered after the purchase, so most people just put up.  Network experts suggest looking at buying a router from a different angle. </p><p>  Many users unreasonably believe that the main criterion that a powerful WiFi router for home has is a radius of action.  Naturally, devices with antennas attract the attention of buyers.  But only few people pay attention to the packaging of the router, where it is written in black and white that the device works according to the international standard ISO IEEE 802.11.  It turns out that the radius of action is the same for all routers: 150 meters in direct line of sight and 50 meters in the room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Consumer abuse </h2><p>  It is logical to assume that it is a router with a powerful WiFi transmitter that is responsible for high-quality signal transmission over a long distance.  Naturally, in expensive devices there is a ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù controller, but in the rest it is fake?  There is something in it.  Indeed, in the market, especially in the budget class, few routers can boast of signal strength, which can provide a high-quality signal through several brick walls.  Explanations are no longer required, cheap routers with great functionality and poor coverage do not meet international ISO standards, which means they violate the laws of the country in whose territory the sale takes place. </p>

    <p>  Accordingly, the most powerful WiFi router that can be found on the market in the budget or corporate segment meets all the requirements.  That's just the cost of such devices is too high and can not afford many potential buyers. </p><h2>  Budget Class Resources </h2><p>  Devices presented in an inexpensive segment (up to 1000 rubles) are designed to organize a wireless and wired local area network within a room with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãnot more than 100 m <sup>2</sup> .  High-quality signal transmission is guaranteed by the manufacturer only if there is only one barrier wall (analogue of the bearing brickwork).  The representative of the low-cost segment, a powerful WiFi router, is guaranteed to provide high-quality communications to all wireless devices within a radius of 25 meters for 802.11n standard or in a range of 50 meters for other technologies (a \ b \ c). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Experts recommend installing the network device not near the computer, but placing it in the middle of the room (for example, in the corridor) to better cover all rooms or offices.  Do not install the router on the floor or attach it to the ceiling.  The signal must have a field for reflection from surfaces, which means that you need to place the router at a height of about 1.6-2.2 meters. </p><h2>  Representatives of an inexpensive segment </h2><p>  In the budget class there are not many devices that can really satisfy all the requirements of customers.  In addition to signal strength, users are also interested in functionality, so IT professionals recommend avoiding low-cost Chinese solutions with hard-to-pronounce names (LioSan, Tenda, Netis) and trusting their choice to proven routers over the years: TP-Link, D-Link, Belkin . </p><p>  Any powerful WiFi router for a home from a budget class will provide the owner with a full range of functionality, including excellent coverage of the room.  Inexpensive devices are equipped with cheap wireless modules, so the signal quality directly depends on the location of the router in the room.  Experts recommend paying attention to the following devices: TP-Link TL-WR720N, Belkin Wireless N150 Router, D-Link DIR-615 / A. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Business Segment </h2><p>  It is in the middle price category that there are devices that do not require any additional events from the user and provide the owner with a full range of functions simultaneously with guaranteed signal quality.  The most powerful WiFi router for the home, professionals recommend choosing among the brands ASUS, Zuxel, Linksys, TP-Link and D-Link, which are in the price range of 1500-4000 rubles. </p>

    <p>  None of the listed manufacturers will allow the user to doubt the quality of signal transmission through obstacles.  Many owners in their reviews note that in apartment buildings, business class representatives create a wireless network within several apartments in the coverage area.  By the way, a powerful WiFi router of this class should also have a decent data encryption system, because it is focused primarily on the sphere of small and medium-sized businesses.  All <span>Linksys</span> products <span>,</span> Zyxel-branded <span>routers</span> in the Keenetic line, TP-Link Archer, D-Link DIR-8xx series and ASUS RT series have proven themselves in this category. </p><h2>  Representatives of the corporate segment </h2><p>  Do not forget about expensive equipment, which experts are used to calling professional.  A powerful WiFi router for the office, following the corporate ideology, is just chosen among the specialized equipment.  Brands such as Cisco, D-Link, and Zyxel are best known among IT professionals.  Many users believe that Apple‚Äôs wireless solutions also belong to the corporate segment, but this is an erroneous opinion, because the American manufacturer laid the brand value in 50% of the cost of equipment. </p>

    <p>  A powerful WiFi router for a cottage, multi-storey building or an entire enterprise, from an expensive segment has not only a huge range, but also a broadband coverage system.  In most cases, the directional antennas with which the router is equipped are responsible for high-quality signal transmission.  Also, all wireless devices are not isolated solutions, but are controlled using the host computer server. </p><h2>  An interesting loophole for the owner </h2><p>  Strengthen the signal on your own on any budget network device is subject to any user.  To do this, it is enough to register the US state in the ‚ÄúLocation‚Äù field through the control panel in the settings of the router.  The fact is that this state has its own laws, including requirements for signal power (250 m direct visibility and 75 meters indoors).  By changing the settings and rebooting the device, you can personally see the improvement in signal strength. </p>

    <p>  A powerful WiFi router for the home, whose range exceeds the established standards and affects the performance of other general-purpose wireless networks, can be removed from the owner by the state for violation of the law.  Indeed, in every country there is a radio frequency surveillance service.  In the CIS countries this is practically not controlled, but in European countries administrative punishment cannot be avoided. </p><h2>  Very skillful pens </h2><p>  To improve the signal within a large room, it is not at all necessary to buy a WiFi router with a powerful signal from an expensive segment.  High costs can be avoided by creating a home broadcasting system.  Behind the proudly sounding name are two half-liter <span>aluminum cans</span> from a drink.  Having cut off the bottom from the tin container, the user must put the can on the router antenna with a drinking neck. </p>

    <p>  Further technical matter, the antennas need to be deployed towards the receiver and adjust the correct angle.  When using the wireless WiFi module in a personal computer, it also puts on a reinforced concrete container and sends the cut part to the router. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  As can be seen from the review, the concept of ‚Äúpowerful WiFi router‚Äù does not actually exist on the world market.  Here the definition ‚Äúproducts of unscrupulous manufacturers‚Äù is more suitable.  We need a decent router - welcome to the corporate segment, the rest will have to use consumer goods, eliminating all the shortcomings of the network equipment with their own hands.  Alternatively, you can just put up and enjoy a low-cost purchase.  In any case, the user will not be able to achieve a balance between quality and affordable cost, since these two criteria are directly proportional to each other. </p>
