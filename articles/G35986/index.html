    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Aqaba is quite far from the capital of the country, so a trip to Amman will be very tiring for guests at the Raed Suites Hotel Aqaba 3 *.  The reviews claim that it is better to go to Jerash to look at the remains of Roman civilization, or to see one of the wonders of the world - the rock complex of the Arabian Bedouins Petra.  A very interesting excursion to the place of the baptism of Jesus Christ on <span>the Jordan River</span> and other holy places.  You can also visit the Main Hot Springs hot springs and the amazing Wadi Rum Canyon - a favorite place for those who enjoy trekking.  In general, the southern regions of Jordan, namely the deserts that are located near Aqaba, are amazingly beautiful.  But any excursion will take you at least nine hours, so know that this time will have to be taken away from a sea holiday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Raed Suites Hotel Aqaba 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1519404.jpg" width="600"></div>
