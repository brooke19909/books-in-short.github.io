  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Origami insects. Spider</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How many times you come across origami as a form of art and just one of the types of needlework, so many times you are surprised at the versatility of this simple activity, which in the end allows you to create amazing masterpieces.  It seems that the elements will not allow to disperse the fantasy beyond the already studied schemes - no!  On the Internet you can meet more and more new toys made using the origami technique, for example, origami ‚Äúspider‚Äù.  Probably, the creation of this miracle was inspired by the series ‚ÄúDaddy's Daughters‚Äù, beloved by the whole country, which is a very unusual choice of an animal for capturing it as a souvenir. </p><p>  So, origami "spider."  To create it, you will need about 300-400 leaflets from which you can make a module - the basis of any masterpiece in the origami style.  The module folds out of a square of thick paper.  It is not advisable to use cardboard for handicrafts - it gives products coarseness, especially since it is quite difficult to bend the cardboard - and the module will turn out to be dense and from a regular sheet.  If your spider is an albino, it is quite acceptable to use regular office paper.  There is also no need to look for specially two-color paper - all the same, one side will be wrapped inside the module. </p><p>  The most difficult and time-consuming creation of any origami figure is the preparation of a sufficient number of modules.  The work itself is not at all complicated, and once you follow the instructions of the scheme for creating modules, you can easily wind them up as much as you need for the chosen version of the craft.  Another thing is difficult - not to lose patience when doing this dreary work.  Therefore, it is recommended to involve at this stage the work of all free households, especially children, starting from preschool age.  Why exactly them?  The fact is that origami trains <span>fine motor skills of</span> hands, and this is very important for preschoolers, who are just in the process of developing the basic functions of the central nervous system.  Especially strong can be seen the connection between well-developed fine motor skills and the speech center in children.  So do not hesitate for a long time about what to do on a rainy day - get together at a round table and arrange a competition: who will fold, say, 50 origami modules faster and better than others. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By and large, for the origami "spider" does not require a huge number of modules.  The reptile turns out to be completely natural, and even very cute, when compared with natural spiders.  There are options for creating an origami "spider" in a different color, with a different arrangement of limbs.  In general, some options for finished crafts, especially if you make them in a small format, can be quite easily confused at a distance with a live and completely natural spider.  Ready-made master classes on <span>how to make an origami</span> spider are available on the Internet.  Your task is to determine his appearance and clearly follow the instructions.  For work, in addition to paper, glue is required - numerous limbs will need to be precisely glued to the body of the craft. </p><p>  Well, of course, the boys are more interested not in the reptiles and arthropod brothers of our smaller ones, but in receiving the spider-man origami gift.  But this may cause slight difficulties.  There are very few options for toy schemes of this kind - only two or three standing ones go out in the Internet search engine.  Therefore, if the offspring really wants to get such a toy, you have to strain your imagination, connect to the manufacture of the offspring itself and create something unique.  Probably, this should be a rather large figure, since the proposed options for the reduced size with a <span>large head</span> and almost no torso look poor and uninteresting.  If you get something good - please share the discovery with those who also have little fans of original origami toys! </p>
