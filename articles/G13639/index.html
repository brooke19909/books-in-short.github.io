    <p>  When it comes to the peculiarities of <span>commercial activity</span> and direct production, the analysis of business activity plays a special role in this.  And in order to make it correct and efficient, specialists are hired.  They use certain knowledge, methods and techniques.  Among them is the coefficient of business activity, which determines the speed with which the funds turn around, on which the direct profitability of the enterprise depends.  Moreover, it is worth noting that a quantitative assessment of this analysis can be done in two main directions: </p><p>  1. According to the degree of implementation of the created plan and the main established indicators, which are provided with the specified <span>growth rates.</span> </p><p>  2. In terms of the effectiveness of the direct use of those resources that a commercial organization uses. </p><p>  In this case, the main evaluation factor, which is an indicator, is considered to be, in fact, the volume of sales and the profit that the activity brings. </p><p>  <strong>Business Criteria</strong> </p><p>  Before identifying these criteria, it is important to understand that the business activity of the enterprise is one of the most important characteristics of the economic condition and specifics of the development of activities.  But now there are quite a few definitions of this concept, although absolutely all of them characterize this category.  It is believed that the analysis of business activity should be based on the results and effectiveness of current production activities.  From this, the main criteria are determined by which a direct assessment can be made.  And we are talking about the following indicators: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1. First of all, this is the direct breadth of markets for the sale of created products. </p><p>  2. The second criterion is the availability of products, their quantity, which is exported. </p><p>  3. The direct reputation of the company, which is expressed in the degree of popularity among consumers who use the services. </p><p>  Also, the analysis of business activity implies certain criteria in a quantitative sense: </p><p>  1. This is the degree of implementation of the plan, which should be established not only directly by the company that provides these or other services, but also by higher organizations.  And these plans are created taking into account the main indicators. </p><p>  2. For assessing business activity, a special role is played by the way in which the specified growth rates are achieved. </p><p>  3. Particular attention is paid to the level of efficiency, on the basis of which the <span>resources of the enterprise are used.</span> </p><p>  <strong>Why business analysis is needed</strong> </p><p>  Naturally, in the financial aspect, business activity contributes to the achievement of goals, in particular, we are talking about achieving the desired income indicators.  And the assessment of the analysis of business activity is needed by the enterprise in order to: </p><p>  1. As accurately as possible to determine the possible annual income depending on the immediate speed of cash flow. </p><p>  2. The <span>relative size of</span> conditionally fixed costs is directly related <span>to the</span> direct size of the <span>cash flow</span> and to the turnover.  It turns out that the sooner the turnover occurs, the less material resources have to be spent on each subsequent turnover. </p><p>  3. Naturally, the acceleration at a certain stage of the turnover also contributes to the acceleration of this in subsequent stages. </p><p>  4. The success of the enterprise and its immediate position in the market is determined by how quickly the invested funds pay off, turning into <span>real income.</span> </p><p>  Knowing the features of the analysis of business activity, each entrepreneur can rationally set a number of priorities that will contribute to the speedy achievement of success.  And due to the fact that now there are many definitions of this concept, the development of their totality will help establish strategies for their activities in the modern market. </p>
