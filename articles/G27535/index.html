Destroyed in the bloody decades that followed in 1917 and broke the entire established way of life, it still exists today.  In the minds of present generations, the noble estate was preserved not only as a myth.  It represents a very real heritage of the once great culture - its surviving buildings, parks, landscapes, collections of ancient books and portraits can be seen with your own eyes, you can touch them.  A meeting with them is experienced as an introduction to the life of long-known and beloved heroes, as a reminder of each of us participating in the noisy fateful events. </p><h2>  Manor "Raiki" (Schelkovo district): how it all began </h2><p>  On one of the picturesque shores of Klyazma, in unusually beautiful places of the Shchelkovo district of the Moscow region, near the village of Sverdlovsk, the village of Raiki is located. </p><p>  It is known that this name is not original - once this settlement was called Ivankov.  Historians retell the legend according to which Empress Catherine II, traveling along this edge, admired its beauty, called the village of Ivankovo ‚Äã‚Äãthat she met a paradise.  Since then it began to be called Raikovo, or Raiki.  And, as you know, this paradise on earth is far from the only one.  In addition to the estate "Raiki" in the Moscow region there are also other memorable places.  They are so beautiful that they have long been associated among Russians with ideas about the earthly paradise.  These include the estate in the Serpukhov district "Paradise-Semenovskoye", as well as the estate in the Tver region "Znamenskoye-Raek". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="nataturka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The estate &quot;Raiki&quot; in the Moscow region" class="if uuid-2696010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39987/2696010.jpg"></div><h2>  "Raiki": a brief history </h2><p>  Selco Raiki once belonged to the Davydovs, then the Kondrashovs, and later to Ivan Nekrasov.  It is known that the famous poet Boris Pasternak spent several years on this estate. </p><p>  Over the entire period of its existence, the estate "Raiki" has seen many prominent personalities, musical works and paintings were written within the walls of the estate.  Currently, its territory is used by the boarding house "Youth" and the sanatorium.  A.M.  Gorky.  In the 70-80s, modern residential buildings were built here for the needs of these institutions.  Unfortunately, many magnificent buildings of the 19th century were destroyed by time, but something has survived.  Even now, visitors to the "Raiki" estate can admire the remains of the "hanging" gardens in the former stepped park, preserved by an ancient pond with islands, as well as trees that eternally adorned the legendary estate. </p><p>  It is known that since 1811 the masters of this earthly paradise were Messrs. Davydovs, in 1852 the estate passed into the ownership of the landowner Aghey Abaz, from 1890 the estate passed into the possession of the silk manufacturers Kondrashovs, and then I.I.  Nekrasov, a famous gold miner.  It is with him that historians associate all the most significant events in the life of Raikov.  The last estate was owned by the manufacturer S.I.  Chetverikov, after the revolution, emigrated with the whole family to Europe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  At the turn of the XIX-XX centuries, designed by architect L.N.  Kekusheva is building a number of interesting buildings in the Art Nouveau style.  Unfortunately, in the 1996 fire, the pearl of the architectural complex burned down - the main house with an octagonal turret, designed by the famous architect.  Among the beautiful creations of L.N.  Kekusheva also includes a residential building in the park, the so-called "American house" in the style of half-timbered houses and other buildings, each of which has its own unique style. </p><h2>  Dutch (American) house, arch.  L.N.  Kekushev (1901) </h2><p>  According to experts, a symmetrical and compact American (or <span>Dutch) house</span> with two floors and an attic deserves special attention.  In each room the details are thought out to the smallest detail, and the design of the external decor inspired a lot of pleasant romantic associations.  The facades of the building were finished in marble, and the roof was laid with Marseille tiles.  It is known that in 1907-1909.  it was here that the family of the famous poet Boris Pasternak spent her summer vacation. </p><p>  Also in 1911, the family of the famous engineer and inventor Bari stayed here for the summer.  Ten years earlier, in 1901, the famous Russian artist Surikov worked on his painting ‚ÄúStepan Razin‚Äù.  Artists K. Bedrosov, V. Denisov, P. Konchalovsky and many others also created and rested on the estate.  In different sources, this building is called differently: it is also called the Fachwerk cottage, and the Dutch, and the American house ... </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="tata-lind.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cottage in &quot;Rayki&quot;" class="if uuid-2696071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39987/2696071.jpg"></div><p>  In the photo you can see that the facades of the building with a wooden frame are visually divided into rectangular fields.  The building simplistically reproduces common Victorian style trends.  Experts say that the general silhouette of this building refers more to the style characteristic of the times of Queen Anne, and the wall decoration refers the visitor to the times of Tudor and Elizabeth.  Unfortunately, today on the facade you will not see dark stripes characteristic of fachwerk - they were painted over with light paint. </p><p>  The building, built in just one year, the architectural community recognized as an example of a new style.  The house has become a recognized standard of comfortable suburban housing.  It is known that light, water, gas were installed in the building.  In this comfortable cottage, the wife of the owner of the estate Nekrasova, Anna Timofeevna, who was seriously interested in painting, loved to live for a long time.  In Soviet times, V.M., who was in disgrace, sometimes stayed here.  Molotov. </p><p>  From antique furniture, a bookcase has survived, which today stands in the library, and a dressing table.  In the house itself, as well as in the modern extension, there are several suites in which visitors can live. </p><h2>  Finnish house, arch.  L.N.  Kekushev (1900s) </h2><p>  According to experts, this beautiful wooden building is subtly reminiscent of the later creation of L.N.  Kekusheva - Moscow residential building of the merchant V. D. Nosov, built in 1903.  In the register of architectural monuments, the building is called a Finnish house, in other sources - a wooden house in the Art Nouveau style, as well as an excellent example of Franco-Belgian art nouveau.  Be that as it may, this architectural creation is beautiful.  According to reviews, it is extremely pleasant to sit opposite this masterpiece, looking at every detail of it ... The house invariably brings peace and tranquility to visitors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mosculture.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Finnish house" class="if uuid-2703322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39987/2703322.jpg"></div><h2>  Garden sculptures </h2><p>  Two objects have also been preserved in the park, the authorship of which is given to the architect L.N.  Kekushev (or his students).  They are two wonderful garden sculptures - ‚ÄúLioness with a lion cub‚Äù and ‚ÄúLion with a victim‚Äù.  The attribution of these works has not yet been proven.  But still, many people tend to consider her the author of the ‚Äúlions‚Äù of the famous master - after all, addressing the ‚Äúlion‚Äù theme is his hallmark. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nataturka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sculpture of a lion" class="if uuid-2696014" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39987/2696014.jpg"></div><h2>  About the boarding house "Youth" </h2><p>  The boarding house is located on Shchelkovo highway 23 km from Moscow.  The pension is surrounded by an old landscape park with paths laid along it.  The boarding house has three separate residential buildings, a restaurant complex, a wellness center with a sauna and a swimming pool, an entertainment center and its own ski lift.  The mode of operation of the boarding house: round the clock. </p><p>  Vacationers are invited to take advantage of a wide range of services: access to the sauna, pool, massage, <span>beauty salon,</span> salt room.  Guests can play table tennis or billiards here.  Green forests and picturesque ponds create a unique atmosphere that inspires you to enjoy pleasant walks. </p><p>  Vacationers are offered a wide range of accommodation options: from a 1-bed standard to an exquisite suite with an empire-style decor.  All rooms have a TV, a comfortable bed and a private bathroom. </p><p>  Meal of guests (three meals a day, included in the price) is organized in the dining room of the boarding house.  In addition, the Imperial restaurant is available for vacationers, in which mass banquet events are held. </p><p>  The distance from the boarding house to the Moscow Ring Road is 23 km, so it is not difficult to get to it.  The Belorussky Train Station is 38 km from here, and Vnukovo Airport is 63 km away.  Boarding house address: pos.  Youth, Shchelkovo highway., Those who are interested in how to get to the estate, experts recommend using the coordinates: n.  55.91790100, east  38.12895300. </p><h2>  How do guests respond to a stay in a boarding house? </h2><p>  According to reviews, the natural and architectural beauty of these places has an unusually positive effect on vacationers, gives an unprecedented strength emotional lift.  There are usually a little more than a dozen vacationers here, mainly pupils of children's martial arts and dance schools are located. </p><p>  Meals are not provided on the menu.  And even more so, as the authors of the reviews note, it is inappropriate to expect a buffet format here.  Mostly guests eat what they give.  A little food, but it is edible, guests assure.  The territory of the boarding house is clean and well-groomed, with many bright flower beds. </p><p>  The audience comes to the boarding house mainly for fishing (fish are bred in the local ponds).  For kebab lovers, there are special grills made of bricks and very civilized parking areas. </p><p>  Many connoisseurs of antiquity regret that the boarding house does not have a museum or even an ordinary stand that would tell about the history of these places.  Often, vacationers do not even realize that they are in a place that stores the remains of a rich history and culture.  It is known that the administration of "Youth" began to seriously think about it.  Nevertheless, experts say that for the construction of the main building of the boarding house in the 70s, a neoclassical building was destroyed (exactly the one in which Pasternak once lived with his family). </p><p>  The authors of the reviews say that at the entrance you can see a sign on which it is indicated that you can enter the territory only by the card of the boarding house.  But this is not so.  The guards easily allowed here, they allow to inspect the surroundings.  It is noticeable that they are very proud that they work in such an important historical place.  Fans of antiquity note that you can just come to the estate and take a walk here.  It would be nice to bring nuts for squirrels.  It is also allowed to sunbathe and fish in a pond (not free). </p><h2>  About the project "Manor Express" </h2><p>  The initiator of this project was the well-known blogger Vadim Razumov (author of the Chronicle of the Russian Estate).  At one time, the initiative was supported by Central Suburban Passenger Company LLC, the Ministry of Culture of the Moscow Region and the Poster of the Moscow Region portal.  The project invites connoisseurs of Russian history to travel to ancient Russian estates in Fryanovo, Grebnevo, Torzhok, etc.  One of the places in which the trip participants can not only visit interesting excursions, but also stop for a short time, have lunch and take a walk, is the estate "Raiki".  Tourists are very enthusiastic about the excellent opportunities provided by the project. </p><h2>  About the sanatorium them.  A.M.  Gorky (Yunost settlement) </h2><p>  The natural landscape of the territory of the institution is a huge parkland of deciduous and coniferous trees.  According to reviews, the cleanest local air is filled with an incomparable forest aroma.  The fragrance of pines, blooming linden, thuja, blue spruce, etc., shady avenues of maples, a picturesque natural pond - all this creates an atmosphere of calm and serenity, which is an ideal condition for relaxation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kurcenter.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanatorium in &quot;Rayki&quot;" class="if uuid-2701318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39987/2701318.jpg"></div><p>  In the sanatorium, you can not only forget about the bustle of the city, escape from everyday problems and worries, relieve stress and get rid of chronic fatigue, but also restore your health in a high-quality and complete way.  The institution has all the necessary conditions for a high-quality and full-fledged treatment of diseases of the cardiovascular system, neurological, etc. The medical and diagnostic base of the sanatorium is equipped with the latest technical equipment. </p><p>  On the territory of the sanatorium, guests can use the services of the library, visit the Finnish sauna, play billiards, swim in the pool.  For vacationers, excursions are organized, concerts of guest pop stars, etc. are held. </p><p>  Guests are accommodated in rooms with all amenities, equipped with modern furniture, TV, fridge, shower (some rooms have a bathtub). </p><p>  For vacationers of the sanatorium, 5 meals a day are organized (custom-made system).  The quality of food for each guest is closely monitored by a nutritionist.  Persons with overweight, cardiological diseases and diabetes receive nutrition on special diets.  But, as guests assure, diet food in the sanatorium pleases with its variety and taste. </p><h2>  Guest Impressions </h2><p>  In their reviews, guests thank the staff of the sanatorium for their care and attention.  Vacationers note that the institution is located in the Stalinist building in the style of a Russian estate.  Many reviewers report that they really like everything here: food, accommodation, a variety of procedures, and the very favorable atmosphere of the sanatorium.  Nature is called wonderful, truly fabulous.  Guests note the effectiveness of treatment in the sanatorium, selected individually for each. </p><p>  According to reviews, unlike "Youth", the resort is quite noisy due to the proximity of the highway.  The territory is not cleaned unreasonably - you can see lying bags, bottles on it.  The inside is beautiful, a good repair was made, but everywhere there is an unpleasant smell of the hospital and the "canteen".  In the sanatorium them.  Gorky, visitors say, nothing remained of the estate "Raiki".  Nevertheless, many express their hope to come here and confidently recommend this resort for relaxation and treatment. </p><h2>  How to get here? </h2><p>  You can get here (address: Shchelkovo district, Yunost settlement) by public transport: </p><ul><li>  The electric train leaves from the Yaroslavl station, go to the station.  "Chkalovskaya", then transfer to minibus number 25 and continue on to the stop.  "Village Biocombine."  Sanatorium named after  Gorky is located directly near the stop. </li><li>  From Art.  m. "Schelkovskaya" shuttle buses, as well as shuttles No. 321, 320, 429, 378. Go to the stop.  "Village Biocombine." </li></ul><p>  On your car, you can follow the Schelkovo highway in the direction of the village.  Chernogolovka (21 km from MKAD), to the village of Yunost. </p><h2>  "Paradise-Semenovskoe" </h2><p>  Returning to the conversation about "paradise on earth" (see the beginning of the article), it should be noted that, in addition to the "Raikes", there are other ancient Russian estates, which, with their beauty and tranquility, provoke thoughts of paradise among visitors.  Association with paradise, one way or another, was reflected in their names.  One of these places is the estate "Paradise-Semenovskoe" in the Serpukhov district.  For many decades, the village of Semenovskoye belonged to the Ordin-Nashchokin boyars.  At the turn of the XVIII-XIX centuries, the owner of the estate was the corps marshal of Paul I A.P.  Nashchokin, who created a magnificent architectural ensemble in the estate and proudly called it ‚ÄúParadise‚Äù.  In 1803, the owner opened a hydropathic establishment in the estate, which later became widely known.  To this day, resort buildings, unfortunately, have not been preserved.  After the revolution, "Paradise-Semenovskoe" gradually fell into desolation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.temples.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church in the estate &quot;Paradise-Semenovskoe&quot;" class="if uuid-2698549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39987/2698549.jpg"></div><h2>  The estate "Raek" (Tver region) </h2><p>  Another real "paradise on earth" is located near the city of Torzhok in the Tver region.  It takes only 3 hours to travel from Moscow to it.  The Znamenskoye-Raek estate (photos are presented in the article) is a truly amazing place with an unusually rich history.  From a bird's eye view, the complex resembles a precious necklace decorated with large diamonds, with a fastener - where the gates are located.  It is known that the estate "Raek" in the Tver region is the location of several documentary and feature films.  The last film starred here was the "Prisoner of the Old Manor" (dir. Marina Suleymanova, 2014) </p><p>  Historians say that at one time the unique suspended floor of the manor in Tver, by the ironic whim of the owner, made the beauties waltz and cling harder to their gentlemen.  Visitors are happy to admire the rich park area here, a picturesque lake with a romantic island of Love.  Manor "Raek" in Tver offers a restaurant and a mini-hotel.  Horseback riding and barbecue can be enjoyed here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turizm.sputnik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="General view of the estate" class="if uuid-2694640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39987/2694640.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The history of the Znamenskoye-Raek estate dates back to 1746, when its construction was commissioned by order of General-General Fedor Glebov.  The manor complex was built according to the project of Nikolai Lvov.  It was assumed that the monarchs would stop at the estate in Tver along the road from St. Petersburg to Moscow.  The construction here was carried out with a truly royal scale. </p><p>  A brief history of the estate "Raek" says that the owner F.I.  Glebov did not have a chance to live to see the finish of the estate.  His widow hardly visited the estate.  Heir, hussar officer P.F.  Glebov-Streshnev, died in the battle of Borodino.  After his death, the estate was sold, after which it gradually began to decline.  After the revolution of 1917, park buildings gradually disappeared.  Much of what HA created by Lvov has not survived to this day.  The last loss of the "Raek" estate in the Tver region was the beautiful rotunda collapsed in 1991. </p><h2>  Homestead today </h2><p>  Unfortunately, today only a small part of the past landscape and architectural delights has been preserved in Raika.  Once the tenants carried out restoration work, a restaurant and a hotel functioned in one of the wings of the complex.  It is known about the current mode of operation of the estate "Raek" in the Tver region that, at the moment, the restoration is suspended here, due to financial difficulties.  It is not yet possible to live in the estate, but if you wish, you can still explore the territory (the duration of the tour is 1 hour). </p><p>  Many tourists believe that the estate "Raek" in the Tver region is a place thanks to which it is possible to accurately understand why you are traveling through your native land. </p>
