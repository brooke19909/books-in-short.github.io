Modern technology is moving by leaps and bounds, and gadgets are being improved day by day.  And if yesterday the radio could only please its owner with sound, today it has turned into a real multimedia center with all the consequences. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.caraudiozone.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radio manufacturers" class="if uuid-2240858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2240858.jpg"></div><p>  It is very difficult to navigate in all the variety that is presented on the automotive market, especially to a novice in this business.  Therefore, we offer you a rating of the best car radios, which includes the most remarkable and high-quality representatives of their segment.  As a technical base, we take the standard interfaces that most cars are equipped with - 1DIN and 2DIN. </p><p>  Car Radio Rating: </p><ol><li>  "Pioneer" DEX-P99RS (1DIN). </li><li>  Prolodzhi MDD-720 (1DIN). </li><li>  Alpine IVE-W585BT (2DIN). </li><li>  "Pioneer" AVH-170 (2DIN). </li><li>  Kenwood DMX7017BTS (2DIN). </li></ol><p>  Let's consider some participants in more detail. </p><h2>  Pioneer DEX-P99RS (1DIN) </h2><p>  This model is confidently in the lead in the ranking of car radios for a year now.  Despite its frightening price tag, the device enjoys enviable popularity among domestic consumers.  The reason is, without exaggeration, the perfect sound that can only be obtained in a car interior. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.skroutz.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer radio" class="if uuid-2240857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2240857.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, this is the first model where the brand ‚Äútried‚Äù a powerful clock generator.  The latter allows you to completely eliminate any trembling sound, so you can forget about the usual "choking" on the bumps.  The model also confidently leads in the ratings of car radios in sound quality due to the extremely efficient module of four-way signal processing (DSP). </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  You can also note the excellent synergy of the radio with almost any periphery, whether it be a smartphone, a TV or an additional audio system.  Here you can add an intuitive and convenient interface, as well as exceptional build quality, as, indeed, with all the rest of the brand‚Äôs equipment. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  perfect sound output; </li><li>  integrated DSP module; </li><li>  support for almost any peripheral; </li><li>  automatic equalizer; </li><li>  good looks; </li><li>  gold plated contacts; </li><li>  copper frame. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  easily soiled front panel; </li><li>  high price. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 45,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Prology MDD-720 (1DIN) </h2><p>  The model is included in our rating of car radios due to its versatility.  In fact, this is a real entertainment center.  The device owes much of its versatility to a retractable panel with a 16 to 9 screen, which greatly expands the functionality of the radio. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.prology.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radio prolodzhi" class="if uuid-2240856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2240856.jpg"></div><p>  The model is able to "digest" almost everything that you offer it, from CDs to finicky flash drives.  There are no problems with codecs either: the radio tape recorder reads all the popular audio and video formats. </p><p>  The device is also included in the rating of car radios because it can connect to navigators, multi-wheels and any car cameras, so there is simply no need to install any additional equipment. </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  excellent retractable sensor in a ratio of 16 to 9; </li><li>  high-quality sound; </li><li>  an abundance of multimedia functionality; </li><li>  extended radio range; </li><li>  reliable transformation mechanism; </li><li>  Extensive peripheral support </li><li>  more than a democratic price tag for the available features. </li></ul><p>  No cons were noticed. </p><p>  Estimated price - about 11,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Alpine IVE-W585BT (2DIN) </h2><p>  The model is included in our rating of car radios thanks to the widest sound settings, extremely high-quality assembly and a convenient graphical interface.  If you like to fine-tune everything for yourself, then you are provided with a long tour of the gadget menu branches.  There are so many of them that just my eyes run up. </p><div class="photo" data-original="eshop.aliso.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpine radio" class="if uuid-2240859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2240859.jpg"></div><p>  In any case, if you mess with the settings for laziness, you can choose one of dozens of presets, moreover, sensible, and enjoy the crystal clear sound.  Those who find the power of the built-in amplifier a little, can easily supplement any channel.  But even without it, the car feels complete immersion and atmospheric tracks, especially if the latter in good quality. </p><p>  The model showed itself perfectly in tandem with mobile gadgets and quietly connects to both devices on the Android platform and apple devices.  For this, a USB interface and a wireless bluetooth module are provided. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  excellent sound quality; </li><li>  intuitive and convenient interface; </li><li>  synergy with the standard vehicle functionality; </li><li>  the ability to connect a variety of peripherals. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  non-switching panel backlight; </li><li>  Does not read the FLAC format (requires an external gadget). </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 36 000 rubles. </p><h2>  Which radio to choose? </h2><p>  When choosing a radio, you first need to look at the form factor (1DIN / 2DIN), brand popularity and your financial capabilities.  A manufacturer who is happy for his reputation will never launch a raw or low-quality device on the market.  While no-name brands from the Middle Kingdom stamp gadgets, not caring either about their image, or, naturally, about the consumer. </p><p>  In the first case, we have an expensive but extremely high-quality product, and in the second, frank rubbish, which will not only break in a week or two, but will also burn car systems.  Therefore, such savings, especially when it comes to this kind of technique, are not appropriate here. </p>
