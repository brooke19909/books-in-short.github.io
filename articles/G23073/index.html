  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Which routers are suitable for Rostelecom: examples and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Rostelecom connects many users throughout Russia, uses a large number of technologies and equipment.  It happens that home routers fail, and then the question arises which routers are suitable for Rostelecom.  In this article, we will consider the main models that are suitable for use on the network of this provider. </p><h2>  We determine the type of connection </h2><p>  In order to determine which <span>routers are better</span> for Rostelecom, you need to know your type of connection.  Different devices are suitable for different technologies.  You can do this in the following ways: </p><ul><li>  A call to the technical support of the provider - according to your contract, the specialist will immediately determine how the connection is made and provide information of interest. </li><li>  Visual definition - if you can determine which cable enters the room, it will immediately become clear which technology you are connecting to.  If it is a copper telephone cable, then you are connected via ADSL, if optical means PON, a thick coaxial cable, like a television cable, Docsis, and if a twisted pair cable is connected to a computer or router, then we are talking about FttX technology. </li></ul><p>  Each of these technologies has its own connection features, and it is very simple to determine which Wi-Fi routers are better.  There are no special restrictions on Rostelecom on the network, except when equipment is installed directly from the provider, which is not purchased at the store (this is relevant for GPON and Docsis technologies).  In these situations, correct operation requires not only a WiFi router, but also auxiliary devices provided directly from the provider. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.harveynorman.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="many routers" class="if uuid-2889565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107577/2889565.jpg"></div><p>  We will analyze all types of connections in turn and give examples of the best routers for Rostelecom with a photo. </p><h2>  XDSL Connection </h2><p>  For this technology, an ADSL modem is used - a device that allows access to the Internet via a telephone line.  Just ten years ago, ADSL modems did not allow access to the Internet via a wireless network, and an additional device was required.  Now almost all modern ADSL modems are capable of distributing a wireless network.  For Rostelecom it is optimal to use the following models: </p><ul><li>  D-Link DSL2640U. </li><li>  ZTE H108N. </li><li>  TP-Link TD854W. </li><li>  Intercross. </li><li>  Sagemcom F @ st 2804. </li></ul><p>  All these models can be either provided by the provider or sold in the retail network.  Most subscribers connect through the Annex A port, but in some cases Annex B is involved - before purchasing a modem, you need to find out from the provider information about how the connection is made in your case. </p><p>  For example, the D-Link 2640U ADSL modem looks like this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="2640 router photo" class="if uuid-2889215" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107577/2889215.jpg"></div><h2>  GPon connection </h2><p>  It also requires a special device for connection - an optical terminal (ONT).  If the ADSL modem can be freely purchased at the store, then the GPon terminal is provided directly from Rostelecom and can only be replaced with the same equipment from the provider. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many ONTs support the ability to connect wirelessly and distribute WiFi like ordinary home routers, but there are terminals without this function - you can connect any device that connects using FTTX technology to them.  We will consider them further. </p><p>  Optical terminals provided by Rostelecom: </p><ul><li>  Huawei 8245H. </li><li>  Sercomm RV6699 (dual band support). </li><li>  Sagemcom F @ ST 5650. </li></ul><p>  These models have a WiFi module and can be used as routers.  Be sure to check when connecting what characteristics the equipment that you install when connecting and whether you need to purchase a separate router has. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sagemcom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="optical terminal" class="if uuid-2889263" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107577/2889263.jpg"></div><h2>  Docsis Connection </h2><p>  This is not the most common technology, it is used only in some regions.  Connection is made using a coaxial cable and the corresponding modem.  A coaxial modem is provided from the provider and does not have a built-in WiFi module in order to distribute a wireless network throughout the apartment.  Requires the connection of an additional router.  In this case, you don‚Äôt have to wonder which routers are suitable for Rostelecom, but purchase any router that uses Ethernet technology and connect it to a cable modem. </p><h2>  FTTx Connection </h2><p>  Here, the choice of home wireless routers is much more extensive, since additional devices are not required - the connection is made immediately via a twisted pair cable spent in the subscriber‚Äôs apartment. </p><p>  Accordingly, you can choose any Wi-Fi router that supports the ability to work on an Ethernet cable.  In this case, you can analyze the necessary requirements for the wireless network in your case and choose a router with suitable technical specifications. </p><p>  Based on the experience of use and user ratings, you can determine which routers are suitable for Rostelecom using FTTx technology. </p><ul><li>  The line of D-Link models (DIR 300, DIR 615, DIR 620). </li><li>  TP-Link (e.g. TL WR 841N). </li><li>  Zyxel (models Keenetik - Lite, Giga, etc.). </li><li>  Netgear (WNR 1000, WNR 3500). </li></ul><p>  In addition, many other models of routers are suitable, the main factor of choice is that the router is connected via an Ethernet cable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TP Link Router" class="if uuid-2889460" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107577/2889460.jpg"></div><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  So, we examined the basic router models that are suitable for Rostelecom.  Which router to choose depends on your wishes for a wireless network and capabilities.  Now there is a wide selection of both budget models that have average technical characteristics and are available to everyone, as well as serious equipment with more extensive capabilities. </p>
