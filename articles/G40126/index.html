This promotion didn‚Äôt cause much excitement, because it didn‚Äôt show the main thing for the one-minute video: the discount is valid only if the condition is met - the card user needs to activate the ‚ÄúBalance Transfer‚Äù service. </p>

    <h2>  Terms of use </h2><p>  Tinkoff Platinum is the bank's flagship product.  It makes it easy to make purchases in both retail and online stores.  In addition, each of them brings points.  And most importantly - there is a unique four-month grace period, due to the connection to the new product of the bank - ‚ÄúBalance Transfer‚Äù. </p><p>  How advantageous is the offer - 120 days without interest on Tinkoff Platinum?  Under standard conditions, the grace period is 55 days.  During this time, it is necessary to fully repay the debt, or at least part of it, making payment in the amount of 6% of the total amount of borrowed money.  Banking conditions allow you to configure auto payments to systematically replenish the credit card balance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The start date of the grace period is indicated in the service contract (most often this is the day it is signed). </p><p>  You can continue to use a credit card, because interest on purchases is not charged. </p><p>  Plus, we note that the bank has no branches.  No one.  For the owner of Tinkoff, Oleg Tinkov, believes that time is the most unique and accessible resource.  And why spend it on the line?  In his company, the client can solve all arising issues either by going to the official website through an Internet browser, or through a mobile application, or simply by calling the toll-free number on the call center.  And that‚Äôs it: five minutes of time, whole nerve cells and no problem. </p><h2>  How does the card work without interest from Tinkoff? </h2><p>  Everything is simple.  With its help, you can conduct a kind of restructuring of one loan from a third-party bank.  After this operation, the promised benefit is included - 120 days without interest.  At Tinkoff Platinum, reviews often write about this, at the end of the grace period, interest accrual starts again according to the current tariff.  Do not forget about the monthly payment, which should be at least 6% of the resulting debt.  You can use this offer of the bank only once a year. </p>

    <p>  The service is available to both new and existing customers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The credit limit does not exceed 300,000 rubles (card users write that the bank determines the ceiling of issued money within two to three wages). </p><h2>  Bank Terms </h2><p>  The benefits of this proposal can be assessed by the following criteria: </p><ul><li>  <span>The grace period is</span> 90 days (in case of debt restructuring, it increases to 120 days).  It should be noted that interest is not paid, but payments on the principal debt must be paid (6% of the loan body). </li><li>  After this period, the remaining amount will begin to accrue interest at the rate according to the tariff plan. </li><li>  Restructuring can only be one loan, which must be rid of debts and delinquencies.  Redemption is possible both partial and full (one-time). </li><li>  The service is connected for free. </li><li>  A third-party bank loan can be repaid only within the limit of the approved card.  That is, if it is 70,000, then the transfer will be the same amount (subject to the availability of these funds). </li><li>  According to the terms of the Tinkoff credit card - ‚Äú120 days without interest‚Äù, you can use this service only once a year. </li><li>  You can connect a banking product exclusively through a call center or through an application for mobile gadgets, by correspondence with a bank specialist. </li><li>  All transfers are made to personal accounts (operations are blocked on the account of a third party). </li><li>  Cashback is available with an interest rate of 1-30% of the purchase price and the Bravo program.  Within its framework, a bonus in the form of points is credited for 1% of the acquisition amount.  With their help, you can pay for tickets for a train, plane, restaurant bill, etc. </li><li>  Active use of the card increases the limit. </li><li>  Internet banking is thought out to the smallest detail.  It is convenient to receive information on a loan with it, including the date of payment and the amount. </li><li>  The card is issued without guarantors and collateral.  By the way, all kinds of references and photocopies are not required. </li><li>  Abroad, plastic from Tinkoff also works great.  It automatically translates rubles into the currency of the host country and vice versa, allowing the tourist not to "bother" with currency exchange and the search for bank terminals. </li><li>  Card funds can be withdrawn to credit accounts (for debit this service does not work). </li><li>  On the World Wide Web, payments are made via 3D-Secure (secure service). </li></ul>

    <h2>  Interesting nuances </h2><p>  For the correct use of the service on the Tinkoff card - ‚Äú120 days without interest‚Äù, bank customers offer several recommendations. </p><ol><li>  Before applying for a service, you need to check the credit limit: there should be no debts.  Otherwise, confusion arises: first, debts will be written off on purchases made or cash withdrawals, and only then on the transferred loan. </li><li>  During the grace period, after restructuring, you need to refrain from any card transactions, because, as usual, you get confusion in these same periods, and, as a result, interest is accrued (and considerable). </li><li>  If there are paid services, they must be turned off: the monthly fee must be paid off in full. </li></ol><p>  I want to emphasize that this card has the highest percentage of bank approval.  And neither bad credit history, nor the presence of debts in third-party banks does not interfere with this.  In this way, according to the mutual opinion of users, a modern bank works that respects its customers.  In addition, Tinkoff always has adequate technical support, and even around the clock. </p><p>  On specialized banking products sites, Tinkoff cards have a rather high rating.  And ‚ÄúPlatinum‚Äù - ‚Äú120 days without interest‚Äù from the beginning of September 2017 takes the second place.  Customers positively evaluate this plastic, noting in the reviews that with a rational approach to the transferred loan, it becomes easy. </p><p>  If criticism is encountered, it most often affects the high annual rate and the conditions that the bank suddenly changes to more loyal ones, only the user has to declare their desire to refuse any Tinkoff services. </p>

    <h2>  When is it better to choose a different card? </h2><p>  Having studied all the pros and cons of the Tinkoff Platinum card - ‚Äú120 days without interest‚Äù, we can say that you need to refuse it if: </p><ul><li>  Funds are needed only for purchases.  There are more convenient and more profitable options.  For example, Halva or cards from Home Credit. </li><li>  Money will often be withdrawn to a debit card or cashed.  Here the plastic ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù from Alfa Bank will perfectly cope. </li></ul><p>  In any other case, nothing is better than Tinkoff Platinum - ‚Äú120 days without interest‚Äù (reviews are vivid proof of this), no. </p><h2>  Post scriptum </h2><p>  Finally, a small example.  Suppose a debt in a third-party bank of 100,000 rubles was taken at 30% per annum.  For three months, 7,500 rubles is accumulated as interest.  We transfer the debt to Tinkoff Bank using the Tinkoff Platinum card - ‚Äú120 days without interest‚Äù (reviews confirm the profitability of the transaction) and save the announced interest minus 590 rubles (fee charged for servicing the card).  It looks convincing. </p>
