    <p>  In the ski resort of Terskol, the hotels are simply gigantic in size and are eight-story.  There is also a sports complex, which includes a swimming pool, gym, tennis court, basketball and volleyball courts and much more. </p><p>  In the <span>Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, a</span> ski resort is far from alone.  But it is Terskol that is the most popular among the population.  And this is not surprising, since it is located on the territory of one of the <span>national parks.</span>  The nearest settlements are the cities of Nalchik and Pyatigorsk. </p><p>  Terskol is a temperate ski resort.  The minimum temperature level is minus fifteen degrees Celsius.  The maximum is plus thirty-five degrees.  Some tourists note the fact that over the past few years, the Terskol camp site has evolved for the better.  This is expressed in the absence of queues, reasonable prices and a friendly mood of vacationers.  In addition, work is carried out on the ski slopes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  From any of the nearest settlements - the cities of Nalchik and Pyatigorsk - you can order a taxi to the tourist base of Terskol, the fare will be from two and a half to five and a half thousand rubles.  If you go a big company, you can hire a "Gazelle".  Then the cost of the trip will be five hundred and fifty rubles per person. </p><h2>  Terskol village </h2><p>  Recently, in the mountain village of Terskol, hotels began to appear with enviable constancy.  The number of various private hotels has sharply increased, as well as all kinds of inscriptions in a foreign language (many, by the way, contain very funny errors).  You even get the impression that you are abroad. </p><h2>  Cableway </h2><p>  Terskol is a ski resort that is equipped with a <span>cable car.</span>  The cost of a daily subscription is seven hundred and fifty rubles.  People who have already rested here note that the cable car is automated, which is very convenient.  But sometimes various force majeure can happen.  For example, at some point in the ticket office there may not be a subscription.  As a result, a person first has to purchase one-time tickets, and then already permanent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Contactless ski passes, which are freely removed from your pocket, are also poorly mastered here.  Tickets have to be pushed into the slots of readers, which is not very convenient, especially when you are holding skis and <span>ski poles</span> in your hands <span>.</span>  It is good that there are always controllers next to the turnstiles who, if something happens, can stick their unlimited subscriptions into the slot. </p>

    <h2>  Ski slope </h2><p>  Terskol is a ski resort that is equipped with a special ski run.  Once there was one of the most interesting slopes formed by a stream.  Going down it, it was possible to imagine that you are inside the mountain.  However, at the moment, this descent was leveled and smoothed out with a bulldozer, as a result of which the ski slope became smoother.  Although, of course, we must pay tribute - it is really comfortable, the snow-ice pillow has been rolled since the autumn.  This advantage is noted by almost all people who have already visited this resort.  Therefore, many prefer to go here, despite the fact that in the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria there is not one ski resort. </p><h2>  Second turn </h2><p>  There is a so-called second-line descent in the ski resort of Terskol.  And, by the way, it has recently been improved.  A narrow gutter with closed corners was constructed.  When approaching him, you never know what awaits you around the bend.  Unfortunately, as a result of this, one of the highlights of the route was lost - the “goat trail”, which has always been a kind of <span>stumbling block</span> for snowboarders.  On this site you could always see who rides well and who does not know how to do it at all.  Now there is a wide tractor road, again perfectly aligned. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cottage Terskol" class="if" height="273" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/737565.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ski area </h2><p>  There are a lot of slopes for skiing in the Terskol ski resort.  Convenience lies in the fact that here you can find the most suitable slope for yourself, both a beginner and a professional.  Or, for example, you can start with a simple track, and then gradually move on to more difficult.  So does most vacationers.  People who feel confident in this sport, but it’s too early to call them professionals, are suitable routes of light and medium difficulty.  For the most advanced skiers, a so-called freeride is provided. </p><h2>  Accommodation </h2><p>  The most ideal option, of course, is a hotel or hotel, which is located within walking distance from the ski area.  Although, of course, the prices there will be several times higher.  But otherwise, you will have to go huge distances in heavy ski boots and with skis at the ready, well, or adjust to the bus schedule, which is not always convenient. </p><p>  There is, however, another option - to rent equipment at a rental point, which is located next to the ski lift.  Boots and skis can be left there for the night, and completely free of charge.  In this case, you can live far from the ski lift, it will not cause you much inconvenience, but the budget will save a lot.  Just come in the morning in ordinary boots, try skiing, pick up your skis, and you can go uphill.  In the evening, leave your equipment at the rental point and go home. </p>

    <p>  After skiing, you can relax in the bath or sauna, and then go to dinner.  If you have taken a ticket for the “breakfast-dinner” scheme, then you can have dinner at your hotel.  If only “breakfast”, then for an evening meal you can choose absolutely any of the restaurants of the Terskol ski resort.  Hotels, however, sometimes they accept the rule according to which only guests can eat from them.  But you certainly will not stay hungry. </p><p>  What is especially convenient is that before entering some cafes and restaurants, a menu is posted.  Thus, in order to become familiar with it, it is not at all necessary to go inside. </p>

People who have already rested here often return here again to experience unforgettable emotions and enjoy the picturesque landscape.  You can come to the resort with small children.
