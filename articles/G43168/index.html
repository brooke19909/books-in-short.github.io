    <p>  As you know, the location is an important point to pay attention to when choosing a hotel.  Must Sea Hotel 3 * hotel has a favorable location.  That is what makes her so popular.  The hotel is located in one of the most popular areas of the island, just 500 meters from the famous <span>Kata Beach.</span>  Phuket, or rather the vibrant city center, is located about 15 km.  In walking distance is another beach that every tourist has heard of - Karon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The distance to the international airport is about 45 km - the road to the hotel is unlikely to take much time (guests, by the way, are provided with a convenient transfer).  This is a resort area, which means that there are shops, salons, bars, restaurants and other entertainment venues nearby. </p><h2>  Must Sea Hotel 3 * hotel (Thailand, Phuket): what does the territory look like? </h2><p>  In fact, this is a very small city-style hotel, which means that its own territory here is very small.  The hotel itself is a compact four-story building, built in a modern style.  The first floor is reserved for public places - there is a reception desk, a lounge and a waiting room, a cozy cafe and bar. </p><p>  By the way, this is a completely new hotel - it was opened in 2011.  And already in 2014, a radical reconstruction was carried out here.  Reviews of regular customers indicate that the hotel is becoming more and more comfortable every year. </p><h2>  Room categories for guests </h2><p>  After a day full of events and entertainment, I want to return to a cozy, quiet room where you can relax and unwind.  What the Must Sea Hotel 3 * offers: </p><ul><li>  Superior Room - spacious rooms with a good repair and new appliances.  Some rooms have their own balcony, while others can enjoy city views from the huge windows. </li><li>  Family Room - large rooms, which consist of a bedroom and a spacious living room with soft folding furniture.  Almost all have balconies with chairs and a table for relaxing in the fresh air. </li></ul><p>  By the way, the hotel is quite small - there are 64 rooms.  For many tourists, this is not a disadvantage, since the territory is always quiet and calm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What does the room look like?

    <p>  Almost every tourist arrives on the island, planning to spend time on the beach, because Phuket is famous for its luxurious coastline.  The world famous <span>Kata Beach</span> is just a short walk away <span>.</span>  And in 10-15 minutes you can walk to Karon Beach, which is no less popular among tourists. </p><p>  Of course, there are many opportunities to have fun, ranging from beach volleyball and water skiing, ending with sailing and scuba diving.  The beaches here are clean (especially in season), the water is warm and the entrance to the sea is convenient.  Since these are places of public recreation, the use of sun loungers and umbrellas is paid separately every day.  By the way, on the shore there is a huge number of cozy cafes where you can order a chilled drink, dine or even treat yourself to seafood dishes. </p><h2>  Hotel Must Sea Hotel 3 * (Phuket): additional service </h2>

On the other hand, it feels comfortable and everywhere feels real home cosiness. </p><p>  At your disposal are spacious rooms with a fresh renovation and modern appliances.  By the way, the insulation here is excellent, tourists relax in peace and quiet.  Breakfasts, albeit slightly monotonous, are still tasty and hearty.  And the staff here are very attentive and helpful.  One has only to say that not everyone understands the Russian language, but there are no problems with English speech.  Conflicts between guests and staff are very rare. </p><p>  As you know, the prices in Phuket are quite reasonable, which attracts tourists.  The cost of living at the hotel is quite affordable - this place is suitable for an economical, but nevertheless comfortable stay. </p>
