This is a wonderful area of ‚Äã‚Äã330 hectares.  One of the three Moscow places of this type.  The oldest of them was founded in 1706 by decree of Peter I, who planned that a raw material base would be created there for the production of medicines. </p><p>  Also a <span>beautiful place</span> is the area near Moscow State University, located near the Sparrow Hills.  The largest such institution was opened in 1945 in <span>Ostankino Park.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Functions </h2><p>  The first task assigned to the Botanical Garden (ENEA) is to preserve the diversity of biological species.  Here you can find 2 thousand wood and artisanal types that were collected around the world.  There is a wonderful exhibition called the Rosary, the stunning Garden of Coastal Plants, and the interesting Shadow Garden.  There are decorative and floral views. </p><p>  The greenhouse is full of interesting representatives of the tropics, of which there are more than 6 thousand.  The Botanical Garden (VDNH) has a huge territory.  By the time it began to operate, it had an area of ‚Äã‚Äã360 hectares.  Compared with Monaco, it is twice as much. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Freedom and space </h2><p>  It looks like a large-scale park Botanical Garden (ENEA).  Photos can give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe incredible beauty of these places.  There are no strict rules of conduct and signs, just a couple of warnings, which, however, people who come bypass attention and still sit on the grass. </p><p>  Also, many people like to sunbathe here, are engaged in roller skating, cycling.  It is very good to relax in the garden.  Thanks to the collection of unusual plants, the atmosphere here is much more beautiful than in a regular park complex.  People who are more focused on gaining knowledge than on a pleasant stay can be invited to go to the Pharmacy Garden, which adorns Mira Avenue. </p>

    <h2>  Availability </h2><p>  This is the largest place of such significance, where you can completely relax, enjoy walking or cycling, and also acquire knowledge about new interesting plants.  In Europe, this garden has virtually no analogues. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can join the excursion group, where you will be provided with useful information, or you can independently travel around the territory.  You will find the mysterious density of the forest, where they feed the squirrels and relax by small ponds. </p><p>  Nowadays, fresh air is becoming increasingly rare, but it is here that you can saturate your brain with oxygen properly.  The only thing that is required of you is not to litter or harm plants.  After all, you probably will want to come here tomorrow and many more times.  So you need to protect such an undeniable value. </p>

    <h2>  Curious details </h2><p>  There is one feature that visitors should keep in mind and not to forget.  Not everyone can immediately find the entrance here.  And there are actually two of them: from VDNH and from the Vladykino metro station.  It is better to arm yourself with a card, as it is pretty easy to get confused.  Many presumptuously believe that they will orient themselves on the spot, leaving the station "Botanical Garden", but it does not work. </p><p>  Due to the lack of signs, it‚Äôs hard not only to get here, but also to get out of the garden.  One gets the feeling that the most favorable conditions have been created so that fewer people come and prevent nature from living in a way that is familiar to it.  Getting lost here is quite simple, so a detailed guide to moving will be very helpful.  So quite consciously you need to go to the Botanical Garden (ENEA).  Some locals can tell you how to get there, each of which, for sure, has been here at least once. </p><p>  If you overcome these difficulties, you will see an amazing sight of wildlife.  Walking here, you will feel that you have become a visitor to a lovely forest park, a mysterious wild forest, a cozy and wonderful garden in which fruit trees grow abundantly.  You can play with cute handmade squirrels.  Forest birds living here are also not very shy, so you may even be able to feed them with your hands. </p><h2>  Important details </h2><p>  A great place to relax is the Botanical Garden (ENEA).  Address: Moscow, st.  Botanical, 4. You can pre-book a tour or ask a question that interests you.  Buses under the numbers 803, 24 and 85, as well as trolley buses 73, 9 and 36 can be brought here. </p>

At other times, your stay here should be limited to from 11:00 to 17:00.  You can visit the garden on all days except Monday, which was a weekend.

From the beginning to mid-autumn, it works from 12 to 18 hours, rest - Monday and Thursday.  The standard ticket price is 250 rubles, students can go for 200 rubles, and schoolchildren and pensioners for 150 rubles. </p><p>  Sometimes you need to get out into the countryside in order to breathe air and allow yourself to relax, abstract from the hustle and bustle of the city, calm down and enjoy the silence.  Thanks to just such places it becomes possible. </p>
