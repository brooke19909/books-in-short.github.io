So what's the difference where to go.  On the other hand, this is not at all true.  The Caucasus, Sochi, Abkhazia, Bulgaria - everywhere there is a piece of the Black Sea with its unique climatic features.  Golden Sands is one of the most brilliant European resorts.  The coast here has a unique energy that attracts millions of tourists here.  It owes its name to the fine-grained yellow sand that makes up the coastal soil. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Tourists who come to relax in Blue Sky 3 * <span>(Golden Sands, Bulgaria)</span> can plan an entertainment program in advance.  Here you can offer the most interesting historical information set.  Tourists emphasize that neither in the ski resorts, nor in the equatorial countries, nor in the exotic East, there is nothing like this. </p><p>  A unique ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù of local recreation is the treatment with bee products, namely bee venom and propolis.  Ancient churches and monasteries are another area of ‚Äã‚Äãlocal tourism.  In particular, we recommend that you visit the small chapel of John the Baptist and <span>the Aladzha Monastery.</span>  The magnificent architecture and cave paintings are worth it to visit here and touch the spirit of the Middle Ages.  It is remarkable that these objects are equally interesting both for those who reverently relate to world religious traditions and for a staunch atheist. </p><p>  However, let's go directly to the description of the hotel Blue Sky 3 (Golden Sands, Bulgaria).  This is a great example of how a summer vacation should go. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blue sky 3 bulgaria" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1434756.jpg" width="600"></div>
