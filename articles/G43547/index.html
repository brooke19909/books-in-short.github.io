    <p>  Guests who first arrived in the city, probably wonder about where to go in Astrakhan.  There are many interesting places, some of which will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  The Kremlin is the main attraction </h2><p>  The main historical attraction of the city is the Kremlin, which is a unique example of Russian fortification architecture.  It was an outpost that defended the southern borders of the country from numerous enemies (troops of the Crimean Khan, Ottoman Turks).  The Kremlin was built in the second half of the 16th century.  It is located on the island, at the confluence of the Volga and several small rivers. </p><p>  Throughout its history, the Kremlin has constantly improved and rebuilt.  Currently, this is a museum and ethnographic complex.  You can get to it from the train station by bus, or by taking a taxi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many visit Astrakhan as part of a business trip or a weekend trip.  Such tourists are interested in the question of where to go to Astrakhan today, since time may be limited, and I would like to see something interesting. </p><h2>  <span>Astrakhan Kremlin</span> as a museum and exhibition complex </h2><p>  The museum in the Kremlin was opened in 1974.  In the 70s of the XX century, the structures of the tower and the Kremlin itself were repaired.  Since that time, it has the status of a reserve.  On its territory (in the Artillery Tower and the "Red Gate", as well as the office of the head of the fortress) is an ethnographic museum.  There are also many exhibitions devoted to military history. </p>
