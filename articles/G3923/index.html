  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to Choose a Tour to Kiev</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Kiev is known as the capital of Ukraine.  If you have the citizenship of the Russian Federation, and you want to travel to Kiev, you do not need a visa.  There is a visa-free regime between states. </p><p>  Remember that you have the right to enter the country upon presentation of the border guards both the internal passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation and the international passport.  Therefore, when planning a trip on a certain date and in the absence of a passport, do not worry.  Both passports give you the right to unhindered entry into and exit from the country.  The only difference is that if you travel with an internal passport, you will have to fill out a special immigration card when crossing the border.  If you have a passport, the customs officer will put you a note on entry / exit, and you will no longer need to fill out anything. </p><p>  Having solved the issue with a passport, it is worthwhile to purchase tickets.  You can fly to Kiev by direct regular flights of Ukrainian and Russian airlines, as well as connecting flights with transfers.  You can take direct flights from Moscow to Kiev with Aerosvit Airlines, Ukraine Intl Airlines, Aeroflot, Transaero Airlines.  Travel time will be a little over one hour.  The ticket price ranges from 5,000 rubles.  During discounts and special offers, you can buy an air ticket even cheaper. </p><p>  With a transfer to Kiev, airlines will help you fly Air Baltic and Belavia.  You will fly through Riga or Minsk.  Travel time is up to 10 hours.  The price of a ticket for connecting flights starts at 8,000 rubles. </p><p>  Be sure to take care of purchasing a ticket in advance.  During the holidays, the price rises and the most interesting options are bought up first.  Visit airline sites and explore specialized airline ticketing resources.  Next, compare prices with flight conditions.  Remember that Transaero Airlines flies to Kiev from Domodedovo, and Aeroflot flights depart from Sheremetyevo.  Prepare a passport with a credit card and book a ticket.  After receiving the itinerary receipt by e-mail, print it.  You can also buy tickets at travel agencies and through ticket offices selling tickets. </p><p>  Think about where you want to live.  In the absence of acquaintances or relatives who are ready to provide housing, before purchasing <noindex>  <span>tour to Kiev</span> </noindex>  need to book a hotel.  Prepare a medical insurance policy.  It will not necessarily be required when entering the country, but it makes sense to be safe from unforeseen circumstances. </p></div></article>
