Thanks to this skill, you will not only acquire a huge number of beautiful and interesting toys and jewelry, but also be able <span>to develop fine motor skills of your</span> hands.  Origami will help you and improve your character: out of positive qualities you will develop endurance, perseverance, patience and attentiveness.  Agree, this is a useful set for every modern person.  It will be even better if you attach a child to your hobby - this lesson will also be useful to him! </p><p>  So, there are many figures, but we will show you something original.  This paper toy can change shape and transform the way you want it.  We offer you to fold origami "transformer". </p><p>  Origami "transformer" is a toy that can have several variations.  For example, there is a Suriken - a throwing star of the Japanese - an ancient weapon.  It can be transformed into an ordinary asterisk and into a tulip.  And there is an origami "transformer", which can be both a cube and a rose.  As a rule, children like these toys very much. </p><p>  <span>How to make origami</span> "transformer"?  First, we will tell you about meerken.  We bend horizontally in half, then we bend and to this line we bend again two halves of your paper sheet.  Now again you need to fold the sheet in half - again horizontally.  We bend the corners on the right and left sides to the center.  Now we bend them along the oblique.  Repeat the same with another sheet, glue the parts with glue or adhesive tape.  And your figure is ready.  If you flip it the other side and expand the corners in the opposite direction, you get a six-pointed star. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Origami from paper "transformer" may be different.  The cube that turns into a flower is called kusudama.  It can be done like this: </p><p>  In order to get support lines, bend the sheet across two times - a cross-shaped bend is obtained.  Flatten the sheet, fold it in half horizontally.  Make a fold and straighten it again.  Now repeat all the horizontal folds vertically and bend again.  Now you need to fold the double triangle.  If you can go over the corners with the ‚Äúvalley‚Äù technique, then your origami ‚Äútransformer‚Äù will be two-color. </p><p>  Now we make zipper folds on one and the second side - this will allow us to push the corners of our product inward.  Repeat the same manipulations on the other side.  The top of the product must be laid to the right.  And then gently bend it inward.  Two of the peaks on the side lift up.  The first module we have done.  It remains to do five more of the same.  Attach these parts to each other using glue or tape.  You should get a cube - a wonderful origami transformer.  And now this, at first glance, a straightforward figure, is ready to show the world and you the wonders of reincarnation.  If you bend the corners of each small square to the center, you get a fluffy ball.  If these same corners are bent inward, a rose will turn out.  Just try to glue the parts in advance so that they do not fall apart at the moment when you will demonstrate the transformation to your loved ones. </p><p>  Do you want to surprise your child with a new toy, which will be not just a beautiful figure, but a thing that can develop your baby?  Then make him such an origami "transformer" - this thing will be much more useful than all the developing games that are sold in stores.  One minus - the product is very fragile.  But you can initially warn the baby that his transformer may break, then he will be more careful in handling.  And by the way, then this toy will help you to cultivate care and accuracy in your baby.  So create your paper masterpieces and give joy to yourself and your children! </p>
