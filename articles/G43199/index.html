    <h2>  Electronic document management between organizations: how it works </h2><p>  In accordance with domestic law, electronic document management between organizations is conducted by agreement of two parties.  For data exchange, it is necessary that all participants are connected to the equipment of one operator.  Next, the user needs to send a request to be added to the list of contractors.  After confirming the request, participants in the system can exchange data. </p><p>  The EDI module will have to perform such functions: </p><ul><li>  Invite counterparties to share data. </li><li>  Create an address book. </li><li>  Integrate with accounting software, for example, 1C. </li><li>  Sign and encrypt documentation. </li><li>  To structure correspondence. </li><li>  Track the status of letters. </li></ul><p>  Electronic document management between organizations is carried out using certificates.  Connection to the server and authentication is carried out through a personal digital certificate.  EDS is issued to each user of the system, stored on an electronic token and is protected by a PIN code.  The user must enter your username, password for your personal account.  Only after that he will get access to his documents. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Any employee of the organization connected to the system can initiate the exchange process.  Before sending a document to a counterparty, it must be signed in the EDS.  This operation is performed using the Cryptopro program.  The document is sent via EDI.  The counterparty employee receives a notification of the receipt of a new document.  If he accepts it, then he also puts an EDS.  If you need to make changes to the document, a new electronic version is created.  Upon completion of editing, you need to save all changes with the help of EDS.  Then the document with the change is sent to the counterparty.  If necessary, electronic approval of information is carried out. </p><p>  If it is necessary to make changes again, the whole procedure is repeated anew.  If there are no complaints about the new version, then the document is respected.  The final result is a sample signed by two digital signatures.  All versions of the document are stored on the server and are available for viewing.  Once a valid status has been assigned to the sample, it will not be possible to amend the document.  Upset contracts are assigned the status of ‚ÄúCanceled‚Äù.  Here's how electronic workflow between organizations is carried out. </p>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  What is needed for electronic workflow between organizations?  First, you need to choose a telecom operator and install special software for exchanging information.  Secondly, with each counterparty with whom the organization intends to conduct electronic correspondence, it is necessary to conclude an "Agreement on the exchange of electronic documents." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is also necessary to install an EDI server on which all documents will be stored.  This can be either client equipment or cloud storage.  Access to system data from the outside is through an application that is installed on the equipment of the organization‚Äôs employees.  The computers interact with the server via HTTP with additional SSL 128 encryption. Documents are accessed only through the application interface and after authentication. </p><h2>  EDI Project </h2><p>  A process automation project can last from several months to several years.  The term directly depends on the number of processes that need to be automated, resource and financial capabilities of the organization.  A brief outline of the implementation of EDI is as follows: </p><ul><li>  Creation of a working group. </li><li>  Formation of goals, deadlines and project budget. </li><li>  Investigation of existing processes. </li><li>  Develop assignments. </li><li>  The breakdown of the EDI system. </li><li>  Signing of an agreement for the implementation of an EDMS. </li><li>  Approval of the work schedule. </li><li>  Filling system directories. </li><li>  Training. </li><li>  Conducting preliminary tests. </li><li>  The publication of the order on the implementation of the EDMS. </li><li>  Finalization of software and work regulations. </li><li>  Launch of a pilot project. </li><li>  Full-scale transition to EDI. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Errors of EDI implementation </h2><p>  In the process of <span>document automation,</span> special attention should be paid to processes in which the presence of paper is required by law.  You cannot duplicate a paper document electronically.  This significantly slows down the work process and causes a negative attitude to the automation process as a whole.  Nobody pays extra for double work. </p><p>  In the process of implementation, you need to develop new regulations for working with documents, train staff and only after that engage in full-fledged implementation.  This can be achieved only if you convey to employees the benefits of using new technologies. </p><p>  Another popular mistake is a poor study of the requirements for EDMS.  If users have to work in a non-customized system, then the EDI process is different from what is accepted in the organization. </p><h2>  Electronic document flow between organizations: pros and cons </h2><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  Reduce the cost of sending original documents by mail. </li><li>  Save storage space for documentation.  It is all stored electronically. </li><li>  Ease of use.  Sending a document is carried out from one workplace.  A quick search of a document is carried out by status (sent, received, received, etc.). </li><li>  Instant delivery.  All information sent to the addressee within a few seconds. </li><li>  The document cannot be lost until the expiration of its storage in the system. </li></ul>

    <p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  To use the equipment you need to purchase a license, which costs a lot of money. </li><li>  Most often, data can only be exchanged between participants in the same system. </li><li>  Electronic document flow between organizations in 1C or with the help of any other software differs from the previously used scheme.  With the introduction of a new algorithm, all employees will have questions about conducting work. </li><li>  Technical equipment.  Before introducing EDI, organizations need to purchase equipment and prepare employees for managing the new system. </li><li>  EDI is carried out using an electronic digital signature, the validity of which is 1 year.  It is necessary to track and timely renew certificates.  It is also necessary to control the validity period of counterparty certificates in order to avoid tax problems. </li></ul><h2>  Legal regulation </h2><p>  What regulations govern electronic document flow between organizations?  The legislation of the Russian Federation includes Federal Law No. 63 ‚ÄúOn Electronic Signatures‚Äù, the rules for submitting documents to the Federal Tax Service are spelled out in order of the Ministry of Finance No. MMV-7-2 / 168.  EDI between organizations is carried out on the basis of the order of the Ministry of Finance No. 50n.  The rules for the exchange of primary accounting documents in electronic form are prescribed in the order of the Federal Tax Service No. MMV-7-6 / 36 @.  All EDI operators in the process of activity should be guided by the order of the Federal Tax Service No. MMV-7-6 / 253 @. </p>

    <h2>  VLSI </h2><p>  Electronic document management between VLSI organizations gives customers the following benefits: </p><ul><li>  Documents can be sent to any organization that is registered in the Russian Federation.  If the counterparty is not a member of the VLSI system, then an employee of the company will simply contact the representative of the organization and send invitations to participate in the system by e-mail.  Immediately after confirming the request, the exchange of information between participants will be carried out without intermediaries. </li><li>  You do not need to install software on a computer.  It is enough to have the current version of the browser and access to the Internet. </li><li>  To work with data does not need a special program.  If the report is initially prepared in third-party software, for example, 1C, then you can configure data integration with the VLSI system. </li><li>  The standard form of the document is not installed.  You can send text, tabular files, images, etc. </li></ul><h2>  SKB "Kontur" </h2><p>  One of the first software developers in Russia is also involved in the supply of equipment, through which electronic document management between organizations is carried out.  Kontur developed the Diadoc system, with the help of which electronic documents are exchanged.  A feature of the system is that access to data can be obtained while abroad.  Especially for this purpose, the company has developed tariffs in roaming.  If you want mono to access data through the API. </p>

    <h2>  What do you need? </h2><p>  To connect EDI, organizations need to buy: </p><ul><li>  licensed software; </li><li>  server; </li><li>  upgrade equipment; </li><li>  to train staff; </li><li>  set up and integrate EDMS for working with internal applications. </li></ul><p>  Is such an investment necessary to connect electronic document flow between the organization?  Inclusion in the costs of technical support consultations, updates of the EDMS and software is the second stage of investment.  These costs will have to be paid monthly. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Paper workflow is being replaced by electronic.  It not only reduces the organization‚Äôs costs of conducting processes, but also increases the efficiency of the business as a whole.  For EDI to function successfully, it is necessary to clearly state the goals of the system implementation and correctly configure the equipment. </p>
