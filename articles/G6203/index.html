    <h2>  Player Actions </h2><p>  The game starts by throwing a pair of dice, the chips from the "Start" cage go clockwise, counting the number of cells corresponding to the sum of the numbers on the dice. </p><p>  If a double fell, the player makes another move.  But there is one ‚Äúbut‚Äù.  If you get a double three times in a row, then the player is sent to the "Tax Police".  Moving around the field, players' chips fall on the cells of enterprises.  On each is written the value of the enterprise and the rental rate.  The data on how much taxes you need to pay for this company are also indicated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  If after the next roll of the dice the chip falls into an empty area, then you can buy it for your use.  On this cell is written the value that needs to be paid to the general bank.  After payment, the card is removed from the cage and the player leaves it in his pack. </p><p>  If you do not want to buy a plot, then it can be put up for sale.  Starting price is chosen at your own discretion.  All players can bid.  The player who gave a large amount of money takes the plot for himself. </p><h2>  Stop at another player‚Äôs area </h2><p>  If, after the next move, the chips stop at the cage with a site belonging to another player, then you will have to pay a rent for being in someone else's territory.  The price is written on this cell.  If you are the owner of all existing enterprises in the industry, then you are considered a monopolist.  If, as a result of the move, the chip falls on the cell of the monopolist enterprise, then the lease will be increased by 2 times.  When a player makes a full circle of moves and goes through the "Start" cell again, he is paid 200 forfeits of circular income. </p><h2>  Surprises as the game progresses </h2><p>  In the board game "Millionaire" according to the rules of the game there are special cells, getting on which, the player has to perform an action written on the card, lying "shirt" up.  In advance, the player does not know what awaits him.  This is the main surprise.  After all, it can be both pleasant and not very.  Let us consider in detail the meaning of such cells: </p><ol><li>  <em>"Tax Inspectorate".</em>  Once in such a cell, you have to pay tax. </li><li>  <em>"Tax police".</em>  Here, the player needs to roll dice three times, waiting for the double to fall.  If the double did not fall, then you will have to pay a fine, otherwise you will not leave the police station. </li><li>  <em>Jackpot.</em>  A player who has got to this cell has the right to play on a slot machine.  First a bet is made.  The player in the board game "Millionaire" according to the rules of the game rolls only one die, but 3 times.  After each throw, the chip moves from bottom to top on the column of the slot machine as much as it fell.  If all the numbers displayed match the winning combination, the player receives a bonus.  A cash bonus is transferred to him from the bank.  But if the numbers do not match, then the bet remains at the box office. </li><li>  <em>"Move".</em>  If, by the result of the roll of the dice, the card falls onto the "Move" cell, then the player flips the card over and reads the task on which cell he needs to rearrange the chips.  If this is the "Start" cell, then the player does not get circular income. </li><li>  <em>"Charity Fund".</em>  If, as a result of moving the card as indicated by the "Move" cell, the chip falls onto the cell labeled "White Business" or "Charity Fund", the player is paid money from the bank from this fund. </li><li>  There is also a cell called <em>Black Business.</em>  If you hit this cell, the player flies from it to the ‚ÄúCharity Fund‚Äù box, and he will also have to pay a fine of 50 forfeits. </li><li>  <em>"Chance".</em>  If the chip hits this cell, the card flips over.  Instructions written on it must be performed by the player.  Then the card is hiding at the bottom of the pack.  If the player cannot fulfill the instruction at the moment, then the card remains with him until he completes the task. </li></ol><h2>  Branches of enterprises: description </h2>

    <p>  The board game "Millionaire" offers players who own a monopoly in any branch of the economy to build enterprises and branches on the sites.  Their value is written on the cells of the field, their price is indicated on the cards of the players. </p><p>  The purchased extensions are placed on the field sections, which are built up systematically.  First, one branch, then the second are added, and only then - the third.  If in each industry a player has three branches of an enterprise built, then he is already given permission to build the enterprises themselves.  The branch and the company are equivalent in price.  But to begin construction, all branches must be free.  If at least one is pledged to a bank, then the industry is not considered complete.  The player ceases to be a monopolist and can no longer build plots in this sector of the economy. </p><p>  If the player has financial difficulties and wants to sell his buildings to the bank, he must act systematically.  You can sell one plot from each industry, then the second, etc. But you should know that the bank buys from the player plots only half the price of the full price. </p><h2>  "Millionaire Junior" </h2><p>  How to play the board game "Millionaire" ("Classic")?  The rules are described in detail above.  Now let's see how the children's version of the game called "Junior" differs.  The set includes a square playing field.  This is an amusement park.  There are 20 cards of "adventures", money of different denominations - 121 banknotes, ticket kiosks - 56 pieces, a cube for throwing a number, chips - 4 pieces, a description of the rules of the game. </p>

    <p>  Board game for children has other rules.  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><p>  The goal of the game is to get rich by buying rides.  Earn money by selling entry tickets.  First, let's figure out how a player can buy an attraction.  Each cell is divided into two equal parts.  If after a die roll your chip fell on one of the halves of the cell, and it is free, no one has bought it yet, then you have the right to purchase it, you only have to pay 10 forfeits to the bank.  If the player is able to make a purchase, then he (without looking at the card) pulls out any of his ticket kiosks and must cover half of the attraction.  If the player does not have money for such an acquisition, then he returns to the "Start" square, and the other player gets a chance.  From any part of the playing field, he returns to this cell and becomes its owner for free.  The board game for children is brightly decorated; it is interesting to play in it for children of primary school age.  The children learn the skills of economic activity that will be useful to them in later life. </p><h2>  "Millionaire Elite" </h2><p>  This is a game for adult players.  It differs from the classic version of the game in the following features: </p><ol><li>  Added stocks, you can buy insurance for all occasions.  In this game, you can get rich not only on the sale of plots, but also at the expense of the securities market.  In "Elite" the luck factor is of great importance. </li><li>  There was a surprise card "Fortune".  There is a step-by-step instruction that players must follow.  This may affect the course of the game as a whole. </li><li>  If, when throwing dice, the chip falls on the Exchange cell, then you will know the price of your shares.  They can grow, or they can fall to a minimum. </li><li>  Insurance policies can protect the player.  This applies to rents, taxes or auctions.  There are short-term and long-term policies.  The first are valid until passing one circle.  If a player passes the "Start" cell, the policy ends.  But the action of the second continues until the insured event. </li></ol>
