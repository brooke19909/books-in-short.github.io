It occupies an area with a width of 80 kilometers, the highest point - 2396 meters.  In some cases, Hamar-Daban is a ridge that is the administrative boundary between these regions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hamar daban" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464049.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  The name of the ridge comes from the Buryat language: “Hamar” - “nose”, “Daban” - “mountain pass”, “saddle”.  Sometimes “hamar” is translated as “pine nuts”, in this case the name sounds like “Walnut Pass”.  In the beginning, this name belonged to a small mountain threshold, which separated the plains of Slyudyanskaya, Kultuchnaya and a narrow rocky cape, as if crashing into Lake Baikal.  In ancient times, sacrifices took place here.  It received the name in the Buryat language Aikh-Shulun, which means “terrible stone”.  Today it is better known as the Shaman.  Much later, the name Khamar-Daban was given to the entire mountain range from the Tunkinsky depression in the east to <span>the Selenga river</span> valley <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This chain has the shape of an arc that borders the Baikal basin.  It consists of several large mountain ranges, which are characterized by the presence of rounded peaks and the absence of a pronounced ridge.  From the north side, it abruptly breaks off to Lake Baikal.  In the south, the depression is smoother - the ridge passes into the Small Khabar-Daban and the Selenginsky high mountains. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hamar daban ridge" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464050.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The highest points of the ridge </h2><p>  Mount Khan-Ula (2371 m) sounds like “king of the mountain” and is considered the highest point of the massif.  A little inferior to it is Sohor - “motley” (2316 m), as well as Chersky peak (2090 m), famous among travelers.  For quite a long time, it was he who was considered the highest point of the ridge and bore the same name. </p><h2>  Origin </h2><p>  Hamar-Daban is formed by the ancient rocks of Archean, Proterozoic (schists, gneisses, limestones).  In addition, it contains volcanic and igneous rocks (granitoids).  There are also modern tectonic uplifts (mudflows, water erosion, landslides, landslides).  In the highlands you can see traces of the Quaternary glaciation. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  Due to the presence of high mountains and a fairly vast water area, climatic features of the Khamar-Daban ridge have formed, the photo of which you see in this article.  In these places, as in the entire southern Baikal region, precipitation falls throughout the year.  In the highlands, this figure reaches 2000 mm per year.  On the slopes, snow cover is from 80 to 120 cm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In winter, the average temperature is -17-18 degrees, but often it can drop to -35 degrees.  In summer, the average temperature is +15.  In August, early snowfall is possible, and a stable cover appears at the end of September and lasts until April-May. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hamar daban card" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464051.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Vegetation </h2><p>  On Khamar – Daban, vegetation is strictly divided by altitude zones.  Fir-cedar, spruce-cedar forests with small interspersed <span>deciduous trees</span> mainly grow up to 1500-2000 meters <span>.</span>  On the upper border of the forest cedar grows. </p><p>  From 1550 to 1700 meters (subalpine belt), fir-cedar woodlands and bushes (heather, <span>golden rhododendron,</span> cedar elfin) predominate. </p><p>  At an altitude above 1700 meters - a mountain tundra with lichens and moss. </p><h2>  Animal world </h2><p>  The diverse natural landscape of the massif allows many species of animals and birds to feel quite comfortable in this area.  In the forests, there are red deer, elk, <span>reindeer,</span> wild boar, lynx, brown bear, sable, wolverine and other animals.  In addition, there are many different birds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hamar Daban photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464052.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is from it that a unique view of Lake Heart opens.  From here it is clearly seen where its name came from.  The lake is small, along the perimeter it can be bypassed in fifteen minutes.  It looks unusually beautiful from afar and does not disappoint travelers who come closer to it at all.  The water in the lake is bright emerald in color, and the mountains and sky reflected in it complete the magnificent picture.  In July, the shores of the lake are covered with bright green grass and various flowers. </p><p>  By the end of August - beginning of September, they completely disappear, in their place appear no less spectacular orange, yellow, green leaves of frankincense and other beautiful herbs. </p><p>  In mid-September you can see snow spots here, and by the end of the month the snow already lies on the banks constantly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="heart lake on hamar daban" class="if" height="241" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464053.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Komarinsky ridge is part of the Khamar-Daban.  Its highest point is Chersky peak.  There are two observation platforms from which you can admire stunning views of the Sayan Mountains and Hamar-Daban.  Along the ridge runs the Mongolian tract of the Starokomarskaya road, which was built at the very beginning of the nineteenth century.  After the appearance of the <span>Trans-Siberian Railway, the</span> need for a caravan route disappeared, and today it is practically empty. </p><p>  When you reach the weather station, the trail will be split in two.  One of the new paths will lead you to Chersky peak, and the second will lower you into the gorge to the Podkomarnaya river. </p><p>  Particularly interesting on this route is the ascent to Chersky peak.  On your way trees will meet less and less - the kingdom of lichens and mosses begins.  The approaches to the peak pass along a rocky and sharp ridge with steep slopes.  And below it are bottomless gorges. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trip to hamar daban" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464054.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In one of them is Lake Heart, from which the small river Mangutayka flows.  At the peak of Chersky there is practically no vegetation.  Even in the summer months, snow persists in shaded areas.  From its top a magnificent panorama opens. </p><p>  The Podkomarnaya River has many rapids and waterfalls.  They are all of an original form and organically fit into the natural landscape.  The path continues to climb up and leads you to the Devil's Gate, which connect the valleys of the Spuskovaya and Podkomarnaya rivers. </p><h2>  Damn lake </h2><p>  Represents the exact opposite of Lake Heart.  It is located not in the hollow, but on a hill.  It is shallow - no more than two to three meters.  It is almost completely covered with algae, which create an original pattern on the water.  Only in the northeast of the lake is there a small stretch of rocky shore.  You can swim here - despite the fact that it is at a considerable height - 1730 meters, the water warms up in it quite strongly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hamar daban" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/464055.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  From the weather station, the trail goes to the Cossack meadow.  This is a fairly large and completely flat area on the side of a mountain.  Its right side is completely bogged, and the left remains completely dry.  This meadow is very beautiful, especially in July, due to the numerous flowers growing here.  The return route of this route passes along the gorge of the Slyudyanka River.  Crossings from one coast to another will give your trip an unforgettable flavor.  The magnificent pictures of the mountain ranges of the Khamar-Daban ridge, the crystal clear air of coniferous forests, evenings by the fire, you will undoubtedly be remembered for a long time. </p>
