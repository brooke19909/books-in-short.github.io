Although they have drawbacks, the low cost fully covers them.  Of course, the weakest side of these gadgets are the technical characteristics: a not very powerful platform, low resolution display and cameras.  But this does not mean that such devices are completely devoid of attractiveness.  Almost all manufacturers of devices in the budget segment are trying to create models that look like flagship gadgets.  This is exactly how the Meizu <span>M5c</span> 2GB / 16GB is reviewed, which will be reviewed in this article.  The phone went on sale in 2017.  Its cost does not exceed 10 thousand rubles, which makes it quite attractive for a specific target audience.  Let's figure out if the gadget justifies the stated price tag. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m5c 2gb 16gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2102027.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What is hiding in the box? </h2><p>  In a simple cardboard box, the Meizu <span>M5c stores 2</span> GB / 16 GB.  The dimensions of the package correspond to the dimensions of the phone.  Designers chose a laconic design, completely abandoning the variegation and images.  All panel boxes are made in white.  The brand logo is presented on the side faces, and the model name on the front.  If you look inside the packaging box, you will notice several compartments in which all accessories are neatly laid.  Each of them is separated by a partition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A set of components will not surprise the buyer with anything special.  It fully corresponds to the budget segment.  Of course, modestly, but the manufacturer provides the most necessary for the user.  This is a 1.5A / 5V power supply and a USB cable.  There is also a paperclip in the box fixed in the documentation folder.  As for the latter, the manual, certificate and warranty card are printed in Russian. </p><h2>  Features of external design </h2><p>  <span>The Meizu</span> M5c 2GB / 16GB <span>smartphone</span> looks quite attractive in appearance.  The device stands out among other gadgets of this price segment with a stylish design.  The manufacturer did not abandon the solutions that are used in more expensive models.  The only thing that had to be sacrificed was materials.  In this unit, instead of metal, plastic is selected for the case.  It does not make sense to dwell in detail on the form, since it is used in other smartphones of this brand. </p><p>  Although only black and silver options appeared at the start of sales in stores, there are four more in the line.  If desired, owners can choose between gold, red, pink and blue.  But if you believe the reviews on the Meizu M5c 2 GB / 16 GB Black, then the black case looks the most stylish. </p><p>  Given that the device is equipped with a 5-inch screen, its dimensions are quite expected.  Case height - 144 mm, width - 70.5 mm.  As for the thickness, everything is fine here.  The manufacturer did not violate current trends, stopping at an indicator of 8.3 mm.  The phone‚Äôs weight also affects usability.  In this case, it is limited to only 135 g. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone meizu m5c 2gb 16gb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2102028.jpg"></div>

In the hand, the smartphone lies well, practically does not slip.  Thanks to the rounded edges, you can control the gadget with one hand.  As for soaking, it‚Äôs at least plastic and matte, but it still collects fingerprints. </p><p>  All standard connectors and keys are in this model.  Of course, not without the navigation button, which is located directly below the screen.  The only thing that really disappointed the owners was the lack of a fingerprint scanner.  The device works with two "SIM cards", which are installed in the tray located on the side edge.  If you need to use a flash card, you will have to abandon the second SIM.  In order for the phone to recognize the external drive, after installing it, you will need to reboot the device. </p><h2>  Talk about the display </h2><p>  The Meizu M5c 2GB / 16GB screen has a diagonal of 5 inches.  The standard matrix is ‚Äã‚ÄãIPS.  Resolution - HD.  Density - 293 ppi.  Unfortunately, the display can hardly be called ideal, but the picture is displayed clearly and fairly high quality.  There is enough brightness for comfortable work both in the sun and in complete darkness.  The surface of the screen is glossy, but the glass has a special anti-reflective layer, so even on the street the information remains readable. </p><p>  The advantages include users <span>oleophobic coating,</span> which copes with the tasks.  The prints, however, remain, but they are easily erased.  There is also an automatic brightness adjustment mode.  There are no special comments on his work.  There is no air gap, which positively affects the image display quality.  It should be noted that the developers have provided multi-touch for 10 touches.  But as usual, there were some shortcomings.  To them, all users attributed a rather thick frame, which on the sides reaches about 4 mm, and in the upper and lower parts increases to 15 mm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m5c 2gb 16gb review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2102029.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  A few words about cameras </h2><p>  After users found out the resolution of the cameras, they immediately understood why the phone costs about six thousand rubles.  Reviews about Meizu M5c 2 GB / 16 GB in their address sound mixed.  Let's figure out what exactly didn‚Äôt like.  Of course, this is permission.  The maximum that you can count on is 8 MP main and 5 front.  Detailing is weak.  In poor lighting conditions, getting a high-quality picture is akin to fiction.  You can see blurry areas in photos.  The flash is supplemented only by the main camera.  Although it is a two-position, it shines dimly, so by and large it is useless.  The only thing that calms you down is the low price of the gadget, which makes this drawback less critical. </p>

    <h2>  Meizu M5c 2GB / 16GB: Performance Specifications </h2><p>  What does the comment on the operation of the Chinese smartphone say?  Each buyer understands that the manufacturer in the "state employee" will not realize the top "stuffing".  And this is understandable.  If you install a powerful processor, then you will have to raise the price by at least a third.  But do not think that this unit does not meet modern requirements.  The developers have implemented two gigabytes of RAM, which is already not bad.  True, half is already taken, but the remaining volume is enough for work.  But which processor did they install in the Meizu M5c 2 GB / 16 GB? </p><p>  The gadget operates on the basis of the <span>MediaTek MT6737</span> chip <span>.</span>  The 28 nm process technology indicates an insufficient level of energy efficiency.  The 64-bit system row opens up great opportunities, however, it must be understood that not all modern applications will pull a 4-core processor.  The clock speed limit is 1250 MHz.  A weak Mali-T720 graphics card is also installed in the device.  The native storage of 16 GB is not available in full.  It will be possible to dispose of only about 10 GB.  Of course, you can expand the storage with a memory card, but you won‚Äôt be able to use it to install applications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m5c 2gb 16gb cpu" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2102031.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Platform </h2><p>  Not surprised users and the selected operating system.  As usual, the sixth version of Android is installed on the phone.  Not without the branded shell Flyme.  The interface is nice.  The developers have proposed several updates that have pleased owners.  This animated pictures, and a new icon design, as well as themes.  It is by this criterion that the Meizu M5c 2 GB / 16 GB received positive reviews, although a new version (seventh) of the OS has already been released. </p><p>  However, several minuses appeared in the corporate interface.  We are talking about a lot of unnecessary applications.  They are installed by default.  For example, Sberbank applications cannot be abandoned.  But here, users find a small plus.  All unclaimed programs can then be deleted manually. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m5c 2gb 16gb screen" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2102032.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  <span>Smartphone Meizu</span> M5c 2 GB / 16 GB is equipped with a good battery.  The battery has a capacity of 3 thousand mAh.  The results, although modest, are considered satisfactory for devices of this price segment.  For example, you can play games for five and a half hours.  In the reading mode, the device will work for about 14 hours. Those who like to watch videos or movies can expect no more than 9 hours. If you use a smartphone in mixed mode, then its maximum is limited to only 20-24 hours, after which you will need to connect the gadget to the network.  It will take about 3 hours to restore the battery life. </p><h2>  Meizu M5c 2GB / 16GB: Owner Reviews </h2><p>  Like any gadget in the budget segment, the M5c has both disadvantages and advantages.  The latter, undoubtedly, include a low price, a screen that is not bad in terms of characteristics, a stylish design, and a decent battery life.  But users are discussing the flaws of the phone more actively.  Of course, a lot of comments are made about the hardware platform.  By modern standards, processor power is already completely lacking.  For example, all "heavy" applications will be inaccessible to the user.  There are also angry comments about the cameras.  Today I would like to have a gadget with the best optical modules. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m5c 2gb 16gb dimensions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2102033.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up, we can confidently say that the company managed to produce a simple and inexpensive smartphone.  Note that earlier devices of the Meizu brand did not occupy the category of up to 10 thousand rubles, so the M5c is a kind of debut.  You should not expect him to have high performance in work, but his 6000 rubles.  The device fully justifies. </p>
