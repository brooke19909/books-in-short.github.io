Overview of hotels Sharm El Sheikh</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This is a hot place in which rest leads to such irreversible, but very pleasant consequences, such as getting a gorgeous golden tan, lots of stunningly vivid photographs and, of course, great memories that warm your soul in the cold Motherland.  Egypt with its ancient grandeur and a huge number of monuments of ancient architecture every year receives many guests.  New hotels in Sharm El Sheikh (for example, Le Royale Holiday Resort 5 * or Sunrise Grand Select Montemare Resort 5 *) do this with special hospitality.  But you should not forget about old and time-tested hotels.  In general, what is better to pay attention to when choosing a place of residence?  This question is worth paying attention to.  The hotels in the resort are mainly four- and five-star, it‚Äôs possible to choose high-quality "treshki", but this is not recommended (risking a long-awaited vacation is not worth it). </p><h2>  Charm, Iberotel Il Mercato (5 stars) </h2>

    <p>  <span>Iberotel Club Fanara</span> &amp; Residence 4 * - the hotel is quite status.  To visit the restaurants in it, you must follow the dress code.  Three private beaches (two of which are sandy) are divided "according to interests": a cheerful island with animation and constant music and calm, designed for relaxation.  The number of bars and restaurants of different types is simply amazing.  Despite its quality, the hotel is very inexpensive.  For example, a tour with a departure from Moscow (the cost of a ticket is differentiated depending on the cities of departure) for 10 nights / 11 days on the basis of breakfast in the most modest room will cost 23,000 rubles per person.  However, it should be noted that the price is for the period of the "low" tourist season, and in the "high" for this country, the cost, respectively, is higher.  Hotel "Fanara" (Sharm-El-Sheikh) attracts guests all year round due to the many activities suitable for winter and summer holidays. </p><h2>  The farther from the sea, the higher the quality </h2><p>  In the distance - it is said conditionally.  Just the next hotel considered is located not on the first coastline, but on the third (that is, the distance from the beach to the hotel is more than one kilometer).  Maritim Jolie Ville Royal Peninsula Hotel &amp; Resort 5 * is a magnificent oasis, spread over 200,000 square meters near Naama Bay.  Every half an hour there is a free comfortable bus to the beautiful coral beach, rooms that are huge in size (from 60 square meters) give a feeling of freedom to guests, and climate control will make it easier to transfer the Egyptian heat, a huge golf course, entertainment for every taste will leave you indifferent.  <span>The pricing policy</span> in this case is very simple: to attract guests, hotels compensate for the distance from the coastline with the quality of service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Maritim - means on the first line </h2><p>  The Maritim Hotel (Sharm El Sheikh) is not the only one, the sister is called Maritim Jolie Ville Golf &amp; Resort 5 * (located on the first coastline, a beach 400 meters long with a coral shallow that ends with a cliff in the clear sea), and it doesn‚Äôt less quality.  There is a wide selection of rooms of different sizes and furnishings.  Hotel reviews are all positive. </p><h2>  The best of the best </h2><p>  About tastes, as they say, do not argue.  Evaluating the quality of visited hotels, which travelers like to share among themselves, allows you to accurately determine the ranking of placements.  Thanks to this, you can make the top hotels in Sharm El Sheikh. </p>

    <ol><li>  Dessole Pyramisa Sharm El Sheikh Resort 5 * successfully located in the beautiful bay of Sharks Bay.  A high rating, consisting of the ratings of tourists who visited there, indicates the quality of service. </li><li>  Rixos Sharm El Sheikh 5 * - a chic hotel with its own reef on a sandy beach, does not have standard rooms (the level of accommodation is an order of magnitude higher).  The ‚Äúultra all-inclusive‚Äù system, daily and afternoon programs, scheduled for every hour, will not let you get bored, a free taxi call service is directly outside the territory of Rixos, when you call one of the two yellow electric cars will drive up to the room and take you to the right place.  Everything has been done and thought out with high quality precisely for the guests to relax. </li><li>  <span>Nubian Village 5 *</span> is a water park, swimming pools, a natural lagoon for comfortable bathing for kids, a variety of sports.  All this will please the customers of the hotel, which has an excellent rating and many positive reviews. </li></ol><p>  Not all <span>5</span> * <span>hotels in Egypt</span> are listed here, but the most worthy of the attention of a demanding guest.  When choosing a hotel, it is worth paying attention not only to the stars, but also to the rating, made up of the reviews of tourists who visited there. </p><h2>  <strong>The subtleties of a beach holiday</strong> </h2><p>  The trip to the beaches of Egypt should be approached with all responsibility: the percentage of risk of harm to health is quite high.  Coral reefs and not always sandy bottom make visitors swim in specialized shoes (it is inexpensive, it is sold at almost every corner, most often these are simple rubber slippers).  Therefore, when vacationing with children, you should think about choosing the most convenient place for their safety.  If even this did not work out, then almost all hotels provide a free shuttle service to the beach at the choice of the vacationer (this is indicated by reviews, Iberotel Il mercato 5 * among such hotels). </p><h2>  <strong>Beaches of Sharm El Sheikh</strong> </h2>

    <p>  There is a beach in the Gulf of Sharm El Maya, where you can swim and go into the water without any fear.  This is the only natural sandy resting place.  Other places for swimming are often cleaned artificially (pure sand is poured), so you can walk there barefoot.  This is Naama Bay.  New resort areas, such as Hadaba or Sharks Bay and Nabq, have a beautiful but dangerous coral bottom (often hotels get significant difficulties in building special ‚Äúbridges‚Äù over corals due to the presence of nature protection zones here). </p><h2>  <strong>What to visit while relaxing in Sharm El Sheikh?</strong> </h2><p>  Naturally, at one fine moment you can get a little tired of staying on the beach and get enough of the abundance of the buffet, so such a vacation can be diversified by a couple of excursions.  One of the most popular is a trip to Mount Moses (climb), a very interesting and informative program.  You can also buy a mini trip to the coral islands (cost approximately $ 25-35), go to the Abu Galum or Ras Mohammed reserves ($ 20-60), visit Cairo or Luxor ($ 150-220) and a lot others.  It‚Äôs better to pre-read the reviews too.  Iberotel Il mercato (5 stars) is ready to share many prospectuses with offers of different programs.  This is a rule that many hotels adhere to.  At the entrance, you can take folders with materials, where all excursions from different tour operators will be described in detail.  In addition to these mini-tours, you can go to an entertainment venue, such as an evening disco Le Pasha or Hard Rock Cafe. </p><h2>  <strong>Travel Tips</strong> </h2><ul><li>  Reviews of hotels are mostly positive (if we are talking about the presented hotels of 4 and 5 stars).  However, periods of the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù season due to the high temperature are not recommended for young children.  In this case, it is more expedient to consider a country with a milder climate, for example Bulgaria, Turkey. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel fanara sharm el sheikh" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/559942.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  In the developed tourist area, goods in stores will be sold at double and triple cost (if not more), so you should visit the Old Market district of the old city, where you can not only buy the necessary goods, but also have a tasty meal.  You can bring a hookah, porcelain figurines, papyrus, traditional jewelry or, for example, high-quality oils as a gift to relatives and friends.  The cost of souvenirs is different (from about 1 Egyptian pound to 30). </li><li>  When resting in this country, it is advisable to take the full-board, all-inclusive or ultra all-inclusive food systems, since all drinks are very expensive here, and taking breakfast only, customers are not allowed to drink free water during the day. </li><li>  Before starting your trip, you should familiarize yourself with the information provided in the literature.  However, these things should be treated with caution, since information can be subjective.  The best way to get the most reliable facts is through communication with people who live in Egypt for a certain time.  Very often they keep their own blogs, groups on social networks or simply separate pages with useful information on which you can find information about living conditions in the country and certain secrets that an ordinary tourist may not recognize.  If possible, you can meet such a person directly in Egypt (Sharm-El-Sheikh), and he will give your family a tour of the most interesting places. </li></ul>
