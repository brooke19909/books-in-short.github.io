Of course, its image is created by the flagship smartphone models, however, inexpensive gadgets deserve the attention of the buyer.  The lineup of the Korean manufacturer is quite saturated.  Samsung is the undisputed leader in the number of phones released.  This brand is also ranked first in terms of sales. </p><p>  In 2016, the presentation of the new <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> J5 Prime smartphone took place.  Reviews about him, as well as characteristics will be presented in detail in the article.  The device belongs to the category of low-cost devices.  In December 2016, its price was approximately $ 200. </p><p>  Before you start reviewing your smartphone, you need to consider one point.  Its name uses the code J5.  Such a model is already known to the buyer, but the device with the Prime prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot an improved version of it.  This is a fundamentally different device.  The differences are in the hardware "stuffing" and other elements (screen, material, cameras, etc.).  What features does this model have? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy j5 prime specifications" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2033050.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ergonomics, appearance, dimensions </h2><p>  Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime (Gold, Black) looks pretty presentable.  The phone differs from its predecessor primarily in the body material.  Here, the developers used metal, which, no doubt, is worthy of respect.  The quality and assembly are not satisfactory.  During operation, users did not notice any creaks or backlash.  Details are fitted as accurately as possible, so there are no gaps.  But, in principle, this is quite in the spirit of Samsung, because the company even produces ‚Äústate employees‚Äù of high quality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The dimensions of the smartphone did not surprise buyers at all, since they fully correspond to devices that are equipped with a 5-inch display.  The height of the case was 142 mm with a width of 69 mm.  The thickness parameter also refers to the average - 8.1 mm.  The same can be said about the mass of the apparatus.  Its weight is 143 g. </p><p>  How is the front panel of the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime designed?  2.5D glass gives originality.  It is worth noting that such a solution was first used in the J-line.  Now we can safely say that it is successful.  The smartphone looks interesting precisely thanks to such glass.  Under the screen there is a control panel with a mechanical key.  This design is a kind of visiting card of Samsung smartphones.  It is, as usual, oval in shape, framed by a chrome frame.  A <span>fingerprint scanner</span> is built into it <span>.</span>  On the sides of the mechanical keys are two touch.  They do not have a backlight, but thanks to the designations of silver they stand out well against the general background.  The right button performs the function back, the left - opens the menu of running applications. </p><p>  Above the screen, of course, there is a company logo.  Immediately above it is a speaker, the opening of which is covered with a chrome mesh.  Such a solution harmoniously fits into the overall concept.  In addition to the speaker, there is also an indicator, an ‚Äúeye‚Äù of the front camera and a sensor. </p><p>  The metal back panel is non-removable.  Plastic inserts are used only in places where the antennas are located.  The solidity of the panel breaks the square "window" of the camera and a small flash.  Under them is a logo.  Due to the one-piece housing design, the user does not have access to the battery. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The <span>Samsung Galaxy J5</span> Prime controls are unusual.  On the right side there is only a lock / power key.  Above it there is no familiar ‚Äúrocker‚Äù of volume.  The developers instead positioned the speaker hole.  Such a decision, although not entirely ordinary, but successful.  During use, the chance of accidentally covering the slot is minimized, which significantly increases the sound level.  But the left side face is overloaded with elements.  There are two volume keys, a tray for SIM cards and a slot for an external drive.  The developers also used the bottom end, bringing to it an audio jack, microUSB port and a small microphone hole. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy j5 prime g570f" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2033051.jpg" width="552"></div>

    <h2>  Sensors </h2><p>  The <span>Samsung Galaxy J5</span> Prime was the first J- <span>series</span> smartphone to feature a fingerprint scanner.  It works well.  Located in a very convenient location.  However, with other sensors, the manufacturer did not bother.  For some reason, the device does not have an elementary ambient light sensor.  The developers refused from the compass, magnetometer, gyroscope.  All that will be available to the owners of this model is an accelerometer, a proximity sensor and an orientation sensor.  Many users have noticed that it is on such trifles that the company is trying to save.  Whether this decision is correct, time will tell. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  <span>Samsung Galaxy J5</span> Prime: performance features </h2><p>  The presentation of a new processor of its own design took place precisely in J5 Prime.  Well, the owners will have to test it and find the strengths and weaknesses, but for now, we‚Äôll tell you about the characteristics of the Exynos 7570 chipset. This model was developed specifically for the budget segment devices.  It is based on processor cores of the Cortex-A53 type.  Manufactured in compliance with the 14-nm process.  It is worth noting that such an indicator is worthy of respect.  Each of the computing elements is capable of delivering a frequency of 1430 MHz.  According to the manufacturer, the advantages of this chipset are undeniable.  First of all, the smartphone will work equally with those in which Chinese eight-core processors are installed.  In terms of speed and energy efficiency, it will compete with many gadgets. </p><p>  Unfortunately, according to advanced users, the video card spoils the overall impression a bit.  For such a device, the capabilities of the Mali-T720 will be missed.  Yes, 3D-games can be difficult, but the device will cope with the basic tasks on a solid five. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy j5 prime reviews" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2033052.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  It's time to figure out what memory features are in the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime.  To begin, pay attention to the volume of operational.  The developers in this model installed two gigabytes.  Half is already occupied by the system, but the rest will be enough to completely forget about crashes while working with applications. </p><p>  Built-in storage has a capacity of only 16 gigabytes.  Is this enough for the modern user?  Probably not.  To work with applications, only 9 GB remains free, and this is critically small.  Expand integrated memory at the expense of the drive.  The device has a separate slot, so there is no need to abandon the second SIM card.  There is also support for <span>USB OTG</span> drives <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  In order to find out all the characteristics of the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime, you need to understand the battery life.  The device has an insufficiently capacious battery.  Its volume is only 2400 mAh.  But having learned about it, it is not necessary to be upset ahead of time.  The new processor is energy efficient, so even with active use, you can safely count on one day of work.  In video mode, the smartphone on a single charge lasts up to 12 hours.  About as much time can be spent surfing the Internet.  Users noticed that if the active state of the screen does not exceed two hours per day, then the gadget will be able to work for almost 3 days.  Surprisingly, these are the results that Xiaomi smartphone shows with a 4100 mAh battery.  There is something to think about ?! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy j5 prime gold" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2033053.jpg" width="462"></div>

    <h2>  Camera features </h2><p>  What cameras are implemented in the <span>Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime?</span>  Frontal <span>features are</span> not very impressed by users.  It is based on a 5 megapixel sensor.  But it is worth noting that, in comparison with the predecessor, the aperture value was increased to 2.2 against 1.9.  There is no point in expecting a lot from the selfie.  Color and quality are average. </p><p>  The main camera has a resolution of 13 megapixels.  There is an LED flash.  But users noticed that in poor lighting it is no use.  Photos are gray, dull, with a low level of detail.  But in the daytime you can make quite high-quality pictures.  The dynamic range is not maximum, but wide.  Color reproduction is close to natural shades.  Image clarity is acceptable. </p><p>  We draw the attention of buyers that both cameras are able to work in video mode with Full HD resolution, which is pretty good for inexpensive gadgets.  The frame rate is 30 FPS. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone samsung galaxy j5 prime" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2033054.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  What screen was used in Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime?  The characteristics of the 5-inch display are practically no different from those that are installed on smartphones of other brands.  Resolution is typical for this size - 1280 √ó 720 px.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer did not use AMOLED technology, replacing it with PLS.  Experts call such a matrix a compromise solution.  The quality with which the picture is displayed is average.  The brightness range is enough for comfortable work.  As protection for the display, Gorilla Glass was used.  It has rounded edges.  The developers did not forget about the oleophobic coating, but its quality does not exceed the average level, so you will have to actively deal with fingerprints on the screen. </p><h2>  Communication and sound </h2><p>  Let's look at the communication capabilities of the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime (G570F).  First of all, we note that the device is equipped with two independent slots for SIM cards of the ‚Äúnano‚Äù format.  The gadget works perfectly with all popular networks, including LTE.  As for the latter, the signal is stable, it works without failures.  There is a Wi-Fi module, but it only works with a frequency of 2.4 GHz, but modern protocols are supported by all.  There are no comments on the navigator.  The device works not only with GPS satellites, but also GLONASS.  To find them will take no more than a few seconds. </p><p>  As for the sound, this model receives only positive reviews.  Firstly, it was influenced by a rather good location of the output speaker.  Secondly, at maximum volume, creaks and wheezes do not appear.  In the headphones, the bass is clearly audible, the upper range is at an average level. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy j5 prime glass" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2033055.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime: reviews </h2><p>  The Korean phone is actively discussed by users on the net.  In their comments, they highlight the pros and cons.  The latter include the inability to operate Wi-Fi with a frequency range of 5 GHz, a weak graphics processor that can not cope with demanding games.  Many also noted that the phone does not have automatic brightness control, as there is simply no light sensor. </p><p>  But even with these shortcomings, the smartphone has something to surprise the user.  The list of its advantages was much longer.  We single out the main ones: </p><ul><li>  Quality materials. </li><li>  Nice design. </li><li>  Energy efficiency of the hardware platform. </li><li>  Decent level of performance. </li><li>  The presence of a fingerprint scanner. </li><li>  Separate slot for memory cards. </li></ul>
