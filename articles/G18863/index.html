  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Braiding at home</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Long hair has always been one of the main decorations of any woman.  They have an advantage over the usual short haircut, especially if they are beautifully laid and have a beautiful neat appearance and a healthy shine.  Below are some popular ways to style your hair in pigtails. </p><p>  1. Popular <span>braiding</span> at home in three strands </p><p>  The first thing to do is comb the curls with a regular brush.  Next, you need to divide the hair into three equal parts (we will conventionally designate them for ourselves as 1, 2, 3).  A third should be placed between the first and second strands, after which the first should be placed between the third and second parts of the hair, and the second between the first and third.  And then the third lock must be "put" between the first and second, etc.  As a result, we get an ordinary pigtail, which almost everyone can weave.  We fix it with a beautiful elastic band, ribbon, clip, bow, etc. </p><p>  2. Weaving <span>braids at home</span> in four strands </p><p>  Carefully comb the hair backwards and divide it into 4 identical parts.  We take the first lock and throw it on the second.  With your left hand we separate the third part and throw it on the fourth.  We take the fourth lock and put it under the first. </p><p>  Then the third part of the hair is placed below the second, and the fourth is simply put on the second.  We intercept the locks as conveniently and continue braiding. </p><p>  We pass the first part of the hair under the second, and put the third on the fourth.  Then we transfer the first lock to the third, and the second at the same time - also under the third.  Continue braiding to the desired length.  We tighten the tip with an elastic band. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  3. Weaving braids at home from five locks </p><p>  We divide the hair located on the back of the head into five strands.  Start weaving with the right lock.  In this case, they need to be arbitrarily designated (1,2,3,4,5). </p><p>  The first strand should be put on the second, the third should be put on the first.  Next: the fourth - under the first strand, the fifth - on the first.  After this: the second must be put on the third, fourth lock - on the second, then the fifth - on the second and, finally, the first - on the second, etc. </p><p>  4. <span>Beautiful weaving of braids</span> at home from six locks </p><p>  DIY weaving of <span>braids is</span> divided into 3 stages. </p><p>  Stage 1: </p><p>  We put the first lock on the second and at the same time the first - under the third.  After that, take the first part and shift it to the fourth, again the first - under the fifth, and, finally, the sixth - under the first. </p><p>  2 stage: </p><p>  put the second lock on the third, take the second again and move it under the fourth, then take the second part of the hair and put it on the fifth, again the second - and already under the sixth, then the first - under the second. </p><p>  3 stage: </p><p>  put the third - on the fourth, again take the third and rearrange it under the fifth, the third lock - on the sixth, again the third - but already under the first, and the second - under the third, etc. </p><p>  5. Pigtail "spikelet" </p><p>  Comb all the hair.  We separate a small section of curls about five cm from the parietal zone of the head to the back of the head and then <span>braid the "spikelet" braid.</span>  The remaining strands on the right side are combed and braided with a backing to the most woven hairstyle.  We perform the same action on the left side.  To the main, central braid, we pin two side weaves with small hairpins.  The ends of the curls are decorated with a hairpin or elastic. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Fashionable and stylish hairstyles with pigtails are very fond of wearing movie stars and pop stars, and what can we say about us simple girls?  In 2012, such hairstyles do not lose their former relevance. </p><p>  So, we begin to braid a beautiful <span>French braid,</span> laid in the form of a hoop.  At the beginning, we parted perpendicular to the upper part of the head in the direction from one ear to the other.  Next, we separate the bangs in exactly the same way.  We fix all the remaining hair with an elastic band (we do not use them).  Next, we collect all the working strands on one side of the head and comb. </p><p>  We start braiding the braids from the right eye as a normal braid, making 2-3 bindings.  After that, we put the left side lock on top of the middle, while adding hair that is on the left side.  Next, we put the working right lock on top of the middle and add the hair that is located on the right side.  We repeat this action until we reach the left eye, and then we begin to weave like an ordinary pigtail.  The tip can be fixed with a hair clip, invisible or elastic. </p><p>  <span>Weaving braids in a</span> circle is simple and very popular at the same time.  Another way is to use the tail.  Weaving is pretty easy.  The hair on the top should be removed in this very tail.  Weaving should begin from the middle of the ear and grab all the hair. </p><p>  In order to better imagine and understand the mechanism of weaving various braids, you can search the Internet for special workshops with step-by-step photos or training video lessons. </p>
