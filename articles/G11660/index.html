    <h2>  Method number 1: make a contribution </h2><p>  The vast majority of people with the thought of where to invest 500,000 rubles to earn, there is only one option - of course, put them in the bank.  Many consider this method to be commonplace.  But no, in fact it is just traditional.  Of course, profits of a million should not be expected.  But then the funds will be at least protected from inflation.  It is a fact. </p><p>  Another interesting point.  Some people think that having a sum of half a million rubles, you don’t even have to think about which bank to invest in.  Unless to choose it at the interest rate.  And so in any case, you can win.  This is almost true.  It’s worth clarifying the situation.  The fact is that recently the Central Bank has been actively withdrawing licenses from many banks.  That is, it closes them.  And in this case, up to 1.4 million rubles of deposit are returned to people who have made an investment.  That is, you can even win.  But only if the reserve amount of the <span>Deposit Insurance Agency</span> is not fully spent.  So there is a risk here too.  And it’s better to choose a bank more reliable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Method number 2: investment </h2><p>  Where to invest 500,000 rubles to earn, in addition to banks?  There are also investment companies.  In the Russian Federation there are several of the largest.  And they all offer pretty interesting conditions.  Many go to such companies, wondering where to invest 500,000 rubles to earn. </p><p>  And, in principle, the option is not bad.  In short, the client’s money will be invested in stock market instruments.  At the same time, a full amount is guaranteed.  There is a risk, but it applies only to profit.  And it can be very good.  Often, the return on investment exceeds the bank rate by two, or even three times. </p><p>  Example.  If the bank offers a percentage of 17 per annum, then 12 months after the deposit, a person will receive half a million and another 85,000 rubles from above.  Moreover, if the investment rate is three times more than <span>bank interest,</span> then the profit will be 255,000 rubles.  Great profit!  But there are risks too.  And this must be taken into account. </p>

    <h2>  Method number 3: turn to highly profitable organizations </h2><p>  This is also a good option if you have 500,000 rubles available.  Where to invest, how to get started and what exactly do highly profitable organizations mean?  So, everyone must have heard about the famous Forex market.  Currency trading, options - these words are familiar to many.  And there are entire organizations whose main activity is to trade on Forex.  A person who decides to earn extra money on his savings can give his money to the account manager.  This is all done officially, with contracts and conditions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can invest in one account or competently distribute them across several.  Sometimes the profit is 100% per annum!  However, guarantees for the safety of investments are not given - this is a huge minus. </p><h2>  Method number 4: the finished investment product </h2><p>  People, wondering where to invest 500,000 rubles to earn, reviews re-read literally about all the methods.  And here is another way - you can purchase a finished <span>investment product.</span>  This is from the same category as organizations that trade on Forex.  Only here behind these products are highly qualified, professional managers.  These are either company employees or successful hired traders.  In such cases, the risk is minimal, because these people really know what they are doing. </p><p>  In such cases, the profit can also be 100% per annum or even more.  Thus, you can not only double half a million, but even get a much more impressive amount.  Many people claim that they managed to earn in this way.  However, do not forget about the risk and that such organizations may go bankrupt.  This is as risky a method as <span>pyramid schemes.</span>  By the way, there, with a competent approach, you can earn about 10-20 percent per month from half a million rubles.  In general, these methods from the category of “pan or gone” - either a big jackpot, or a complete loss of their funds. </p>

    <h2>  Reliable way </h2><p>  It is logical to assume that for most people who have become familiar with the above methods, the question arises: "And where to invest 500,000 rubles, so that it is not only profitable, but also reliable?"  It is reasonable, because no one wants to just lose half-million earned and scrupulously accumulated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Well, there is a reliable way!  And it is called diversification.  The first thing to do is divide the amount into three parts.  One needs to be invested in a bank.  Let's say a hundred thousand.  The bank should be as reliable as possible - you should not pay attention to interest.  Let it be 10% per annum, but at the end of the term a person is guaranteed to receive ten thousand from above.  Everything is better than nothing! </p><p>  The second part (say, 50%) should be spent on a <span>structural product</span> (as discussed above).  You need to use the services of analysts - they know exactly what is best to choose.  You need to contact the most popular company, which has a Deposit Insurance Agency.  And if everything goes well, then in the end you can make a profit of at least 50-70 thousand rubles. </p><p>  And experts advise to invest the last part in a risky investment.  150 thousand rubles  eg.  If fortune is on the side of the investor, then from above it will be possible to get one hundred percent profit. </p><p>  Some consider this method reliable, others - senseless, and others - risky.  However, it is popular.  Many people managed to earn good money in this way, and some of them even began to use this scheme constantly. </p>

    <h2>  Promotion of online business </h2><p>  The website of the online store needs to be beautifully designed - it will turn out on its own, without hiring masters.  It is necessary to fill the pages with goods - with bright, detailed pictures and descriptions.  Delivery must also be arranged.  The payment system is to fix.  It is necessary to make sure that a person, having thrown the goods into the basket, paid immediately for them at registration.  And you can make a choice in favor of cash on delivery - it's easier.  In general, the choice is up to the person. </p><p>  Some people do it tricky.  They fill the site with all kinds of goods, and as soon as the order arrives, they themselves call the suppliers to send it.  This is done in order not to burn out and so that the goods do not become stale.  However, it is necessary to take into account the fact that doing express delivery from a warehouse every time will be much more expensive than wholesale purchase.  In general, this point is worth considering.  For starters, you can purchase the most popular and sought-after goods.  And for this, study the needs of customers. </p>

    <h2>  Creating a customer base </h2><p>  The last and most important factor is customers.  Where to look for them?  First you need to give an advertisement.  And it’s best to do this through social networks, or rather, through groups and public pages.  It is inexpensive, but the result is effective.  In addition, there is just a sea of ​​visitors!  Several publics (as they are also called) have several million people subscribed!  And if you place an advertisement there, you will get a very good <span>customer base</span> to collect.  Users, guided by the credibility of the group and page, follow the link to the store, register and buy.  So the idea can turn out to be very profitable if it catches fire.  By the way, it is considered one of the most simple and effective.  Many people do this and assure: this is the best thing to be carried away with the goal of earning money in our modern age. </p>
