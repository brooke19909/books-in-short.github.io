    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The five-star complex is located in a village called Bogazkent, located near Belek (Antalya province).  This is a popular resort, it began to develop relatively recently.  The advantage of Belek is its favorable geographical position, which allows you to make numerous excursions to the sights of all of Antalya. </p><p>  From Crystal Family Resort &amp; Spa 5 * you can reach many interesting places in 7-10 minutes.  These include numerous golf clubs (among which there is one with a national status), the ancient city of Aspendos and the amphitheater located in it, the Roman Aqueduct, the Garden of Tolerance and much more.  What about transport links?  <span>Antalya Airport</span> is located about 35 kilometers away, so getting to it is not a problem. </p><p>  More importantly, the hotel is located right on the seafront, on a spacious sand and pebble beach, where it is always clean and has free sun loungers (even at the height of the swimming season). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The Crystal Family Resort &amp; Spa 5 * has everything that should be in any 5-star hotel.  This is free Wi-Fi, private parking, luggage storage, currency exchange, 24-hour reception, child care services (personal baby sitter), dry cleaning, laundry, ironing, several shops (including a souvenir shop), car rental, and a separate business center. </p><p>  Also in Crystal Family Resort &amp; Spa 5 * (Belek) there is a hall for congresses and balls, designed for 430 people (there is an opportunity to divide it into two parts).  The interior is decorated in an interesting design, and the hall itself is equipped in accordance with all modern requirements for premises with a business concept. </p><p>  What about equipment?  The hall has everything that you might need: demonstration screens (stationary and portable), sound system (wired and wireless), a multimedia projector, microphones (wired and radio), a DVD player, a stage, wireless high-speed Internet, a plasma TV and lighting systems.  Of course, there are also such trifles as a fax, pointers, air conditioning, laser pointer, etc. </p><p>  Naturally, the hotel provides room service.

    <h2>  Reservation and complex rules </h2><p>  If people have planned a trip to Belek and decided to stay at Crystal Family Resort &amp; Spa 5 *, then the reservation process is better not to postpone.  This hotel complex is very popular, and rooms are booked for weeks or even months in advance (both by ordinary travelers and tour operators). </p><p>  By the way, if circumstances allow, then it is better to go on vacation not in the summer.  The climate here is good for relaxing in almost any month of the year, but prices in autumn and spring (and even more so in winter) fall almost twice.  This is worth considering for people who want to save money. </p><p>  What about check in?  Registration of new guests here starts at 13:00.  Accordingly, the departure of previous guests lasts until noon.  We must remember this when choosing a flight.  If guests arrive earlier than 13:00, they will, of course, be settled without waiting - but only if there are free and cleaned rooms of the reserved category.  But, as already mentioned earlier, Crystal Hotels Family Resort &amp; Spa 5 * is popular, and it is rarely empty. </p><p>  By the way, when placing on extra beds all children under the age of 12 do not need to pay for them.  This is the policy of the hotel.  But if you need an extra bed - this should be reported in advance.  You must contact the administration and request this service. </p><p>  And yet, making a remote reservation, you will need to indicate in the application the details of the credit card ("Visa" or "Master Card").  When checking in, the administrator at the reception will ask you to provide it with your passport, therefore you only need to use your own, and not borrowed from someone. </p>

These are real shows.  Turkish night, Brazilian dances, shadow theater, capoeira ... Every evening the animation team arranges something new and interesting - the vast majority of guests are happy to attend such original and exciting performances. </li><li>  <em>Comfort</em>  The rooms are well isolated.  And after midnight, silence reigns on the street, even in neighboring hotels. </li><li>  <em>Food</em> .  Many travelers (who have something to compare with) assure: such a delicious buffet still needs to be bothered to search.  There is absolutely everything!  Starting with shrimp and mussels, ending with lamb skewers and lentil soup.  Anyone, even the most food-picky person, will find what he likes.  There is a children's table, and even a diet area is available - with cereals, boiled potatoes, chicken and meat, broccoli, carrots, etc. Service in restaurants is also at their best - the waiters work promptly and politely, not forgetting to communicate with guests. </li><li>  <em>SPA</em>  This is really a salon with high-class service, and not a couple of rooms with a big name SPA.  They say that there is an excellent manager - he will listen to the wishes of customers, and pick up the visitor the program that is right for him.  Massage, by the way, is done great here - everyone should sign up for at least one session. </li></ul><p>  Reviews of Crystal Family Resort &amp; Spa 5 * (Belek) make sure: this complex really deserves to stay in it.  Many people who visited Turkey for the first time assure that if you go back there, it‚Äôs only to Belek, and exclusively to this hotel. </p>

    <h2>  What else should you know? </h2><p>  There are several more nuances that are worth noting attention, telling about the Crystal Family Resort &amp; Spa 5 * hotel, the photo of which is presented above.  And, again, you should turn to the reviews.  Here are the nuances that are recommended to remember people who decide to go here on vacation: </p><ul><li>  Most rooms face each other.  Therefore, it is better to book rooms with sea views.  And when filling out an application for reservation of apartments it is better to discuss this point in addition. </li><li>  If the main purpose of the trip is constant walking and entertainment, then it is better to choose a different accommodation option.  This is said by people leaving reviews about Crystal Family Resort &amp; Spa 5 *.  Near the hotel there is a quarter of shops, there are not even alleys and paths around.  However, in the hotel everything is organized in such a way that even you do not want to leave its territory. </li><li>  Coming to the bar, you do not need to limit yourself to the available menu.  People say that the hotel has excellent bartenders - professionals who can make any cocktail that the guest asks for. </li><li>  Receptionists are very helpful and polite.  In the hotel, according to the guests, the principle is ‚ÄúEverything for the client‚Äù, so if you need something, you can not hesitate to contact them.  They will try to fulfill any request. </li><li>  Sensitive sleep people are better off closing the balcony door at night.  In the morning, a rather loud call to prayer sounds in the mosque - this can wake up. </li><li> Few people know that the hotel is located in such a natural area in which turtles live.  They bury the eggs on the shore.  And so that their masonry was not ruined, vigilant security was organized.  Therefore, one should not be surprised at the prohibitions regarding the movement along the coastal strip of a sandy beach. </li><li>  In this area, a blackout is often observed.  The problem is instantly eliminated by automatically turning on the local generator, but another nuance appears - the noise from its operation, which may confuse some. </li></ul><p>  These are all the nuances that potential guests should know about.  In general, looking at the official description of the hotel, its photos, as well as reviews left by satisfied tourists, we can conclude: it is really worth going here.  And if there is such an opportunity, and there is a desire to spend a vacation in Turkey, enjoying high quality service, you should go to the Crystal Family Resort &amp; Spa. </p>
