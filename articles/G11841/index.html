    <h2>  By rail to Suzdal </h2><p>  "How to get from Moscow by train?"  - a question that will be answered right now.  But before you buy a ticket, you should book a hotel room.  Suzdal is a tourist city.  Prices here are not much different from Moscow.  And most importantly, on weekends it is rather difficult to rent a room in a hotel house.  Therefore, it is better to call and book in advance.  When the issue with the hotel room has been resolved, you should find out the schedule of trains Moscow - Vladimir.  It is Vladimir, because there is no direct route Moscow - Suzdal.  How to get from Moscow by train?  From Kursky station, electric trains depart daily for Vladimir.  Travel time is about three hours.  Ticket price - from 500 rubles. </p><p>  From the regional center to Suzdal can be reached by bus.  Departure interval is forty minutes.  But the train station and bus station are not quite close to each other.  You have to travel by public transport to the Torgovye Ryad stop.  Or get to Suzdal by taxi.  This option is quite tedious.  But for people who are curious and hardy, it will do.  Thus, you can visit the two cities of the Golden Ring.  Some tourists prefer this route because in Vladimir there are also many attractions. </p><h2>  By bus </h2><p>  This method is much simpler.  Every day, buses leave for the Suzdal and Vladimir buses from the <span>Shchelkovo station</span> .  Ticket price is about five hundred rubles.  Travel time is four hours. </p>

    <h2>  By car </h2><p>  Most Muscovites visit Suzdal in the summer or on May holidays.  Traffic jams cannot be avoided at this time.  In addition, the roads in the Vladimir region leave much to be desired, and the repair work being carried out at many sites in the Moscow region can significantly increase the travel time.  Suzdal is 220 km from the property.  You can get from Moscow in 4-5 hours, depending on the time of day and the level of traffic jams.  But even despite all these shortcomings, this is the most convenient way to get not only to Suzdal, but also to any other city of the Golden Ring. </p>
