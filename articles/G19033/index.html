  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get survivor benefits</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the loss of a husband or father who earned money, a family, among other things, finds itself, most often, in a difficult financial situation.  Trying to help, the state in this case assigns a survivor benefit to dependents (most often children under 18), who remained in this case without support.  However, there are several nuances that need to be considered when making out this payment.  It should be borne in mind that it can be social or labor.  In the second case, its size will depend on the accumulations that came from the deceased to the Pension Fund.  In 2011, the minimum amount was about 1,500 rubles per person, and for orphans this amount was almost doubled. </p><p>  To begin with, it is worth determining who exactly has the right to benefit from the loss of a breadwinner.  Firstly, these are his minor children, who do not even need to particularly prove their right to this assistance from the state.  Further, depending on the situation, the spouses or parents of the breadwinner, as well as his brothers, sisters or other <span>close relatives</span> , may apply <span>.</span>  An important factor is the complete financial dependence on the deceased breadwinner for reasons beyond the control of dependents (disability, age up to 23 years, <span>full-time study</span> at a university, etc.).  Also, the payment is due to the relatives of the deceased, caring for his young children. </p><p>  The organization where you need to apply is the local (regarding registration) branch of the Pension Fund.  Turning there, first of all, it will be necessary to fill out an application on a special standard form, which contains the data of the applicant, the deceased breadwinner, as well as a list of dependents.  In advance, you need to take care of opening an account with a bank, to which benefits will be paid for the loss of the breadwinner.  It can be transferred either to a <span>savings book</span> or to a plastic bank card.  The law states that this application can be sent to the appropriate institution by mail, and it must first be certified by a notary. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The package of documents that will be needed consists of mandatory and additional ones, while the latter are individual for each specific case.  In order to clarify them, you need to contact a pension fund employee.  The documents that will be needed in any case include the applicant‚Äôs passport, death certificate of the breadwinner, a document that must confirm the status of the dependent (for children - the birth certificate), the work book of the deceased.  Additional documents may be the following: a certificate of <span>the</span> breadwinner's <span>salary</span> , a document confirming the disability of the dependent, a certificate of full-time education, etc. </p><p>  The period for which the survivor benefit is issued varies depending on the situation.  If it is prescribed for disability, then its entire term will be paid.  For minor dependents, two stages of its payment are distinguished.  The first - until the age of 18, the second - if the child continues to study full-time, then, upon provision of relevant certificates, up to 23 years.  Usually, when registering an application, the Pension Fund specialist gives detailed comments on the payment term and the possibility of extending it. </p><p>  In addition, dependents are entitled to social benefit for the loss of the breadwinner, which is paid in cases where the deceased does not have any length of service officially registered, or when he committed a deliberate act punishable under the Criminal Code, which led to his death. </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to the fact that benefits for the loss of the breadwinner are assigned from the day of his death, so you need to apply to the appropriate institution no later than 12 months from this date.  Such a payment, although not too large in size, but allows the state to provide all possible assistance to persons in need. </p>
