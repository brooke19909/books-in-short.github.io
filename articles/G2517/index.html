At one time, it also gave rise to such kingdoms as Sumer, Akkad and Babylonia.  However, it is Assyria that holds the status of the first empire in the history of the world. </p><h2>  Foundation of establishment </h2><p>  Mesopotamia was located in the valley of two rivers - the Tigris and Euphrates, which is why it got its second name - Mesopotamia.  The land of this region was not particularly suitable for farming.  However, there were significant deposits of copper and iron ore that people learned to process.  In fact, this area lasted about 25 hundred years. </p>

    <p>  Historians count down from the invention of writing to the conquest of these lands by the Persians.  Researchers confine Mesopotamia to the two named <span>rivers: Tiger</span> and Euphrates.  This is exactly the country in the north of which the Assyrian state arose.  The answer to the question of how the establishment of this kingdom took place is given by historians. </p><p>  Even in the second half of the III millennium BC.  e.  the climate has changed on the <span>Arabian Peninsula</span> .  Therefore, the Semitic tribes were forced to migrate to the middle of the Euphrates River.  There, this people mingled with the ancient Assyrians.  Thus a poor state was formed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Modest life </h2><p>  At first, this territory lagged significantly behind its neighbors.  The inhabitants of the kingdom were engaged in agriculture and gathering.  Fields were sown with crops.  They skillfully grew barley and emmer.  A variety of fruits ripened in the gardens.  They had wonderful vineyards.  There were no irrigation systems.  Moisture brought rain and snow. </p><p>  But the main occupation was hunting.  Later they began to domesticate animals, grazing sheep.  There were Assyrians and horses.  They were used both in the economy and in military affairs.  Working with animals was quite difficult.  In winter, deep snow could fall in this area.  Summer was so hot that the sun dried the soil to dust. </p><p>  From the countryside into a majestic state, trade has helped transform this kingdom.  In Mesopotamia were the largest cities of that time.  Mesopotamia is also a country in the north of which the Assyrian state arose. </p>

    <h2>  Trade as a way to success </h2><p>  The history of the great empire began with the small northern city of Ashur.  The name he received in honor of the supreme deity.  The item was mainly inhabited by merchants.  In the XVI century BC.  e.  it was a trading power.  The city has become very rich due to its location.  He was lying at the intersection of trade routes, and merchants who traveled from Mesopotamia east and back, willingly rested at this point.  For a long period, the city did not receive political independence. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Added money to the treasury and the slave trade.  This situation was typical of Ancient Mesopotamia (the country in the north of which the Assyrian state arose). </p><p>  History (Grade 5) tells that Mesopotamia was part of Assyria in a chronological interval from the 9th to the 7th centuries BC.  e.  And this time falls on the Central Assyrian stage. </p><p>  The last time period was preceded by the Old Assyrian period.  Then the kingdom gained independence for a short time.  In 1970 BC  e.  power passes for the first time to the indigenous people of Ashur.  Although after this stage, these territories several times fell under the rule of other rulers. </p>

    <h2>  Lord's work </h2><p>  The state was led by the king.  This title was inherited.  The monarch in all matters was guided by the opinion of the nobility and elders.  For some time, the ruler concentrated in his hands all the main posts.  He played the role of a priest, a military leader, and even ruled the economy. </p><p>  Throughout the Old Assyrian period, this region fought for its independence.  And from the XIV-IX centuries.  BC  e.  Assyria from time to time conquered border lands.  Further, the power was under the rule of neighboring Mitanni. </p><p>  Several centuries passed, and it was precisely because of the invasive nature of this kingdom that the world recognized the name of the country in the north of which the Assyrian state arose. </p><h2>  The origin of the kingdom </h2><p>  In 1300, the king of <span>Assyria, Ashur-ollallit</span> I, through diplomacy and cunning, freed his state from invaders and took the first steps towards the formation of an empire.  One of his distant successors, Adad nirari I, brought the matter to an end.  Then began the period of conquest and loss of the occupied territories.  Sometimes the area was reduced to the previous redistribution.  Often the land to which the king‚Äôs power extended was reduced to the embankments of the Tigris River.  The main goal of the then military operations was robbery.  The country was enriched at their expense. </p><p>  The emergence of the Assyrian state was at the beginning of the XI century BC.  e.  Then the king was Tiglathpalasar I. His army carried out more than 30 successful campaigns, as a result of which significant territories were captured.  But the greatest profits came from the trade routes, which again fell under the rule of Assyria. </p><p>  Then, for nearly two hundred years, this land suffered from attacks by nomads.  The region was brought out of the crisis by Adad-nirari II. </p>

    <h2>  Warfare </h2><p>  The period of prosperity fell on the New Assyrian kingdom.  This stage dates back to the X-VII centuries BC.  e.  At this time, new reforms were introduced.  The army kept strict discipline.  The soldiers were particularly cruel.  Subsequently, even Mesopotamia, the country in the north of which the Assyrian state arose, could not boast of such military power. </p><p>  The ruler of Tiglathpalasar III became a true innovator in the military field.  First of all, he passed a law according to which recruits were recruited into the army.  The second step - from now on, the military were in full support of the state.  The number of soldiers could reach 120,000. In addition, the army was divided into parts, ranks appeared.  There were even scribes who were responsible for the calculations.  For example, how many prisoners were taken, what good they managed to capture.  Musicians entertained the army.  Another characteristic feature of this period is clairvoyants. </p><h2>  Great ruler </h2><p>  With this technique, the army became invincible.  Not surprisingly, the whole world knew in the north of which country the Assyrian state arose. </p>

    <p>  Another tactic of the army is chariots.  Soldiers on carts drawn by four horses could have burst into enemy lines in a matter of minutes and delivered deadly blows to them.  In addition, in this kingdom there were people who were digging and destroying the walls of the city that held the defense.  Significant benefits to the army brought spies. </p><p>  Tiglathpalasar III did much good for his country in other areas as well.  In particular, he resettled some peoples on the territory of others, thus mixing traditions and culture.  Therefore, the colonies could not gather enough strength to fight against the empire. </p><p>  Constant gains and successful policies brought fabulous wealth and cheap labor to the state. </p><h2>  The collapse of the kingdom </h2><p>  VII century BC  e.  became fatal to this people.  Gradually, the great empire began to lose its position.  Mesopotamia, a country in the north of which an Assyrian state arose, awaited a new government.  The next ruler of this land was Babylonia.  It was this kingdom and the neighboring Medes that made an alliance among themselves to repulse the enemy.  Their armies attacked in two directions.  With each battle, the empire lost its main cities. </p><p>  But the death of Assyria was a historical regularity.  Her kings and warriors were so bloodthirsty and cruel that they themselves later suffered from their gluttony.  It became impossible to control such a number of peoples.  Rebellion exploded in one or another region. </p>
