  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Babel. The meaning of phraseology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Babel Babel is a phraseology that we hear and mention repeatedly.  In order to do it right, you need to figure out what it means.  Let us turn to history for this. </p><p>  The book of Genesis, chapter XI of the Old Testament, tells us that all people living on Earth spoke the same language and understood each other perfectly.  That was until an event occurred that completely changed their lives. </p><p>  Nimrod, the king of the Hamites, founded a strong state on the land of Sennaar and set out to become king over all people, but for the sins of his ancestor Ham, all his people (hamites) should have been in the service (slavery) of other nations.  Nimrod forgot about this punishment and decided to build the city of Babylon and a tower high to the skies in order to draw near to God. </p><p>  When the construction of the tower, or, in other words, the pillar, began, builders gathered from all ends of the earth.  The work began in full swing, people quickly and amicably erected several tiers of this tower, but then the Most High intervened and punished the disobedient.  He mixed all languages ‚Äã‚Äãtogether, and people ceased to understand each other. </p><p>  If someone needed bricks, they brought him sand, if they needed clay, they brought water.  People shouted, demanded, proved something to each other, but no one understood anything.  The real Babylonian pandemonium began, which ended with everyone abandoning their work and scattering home. </p><p>  There are still traces of the construction of the <span>Tower of Babel,</span> which, undoubtedly, was a unique structure.  The Babylonian pandemonium firmly entered the <span>history of mankind,</span> as an example of the pride of people and their desire to be great against the will of God. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many artists, writers, and musicians have dedicated their works to this biblical event.  Renaissance Dutch painter <span>Peter Bruegel the Younger,</span> writers <span>Franz Kafka,</span> Andrei Platonov and composer Anton Rubinstein in their works showed the Babel Babel in the way they understood it. </p><p>  For millennia, people have been interested in the fact of this event, which has been confirmed in the research of scientists and archaeologists.  In all world religions there are myths and traditions that, one way or another, tell about such an event as the Babel Babel. </p><p>  We, the current generation, must also learn from this biblical legend.  We need to reflect on the fact that we should never succumb to such a great temptation as pride.  After all, no matter how high we may ascend, at any moment everything may end.  The Babylonian pandemonium, the meaning of which we understand as disorder, turmoil, confusion, has been used in this sense for centuries.  This phrase is often found not only in classical literature, but also in the works of modern authors. </p><p>  The Babel Babel is a phraseologism that is less widely known today than the name of the biblical city of Babylon.  Listening to music and watching Hollywood films, you and I often hear the word Babilon, which corresponds to the Russian name Babylon, meaning buzz, confusion and vanity.  Often people use the expression "Babylonian pandemonium", the meaning of which they do not even know. </p><p>  Before using unfamiliar words and phrases, try to find out their meaning, and then you can easily operate with phraseological units that are not so common in everyday <span>colloquial speech.</span>  With such knowledge, you will never get in the way.  You can safely say when you see a large gathering of people trying to prove something with a cry that this is the real Babylonian pandemonium.  This way you can emphasize your literacy and intelligence. </p>
