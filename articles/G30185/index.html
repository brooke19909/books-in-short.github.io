Mikhail Timofeevich Kalashnikov</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Who knows the history of the Kalashnikov assault rifle?  But this is a legendary machine used by most world countries.  This is not only one of the most popular small arms, but also one of the most significant inventions of the twentieth century.  During the existence of the AK-47, more than fifty million modifications of this machine have already been released.  The weapon is a legend, recognized by most countries of the world.  The story of the creation of the Kalashnikov assault rifle will be told to the reader in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="the history of the Kalashnikov assault rifle" class="if uuid-2082034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35123/2082034.jpg?1551273955"></div><h2>  Creator of the AK-47 small arms </h2><p>  Who invented the Kalashnikov assault rifle?  It was made by the famous weapon designer-developer - M.T. Kalashnikov.  As a lieutenant general, he was also a doctor of technical sciences, in Soviet times he was a member of the CPSU, a participant in hostilities, the owner of many medals, awards and orders, a public figure, and a deputy who received the title of Hero of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Mikhail Timofeevich Kalashnikov - a native of the Altai Territory, was born in a large, large family on November 10, 1919.  From an early age he was fond of studying the effects of various mechanisms.  Once, after graduation, a young man independently disassembled a browning pistol in order to familiarize and study in detail a weapon device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Upon reaching 19 years, he was called up for military service, where he received the specialty of a tank driver. </p><p>  Inventive talent Mikhail Timofeevich Kalashnikov began to show even during the service.  One of his first developments was an inertial recorder, counting the number of shots fired from a tank gun.  Then for several months he was passionate about developing a tank engine meter.  The result exceeded all expectations - the invention worked clearly, accurately capturing the operation of the engine. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War he was the commander of the tank, but in the fall of 1941 he was seriously wounded.  It was during treatment that he began to make the first drafts of automatic weapons.  He developed his idea, taking into account his own impressions received during the fighting, studied special literature, listened to the opinion of his colleagues.  This lesson captivated a talented young man so much that in a few months he developed his first model of firearms.  Although the model of the submachine gun was not recommended for serial production for a number of technical reasons, the great Soviet scientists in the field of mechanics A. A. Blagonravov noted the originality of the idea, as well as the design of the sample itself. </p><p>  Kalashnikov took up the development of the assault rifle in 1945.  After several years of design, refinement, as well as combat testing, the Kalashnikov automatic systems were adequately evaluated and recommended for army armaments.  For the greatest development of national importance, the one who invented the Kalashnikov assault rifle received the <span>Stalin Prize of the</span> first degree, and was also awarded the honorary order of the Red Star. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="how much is a kalashnikov assault rifle" class="if uuid-2082037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35123/2082037.jpg?1551273955"></div><h2>  Development history </h2><p>  In what year was the Kalashnikov assault rifle created?  In 1943, under the rifle cartridge received for armament, whose caliber was 7.62 mm, small arms were needed.  On a competitive basis, the development of weapons was launched specifically for the cartridge of this caliber.  The main task was to surpass analogues, to create a worthy replacement for <span>the Mosin rifle.</span> </p><p>  Among the competitive works were other successful projects by well-known developers, however, the automatic system of Mikhail Kalashnikov (also known as AK-47) surpassed the competitors in terms of design and cost of production as a result of the competition. </p><p>  In 1948, Mikhail Kalashnikov went to the motor plant of the city of Izhevsk to produce a trial batch of automatic systems in order to test them using military tests.  A year later, serial production of AK-47 started at the engineering plant of the city of Izhevsk.  By next year, AK entered service with the army of the Soviet Union. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="who invented the Kalashnikov assault rifle" class="if uuid-2082039" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35123/2082039.jpg?1551273955"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The main details of AK, their purpose: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  The rifled barrel of the machine, including the pool entrance, as well as the chamber.  Directs the flight of a bullet. </li><li>  The receiver is designed to connect the mechanisms in a single design. </li><li>  The stock contains a specially designed nest, which houses a pencil case with instruments for cleaning tools. </li><li>  Sights, consisting of a sector sight and front sight, are necessary for direct control of the location of the barrel channel relative to the aiming point.  Serve to aim a firearm at a target during firing.  The position of the fly is easy to change to control the location of the midpoint. </li><li>  The cover (detachable) of the receiver prevents damage to internal mechanisms. </li><li>  The bolt frame connected to the gas piston is one of the main elements of a firearm, which actuates the bolt element, also triggers the trigger. </li><li>  The shutter closes the barrel channel before firing.  Promotes a cartridge from the magazine directly to the chamber.  Also, a special mechanism is located on the shutter, with the help of which the spent sleeve is removed from the chamber or cartridge (if a misfire occurs). </li><li>  Thanks to a special spring, the return mechanism returns the bolt frame to its extreme forward position. </li><li>  A gas tube with a barrel pad adjusts the direction of movement of the gas piston using directional ribs. </li><li>  The trigger mechanism includes a trigger, trigger spring retarder, trigger, spring automatic release, sear, translator.  Provides trigger release from platoon, switching from single to continuous fire.  Using this mechanism, you can stop shooting, as well as lock the fuse. </li><li>  The fore-end is necessary for the comfortable holding of the weapon during combat shooting, performs the function of protecting the hands from contact with hot metal, thereby preventing burns. </li><li>  The store has a box type, holds three dozen rounds.  Thanks to the spring, the cartridges advance directly into the receiver. </li><li>  The bayonet-knife is mounted for operation at the time of close combat. </li><li>  The muzzle brake is a special compensating device designed to increase the stability of the weapon during a shot.  Partially removes powder gases during firing, due to this, significantly reduces the recoil of the barrel.  Helps increase accuracy during firing bursts (appeared in the AKM version). </li></ol><p>  Most young men can easily list the main parts of the AK-47, since the assembly of the machine for a certain time is an obligatory part of the school course of military initial training. </p><p>  The total number of AK elements is about a hundred parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="weight Kalashnikov" class="if uuid-2082041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35123/2082041.jpg?1551273955"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The first version of the AK-47 was distinguished by the following main characteristics: </p><ul><li>  The weight of the Kalashnikov assault rifle is 4.8 kg (not including the bayonet-knife). </li><li>  The length of the automatic system was 870 mm (including a knife - 1070 mm). </li><li>  <span>The speed of a bullet of a Kalashnikov assault rifle</span> (initial) is 715 meters per second. </li><li>  Barrel caliber - 7.62 mm. </li><li>  Cartridge - 7.62 x 39 mm. </li><li>  The Kalashnikov assault rifle store consists of thirty rounds. </li></ul><p>  Rate of fire: </p><ul><li>  when firing bursts - 100 shots in one minute; </li><li>  when firing single shots - 40 shots in one minute; </li><li>  The technical rate of fire is approximately 600 rounds per minute. </li></ul><p>  Shooting rates: </p><ul><li>  maximum bullet flight - 3 km; </li><li>  range of a lethal shot - 1500 meters; </li><li>  direct shot range - 350 meters. </li></ul><h2>  Modifications </h2><p>  The history of the Kalashnikov assault rifle contains information that the very first version designed by Mikhail Timofeevich during the competition was the AK-46.  This version of the weapon was invented in 1946, however, after a detailed study and a series of combat tests, this model was recognized as unsuitable. </p><p>  However, <span>as the story of the</span> creation of the Kalashnikov assault rifle <span>tells</span> , the next, 1947 was the year of development of the famous AK-47. </p><p>  Together with AK, by 1949 they adopted the Soviet Army folding version of the AK - AKS, created for special forces. </p><p>  Then, since 1959, the history of the Kalashnikov assault rifle moves to a new stage.  The AK-47 comes with a modernized Kalashnikov assault rifle (AKM).  From the same year, it was AKM that became the most common version of Kalashnikov.  Relative to previous models, AKM improved the firing range, the shape of the stock was changed, a muzzle brake compensator was added, as well as weight was reduced, a bayonet-knife was added.  Along with this model, a modification of AKMN was released, which has a night, optical sight. </p><p>  Together with AKM, the armament was replenished with a similar model, but the butt of which is folding - AKMS.  In addition to this version, AKMSN also existed, that is, a night version with a special optical sight. </p><p>  Over the next few years, the development of an automatic system for use with a 5.45 x 39 mm caliber cartridge was actively pursued.  By 1974, a new modification came into service - the AK-74 and AK-74N (a model that includes a night and an optical sight).  A special development for special forces was the new version of the AKS-74, that is, a model with a folding butt, another model was called the AKS-74N - a night modification with an optical sight. </p><p>  By 1979, a shortened version of the AKS-74 ‚Äî the AKS-74U and AKS-74UN ‚Äî containing fasteners for night and optical sight, appeared specifically for arming the landing forces. </p><p>  In 1991, a modernized AK-74 called the AK-74M entered the armament of the army.  The unique machine released into mass production managed to replace several models at the same time. </p><p>  It was the AK-74M version that became the base version for the development of the entire hundredth series. </p><p>  The hundredth AK series are various versions of the AK-74M, designed for export.  For delivery to other countries, only automatic systems of the hundredth series are currently used, since this series surpasses the previous ones in terms of material quality, modern technological process, and improved firing characteristics. </p><p>  The latest 5th generation modern model is the AK-12.  This sample appeared in 2012. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Mikhail Timofeevich Kalashnikov" class="if uuid-2082045" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35123/2082045.jpg?1551273955"></div><h2>  Guinness World Records Champion </h2><p>  The Kalashnikov assault rifle, the dimensions of which you already know, occupies one of the leading roles in the weapons environment.  For its reliability, he won the well-deserved unconditional recognition of most countries of the world.  Together with all its modifications, it occupies more than 15% of the small arms around the world, which is why it is included in the Guinness Book of Records as the most common weapon. </p><h2>  AK outside of Russia </h2><p>  A few years after the adoption of the AK-47 for armament, a production license was given to approximately two dozen countries.  The license was transferred mainly to states that were allies of the famous Warsaw Pact.  Also, by that time, more than a dozen countries began to produce AKs without an appropriate license. </p><p>  Around the world, there are about 100 million diverse variations of the Kalashnikov assault rifle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Kalashnikov assault rifle creation story" class="if uuid-2082047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35123/2082047.jpg?1551273955"></div><h2>  Combat use </h2><p>  The first combat use of the AK occurred during the suppression of protests in the fall of 1956 in Hungary.  Then it was a symbol of the war in Vietnam and was actively used by soldiers of the Vietnamese people's army. </p><p>  However, the rapid spread of the Kalashnikov assault system around the world occurred during the war in Afghanistan, while the CIA actively supplied them with armed groups. </p><p>  And then, thanks to reliability and ease of operation, Iraqi soldiers during the military operations in their country preferred the AK-47 instead of the M16. </p><h2>  AK as a civilian weapon </h2><p>  A variety of options for the Kalashnikov automatic system are very popular among civilian weapons, especially among those countries where the laws of arms are quite liberal. </p><p>  At the time of the appearance of the very first AK models in the United States of America, it was allowed to own automatic weapons.  Later, a law was passed prohibiting the sale of such weapons to civilians, but this did not apply to guns officially registered until 1986.  Therefore, until now, some own combat models of AK. </p><p>  As for most world countries, the storage of such automatic systems is prohibited by law.  Those who own AK illegally acquire them on the <span>black market.</span>  How much is a Kalashnikov assault rifle?  The price of AK varies depending on the modification.  So how much does a Kalashnikov assault rifle cost approximately?  According to unofficial data, the price of AK on the black market is in the range of $ 1,000 (about 55,000 rubles). </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Kalashnikov assault rifle speed" class="if uuid-2082052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35123/2082052.jpg?1551273955"></div><h2>  AK at the present time </h2><p>  Over time, the Kalashnikov assault rifle (weight, size and other technical characteristics were presented to your attention in the article) was subjected to many criticisms from leading experts, its shortcomings are increasingly discussed, many call the model frankly outdated.  During its existence (and this is already more than 60 years) the requirements for weapons systems in general have changed, the modern world, of course, dictates new rules, requiring improvement, modernization. </p><p>  However, despite the shortcomings discovered over time, the history of the Kalashnikov assault rifle continues.  He is rightfully considered a legendary weapon.  Having gained the reputation of being just a reliable machine, he will undoubtedly be in high demand for a long time to come.  It does not cease to copy, improve, refine the characteristics.  The Kalashnikov assault rifle is erected monuments, depicted on the arms, considered a symbol of good luck and even depicted on coins.  His recognition took place all over the world, and, undoubtedly, the AK left an indelible mark on the weapons history not only of Russia, but also of most foreign countries. </p>
