    <p>  Many in the country spend all their free time, equipping their temporary housing no worse than permanent, and sometimes even much more comfortable and cozy.  Almost all for the summer period bring a refrigerator and TV, which have long been synonymous with comfortable living, provided, of course, that they work properly.  This is especially true for the TV.  So that the quality of the received signal does not cause any complaints, the antenna for giving must comply with a number of requirements and wishes.  This will avoid unnecessary waste of time, material resources and nerves. </p><p>  Do not think that if your relatives or friends in a neighboring partnership have a television antenna that perfectly performs its main function to give a specific model and manufacturer, then you also need to purchase exactly the same one.  Even if the allotment is located not so far away, the terrain and various objects around your home can still make significant adjustments to the quality of the incoming television signal.  Therefore, choosing a similar device for yourself, be sure to seek qualified advice from specialists. </p><p>  Most often found on-air antenna for giving.  However, it has a number of significant drawbacks.  Firstly, the distance from the place of its installation and the signal source, depending on the model, can be no more than 40-80 m. Secondly, it is this type of antenna that reacts sharply to all kinds of relief changes in the terrain.  In some cases, the location of the house improves the quality of the received signal.  However, more often than not, the adjustment performed does not allow to achieve the desired result.  Thirdly, the number of received channels will be sharply limited, and if you have cable television at home, you will definitely feel the difference between the quality of reception and the number of watched shows. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you want your antenna for summer residence not to depend on the features of the terrain and the location of the land allotment, give preference to the satellite version.  Of course, this will cost you a little more, but for convenience, as they say, it‚Äôs worth paying.  The satellite dish can be installed in any area and at different distances from the television tower.  Even if you go on a visit to a distant farm, you can be calm that not only do not miss the football match that interests you, but also can watch it in a fairly high quality.  This is an ideal option in terms of the ratio of price, quality and the number of viewed channels.  Of course, you can connect it to only one TV, but so that everyone can see everything well, just pick up the receiver with the largest possible diagonal or get a signal modulator.  True, in the country, rarely does anyone install two TVs, so these tips are likely to be superfluous. </p><p>  A satellite dish for a summer residence still has a number of limitations.  When installed, it is located in the direction of the satellite.  If you are lucky and there is even terrain around you, then there are no obstacles.  If your neighbor has built a three- or four-story cottage, then it may be difficult to receive a signal even with this type of antenna. </p><p>  So that the TV antenna for giving gives you only joy and pleasure, before buying a particular model, be sure to consult with specialists or study in more detail information on this topic.  This will avoid unreasonable material costs and make the picture on your TV clear, bright and contrast.  Good luck watching your favorite TV shows in the fresh air! </p>
