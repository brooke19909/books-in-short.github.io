Today, many people are engaged in one or another type of needlework, because the best and most valuable gift is one that is made with their own hands. </p><p>  Even such a simple thing as a bow can be done in completely different ways, for example using a fork.  This is what will be discussed in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.faithtap.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bow on a fork master class" class="if uuid-2314563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2314563.jpg"></div><h2>  What materials are needed for the manufacture </h2><p>  Before starting work, it is necessary to have at hand the following materials and tools: </p><ul><li>  thin satin ribbon; </li><li>  table fork; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><h2>  What do we have to do </h2><p>  A novice master may have a question: "Why is a thin tape used?"  It is with such material that it is easiest to work with.  From a wider ribbon to make a beautiful bow on a fork the first time may not work. </p><p>  During the manufacture of jewelry, the fork should be located inside to the needlewoman, then the cutlery should be wrapped with tape.  In this case, you must not forget to leave on the inside the small end of the ribbon.  It must be fixed with your left hand and do not touch until the work is completed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the manufacture of the bow will be involved in the free end.  It is threaded between the middle teeth under the tape.  It is not necessary to tighten much, the result should be a loop.  Then, the same end is thrown to the inside through the tip of the fork so that it is threaded into an already made loop. </p><p>  During operation, you must carefully monitor how the tape is located.  It does not have to be twisted so that the craft turns out to be neat.  Particular attention must be paid to ensure that the ribbon passes through the loop on the desired side, otherwise the bow cannot be made.  To tighten the product, the working end is used, for which you need to gently pull. </p><h2>  How to make another bow option </h2><p>  This method is classic, the work starts in the same order that has already been described.  The tape wraps around the table fork and bends toward the outside so that it passes through the middle cloves to the other side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.owhstarsandstamps.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ribbon bow on a fork" class="if uuid-2314156" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2314156.jpg"></div><p>  Then you need to bend the remaining end, too, to the outside, but through the top, and do not forget to skip between the teeth.  At the last stage, a knot is tied, and the craft is ready.  This option is the easiest to make a small bow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you need to decorate a gift with a very small product, then only a couple of prong teeth are located in the middle.  And so it turns out a small bow on a fork. </p><h2>  Double bows </h2><p>  Using a fork, you can make a slightly more complex decoration in the form of a double bow.  The plug should be in the left hand or in the right (for those who are accustomed to working with the left hand).  The tape alternates through all the cloves.  After the last tooth is wrapped, the tape needs to be expanded and create another row located above.  For crafts, you need several rows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cleverly.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bow on a fork photo" class="if uuid-2314176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2314176.jpg"></div><p>  At this stage, the end of the tape must be wound between the teeth located in the middle, and passed to the bottom of the product so that it passes through the already finished loops.  For convenience, it is recommended to take tweezers.  As a result, the two ends of the ribbon are on the same side.  They need to be tied so that the resulting rows are pulled together.  At the last stage, the bow is removed from the fork and straightened. </p><p>  If you want to make the craft more colorful, then you can take a tape of a different color.  One tape is wrapped in several rows, then another is introduced.  With this method, the ends of the tape should be directed in opposite directions.  The second tape is threaded through the middle teeth and pulls together the rows, then it is tied in a knot.  At the end of the work, the bow needs to be aligned and straightened.  It is worth noting that the decoration of two ribbons looks more original.  Now it‚Äôs clear how to make a double ribbon bow on a fork. </p><h2>  Another way </h2><p>  Here, the option is repeated with the implementation of the classic bow, with the difference in that you have to make another round, which will take place between the middle cloves.  This is done at the first stage of work. </p><p>  The photo shows how to make a bow on a fork (master class). </p><div class="photo" data-original="no.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bow on a fork" class="if uuid-2314178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2314178.jpg"></div><p>  You can take several multi-colored ribbons at once, a very original craft will turn out if contrasting colors are selected.  Nothing complicated here.  A tape of any color is selected, which once wraps around the fork so that the end is between the middle teeth.  Then comes the turn of the second tape, which is also wrapped, but placed under the first tape.  Then the end remaining from the bottom ribbon should be brought to the outside and tied to a knot.  That's all the work.  It remains to remove the craft, straighten everything, cut the ribbons from the ends to get the desired length of decoration.  Ribbons are recommended to singe around the edges so that they do not crumble. </p>
