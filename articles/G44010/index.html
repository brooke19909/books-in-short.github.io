The beach season in Egypt lasts all year long.  It remains to understand the nuances of climate for the <span>months of the year.</span> </p><h2>  <strong>December</strong> </h2><p>  Of all the winter months, December should be preferred.  From December 1 to December 15, off-season takes place in Egypt, which means that the hotels are not crowded, the air temperature is about 28 degrees, the sea is warm.  However, from the 20th day, residents of the Old World begin to come here for Catholic Christmas.  Traditionally, the greatest demand for the period of the New Year holidays.  The price of tickets is growing with their approach. </p><h2>  <strong>January</strong> </h2><p>  The season in Egypt, which begins immediately after the New Year, January 2-3, is becoming increasingly popular.  From the beginning of the month until January 10-12, the most scarce tours are booked.  After that, until the 20th day, one of the most inexpensive seasons of the year comes.  The sea during this period has a temperature of about 22 degrees, air in the afternoon - about 25. There are few people in hotels, however, recently, due to the low price, this period has become more popular.  A beautiful tan in the middle of winter among vacationers, even with a not too hot sun, is provided. </p><h2>  <strong>February</strong> </h2><p>  One of the lowest prices per year for this season in Egypt is due to the lowest (about 15 degrees) air temperature.  Although many Russians continue to sunbathe and even swim.  With the weather it may be unlucky, and the temperature drops to 10 degrees.  However, it also happens that in February the air warms up to a comfortable 25 degrees. </p>

This helps to increase the number of visitors, hotels are filling, prices this season in Egypt are increasing significantly. </p><h2>  <strong>May</strong> </h2><p>  The weather in May is a real fairy tale!  This is rightfully the best season in Egypt.  However, during this period one of the highest prices of the year.  May is not only a time of Russian holidays, but also of Arab holidays.  The hotels are crowded, it is advisable to take care of the reservation in advance for this period.  Last minute vouchers at this time will not succeed.  However, in the second half of the month, prices begin to fall.  The fact is that it was then that the rival of Egypt - Turkey - begins its season.  This country is pulling a certain number of tourists, which affects the reduction in the price of tours.  The number of flights is also significantly reduced, so you should familiarize yourself with the flight schedule in advance. </p>
