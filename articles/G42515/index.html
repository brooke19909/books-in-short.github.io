    <p>  This winter resort in Russia for five consecutive years won one of the most prestigious awards - the World Ski Awards, a kind of Oscar for the tourism industry.  This award was made possible due to the proximity of the hotel to the ski lifts, well-designed tracks and the highest standards of service. </p><h2>  Dombai </h2><p>  It is difficult to imagine a more interesting holiday in the mountains of Russia in winter than a holiday in the Karachay-Cherkess Republic.

This place gained particular popularity in the post-war years - the territory began to expand, in this place there was a tourist complex with the first routes with a length of six kilometers.

    <p>  The Buryat hot spring can be safely called the most powerful on Lake Baikal - water comes out at a speed of forty liters per second!  The water temperature is +46 degrees Celsius.  The Ton Research Institute of Balneology characterizes this source as highly thermal, characterized by low mineralization, slightly alkaline, and siliceous.  That is, the water of this source is ideal for the treatment of a variety of diseases, for example, diseases of the nervous system, skin diseases, circulatory problems, musculoskeletal system. </p><p>  Immersion in a thermal source expands the capillaries, while reducing the load on the heart muscle.

In addition, it calms, anesthetizes, heals damage and accelerates metabolic processes. </p><h2>  Toksovo </h2><p>  What unites beginner skiers, ski jumpers, biathletes and biathletes?
