Here are just the most effective model, not everyone can find on store shelves.  Either the color is not the same, or there is too much decor, or there is no suitable size - there may be a lot of reasons.  But this circumstance is unlikely to upset creative young ladies.  And all because they themselves can realize their idea.  For example, tying it.  If the reader is just starting to learn the basics of knitting, we offer detailed instructions on how to knit the Bat pullover with knitting needles. </p><h2>  Features of work </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.shutterstock.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pullover bat" class="if uuid-3044716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3044716.jpg"></div><p>  There are many ways to bring an idea to life.  However, experienced needlewomen strongly advise beginners to choose the one that is most convenient and simple.  It involves knitting the studied wardrobe in a circle from the bottom up.  That is, we need to take annular needles, dial the number of loops equal to the circumference of the hips or chest.  Knit several rows without increases and decreases with an elastic band or facial smoothness.  And then begin to gradually expand the canvas, advancing to the armpits and at the same time tying the sleeves.  The principle of knitting the studied product is simple, but requires competent calculations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Preparation of necessary tools and materials </h2><div class="photo" data-original="guide.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knit pullover bat" class="if uuid-3044713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3044713.jpg"></div><p>  To knit a female pullover "Bat" with knitting needles, you do not have to perform complex manipulations.  In fact, even those who can only knit front and back loops and are completely unfamiliar with complex patterns can do the job.  Experienced needlewomen recommend to beat the conceived product with unusual yarn.  For example, you can take a patchwork or gradient, and also make a studied wardrobe item using several shades of yarn.  You can also work with melange knitting thread.  It consists of several tones that are selected in such a way that they blend well.  If the reader succeeds in complex patterns, you can knit the ‚ÄúPullover‚Äù pullover with various braids, plaits and other interesting textures.  But it is better to use monochrome yarn.  In addition, it is worth noting that in any case, the thickness of the knitting thread and the diameter of the selected knitting needles should be the same. </p><h2>  Is it possible to use standard parameters? </h2><p>  The question that we have formed in the subtitle of the current item is the predominant majority of novice masters.  Because they strive to act as much as possible according to the instructions or the finished template, so as not to make mistakes.  However, professionals do not advise working with someone‚Äôs standards, they say that it‚Äôs better to take off your own.  Why? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pullover bat working principle" class="if uuid-3044738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3044738.jpg"></div><p>  To please yourself or someone close to yourself with a do-it-yourself thing, you need to correctly make calculations.  But first, it‚Äôs important to measure the model for which we will knit the ‚ÄúPullover‚Äù pullover with knitting needles.  Moreover, experienced needlewomen recommend taking measurements, rather than using ready-made ones.  Otherwise, you can do a thing that turns out to be more or less than the necessary parameters.  And this means that it will have to be bandaged. </p><h2>  Features of taking measurements </h2><p>  So, taking measurements is very simple.  You just need to prepare a centimeter tape, a piece of paper and a pen.  Then make measurements: </p><ul><li>  girth of the chest or hips (the highest value is taken); </li><li>  product length - from the bottom edge to the shoulder; </li><li>  neck girth - at the base; </li><li>  the height of the armpits - from the lower edge to the armpits; </li><li>  sleeve length - from the tip of the shoulder to the estimated level of the cuff; </li><li>  girth of the arm at the location of the cuff. </li></ul><p>  Many beginning masters, having figured out the parameters necessary for knitting the ‚ÄúBat‚Äù pullover with knitting needles, immediately get to work.  At the same time, they verify each action with a centimeter.  However, experienced needlewomen find this technique extremely uncomfortable.  After all, he does not even allow the first time to dial the correct number of loops.  Therefore, further we will analyze another important part of the preparatory phase. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.postila.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pullover bat" class="if uuid-3044704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3044704.jpg"></div><h2>  How to determine the desired units </h2><p>  When knitting any product, the needlewoman is guided by the number of loops and rows.  It is these parameters that determine the size of the idea.  And in order not to check each step with a centimeter and not get a big or, conversely, a small thing, it is more reasonable to make calculations in advance.  To do this, knit a square 10x10 cm in size. It is important to work with prepared yarn and tools, as well as knit with a pattern that is selected for the Bat pullover.  On the knitting needles we loop, guided by rapport.  Therefore, sometimes a square can get a larger size.  In any case, further actions will be as follows: </p><ol><li>  We carefully consider how many loops and rows fit in the sample. </li><li>  Divide the loops by the width of the sample, and the rows by the length. </li><li>  Thus, we manage to find out the number of loops (P) and rows (P) in one centimeter. </li><li>  Now it will not be difficult for us to calculate the parameters of our ideas.  To do this, multiply P by all horizontal rows, and P by all vertical ones. </li><li>  For convenience, it is better to draw the desired product and indicate on it the necessary units of measurement obtained by simple calculations. </li></ol><h2>  Knit pullover from bottom to top </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pullover bat workshop" class="if uuid-3044736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3044736.jpg"></div><p>  Experienced needlewomen say that those who have been able to carry out competent training will easily knit the Bat pullover for a woman, girl or girl.  But it is also important to follow the instructions provided: </p><ol><li>  We collect the number of loops equal to the circumference of the hips or chest. </li><li>  We knit an arbitrary number of rows without increases and decreases. </li><li>  After we start adding loops strictly along the line of the side seams.  To simplify the work, you can calculate how many additives are in each row.  To do this, divide the length of the sleeve by the height of the armpits. </li><li>  We knit, relying on our calculations and forming a t-shaped canvas. </li><li>  Next, we knit the front and back separately.  We move back and forth without making increases or decreases.  Each part is raised half the width of the cuff. </li><li>  Close the loops and sew the fabric with a sewing needle and thread.  But do not forget in the middle of each part to select the hinges for the gate - 1/2 neck circumference. </li><li>  In conclusion, we take a hook, we collect loops, we transfer to ring spokes of the same size or smaller and we knit small cuffs. </li></ol><p>  We hope that our instruction will help the reader to knit the Bat pullover with knitting needles.  But if someone has questions, we will gladly explain everything, help.  And we will be especially happy if someone wants to demonstrate the result of their labors or share their experience. </p>
