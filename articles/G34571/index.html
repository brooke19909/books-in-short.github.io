These phrases cause excitement for everyone who at least once seriously engaged in philately, or as people call it - collecting stamps.  Some have taken up this quite recently and believe that this kind of activity is just an exciting hobby.  But the attitude of others may surprise someone.  For most avid philatelists, collecting is life.  They absolutely spare no effort and time in searching for the necessary fragments or copies for their collection. </p><p>  Perhaps they can be understood, because some brands are not only of historical value.  Sometimes the cost of one unit can fly up to eight-digit numbers.  This, of course, applies only to rare instances.  Today it is extremely difficult to find them yourself, and those that have already been found?  show off in private collections or museums, from where it is almost impossible to buy something.  <span>Postage stamps of the USSR are</span> also of interest, as they are of considerable historical value. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="USSR stamps" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40532/1178313.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Historical specimens.  Description </h2><p>  Each such brand has its own story.  Some stamps of the USSR were issued for some event, others were printed in a limited edition, etc.  So, what can be said about the most expensive and interesting brands of the Soviet Union? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Almost a century ago, a significant and very first brand appeared in the history of the USSR.  This happened on November 7, 1918.  Its creator was none other than Zarins Richard Germanovich.  Since that time, rare specimens have often been produced in the Soviet space, which to this day philatelists are searching all over the world.  Yes, USSR stamps can cost more than one thousand dollars.  Almost eight hundred cost one buyer a copy of the stamp from the very first All-Union Philatelic Exhibition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="USSR stamps by years" class="if" height="426" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40532/1178312.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rare and expensive </h2><p>  More recently, namely in 2008, stamps with the image of the pilot S.A. were sold  Levanevsky.  Released in August 1935, it came in a limited edition and had several varieties.  The difference was in the letter "f", which was spelled out in slightly different ways.  Moscow - North Pole - San Francisco ... That was that significant pilot route.  The authorities decided to mark this event with the release of such a wonderful paper subject of history. </p><p>  There is the same brand on the market, only with inverted ‚Äúblanking‚Äù.  It is priced somewhat cheaper - two hundred thousand dollars.  Large numbers of copies came out under the name "Consular fifty dollars."  Their number at that time was about fifty to seventy pieces.  Each is estimated at approximately sixty-five thousand dollars.  A rare brand, bearing the name "Transcarpathian Ukraine", remained in only a few copies, since it was, in principle, not issued in circulation.  Its value ranges from thirty thousand dollars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="USSR stamps 1974" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40532/1178311.jpg" width="432"></div>

Space and achievements of the XX century </h2><p>  Space topics in stamps are of particular interest to philatelists.  Famous astronauts and their flights often adorn the stamps of the USSR.  Space, like everything unknown, always attracted people, so such grandiose flights deserve eternal memory.  The first manned space flight was marked by the release of a brand with the image of Yuri Gagarin.  Following it, USSR stamps were issued dedicated to the <span>day of cosmonautics,</span> to achievements in the field of space technology, space television and space physics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="USSR stamps space" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40532/1178314.jpg" width="500"></div>
