  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a car out of paper?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In almost every family in which there are children, the question inevitably arises for the parents, why would it be so interesting to take their children so that their free time (and they sometimes have a lot of it) would be fun and useful?  It is not so easy for a child to be interested in anything, especially for a period of more than ten minutes.  But it is necessary from an early age to develop a desire and a passion for creativity in a boy or a girl, and simply strive to ensure that the child is fully developed.  Each parent wants his child to be talented, and he (or she) has a creative approach to everything.  Is not it? </p><p>  For these purposes, the art of origami, or the technique of creating various figures (animals, birds, fairy-tale creatures, etc.) from paper or cardboard, is perfect.  You can use any paper, and in some cases, cardboard.  It all depends on your personal desire, the tastes of the child and, of course, financial capabilities.  Among other things, from paper you can create all sorts of <span>cars.</span>  <span>How to make a</span> car <span>out of paper</span> you will know very soon.  Surely your children will like the process of co-creation, and then they will want to try to do the work on their own.  Just think, your child will create a toy for himself with his own hands and then play with it.  Isn't it wonderful? </p><p>  In fact, there are options for how to make a car out of paper, a whole sea.  It all depends mainly on what kind of machine you want to make.  Large truck, or small miniature - you choose.  Of course, different schemes and different models will take different time.  Well, let's get started?  "How to make a car out of paper?"  - you ask.  Everything is very simple.  You only need to read the manual below and you will succeed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Racing sports car - manufacturing technique</strong> </p><p>  To get started, take a rectangular sheet of paper, fold it in half lengthwise.  By hand (or using a ruler), fix the crease on the paper that has formed properly.  Carefully tear off half the sheet.  We do the same process again, and again divide the sheet.  Now, grasp the edge of the paper, on the side that is authentic, and bend it so that an angle of 90 degrees is formed.  With the other end we do the same.  We have formed a cruciate ligament. Turn the sheet over and do the same on the other side.  Next, fold the paper strictly along the fold lines to make a triangle.  Similarly, make it on the other side of the sheet, there you also need to get a figure symmetrical with the first.  So, on your table lies a blank for our machine.  Now, bend the long sides of the figure to the middle, and fix the fold as best as possible - these will be the contours of the machine.  Now you need to choose which side will be the hood and which side will be the back of the car.  But this, in general, is not too important, since the differences are minimal (for now).  Carefully grasp the edges of the triangle that you want to see with the face of your car, bend to the middle - you get ‚Äúwings‚Äù.  Bend our workpiece again by connecting the front and back.  Both halves of the machine do not need to be glued together.  Well, that's basically it.  The question of how to make a car out of paper has been resolved.  The point is small: if you wish, you can color the car or even stick a number plate. </p><p>  In addition to the above, the machine can be made not only of paper, but also, for example, of cardboard.  In this case, the design will be much more dense and durable.  But <span>how to make a car out of cardboard,</span> because it is tough?  Everything is actually about the same as in the previous description, only here you will need glue and scissors in some cases.  The rest of the technology is the same.  Thus, what and how to make a machine - paper or cardboard - you decide.  The most important thing is that your child be satisfied and the smile does not leave his face.  This is the main dream of any parent.  From ancient times, origami was considered a good way to train and educate patience, perseverance and other qualities that are likely to be useful in life to everyone, not only a child, but also an adult. </p>
