Traditionally, it was considered a great success to get a vacation in July.  But where to spend these four coveted weeks?  With the fall of the Iron Curtain, the choice of places to go to the sea in July has expanded significantly.  In this article we will review these summer resorts.  Some of them receive guests in spring and autumn, and at least all year round.  But there are those who ‚Äúlive with visitors‚Äù only three summer months.  Then on the beaches, as they say, the apple has nowhere to fall, and prices in hotels and local cafes soar.  And this fact must be taken into account when booking the hotel in advance.  In tropical countries where tourists travel in large numbers to rest in winter, summer, either very hot (Egypt, the United Arab Emirates), or the rainy season begins (Thailand, Maldives, Dominican Republic).  But then prices are falling.  Therefore, before the trip you need to weigh everything and decide where to go to the sea in July. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to go to sea in July" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/830924.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays in Russia </h2><p>  Holidays in domestic resorts have their undeniable advantages.  Firstly, not only visas are not needed, but also a passport for traveling abroad.  The road will not take much time and will not be tiring.  The absence of a language barrier, a single paradigm with the local population make the life of a vacationer comfortable.  What can the seaside resorts of the Russian Federation offer their citizens?  Two seas at once - Black and Azov.  The last water area is in special demand among tourists with young children.  Shallow water warms up quickly and you can not be afraid that the crumbs are supercooled by sea baths.  The Krasnodar Territory and the Kuban have always been famous for their recreational opportunities.  The Black Sea coast of the North Caucasus has always been a favorite and prestigious vacation spot for citizens.  Sochi, Adler, Gelendzhik, Anapa, Tuapse, Lazarevskoye, Dagomys - this is not a complete list of resorts, where to go to the sea in July will be a great choice.  Of course, prices bite during peak season.  And the service, frankly, is very inferior to European standards.  Therefore, experienced travelers are advised to look after the private sector as housing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to go to rest in July at sea" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/830921.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rest in Ukraine </h2><p>  Seaside resorts of the motherland are not always pleased with the service.  In addition, the prices there cannot be called suitable for a budget holiday.  But in neighboring Ukraine the same climatic characteristics are observed as in the Azov and Black Seas in Russia.  The same comfortable air temperature (+ 27-28 ¬∞ C), water indicators up to plus twenty-three water (and in shallow water and more).  True, since 2015, a foreign passport is required to enter Ukraine, and for a child a "Travel document for a child" is required.  But this does not stop fans from basking in the soft yellow sand of the Northern Black Sea coast.  Affordable prices, rapidly developing tourist infrastructure and delicious food will be a pleasant addition to the hot and dry climate.  Where to go to the sea in July in Ukraine?  The selection is very wide.  Firstly, it is Zatoka - a huge spit that extends to the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKarolino-Bugaz near Odessa.  Also it is impossible to ignore resort towns of the Nikolaev and Kherson region.  For a year now, Ochakov and the Iron Port have been considered a cheap place for sea and sun baths. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to go in July to the Black Sea" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18164/487705.jpg" width="504"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays in countries where visas are not required </h2><p>  Well, if we got a passport for going <span>abroad,</span> we will not limit ourselves to neighboring countries.  There are still countries where you can enter without a visa.  These are Montenegro, Cyprus and Turkey.  The latter is consistently very popular among Russians - probably because most of the hotels there practice an all-inclusive food system.  If you are a fan of ringing heat and the sea, which in temperature resembles a bath, select the resorts of the Anatolian coast.  This is Alanya, Kemer, Side.  But if you like more comfortable temperatures, and you wonder where to go to the sea in July, the Aegean coast awaits you.  There are enough historical antiquities and amazing sights in the south and in the west of Turkey.  But in Izmir and Marmaris, even in mid-July, a light cool breeze blows, refreshing the heat.  And the Aegean Sea is a little colder than the Mediterranean. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cyprus and Montenegro </h2><p>  These are two more countries where you will have a wonderful vacation at sea in July.  Where to go in the <span>Balkan country</span> on the Adriatic?  Budva, <span>Sveti Stefan,</span> Boka Kotorska Bay - no matter which resort you choose, everywhere you will find the cleanest beaches awarded with the Blue Flag, large hotel complexes and small family hotels with a European level of service.  As for Cyprus, the island republic is ready to provide travelers with all kinds of services.  Youth chooses Ayia Napa.  This resort has many nightclubs, discos and the like.  On the other hand, golden sand beaches and a shallow calm sea are safe for babies.  In addition, there is a water park in Ayapa.  Anyone who prefers a measured and relaxing beach holiday travels to Protaras.  And those who like to alternate swimming in the sea with interesting excursions, choose Limassol.  Incidentally, he is considered the most ‚ÄúRussian-speaking‚Äù of all resorts in Cyprus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays at sea in July where to go" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/192304.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Bulgaria </h2><p>  In the middle of summer, hot and clear weather sets in this country.  The likelihood of rain is minimized.  But, by the way, temperature indicators of air rarely exceed the mark of plus thirty degrees, while the water warms up to stable + 25 Celsius.  An ideal solution to the question of where to go in July to the Black Sea with a child.  Bulgaria has always been famous as a place of children's recreation.  If your child has already reached school age, then it is quite possible to arrange a trip for him to the sports and recreation camp.  Children's groups leave Russia under the supervision of domestic teachers.  Nessebar, Pomorie, Golden Sands, Varna, Sunny Beach - the choice of Bulgarian resorts is quite wide.  The similarity of language and hospitality of local residents make the rest of Russian tourists comfortable.  The beach and sea in this country get along well with excursions deep into the mainland.  You can go to the Valley of Roses, go along the Ropotamo river, visit the ancient Plovdiv and the capital of Bulgaria, Sofia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to go in July at sea" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22962/492999.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Balkan countries </h2><p>  Slovenia, Montenegro, Albania and Croatia are located in approximately the same climatic zone, in fact, like Bulgaria.  If you decide where to go to rest in July at sea with the whole family, then the Adriatic is the best choice.  Comfortable air and water temperatures (+29 and +25, respectively) are suitable for both children and adults.  A mass of natural, historical and cultural attractions will dilute the monotonous beach holiday with vivid memories.  In Croatia, resorts located south of the city of Split are especially popular with Russian tourists.  This region is famous for its wonderful wines and excellent cuisine.  In addition, in Slovenia there are many healing sources, so you can combine a beach holiday with treatment. </p><h2>  For extremals </h2><p>  In Egypt, in July, the real heat.  The temperature in the shade can reach forty-five degrees with a plus sign.  And the water in the Red Sea warms up to + 28 gr by the middle of summer.  True, due to the dry air and constant breeze, the heat is quite easily transferred to the coast.  But again: young people with a healthy heart and without pressure surges can be advised to include in the list of countries where it is better to go to the <span>sea, Egypt,</span> Tunisia, Morocco, the Emirates in July, but elderly tourists and children should visit these places in October, when it gets cooler.  Budget trips will be made to the Caribbean and Southeast Asia.  Compared to winter, of course.  Do not be afraid of the words "rainy season."  Showers mostly take place at night and only refresh the hot equatorial air. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to go in early July at sea" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28188/830941.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  European Resorts </h2><p>  Summer, and especially the high season, is a good time to travel to Greece, Italy or Spain.  There would be a visa!  And charter flights at an affordable price will take you to any airport in Southern Europe.  Please note that in Italy, entry to the beaches is mostly paid.  But in Spain, on the Mediterranean coast of France, Greece, they are municipal.  July in Spain is a rather hot month.  In order not to expose your body to temperature stress, you should choose the Costa Brava or Moresme, leaving Azahar and Blanca for September-October.  The heat is easiest to experience on the islands - Ibiza and Mallorca have always been a favorite tourist destination for vacationers from Western Europe.  If you can hardly stand the heat, choose Portugal.  The cool Atlantic Ocean softens the heat, and the average temperature here is twenty-five degrees.  Another destination is Madeira Island.  It is constantly warm here, and tourists come here until mid-October. </p><h2>  Where to go in early July at sea </h2><p>  Although the weather in summer does not change as fast as in the off-season, the difference between the first ten days and the end of the month is still visible in some places.  For example, in Cyprus, Tunisia, Turkey closer to August, the heat is very intense.  But at the beginning of the month of July, the weather is ideal for sunbathing and sea bathing.  The same can be said of the resorts of Greece.  The water has warmed up well, but the air still does not ring from the heat, and the nights are not stuffy.  Bulgaria and the Ukrainian Black Sea coast are good throughout July.  The weather can mess with short-term rains in the first decade, but it will not affect the sea temperature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to go at the end of July to the sea" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/830936.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to go at the end of July to the sea </h2><p>  It may seem strange, but it is better to go to the Balearic Islands, France and Italy in the second half of the month.  This is because the deep Mediterranean Sea can ruin bathing by accessing the surface of deep bottom layers of water.  The Adriatic warms up quickly, but the neighboring Alps still melt in their gorges, which affects the possibility of prolonged rains.  The last half of July is the best time to relax in the Baltic countries.  The same can be said about the resorts on the northern seas of Central and Western Europe: the Belgian Ostend, Polish Gdansk and others. </p>
