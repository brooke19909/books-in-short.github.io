It is located on the coast of the great Don River, sung by Sholokhov in the novel "Quiet Don".  The history of the city began in 1749, when customs was founded on the coast, and later on the fortress, which served as a defense during the Russian-Turkish wars.  Now the city is recognized as one of the ten best cities in Russia.  Tourists want to see interesting places in Rostov-on-Don.  It is about them that will be discussed in our article. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="47.23571369999999" data-lng="39.701505" data-type="hybrid" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/1/0/0/5100.png"></div><h2>  Bolshaya Sadovaya street </h2><p>  Bolshaya Sadovaya is one of the interesting places in Rostov-on-Don.  The main street of the city began to be built up in 1781.  But in those days, she still had no name.  Beautification of the streets began only in the middle of the nineteenth century.  At this time, kerosene lights appeared on it for lighting.  Later, a water pipe was made here and an electric tram was launched.  In the past, there were two streets in the city with the name Sadovaya - Malaya and Bolshaya.  They walked parallel to a friend. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nicoletta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Large garden" class="if uuid-2590861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2590861.jpg"></div><p>  One of the parts of Bolshaya Sadovaya is nicknamed by the locals ‚ÄúRostov Broadway‚Äù.  On the site from Budennovsky to Voroshilovsky Prospect, unique houses are located, each of which previously bore the name of the owners.  Only some architectural masterpieces have survived to our days: the House of Margarita Chernova, the State Bank, the city hall building, the Moskovskaya Hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Promenade </h2><p>  Among the beautiful places for photo shoots in Rostov-on-Don, it is worth highlighting the embankment, which has long been a resting place for citizens and tourists.  Numerous monuments are located on the Don coast, and the embankment itself is lined with stone slabs and decorated with flower beds.  On a sunny day, you can enjoy stunning views of the city.  Rostov embankment is named after Fedor Ushakov.  An interesting fact is that in the mid-nineteenth century it was built by prisoners. </p><p>  A number of iconic sculptures were installed on the embankment: ‚ÄúRostovchanka‚Äù, Nakhalenok with grandfather Schukar, ‚ÄúCastle Tree‚Äù.  More recently, new monuments appeared on the right bank ‚Äî Don-Father, Artist, Grigory and Aksinya in a Boat, Fisherman and others.  Visitors to the city very often take photos near these lovely sculptures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tonkosti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Embankment" class="if uuid-2590865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2590865.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the city embankment during the holidays becomes a place of festivities.  A special day is the city, representatives of all diasporas are preparing a treat code for local residents. </p><h2>  Liventz Fortress </h2><p>  The interesting places of Rostov-on-Don and the region should certainly include the <span>Liventsovskaya fortress,</span> which is the oldest village in the region.  It dates from the eighteenth century.  The hillfort was erected by the tribes of the Yamnaya and catacomb culture of the Don.  Often it is compared with the famous Troy.  The archaeological site has been known for a long time.  However, full excavations on its territory were not conducted.  Experts believe that local residents were forced to defend themselves from nomadic Indo-Iranian tribes, and therefore built a stone fortress. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.2r.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Liventz Fortress" class="if uuid-2590878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2590878.jpg"></div><p>  The main building, called the fortress, covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãseveral thousand square meters.  m. Initially, experts did not pay any attention to it, since they did not find cultural objects.  Later, during the development of the quarry, silicon tips and ceramics with comb and cord ornaments were found.  Now the fortress is recognized as a historical monument of federal significance.  Unfortunately, only a small part of the village has been studied, so much is still in the ground.  Of the objects found, a protective wall, part of the castle moat, rubble stones of buildings are interesting.  Findings made on the territory of the complex indicate that the fortification dates back to the middle of the Bronze Age.  Here you can see the traces of the acropolis of the city, barrows and burial grounds. </p><h2>  Paramonovsky warehouses </h2><p>  Among the interesting places for tourists in Rostov-on-Don, you should see Paramonovskie warehouses, which now look more like ruins.  But even in this state, they are impressive.  The walls of the buildings are made of good red brick and more likely resemble the ruins of a fortress.  Keys are everywhere, creating ponds with clear water and waterfalls.  Seeing all this, it is difficult to imagine that literally a hundred years ago it was a prosperous place that brought a lot of money to the city.  Thousands of people worked in warehouses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="donday.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paramonovsky warehouses" class="if uuid-2590873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2590873.jpg"></div><p>  The history of buildings began in the nineteenth century.  And then the turnover of the local port was very large.  Wheat was sent to England from here, and the quantity of production was constantly increasing.  Therefore, it was decided to build a large warehouse complex in the Khlebnaya Wharf area. </p><p>  The oldest building was built in the 1850s, and the newer in the 1980s.  Thousands of tons of wheat, coal, wool, and food products passed through the warehouse premises.  Engineers involved in the construction brilliantly used the non-freezing springs of the area.  All the water from the keys was collected in pipes that circulated around the premises, maintaining a low temperature.  Throughout the year, the temperature of the springs was +9 degrees, which made it possible to store grain in the right conditions.  Now, unfortunately, the ruins are in poor condition. </p><p>  Nevertheless, Paramonovsky warehouses are an interesting place in Rostov-on-Don for a photo.  People come here to make photo shoots, as well as wedding processions.  Amazing ruins combine the power of the creation of human hands and natural beauty. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden </h2><p>  Among the best places in Rostov-on-Don, you need to pay attention to the botanical garden.  In the wide Don steppes, trees have always been appreciated.  That is why after moving the University of Warsaw in 1915 to the city, a botanical garden was laid under it to study the vegetation of southern Russia and to spread new species of shrubs and trees here.  Over time, this place became one of the most beloved among Rostovites.  It is difficult to find a more beautiful place for walking.  Along the coast of Temernik (the right tributary of the Don) stretch over 200 hectares of garden land.  Its territory is divided into thematic zones, where 5,000 plants grow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.2r.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-2590891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2590891.jpg"></div><p>  The garden has a large collection of subtropical and tropical flora of Southeast Asia, Australia, North and South America.  A section of the Azov steppe will allow you to admire a small corner of the earth, not touched by human hands.  In the garden museum you can see a collection of seeds and a large herbarium. </p><p>  The complex has paths and an ecological trail for a two-hour walk.  Beautiful clearings are equipped with benches.  Walking around the territory, you can admire the leafy oaks, see the 300-year-old ‚Äúdinosaur tree‚Äù.  The Botanical Garden is not only a stunningly interesting place in Rostov-on-Don, but also a park area where you can take a lot of beautiful photos against a background of unique plants and unique landscapes. </p><h2>  Don Park </h2><p>  Among the most interesting places in Rostov-on-Don for family leisure is a water park.  The water and entertainment complex is located near the city, on the Salt Lake.  It was opened recently, in 2014.  In just a couple of years, he was so fond of locals and tourists that he was on the list of interesting places in Rostov-on-Don and the Rostov region.  The complex has 40 water slides and attractions, 4 pools of different sizes and shapes, two of which are heated, as well as a jacuzzi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rostovnadonu.bezformata.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Don Park" class="if uuid-2590893" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2590893.jpg"></div><p>  For children equipped with their own playground in the form of a pirate ship, all kinds of water slides in the form of your favorite characters and fountains.  The water park is so popular that about a thousand people visit it on the day. </p><p>  Two adult pools are of particular interest.  In one of them, you can splash around in large waves, and the second - a "slow river" is designed for rafting.  But most of the visitors are always on the slides.  The water park hosts festive events, weddings, celebrations and children's birthdays. </p><h2>  Dolphinarium </h2><p>  Another interesting place in Rostov-on-Don for a family visit is the dolphinarium.  The complex was opened in 2009 and consists of three pools, which are inhabited by representatives of the ocean. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vy-afisha.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolphinarium of the city" class="if uuid-2590900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2590900.jpg"></div><p>  The dolphinarium building itself was built during the USSR period.  It was the first in the whole country designed specifically for marine life.  Bright and colorful show programs allow you to have fun.  The dolphinarium is not only interesting for its views, but also for the opportunity to swim with dolphins. </p><h2>  Rostov Zoo </h2><p>  The Rostov Zoo is one of the most interesting places in Rostov-on-Don, as it is included in the lists of large establishments in Russia.  It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 50 hectares.  And his rich collection has more than five thousand individuals, among which 400 species are represented, including rare ones.  Of constant interest to visitors of all ages are three elephants, flamingos, white-tailed eagles, Japanese cranes and other inhabitants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Zoo" class="if uuid-2590903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2590903.jpg"></div><p>  The history of the zoo began in 1927 from a wildlife corner at the school.  And now the institution occupies a large area.  It is pleasant to walk along the alleys of the zoo, surrounded by flower beds and ponds, after viewing the enclosures. </p><h2>  Interesting places in Rostov-on-Don in winter </h2><p>  The city is very colorful and interesting in the warm season.  But in winter there is something to see.  When the weather is not good for walking along the street, you should pay attention to local museums and theaters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rnd.arriva.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Space Museum" class="if uuid-2590910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2590910.jpg"></div><p>  One of these places is the space museum, which belongs to the scientific and educational complex called "Vertical".  The institution is engaged in space research.  It is very popular among fans of the stellar worlds.  A visit to the museum leaves a lot of pleasant impressions.  Its exposition acquaints people with suits of astronauts and spacesuits, models of space technology, models of satellites and aircraft.  The museum funds also contain personal items of astronauts, books, photographs, awards, samples of food pilots.  Particular attention should be paid to the details of the Soyuz spacecraft, the instruments used by astronauts in their work in orbit of the earth. </p><h2>  Art Museum </h2><p>  The Museum of Fine Arts in Rostov-on-Don will acquaint visitors with the rich artistic heritage of the Don Region.  In addition, here you can see the world famous paintings.  In the first years of its existence, objects from the storerooms of the Tretyakov Gallery, the Russian Museum and the Hermitage were transferred to the museum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rnd.arriva.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Fine Arts" class="if uuid-2590914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2590914.jpg"></div><p>  Unfortunately, not all works have reached us.  During the war, all the most valuable was sent to Pyatigorsk for conservation, but it was on the way there that the Germans looted the collection.  Over time, some of the paintings were returned, but some were lost. </p><h2>  Drama theatre </h2><p>  Unusual appearance has a drama theater named after  Gorky in Rostov-on-Don.  It was built in the style of Soviet constructivism.  The first wooden hall was erected in 1863.  For the first time, Mikhail Schepkin performed on his stage, playing the role of a city manager in the immortal ‚ÄúExaminer‚Äù.  Twenty years later, a stone theater was built, which burned out shortly after the revolution.  And only fifteen years later, a new building was built, which the Nazis destroyed during the retreat.  But subsequently the theater was restored.  The institution's repertoire presents interesting performances for children and adults. </p>
