    <h2>  Short description </h2><p>  Cite is a quarter-square-kilometer island.  There are many ancient buildings, thanks to which the atmosphere of romance reigns in the air.  The island is connected by nine bridges to both banks of the Seine and the neighboring island of Saint-Louis.  According to the administrative division, Cit√© is included in the 1st and 4th municipal <span>districts of Paris.</span>  This division passes along the boulevard du Palais. </p><h2>  Notre Dame Cathedral </h2><p>  In the first century BC.  e.  the island was inhabited by tribes of the Gauls.  He later became part of the Roman Empire.  And at the beginning of the last millennium he began to actively build up.  These buildings still adorn the island of Cit√©.  Attractions are here at every turn.  The most famous building, perhaps not only of the island, but of the whole of Paris is the Notre Dame Cathedral, which was built for almost two centuries.  Its construction began in 1163.  Tourists from all over the world flock day and night to look at an example of a classic Gothic structure.  The cathedral had several construction managers, each seeking to add something of their own in order to perpetuate their own name.  It is in this building that many scenes from the famous novel by Victor Hugo's "Notre Dame de Paris" develop. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cite island photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1268628.jpg" width="503"></div>

She is one of the most beautiful Gothic buildings.  The structure is quite small in size.  The chapel was erected in the 13th century. </p><h2>  Palace of Justice </h2><p>  The civil building of the Palace of Justice is the largest building, occupying almost half of the island.  The construction was carried out over several centuries.  Looking at the building that adorns the island of Cite, you can see a mixture of architectural styles of different eras.  The court proceedings that took place at the Palace were of interest to a large circle of the French public.  And all because the defendants at different times included such famous personalities as the writer <span>Emil Zola, the</span> spy Mata Hari, who was sentenced to death in the courtroom, as well as many well-known French politicians and the military. </p>

Today it is a place of a large concentration of artists.  They offer tourists their work, there are also many souvenir dealers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Concierges are a building built as a castle for French kings.  Subsequently, it became a prison for many high-ranking noblemen.  Now the building is an architectural monument, there is a museum. </p><h2>  Climatic features </h2><p>  The climate and weather conditions of the Cit√© as a whole do not differ from the Paris average.  The coldest month is January.  But even at this time, the island of Cit√© delights citizens and guests with temperatures above zero.  July is considered the hottest month.  But the most favorable time for visiting Paris as a whole and its individual attractions is August.  The last summer month is not as hot as the middle of the season.  Along with this, August is a favorite time for holidays of indigenous Parisians.  This means that the population of the city is decreasing, and tourists can walk with great comfort around the various picturesque places of the island. </p><h2>  Some facts from the history of the island </h2><p>  The population of the island is just over 1,000 people.  Whereas a few centuries ago it was the most populated area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.  During the reign of Napoleon III, the destruction of residential buildings on the island.  This was done by order of Baron Osman, whom the emperor appointed prefect of the capital of France.  In search of a new home, the island of Cite left more than twenty thousand inhabitants.  While building up the city with new buildings, the baron did not forget about the tourists: he belonged to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãleaving the square not built up on all sides of Notre Dame Cathedral.  Now this building can be seen from different angles in all its splendor. </p>
