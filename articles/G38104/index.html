Even a novice craftswoman can make it on her own.  She just needs a hippo pattern, the necessary tools and materials, and step-by-step instructions. </p><h2>  Keychain or pendant: materials and tools </h2><p>  Today, many teenage girls hang cool stuffed animals toys on their backpacks.  You can make, for example, just such a charming pendant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.makerist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself hippo patterns" class="if uuid-3100078" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3100078.jpg"></div><p>  For work, a hippo pattern will be required. </p><p>  Still need will be: </p><ul><li>  fabric of three colors: dark gray, light gray, pink; </li><li>  felt-tip pen for fabric (self-disappearing); </li><li>  filler (synthetic winterizer, pieces of foam rubber, cotton wool); </li><li>  threads </li><li>  needle; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><h2>  How to make cutting pendants to a bag </h2><p>  This is the easiest option for making a do-it-yourself soft hippo toy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="hippo pattern toys" class="if uuid-3102833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3102833.jpg"></div><p>  Patterns of all details are transferred to the fabric.  No seam allowances are necessary.  The master must lay the parts as close as possible to each other so that there is as little space as possible between them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The body is covered with their dark gray fabric.  To work, you need two such details.  The spots, the muzzle cover and the nails are made of light gray fabric.  Pink will be the inside of the ears and nostrils.  Eyes make black. </p><p>  You can not cut out the eyes and nostrils, but draw them or sew buttons or beads on these places. </p><h2>  How to sew a hippopotamus </h2><p>  The pattern of parts is completed.  The moment of assembly of the product comes. </p><ol><li>  At first they work with the front half of the suspension.  Spots are sewn onto the back of the body.  You can make the applique with any seam: overcast or ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù if the fabric does not crumble. </li><li>  Then, the nostrils are sewn onto the patch.  A mouth is laid on it with a stalked seam. </li><li>  Now the finished patch is sewn onto the lower part of the muzzle.  You can make it flat - this option is suitable for completely inexperienced craftswomen.  But more sophisticated dressmakers can put a little filler between the pad and the base.  For this, the seam is not finished, leaving a small hole, but without cutting the thread.  A filler is stuffed through it.  Then the hole is sutured. </li><li>  The front of the body is decorated with pink details for the inside of the ears. </li><li>  It remains only to sew or embroider eyes. </li><li>  The rear half of the suspension is much easier to do.  On this item you only need to sew on the specks. </li><li>  Both halves of the pendant are connected face out.  The edges are sewn together with the already selected seam.  When a hole remains about a centimeter, sewing is temporarily stopped. </li><li>  Now you need to fill the filler inside the hippo.  After this, the hole is sutured. </li><li>  The final stage of the work is a patch of toenails.  To do this, each part is folded in half inside out and ironed. </li><li>  Then the nails need to be swept to the lower seam of each leg so that one half protrudes in front and the other behind the crafts. </li></ol><p>  You can stitch spots, nails, nostrils, the inner parts of the ears and stick them.  Then the time for crafts will take much less. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Flat hippo with moving legs </h2><p>  This version of the craft is already more complicated.  Here you will need to make separately the animal's face, head, trunk and four legs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a hippo pattern" class="if uuid-3104522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3104522.jpg"></div><p>  Pattern hippo toys and detailed instructions in the video will help to make this craft. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="UCPA-lmzadU" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=UCPA-lmzadU" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/8/4/7/14847.jpg"></div><h2>  Cutting out parts for a volumetric hippo toy </h2><p>  This manufacturing option is the most complex.  It is suitable for already experienced craftswomen.  But the result is a volumetric toy-hippo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.e-quilterscorner.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hippo pattern" class="if uuid-3100068" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3100068.jpg"></div><p>  Pattern of all parts is done with seam allowances. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Sidewall and back patterns" class="if uuid-3105375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3105375.jpg"></div><p>  The nuances of the pattern: </p><ol><li>  The pattern of the sides of the torso with legs is first superimposed on the material on one side and is surrounded by a felt-tip pen for fabric.  Then the pattern is turned over and circled again.  This is how asymmetric parts are obtained. </li><li>  The insert for the back is made according to the drawing with a red outline. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern details" class="if uuid-3104556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3104556.jpg"></div></li><li>  Detail of the tummy and tail is done in one copy.  Feet can be made of a fabric of a different color.  But ears are made in pairs.  Two parts from the base material will be required.  Two more are cut from a fabric of a different color.  They will be required for the design of the internal parts of the ears. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Patterns for the head" class="if uuid-3106187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3106187.jpg"></div></li><li>  Two parts are required for the top and bottom of the head.  The connecting strip between them is not given in full format in the drawing.  The pattern is applied to the fold of fabric with a dashed line.  All these details are cut out of the basic matter. </li><li>  The inside of the mouth needs to be cut out of red cloth, and the teeth - and dense white material, can be made of leather or its substitute. </li></ol><p>  When the pattern for the hippo toy is finished, you can start sewing. </p><h2>  Workshop for the production of hippo Moti </h2><p>  You can sew the toy inside out.  Then then you should turn out all the details there.  And you can sew on the front side with a stitch seam. </p><p>  Sequencing: </p><ol><li>  A part of the tummy with legs folded in half and either ironed or put a mark along the contour at the bend. </li><li>  One half is sewn with the lower part of one side of the trunk, and the second with the other. </li><li>  The free upper body must be stitched with a ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù stitch and pulled slightly. </li><li>  The insert in the back is sewn so that a hole remains in front. </li><li>  The tail is folded in half.  By hypotenuse, the triangle is stitched.  Attach the item to the back of the body. </li><li>  Now sew the feet to the lower part of the legs. </li><li>  The finished body is stuffed with filler. </li><li>  The connecting strip for the head is sewn to the top.  The edges of the part must coincide with the places marked with crosses in the drawing.  Before working along the edge of the strip, you need to pass a seam ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù.  Then the thread must be pulled a little thread.  This ensures the coincidence of the edges of the parts. </li><li>  The inside of the mouth is folded in half and ironed. </li><li>  The upper half is swept to the part that was just worked on, not forgetting to fix two teeth in the right places.  After this, the stitch is already sutured. </li><li>  Then the lower part of the head is sewn, not forgetting to tighten the edge of the connecting strip in the same way as they did with the upper.  The front will stitch with the inside of the mouth.  When sweeping parts, one should not forget about the hippo's lower teeth. </li><li>  The ears are stitched in pairs: one part is made of the main fabric, the second is made of a material of a different color.  You need to fix them on your head, slightly turning them inward. </li><li>  The hippo‚Äôs head is stuffed with filler and sewn to the body. </li></ol><p>  Using these workshops and patterns, you can make cute little animals as a gift or decorate your home with designer toys.  Hippos will also look charming as accessories on a purse or backpack, on a guitar or in the form of a keychain on keys. </p>
