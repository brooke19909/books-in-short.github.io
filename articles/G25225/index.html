Overview of cash management systems</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The cash register is a huge sector of tax and accounting, regulated by many provisions and extensive codes of practice.  All organizations and individual entrepreneurs who conduct settlements with counterparties using cash are required to comply with them.  Since various kinds of frauds are often found in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãaccounting, the control of cash transactions is becoming more and more complicated every year, toughened and modernized.  This article discusses the role of cash in the enterprise, the rules of conduct, as well as methods and systems for monitoring operations. </p><h2>  The role of cash in organizations and banks </h2><p>  The cash desk of the enterprise is necessary for organizations that receive and issue cash in cash.  The purpose of these operations can be any: the issuance of salaries to employees, travel expenses, office expenses, receiving payments from customers, settlements with suppliers.  All these actions must be carried out through the cash desk.  Control of cash operations is entrusted to the Tax Service. </p><p>  When the word "cashier" is used in a normal routine dialogue, the cash register itself appears before the eyes.  In fact, in organizations this is not only a computer technology.  The cash desk of an individual or legal entity is a whole system that includes an equipped cashier's workplace, software, the device itself, the availability of reporting, compliance with the limit and collection rules.  The specialist working on this site must also be properly registered. </p>

    <h2>  Rules for equipment premises </h2><p>  Control of cash operations begins with the requirements for the premises in which the cash desk itself is located.  Without proper equipment and equipment, as required by the rules and regulations of the Central Bank, the cash desk should not function.  Of course, not all organizations comply with the requirements.  This approach, firstly, can lead to fines, and secondly, it is dangerous for the funds and the employee who is liable for them.  Banking organizations must comply with all requirements without fail, otherwise they may be deprived of a license.  Below are the general requirements for equipping a cash register: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  The presence of only one door that closes from the inside.  The door lock must be reliable, in some cases, iron lintels and bolts, as well as padlocks are used so that it is impossible to crack the door from the outside. </li><li>  In the room there is a window for contacting customers, receiving and issuing funds.  The window should also close tightly and be equipped with a padlock.  By the way, the dimensions of the door and window are clearly regulated.  Deviation from the established sizes is allowed if the company has a security unit. </li><li>  The room should be equipped with metal cabinets.  They must be attached to the supporting structures of the building, so that they could not be carried out together with the interior parts to which they are screwed.  At the end of the working day, the cabinets are locked and sealed. </li><li>  Ventilation and windows must be securely closed and equipped with metal grilles. </li><li>  There should be two fire extinguishers in the room. </li><li>  The cash desk must be guarded by an alarm signaling from various protection loops to the local police station or security organization. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Cash desk procedure </h2><p>  Control of cash transactions implies a certain order of work.  Upon arrival at your workplace, the cashier‚Äôs primary responsibility is to check the integrity of the seals on the boxes and the safe, as well as to check for any signs of breaking and unauthorized entry into the room.  If no warning signs are found, you can get to work.  If there are signs of someone else's presence, you must immediately call the law enforcement authorities and ensure that the documents, equipment and furniture located in the cash register are inviolable before the employees arrive.  Check that disappeared from the scene can only be in the presence of police officers.  With them, the contents of the safe are recounted.  After inspecting the premises, an act is drawn up in four copies: one is for police officers, the second for an insurance company, the third for the company itself.  A fourth copy is needed if a parent organization exists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Access to the premises where the ticket office is located should be available only to the cashier, who is executed in accordance with all the requirements of the Central Bank and the TKRF, and to the authorities.  A set of keys intended for superiors should be sealed and stored in a safe place.  There should not be personal items of the cashier in the cash register premises.  There is only what belongs to the business organization. </p><p>  There are also requirements for the amount of cash that can be stored at the organization‚Äôs cash desk.  It is necessary to calculate in advance and document in the relevant acts the limit of funds, over which there should be no cash at the cash desk at the end of the working day.  To maintain the limit, a special operation is carried out - collection, which means that specialized transport with reliable security transports funds to the bank.  Small branches of the bank collect their funds in the main vaults, and organizations - in the bank with which they have concluded a service and maintenance agreement.  The cash limit can be violated only within three days, when salaries are issued to employees of the organization. </p>

    <h2>  Cash withdrawal procedure </h2><p>  Control of cash operations of the bank and organizations is based on a clear regulation of recording all actions with cash.  All operations are properly documented and reflected in various types of business accounting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The control system of cash transactions involves the reflection of all manipulations with cash using <span>credit and debit cash warrants,</span> advance reports, checks and acts on used cash issued under the report.  All transactions are recorded in the cash book.  At the end of the working day, a report is prepared with the attached final fiscal receipts printed from the cash register. </p><p>  All cash withdrawal operations must be confirmed by expenditure cash warrants signed by the person to whom they were issued.  In the accounting program, in the comments, the purpose of the issue is driven in.  Advance payments and payments under the report must then be confirmed by checks, acts of work performed or services received.  The issuance of wages is also confirmed by an expenditure cash warrant, as well as a payroll sheet. </p><p>  Control of cash and settlement transactions categorically prohibits the issuance of funds intended for one person against the signature of another. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cash control" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2130413.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Cashier Rules </h2><p>  Accounting and control of cash transactions is primarily assigned to a specialist called a "cashier".  In organizations with a small state, the following officials can play its role: </p><ul><li>  Chief Accountant. </li><li>  Accountant for a specific site. </li><li>  Any employee with special knowledge and skills. </li></ul><p>  A prerequisite for all officials acting as a cashier (even part-time) is an agreement on full material liability.  If it is decided to make the manager or accountant a cashier, then it must always be the same person.  If he goes on sick leave or on vacation, he is replaced by another employee specified in the order of the head, and also signed a new liability agreement.  In addition, it is necessary to draw up an act of reception and transmission of material values.  In the process of its compilation, cash is counted, the condition of the equipment is checked, and all documents are present in the presence of the commission.  A commission is a group of people of at least three people.  Most often, it includes the chief accountant and management.  The act is drawn up in triplicate. </p><p>  When registering a cashier, a sample of his signature is transferred to the organization‚Äôs serving bank or head office of the bank.  That she should stand on all documents relating to the work of the cash register. </p><p>  Before applying for a job, an applicant applying for a cashier position must be carefully checked for any unpleasant precedents in work.  His documents and photograph are transferred to the security service or request information from law enforcement agencies.  Now the Internet is a good helper for the employer in this matter.  There are many databases in which organizations share information on laid-off employees who have committed unlawful acts at the workplace. </p><p>  It is not recommended to allow people with alcohol and drug addiction, past convictions, public order violators, or various mental illnesses to work with the cash register. </p>

    <h2>  Control cash register operations </h2><p>  The correctness of the design and availability of all documents is an indispensable requirement of the Central Bank, the servicing bank, the tax service and other control bodies.  Financial control of cash transactions can be carried out unscheduled, with a warning, with the seizure of documentation and cash equipment.  Many organizations, especially financial institutions, practice planned <span>internal audit of the</span> cash desk.  In this case, a commission is assembled consisting of its own competent employees in this matter, or a special audit company is hired, which carries out all the checks on a professional level and issues a report on malfunctions, discrepancies in cash desk operations and documentation. </p><p>  Field and other types of inspections may affect employment contracts, liability, personal data of employees, the state of cash documents, the correctness and regularity of their maintenance, fiscal memory of the cash register, equipment and equipment of the cash register premises, reflection of transactions, their validity in accounting, business and tax accounting. </p>

    <h2>  Cash registers </h2><p>  The list of equipment for controlling cash operations includes a specialized cash register.  You can‚Äôt buy one in ordinary equipment stores.  Unlike a printer, fax, calculating machine, and other office equipment, KKM can be sold only to organizations that have received a special license for this.  As a rule, the same organizations serve the computing devices.  Each cash register must be registered with the tax office.  A special memory device constantly records all operations performed by the cashier with the device.  Further, these testimonies are transferred to the tax service for verification with the submitted reports of the enterprise.  All breakdowns, repairs, write-offs of the cash register must also be notified to the tax office. </p><p>  All legal entities (enterprises) that accept cash from customers are required to work with the cash register.  Only individual entrepreneurs can be exempted from using KKM.  They have the right to write checks manually, certifying their authenticity with their own seal.  But even such relief does not affect all entrepreneurs.  Some activities require only the use of cash registers. </p><h2>  Cash management control </h2><p>  In addition to verification by external services, internal verification is required.  The cash desk rules provide for the following schedule of scheduled inspections: before the submission of the annual report, before the submission of the quarterly reports, in cases where the financially responsible person who worked with this cash desk changes.  The cash desk and cash operations are also monitored if the employee was suspected of dishonesty, the facts of theft or fraud were revealed, the amount of cash does not correspond to that reflected in the documents. </p><p>  The management of some organizations adheres to a policy of frequent unscheduled inspections so that employees are not tempted to take advantage of their official position and close contact with cash.  A special commission is appointed for each audit, each time consisting of different people who are not related to the formation of the contents of the cash desk.  The composition of the commission is fixed in the act of verification.  Often the process itself is accompanied by a video recording. </p><h2>  Features of bank cash transactions </h2><p>  The <span>bank‚Äôs</span> cash management system implies a more complex configuration.  In the departments of financial organizations, several levels of verification are carried out by different specialists.  Since the money flowing through the bank is much greater than in ordinary organizations, the complexity and increased requirements for the control system are justified.  Despite the fact that every year they try to automate all operations in banks, at least two employees are required who are responsible for the correctness of operations: the cashier-operator and the head of the cashier.  The first performs operations during the working day, the second gives an advance amount, takes and calculates the balances, fills in cash documents, collects funds in excess of the cash desk limit, and exercises daily control at the primary level. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cash register control" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2130414.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Cash control and other cash management systems </h2><p>  Increasingly, control over cash transactions is carried out using the latest technology.  Their meaning lies in the video recording of the actions of the cashier, client, as well as data from the fiscal memory of cash register equipment.  These data allow us to prove illegal actions, fraud, theft and other fraud.  In court, this video will be undeniable evidence, since it is no longer possible to change the combined evidence of two sources. </p><p>  Cash Control - a cash register control system consisting of a cash register, high-resolution color video cameras, a video server, a program that synchronizes camera footage with the text of the cash register, as well as a remote workstation for a security specialist.  There are many similar systems on the market at the moment.  All of them are based on the same way of working, having differences in functionality, cost, development and methods of connection and analysis.  Among them, the following control systems can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  DIT-POS - the cost depends on the server settings, connects up to 16 cash registers, comprehensively stores video and text information. </li><li>  The POS inspector is a Russian development, costs about 6,000 rubles, has the function of searching for operations by check parameters. </li><li>  POS-intellect is also a Russian development, it is distinguished by the ability to integrate with various trading systems, the text on the video is not just superimposed, but integrated programmatically, the search for video fragments is performed automatically. </li><li>  CHEKTV is another Russian development with the ability to integrate with cash registers and trading systems, with a universal video recording system, software integration of text and video, with the possibility of hardware data analysis and automatic search for fragments. </li></ul>
