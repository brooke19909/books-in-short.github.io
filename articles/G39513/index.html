Hippies rediscovered its beauty, making this island a kind of mecca for its movement.  The beautiful beaches of Goa considered it their duty to visit everyone who was devoted to the spirit of personal freedom in the world of politicians and officials. </p><p>  After a while, travel agencies learned about the exotic island, which created a ‚Äúboom‚Äù in the construction of hotels and the development of its infrastructure.  Hotel Ticlo Resort 2 * is located in the famous city of Calangute, which has become a significant tourist center on the north coast of Goa. </p><h2>  Calangute </h2><p>  Formerly a small fishing village before hippies arrived, Calangute gradually became a popular holiday destination not only among them, but also among travelers from all over the world.  The tourist <span>season in Goa</span> lasts from November to February, when the rainy season stops, and the air temperature +31 degrees is comfortable for residents from any part of the world. </p>

    <p>  The construction of the coast by hotels, as well as the improvement of the world-famous Calangute beach, has led to the fact that today it is the most visited tourist state of <span>India.</span>  <span>Hotel</span> Ticlo Resort 2 * is located on the second line from the beach, but it is well known to those who prefer a relaxing family holiday away from beach parties.  A distance of 400 meters from the coastline is not an obstacle to the entertainment of youth, so the democratic prices at this hotel open the doors to the ‚Äúdescendants‚Äù of hippies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to the price, Ticlo Resort 2 * attracts tourists with its location. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Usually the most advantageous location for a hotel is its close proximity to the airport and the beach.  Although it is only 18 km from Calangute to the capital city of Panaji, the journey from the international airport will take about 40 minutes. </p><p>  Ticlo Resort 2 *, reviews of which are only positive, is located in the very center of the town, which allows its guests to choose where to go again to sunbathe or have fun.  The path to the sea, amounting to just over 400 m, may seem quite long to sophisticated and capricious tourists, but the beach itself is so famous for its infrastructure around the world that you can spend 10 minutes to reach it.  It should be noted that this ‚Äúdrawback‚Äù of the hotel is fully compensated by the cost of living in it, and the most enterprising visitors rent a scooter and explore all the beaches of Goa. </p><p>  A feature of Ticlo Resort 2 * (Calangute) is a public beach on which every vacationer can find something to their liking. </p><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  The hotel is a separate 4-story building with a crescent moon enveloping the pools located in the courtyard. </p><p>  It welcomes guests with friendly and unobtrusive staff, always ready to help and answer all questions.  By the scale of Goa, Ticlo Resort 2 * is a large hotel, as it has 100 rooms located in 3 blocks.  In each room, guests expect: </p><ul><li>  comfortable upholstered furniture; </li><li>  TV with satellite television; </li><li>  air conditioning or ceiling fan; </li><li>  stocked with a refreshing and alcoholic drinks paid minibar; </li><li>  shower, toilet, washbasin and hairdryer; </li><li>  utensils for making tea and coffee. </li></ul>
