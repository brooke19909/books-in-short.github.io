  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Sigma", Irkutsk: address, delivery dates and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many believe that modern technologies and innovations in real estate have reached only the central regions of our country, but even in its remote corners there are unique projects from local construction companies and architects.  Irkutsk is a huge city, a real attraction, but at the same time a place with a rather severe climate.  That is why its residents no less than the rest need high-quality modern housing.  Increasingly, people give preference to spacious bright apartments in prestigious areas of the city, so as part of this material we want to bring to your attention Sigma residential complex (Irkutsk), clarify living conditions, apartment layouts, get acquainted with the feedback from the first real estate investors and the conditions for acquiring the cherished square meters. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  If you are looking for modern housing near the center of Irkutsk, in an area with developed infrastructure, you should definitely pay attention to the Sigma residential complex (Irkutsk).  14 block sections built using unique technologies and high-quality materials, own underground parking, well-maintained green courtyards with a closed territory - this is what every shareholder will receive.  Construction is carried out in several stages, but due to the use of advanced technologies, it is possible to rent apartments ahead of schedule.  The project is definitely worthwhile, interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sigma-jsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd sigma irkutsk" class="if uuid-3196549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3196549.jpg"></div><p>  Another thing is the opinion of those who have already received the keys to the coveted apartment.  As part of this material, we will also focus on the feedback of residents, which will allow us to objectively evaluate the review. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Apartments in Irkutsk, LCD "Sigma" in particular, are being built in one of the most prestigious areas of the city, the scientific and cultural center - Akademgorodok, which definitely leaves a mark on the way of life.  Libraries, schools, including those with in-depth study of foreign languages, universities, sports stadiums - there is no shortage of educational institutions.  The contingent of residents, represented mainly by professors, teachers, scientists, turns the district into a quiet, calm and comfortable place to live. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sigma38.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apartments in irkutsk lcd sigma" class="if uuid-3196551" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3196551.jpg"></div><p>  Literally across the road from the complex there is a picturesque promenade and a sports park where you can not only have a great time in the fresh air, but also do your favorite sports. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  No matter how modern and promising the project may be, its implementation is possible only under the supervision of an experienced construction company.  The developer of the Sigma residential complex (Irkutsk) is a company of the same name - ZhSK Sigma.  She is quite famous in the region and has already managed to pass several excellent modern complexes.  Speaking about the basic principles of construction, first of all I want to note the high-tech of each object, attention to detail, spacious apartments and a variety of planning solutions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Sigma residential complex (Irkutsk, Akademgorodok) is an excellent option for those who want to buy an apartment in an area with developed infrastructure and are certainly not ready to wait until the first kindergarten or school is built.  Responses of residents - confirmation that there is everything necessary for a full and comfortable life.  Polyclinics, kindergartens, educational institutions of various levels, including the most prestigious universities of the city, shops, shopping centers, service organizations are at your service.  Within walking distance there is an excellent sports park and numerous equipped sports fields. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irkutsk.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd sigma reviews irkutsk" class="if uuid-3196554" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3196554.jpg"></div><p>  In September 2018, a new school with a planetarium opened in the district - the pride of Akademgorodok. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  If you look at the photo of the Sigma residential complex (Irkutsk), you will see that it is in close proximity to the new Academic Bridge.  Soon a separate exit will be organized on it, which means that you can get to any point in the city in a personal car in 30-40 minutes.  For all car owners, an underground heated parking is equipped with a sufficient number of parking spaces.  In addition, there is a gas station and car wash nearby. </p><p>  The lack of a personal car is not a problem, because next to the complex is a public transport stop, from where you can get to any point in Irkutsk.  There are so many routes that you will definitely not feel discomfort in your movements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="irkutsk.superrielt.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Sigma Irkutsk buy an apartment from the builder" class="if uuid-3196560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3196560.jpg"></div><h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  Despite the developed infrastructure of the district and the availability of a sufficient number of sports and playgrounds, the developer decided to maximize the landscaping of the surrounding area.  The yards turned out to be spacious and bright, and due to the underground parking it was possible to isolate them from the through traffic of cars.  There are playgrounds equipped with modern technologies in the field of child development.  In addition, the whole territory is landscaped, flower beds and flowerbeds are broken, places for walking and recreation are organized.  Residents confirm that the windows of the new apartments offer stunning views of the river, the city and its attractions. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  If you value spaciousness and comfort in real estate, you should pay special attention to the Sigma residential complex (Irkutsk).  Many people really dream of buying an apartment from a developer in such a picturesque and landscaped area.  The reviews of the first residents of new buildings confirm the variety of layouts - there is an opportunity to choose the best option for each family. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yuga-build.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="developer lcd sigma irkutsk" class="if uuid-3196559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3196559.jpg"></div><p>  The developer relies on European technology and vision when planning a living space.  That is how spacious kitchens, additional bathrooms, a wardrobe appeared.  The space is organized in such a way that it is possible to use every square meter of area. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The cost per square meter is an important component of each property.  Sometimes, understanding all the advantages of a project, we simply can not afford it.  The cost of apartments in the Sigma residential complex (Irkutsk) starts from 3.6 million rubles for a one-room apartment of 50 square meters. </p><h2>  Terms of purchase </h2><p>  At the moment, the apartment can be purchased for cash, the developer offers installment payments until the moment of delivery of the object, as well as a mortgage from the largest partner banks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.irk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Sigma Irkutsk Akademgorodok" class="if uuid-3196563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3196563.jpg"></div><h2>  Residents reviews </h2><p>  What can fully characterize the project of the Sigma residential complex (Irkutsk)?  The reviews of the first residents allow us to identify the real advantages and possible disadvantages of the complex. </p><p>  So, the construction project, judging by the reviews, is worthy and attractive.  The first apartments have already been commissioned and settled, which means there is already the basis for further discussions on the project. </p><p>  The first drawback discovered was that after torrential rains the upper floors of commissioned buildings were wet, water seeped into the underground parking, causing a real flood.  Naturally, in the flooded apartments, plaster began to fall off from the ceiling and walls.  This suggests that during the construction process mistakes were made that would have to be corrected by unscrupulous builders. </p><p>  In general, the construction of new buildings also proceeds not without flaws: equity holders complain about cracks on the walls, the presence of fungus, bumps - all this is the result of a neglected attitude.  The developer will have to make a lot of efforts in order to eliminate all the shortcomings in the shortest time period, otherwise he will face huge problems and financial losses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fotostroek.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Sigma Irkutsk photo" class="if uuid-3196565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3196565.jpg"></div><p>  The rest of the complex is excellent - its location pleases, the presence of all the necessary infrastructure facilities, proximity to the river and a huge sports park, where each family member can have a great time and relax. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Sigma residential complex (Irkutsk) is an excellent modern project, but when choosing an apartment to start, visit the facility itself, get acquainted with the stages of work, technologies, talk with residents in order to further protect yourself and your household from spills, cracks and other unpleasant situations.  And remember that the quick surrender of the house, which is characteristic of this developer, does not always happen with the observance of all technologies. </p><p>  Now the developer offers excellent conditions for acquiring apartments in buildings under construction, and if you have not decided on your choice yet, welcome to the tour! </p>
