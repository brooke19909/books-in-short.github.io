In this case, the salary of a novice economist will not be high, and the first years should be spent on improving your reputation, collecting recommendations in order to subsequently claim higher wages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For graduates, as well as those who have not yet graduated from high school, there is a great opportunity: to get the position of ‚Äúassistant economist‚Äù.  He is subordinate to the economist of the company and assists him in organizing work, which is often monotonous.  Applicants with secondary specialized specialized education can also apply for this place.  Assistant duties may include: </p><ul><li>  reception and shipment of goods; </li><li>  making changes to the accounting program; </li><li>  entering information into the database; </li><li>  reporting (one-time, permanent); </li><li>  reconciliation with suppliers; </li><li>  conducting telephone conversations, business correspondence; </li><li>  execution of contracts and development of templates; </li><li>  any other assistance in the preparation of financial documents. </li></ul>

    <p>  Recently, the position of Manager-Economist has become widespread, the salary of which is due to the fulfillment of the duties of an economist and manager and, as a rule, can be quite high.  The competence of this specialist includes analysis of the state of the organization, participation in managerial, production, economic, marketing, entrepreneurial spheres, engaging in exchange and auditing activities. </p><h2>  Budget Organization Economist </h2><p>  If an economist works in a non-profit structure, in some cases he can count on an increase in the salary of state employees along with all other employees of the institution.  Such an employee, as a rule, is subordinate to the chief accountant.  In addition to the standard ones, his job descriptions also include mandatory knowledge of the norms of the sphere in which the institution is located (housing and communal services, hospital, cultural department, etc.).  The salary of an economist will depend on the availability of categories and categories.  A graduate with no work experience is formalized by a 6th grade specialist (primary).  The longer the length of service in the post, the higher the rank (but at least three years must pass to increase).  The accrual of categories also begins after three years of work in this organization.  The highest category of budget economist is 11th, which corresponds to the level of the category "Leading Specialist". </p>

    <h2>  Applicants for the position </h2><p>  According to studies, in most cases, economists are women (78%).  Sociologists and psychologists call the monotonous nature of the work as a possible reason.  It is believed that women better than men cope with such activities.  At the level of assumptions, some researchers also provide another explanation for this phenomenon.  Sometimes unscrupulous managers deliberately underestimate the level of wages in the financial sphere, and more women than men agree to it.  In addition, it is necessary to take into account the high competition among graduates of this area, the low starting pay for work and the need to accept a job as an ‚Äúassistant economist‚Äù, which may not appeal to some members of the stronger sex. </p><h2>  Summary factors affecting the patch </h2><p>  The salary of an economist is made up of some components.  Specialists can apply for high wages: in large cities, with seniority, additional skills and abilities, working in commercial companies, involved in the construction industry, and having a diploma from prestigious educational institutions.  The salary of a non-profit economist depends on his categories and categories.  In addition, it affects the increase in salaries of state employees at the federal or regional level. </p>
