    <p>  But even today not all children and adults know how to make a ship out of paper.  There are several ways that you can quickly make any model from a regular sheet of paper. </p><h2>  The first option is the easiest </h2><p>  We will now tell you how to make a ship out of paper.  You need to fold the sheet in half to make a rectangle, mentally find the middle of the fold and wrap both edges so that it makes a triangle.  Next, you need to bend both lower edges of the rectangle up, each on its own side.  Now bend in this way the ends together and tuck into each other.  It will turn out a rhombus.  Raise its lower corner.  Turn the boat over to the other side and do the same.  The result is a triangle.  Its two sharp corners need to be lifted up and folded in the center.  And again in the hands of a paper rhombus.  Carefully pulling the edges of the figure, they should be moved apart and a boat formed.  Now it remains to add volume for stability and can be floated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper ship models" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/484444.jpg" width="480"></div></h2><h2>  Another variant </h2><p>  The next version of a paper boat is not so well known.  The model is more original and stands out against the general background of simple little boats.  So, how to make a ship out of paper?  You need to take a square sheet and fold along the diagonals to indicate the folds.  Then re-deploy and bend the upper corner towards the center. </p>

    <p>  Then raise the tip up and bend the corner of the resulting small triangle down again.  Now fold the entire figure along diagonally.  Unscrew and lower both sides.  The result was not just a boat, but a real boat.  It remains only to paint the board and draw windows. </p><h2>  Interesting model </h2><p>  The top skill for the baby is to make a boat with two sails.  To do this, take a square sheet of paper and fold in half twice.  Then, the resulting square should bend the upper left corner and lower right to the center.  After which the figure is again folded in half.  The resulting rectangle is mentally divided into two squares - left and right.  Fold a triangle on the left side, bending the apex to the center, and bend the corner to the right and up.  Side wings fold down on both sides.  In the resulting rhombus, wrap the right triangle down and bring it back up, but with a depth of 1 cm. Wrap the bottom corner inward. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Having mastered the simplest techniques, you can build a ship from modules.  This craft can not be allowed to sail, but it is perfect as a gift to a friend. </p><p>  In kindergartens and elementary grades, children are happy to make boats in the form <span>of colored paper applications.</span>  Many samples can be found in children's books and magazines.  During classes, the child can talk about different <span>types of ships</span> and invite him to make them to choose from.  Thus, over time, you get a whole collection of applications. </p><h2>  How to make a ship out of paper and improvised materials? </h2><p>  But the most interesting type of home shipbuilding is the manufacture of models from improvised means - matchboxes, toilet paper rolls, walnut shells.  Everything that the fantasy prompts is suitable here.  To make the simplest boat, you will need three matchboxes, a cocktail tube, colored paper, glue, a sheet of cardboard and felt-tip pens.  The skeleton of the ship must be formed of three boxes - two glued together, and a third glued to them on top. </p><p>  While they are drying, you can cut the stern out of colored paper - a strip whose width is equal in height to the first two glued boxes.  The third box should rise above it in the form of a captain‚Äôs bridge.  When cutting a strip, you need to remember that it should be several centimeters longer, since it will have to form another bow of the ship.  Having glued the boxes and making a nose, the workpiece should be turned over and the bottom should be glued from thick cardboard. </p><p>  Now you can start making sails.  To do this, put on a paper cocktail two paper sails, previously painted with felt-tip pens.  They can be either the same or different sizes.  Glue the flag on top and fix the finished structure in the upper match box. </p>
