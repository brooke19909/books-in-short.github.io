    <p>  The very <span>concept of culture</span> cannot be described as a separate object.  This is a completely abstract meaning, which is a designation of different aspects of <span>social relations, the</span> nature of a person and his lifestyle.  The term "culture" has several meanings.  Most often it began to be used from the beginning of the twentieth century.  For this, many different prerequisites have arisen. </p><p>  First of all, this was necessary in order to systematize many factors that characterized <span>cultural values</span> and norms, certain aspects of social life.  In the modern world, the concept of culture has different meanings.  It has found wide application in designating the level of human behavior.  Here, the term "culture" carries an estimated meaning.  Such qualities as reliability, consciousness, accuracy, etc. are associated with it. </p><p>  Certain lifestyles are associated with this term.  For example, urban <span>life, level of</span> education, upbringing.  It also includes the ability to understand art, literature, the presence of philosophical knowledge and other skills. </p><p>  The term ‚Äúculture‚Äù also depends on a specific scope.  For example, it may be limited to some institution (theater, library, etc.). In this case, the family, economic structures, and the state are not included in this concept. </p><p>  But culture cannot be described as an object completely subordinate to human activity and reason.  It is a consequence of the existence of people and includes some objects of his labor.  This process does not always have reasonable and meaningful motives. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The term "culture" is understood as follows: </p><p>  1. This is a manifestation of the spiritual and <span>universal values</span> inherent in man. </p><p>  2. The level of development of the individual and the society in which he lives.  It can be expressed in ways of organizing life, activity and those values ‚Äã‚Äãthat it creates. </p><p>  3. The whole creative potential of mankind. </p><p>  4. All information that is inherited at the genetic level and manifests itself in the behavior of individuals. </p><p>  5. This is human behavior that is not of biological origin. </p><p>  6. The level of development in the field of art and sciences. </p><p>  This is how some sources characterize the term ‚Äúculture‚Äù. </p><p>  Initially (in antiquity), it denoted methods of cultivating the land and agriculture as a whole.  With the improvement of skills, improvement of living standards and the development of social relations, there was an increase in cultural values.  This concept is associated with human activity aimed at <span>creation.</span>  <span>This is the</span> material side. </p><p>  Then this value began to be used to indicate the level of education, enlightenment or education.  In this case, culture acquires a spiritual side.  All its directions are interconnected. </p><p>  We can distinguish the main properties of culture: </p><p>  Firstly, it is necessarily associated with human activities and is subject to social laws.  For her are inherent and their own laws. </p><p>  Secondly, the object and subject of culture is man. </p><p>  Thirdly, it unites all aspects of people's life and it cannot be attributed to any particular area. </p><p>  And last, it characterizes the qualitative side of society. </p><p>  The main <span>functions of culture</span> are to transform society, increase its level of education.  Culture also has aesthetic value.  Its components instill in people the concept of fine and high art. </p><p>  Culture can be called the keeper of centuries-old knowledge, experience, tools and other consequences of the activities of people that accumulate from generation to generation.  This is not only the activity itself, but also the relationships that arise as a result of its implementation.  This includes economic, political, moral and other factors. </p>
