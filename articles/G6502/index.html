    <h2>  LG D724 </h2><p>  Perhaps we will start with you with a little non-standard manufacturer.  The thing is that you can pay attention to the model called LG D724.  This trading company a few years ago was not very trusted.  But now everything has changed.  And "AlGi" offers a beautiful smartphone in a metal case.  What are the main characteristics he possesses? </p><p>  For example, the screen size of the device is 5 inches.  Quite a normal indicator for a modern phone.  Resolution is also worthy of respect - 1280 by 720 pixels.  There is a special <span>protective glass.</span>  The battery of the model is quite capacious - 2540 mAh.  With active use, the device lasts approximately 4 days.  The rear camera is 8 megapixels.  This allows you to take pretty good pictures.  The operating system here is well known to everyone - "Android 4.4."  So, you will have access to entire streams of different games and applications.  The RAM in this phone, however, is not good - only 1 GB.  But the processor is good - 1.2 GHz on 4 cores.  In principle, the LG smartphone in the metal case of this ‚Äúversion‚Äù is perfect for work and study.  It costs not so much - from 10 to 12 thousand rubles.  Sometimes you can find cheaper.  Only here, for the same amount, everyone has the opportunity to purchase not only the LG D724, but more powerful models.  By the way, "AlGi" with 2 SIM cards works just fine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Keneksi crystals </h2><p>  And here is another very good smartphone in a metal case.  True, in the Russian market he has not yet had time to establish himself.  It's about Keneksi Crystall.  This is a budget smartphone that is perfect for both study and work.  As a gaming phone, he is not very.  And in its characteristics, it somewhat resembles the previous model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone in a metal case" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/975804.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The diagonal of the display here is a bit larger - 5.5 inches.  But the battery is also 2500 mAh.  True, as practice shows, Keneksi Crystall works longer for a day in the mode of active use.  That is, with it you can count on 5 days of work without recharging.  To be honest, the option is very good.  The camera here is frontal at 2 megapixels, and the rear - at 8. The pictures are quite beautiful, bright and clear.  Among other things, there is a more powerful processor.  It is also on 4 cores, but with a frequency of 1.3 GHz each.  RAM is similar to LG D724.  It is possible to connect an additional memory card to the phone.  The version of the operating system, one might say, is slightly outdated - "Android", but not 4.4, <span>but 4.2.</span>  In principle, it is suitable for work and some entertainment.  If desired, you can update the system.  Keneksi Crystall is a beautiful smartphone with a metal case, which allows you to simultaneously use 2 SIM cards.  True, if you use different mobile operators, then small glitches may occur.  No one is safe from this.  But if you take into account the cost of the device - about 6,000, then you can come to terms with this feature.  After all, owners usually try to use the same mobile operators.  This minimizes negative consequences.  Perhaps, Keneksi Crystall is a smartphone with a metal case that will delight schoolchildren and students.  It is well suited for learning. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Qumo Quest 507 </h2><p>  Next, we again have a not quite familiar manufacturer.  If you do not like Keneksi, but want to purchase a non-standard thin smartphone in a metal case at a low cost, then you should pay attention to the Qumo Quest 507. To be honest, this is also not quite a gaming phone.  And he differs from his predecessors on our list a little.  Perhaps the main differences here are manufacturer and design.  For the rest, we can say that Qumo Quest 507, for example, is an analogue of "Kenexi". <strong><br></strong> </p><p>  To begin with, the average screen here is only 5 inches diagonally.  And there are two cameras.  The rear is 8 megapixels and the ‚Äúfront‚Äù is 2. The screen resolution is average by modern standards - 980 by 540 pixels.  In excellent quality videos do not see.  And movies too.  But for work / study this is usually enough.  The processor is similar to the Keneksi model - the same 4 cores at 1.3 GHz.  Such a device weighs quite a lot - 144 grams.  With 2 SIM cards, the phone works great.  That is what he attracted attention to himself.  The battery, in truth, is less capacious here - 1700 mAh.  But it works no worse than in all previous versions.  In standby mode, you can expect a month of work, and with constant use of the device - for 4-5 days.  This smartphone is charged (metal case, 2 SIM cards) pretty quickly - literally in an hour.  This allows you to always stay in touch.  Such a model costs 8400 rubles.  Not so expensive when compared with some analogues.  Nevertheless, reviews say that the Qumo Quest 507 works better than the same "Kenexi". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thin smartphone in a metal case" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/975803.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Asus ZenFone 2 </h2><p>  And now, most likely, the next manufacturer will be familiar to many.  A <span>thin smartphone</span> in a metal case from Asus is considered very good.  And it's called ZenFone 2. This is a more powerful model.  It differs from the previous ones in many ways.  Of course, this also affects the price.  But it's no secret that Asus produces only high-quality devices.  And phones as well. </p><p>  The screen size of the Asus ZenFone 2 is exactly the same as that of most analogs - 5.5 inches.  It is quite acceptable for Internet surfing, and for games, and for reading.  In addition, the display is protected by a special glass.  The resolution is high - 1920 by 1080 pixels.  This allows you to watch movies in high quality directly on your mobile phone.  There is only one camera, but it shoots beautifully.  The buyer will be offered as much as 13 megapixels.  The processor at Asus ZenFone 2 is the most powerful of all the options considered earlier.  In it, as in most models, 4 cores.  But their frequency pleases - 1.8 GHz.  RAM is 2 GB.  We can say that we already have a gaming phone to some extent.  The ability to connect 2 SIM cards allows you to work with several mobile operators without failures and malfunctions.  Even if you are called at the same time on both SIM cards. </p><p>  The battery pleases everyone with its capacity of 3000 mAh.  To be honest, the best battery has not yet been invented.  Such a device will work for about a week without recharging.  And in standby mode, about 2 months.  Very comfortable and practical.  The operating system is also familiar and familiar to everyone - "Android 4.4."  And the price can be different - from 13 thousand rubles to 19850. Depending on the place of your residence.  Nevertheless, having bought Asus ZenFone 2, you definitely will not regret it.  This is a really worthy smartphone with a metal body, as well as a good battery and with 2 SIM cards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphones with metal casing and powerful battery" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/975802.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Huawei P8 Lite </h2><p>  Next, you can buy a Huawei P8 Lite.  This is a phone that is similar to Asus.  But only with some significant differences.  It is believed that this model is a game.  So, it attracts the attention of consumers more. </p><p>  As in many cases, the screen of the device is acceptable for the game - 5 inches diagonally.  In addition, it conveys up to 16 million colors.  And even in sunny weather you will see a bright and clear image.  In addition, smartphones with a metal case and a powerful battery, as a rule, have far from the best characteristics in the field of processor and RAM.  But not in our case.  After all, Huawei P8 Lite is equipped with an octa-core processor at 1.2 GHz, as well as 2 GB of RAM.  This allows you to launch many new games and applications.  However, sometimes buyers claim that it would be possible to make more RAM for such a smartphone.  The average battery capacity is 2200 mAh.  But to work without recharging, the Huawei P8 Lite is capable of approximately 72 hours.  And this is provided that you will actively play on it. </p><p>  The cost of the device pleases.  Huawei P8 Lite will cost the buyer 15500 rubles.  For such a smartphone, this is a normal price.  Yes, some models can be found cheaper.  But they will not give such quality as Huawei P8 Lite.  In addition, with several SIM cards it works quite well.  You can say, on a par with Asus. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy S6 </h2><p>  There is even a Samsung smartphone in a metal case.  Perhaps this is the manufacturer most often offers customers similar offers.  So, pay attention to the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S6 model.  She really deserves attention in many ways.  But it‚Äôs only worth being prepared for the appropriate price of the device.  It is quite high - about 30-35 thousand rubles.  But sometimes this is nothing compared to the capabilities that the phone gives its owner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best smartphones in a metal case" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/975801.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In our case, a screen diagonal of 5.1 inches will be offered.  In addition, it is in this version that there is the possibility of connecting a SIM card of the Nano format.  There are two cameras of 5 megapixels.  But they are not particularly pleasing to buyers.  After all, the rear camera with 5 megapixels shoots not in the best quality.  For the front, this is more than enough, but not for the main one.  The processor and RAM are also noteworthy.  8 cores of 1.5 GHz and 3 GB of "system space".  Perhaps the <span>Samsung Galaxy S6</span> has every right to be called a gaming one.  Among other things, there is quite a lot of data here - 32 GB.  Also, this smartphone (metal case, 2 SIM cards) is considered from the latest generation of devices.  So, there is a 4G connection.  It allows you to use high speed internet.  And all this is fast, high quality and reliable.  The phone‚Äôs operating system is Android 4.4.  Battery 2500 mAh  It works, however, it is not as good as we would like.  With constant use of the phone, you can expect about 3 days of work.  There are no complaints in standby mode - the device will last exactly 30 days. </p><h2>  Lenovo S90 </h2><p>  Another worthy option is the Lenovo smartphone in a metal case.  There are many models, but the <span>Lenovo S90</span> is considered the best <span>.</span>  Why is that?  What's so special about her? </p><p>  To begin with, the device‚Äôs screen is standard.  The diagonal indicator in inches is 5. Enough for games, and for work, and for study.  The extension is also quite normal - 1280 by 720 pixels.  There is a capacitive touch multi-touch that responds well to commands sent.  Transmits the screen to 16 million colors and shades.  This is a normal indicator for a modern model.  In addition, the Lenovo smartphone in a metal case is perfectly protected from falls and damage.  So, he will work for a long time and with high quality. </p><p>  There are two cameras here, as in many models.  The first (main) shoots from 13 megapixels, and the "front" from 8 megapixels.  This is very pleasing to the owners.  You can take high-quality selfies and videos, as well as receive and make calls using video.  True, the processor is rather weak - 4 cores.  Each of them at 1.2 GHz frequency.  RAM for a gaming smartphone is also not enough - only 1 GB.  But sometimes this is enough.  Fortunately, the operating system is quite new and widespread - "Android".  And the version is installed 4.4. </p><p>  The battery of this device is also decent.  Despite its small capacity (2300mAh), it works for a long time and efficiently.  About 6 days with constant use.  And in standby mode for about a month and a half.  Quite decent performance for the Lenovo S90.  Such a model will cost the buyer about 10,000 rubles.  A great option for work and study.  Sometimes even to run some games.  But this option cannot be called a full-fledged gaming smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung smartphone in a metal case" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/975800.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nokia XL </h2><p>  Do not forget about the ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù.  In a metal case, the smartphone of this manufacturer is.  And the model is called Nokia XL.  This is a great option that will please many buyers.  Especially if you like the manufacturer of Nokia.  And if you need a phone at a low price, but with good quality. </p><p>  The display here, as in most cases, is 5 inches diagonally.  The processor is dual-core at 1 GHz.  RAM is not enough - 1 GB.  Built-in space 4 gigabytes.  It is possible to connect an additional memory card.  True, there is a limit of 32 GB.  In principle, this should be enough for a budget phone. </p><p>  There‚Äôs only one camera.  And she shoots with a quality of 5 megapixels.  But according to users, the images are extremely good and high quality.  The Li-on battery has a capacity of 2000 mAh.  With constant use of the device, you can expect about 6-7 days of work without recharging.  The ongoing conversation mode allows you to keep in touch for 16 hours.  But the device is able to ‚Äúlie‚Äù idle for about 2 months.  Nokia XL will cost from 9,500 to 11,000 rubles.  As you can see, the best smartphones in a metal case are similar in both their characteristics and price. </p><h2>  HTC One M8 </h2><p>  The last option we offer today is the HTC One M8.  This smartphone is very popular among buyers.  And this is understandable - ITC has long established itself as a good manufacturer of phones.  Sometimes it is he who can offer the best smartphones in a metal case.  And now this is just our case. </p><p>  This device works great with multiple SIM cards at the same time.  In addition, HTC One M8 is equipped with a powerful processor and 2 GB of RAM.  There are two cameras, but they are not very encouraging.  Front shoots better than the rear.  The first type allows you to take pictures in 5 megapixels, and the second - in 4 megapixels.  It repels many.  But the processor attracts - 4 cores.  And each has a resolution of 2.3 GHz.  This is enough to call the HTC One M8 a gaming device. </p><p>  The screen and operating system are also suitable for this lesson.  5 inches diagonally and the "Android" version 4.4.2 do their job.  The image on the display in any weather will be clear, bright and beautiful.  There is the possibility of connecting an additional memory card up to 64 GB inclusive. </p><p>  The battery of the device also pleases.  Its capacity is 2600 mAh, but the operating time is about 4 days.  And this is provided that you will constantly be in contact with HTC One M8.  Without work, such a smartphone will lie about 2.5 months.  Sometimes it‚Äôs very convenient.  The brainchild of HTC is not very expensive - 14,500 rubles.  It is quite accessible to the modern buyer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone metal case for 2 sim cards" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/975799.jpg"></div>
