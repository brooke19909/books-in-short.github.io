    <h2>  Cost of living at the three-star Cleopatra Apartments Hotel </h2><p>  As for the cost of living in this apart-hotel, it is quite consistent with its level of stardom.  So, a ten-day tour with a flight from Moscow and accommodation in a double room will cost you an average of 57 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Cleopatra Apartments: Travel Reviews </h2><p>  We bring to your attention generalized comments from travelers staying in Ayia Napa in the three-star hotel described.  So, most of the tourists found the hotel quite consistent with their stardom and cost of living. </p><p>  Most of all, vacationers were pleased with the location of the hotel.  After all, it is located almost in the city center, near the bar street with many bars and nightclubs.  Many "party people" appreciated the fact that after visiting fun discos they did not have to get to their hotel for a long time.  There are also many shops, restaurants, cafes, etc. The city beach is also located very close.  However, many tourists preferred to go to other beaches, mainly to Nissi Beach.  This could be done either by bus or taxi. </p><p>  The hotel itself also attracted many tourists.  Vacationers found it, though small, but very comfortable.  The rooms also made an extremely positive impression on our compatriots, because there is everything for living: from a TV and phone to an air conditioner, refrigerator, stove.  In some rooms, guests even found a hand blender and air mattresses for the beach.  Also, hotel guests appreciated the good <span>soundproofing of the rooms,</span> so that sounds coming from nightclubs do not interfere with sleep. </p><p>  The hotel staff did not cause any particular complaints.  All hotel staff are responsive and attentive, speak good English.  But in Russian it‚Äôs unlikely that you will be able to communicate with them.  However, some vacationers were unhappy with the irregular cleaning of the rooms. </p><p>  The negative point that almost all tourists paid attention to was the theft.  However, this fact is not associated exclusively with this hotel, as thieves hunt throughout Ayia Napa.  In this regard, travelers are advised not to leave valuables in their rooms, and whenever possible always carry them with them. </p>
