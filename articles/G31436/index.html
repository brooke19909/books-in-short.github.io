    <p>  The town of Protaras is a small resort that features sandy beaches, beautiful rocky bays.  This place is just perfect for families.  As a rule, this town attracts the attention of those who are focused on a relaxing holiday away from the noisy and reckless Ayia Napa.  It is noteworthy that several decades ago only fig groves and dry shrubs grew in Protaras, but there was no talk of building hotels here.  Today, this region has a developed infrastructure with a network of various hotels - more affordable (for example, Adelais Bay Hotel 3 *) or more expensive (for example, Constantinos the Great Beach 5 *). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The city of Protaras is located near Ayia Napa - only tens of kilometers away.  You can get to the city by taxi - it will be quick and inexpensive, and buses and suburban minibuses run between cities.  Many tourists note that Protaras is perhaps the best romantic resort town, the nature of which is replete with amazingly beautiful landscapes.  In addition, this city is full of attractions that allow you to explore the country's traditions from the inside.  So, you can stay at the Adelais Bay Hotel 3 * (Protaras) <strong> </strong>  and <strong> </strong>  visit the beautiful Cape Greco, which is famous for its sea views.

    <p>  However, many note that there are also disadvantages, for example, a paid safe - you have to take all things with you so as not to overpay.  In addition, shops are not very close - going to them in the heat is not the most pleasant event.  For example, the cheapest and at the same time a large supermarket is located 30 minutes from the hotel, but here you can always find delicious and fresh products. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned every day, so the room is clean, and indeed the staff is friendly and responsive, which is important in a foreign country.
