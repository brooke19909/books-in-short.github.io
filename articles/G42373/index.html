It is not necessary to say that travelers from different parts of the world seek to visit the beautiful places of Novosibirsk in order to at least touch the history of the Russian Federation and feel the unusual atmosphere. </p><h2>  Monuments and sculptural structures </h2><p>  Among the highlights of Novosibirsk is a unique structure - a monument to traffic lights.  It was erected in a historical place - where the townspeople first saw a traffic light.  At the crossroads of Serebrennikova and Sibrevkoma streets, this monument now flaunts, which is located near the school.  The sculpture is presented in the form of a composition of two elements: the guard, who salutes, and the traffic light itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful places of Novosibirsk" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/1359134.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Not one excursion in the city is complete without a visit to the Glory Monument.  This large-scale monument was erected in honor of the memory of the dead inhabitants, and there were more than 30 thousand who lost their lives in the name of the Great Victory.  Five pylons 10 meters high are symbols of the Great Patriotic War, and the names of heroes are immortalized on them.  Here, not far from the sculpture of the Grieving Mother, the Eternal Flame is seen.  A little further you can walk along the Alley of weapons, visit the chapel of St. George the Victorious, as well as a monument dedicated to the unity of the Front and the Rear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Railway bridge over the Ob river </h2><p>  One of the most famous <span>sights in Novosibirsk</span> is the first railway bridge over the Ob river.  Officially, he was opened to transport in the distant 1897 year.  The action took place in a festive atmosphere, as it became a significant event both for the city and the entire region, since the bridge is part of the <span>Trans-Siberian Railway.</span>  In general, all the bridges of Novosibirsk play by no means the last role in unloading traffic, so the townspeople treat them with care. </p><p>  Today the view of the bridge is significantly different from the original.  Most of its elements were replaced in the nineties of the last century.  However, the first details were preserved in the form of museum exhibits and are now available to the public.  Many residents of the city are sure to take this bridge to the beautiful places of Novosibirsk and advise them to see it with their own eyes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bridges of novosibirsk" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/1359135.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  House for a hundred apartments </h2><p>  In Novosibirsk, the most famous building is considered a block of flats.  Its analogues do not exist in the world.  For his design and the entire architectural ensemble, implemented according to the plan of the architect A. Kryachkov, a gold medal was received at an exhibition in Paris in the distant 1937.  It is interesting that now, in front of this crowned structure, a monument flaunts to the architect himself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Train Station </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that the beautiful places of Novosibirsk are not only bridges, gardens and monuments.  This includes the impressive building of the railway station.  It was built in the 39th year of the past century, and several architects were involved in its creation at once.  It was not in vain that so much attention was riveted to the station, because the appearance of the city at that time completely depended on the railway. </p><h2>  Cathedrals and churches </h2><p>  One of the most magnificent and oldest cathedrals in the city is Alexander Nevsky Cathedral.  His age reaches hundreds of years, which is quite a lot for Siberia.  The name of the architect is still unknown, but the quality of his work deserves respect.  There were several attempts to blow up and destroy the structure, but they all ended in failure.  Therefore, the cathedral still flaunts to the joy of parishioners along Sovetskaya Street. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Central Siberian Botanical Garden" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/1359136.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Theaters </h2><p>  It turns out that the title of the largest opera house in the Russian Federation was awarded to the Novosibirsk theater.  Its building is so unique that it is especially protected by the state.  Its construction was started in May 1931 in the central part of the city.  But during the construction, the original plan to build a huge building was replaced by a less shocking version.  Nevertheless, the result of the work of the creators was awarded the highest award at an exhibition in the capital of France.  Undoubtedly, if local residents are asked what beautiful places of Novosibirsk they can name, then the opera house is necessarily included in the top list.  It is noteworthy that during the war, artworks from the Tretyakov Gallery and the Hermitage were preserved in this theater. </p><h2>  Botanical Gardens </h2><p>  The Central Siberian Botanical Garden is the largest representative of such landscapes in the Asian part of the Russian Federation.  Its foundation is considered the 46th year of the last century.  The authorities allocated a large area near Akademgorodok in 1964, where various plants were planted according to the plan.  The official date of the grand opening of the botanical garden is 1982. </p><p>  Here every year new interesting expositions appear before the eyes of the public.  Many tourists rush to see the arboretum in the garden, visit the forest park zone, and also see the taxonomic.  In addition, everyone can enjoy a collection of endangered species of vegetation, historical photographs, see the largest herbarium of the country and much more.  A plus for visitors is also that visiting the Central Siberian Botanical Garden is interesting in all climatic conditions.  In winter and summer there is always something to see and where to go for a walk. </p><h2>  Technopark </h2><p>  The place where innovations in the field of science turn into real technological projects is rightfully considered the technopark of the Novosibirsk Academgorodok.  This integrated technology park has scientific, technological, business infrastructure, which makes it possible to develop various enterprises in the field of high technologies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Technopark of Novosibirsk Academgorodok" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/1359137.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  River surroundings </h2><p>  The embankment of the Ob River annually attracts crowds of tourists hurrying to enjoy the water surface and the surrounding beauty.

Hence, a beautiful view of the bridges of Novosibirsk, which you can admire both day and night.  In addition, on the promenade there is a park called "City Beginnings", where you can spend time in the shade of trees. </p>
