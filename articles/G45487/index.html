Interestingly, such needlework originally originated in China, where paper was invented.  Gradually, unusual crafts gained worldwide recognition, but most of all they became interested in Japan. </p><p>  This piece of art for a long time was available exclusively to people belonging to the aristocracy.  Here, the ability to add origami belonged to one of the signs of good taste.  The secrets of paper masterpieces were passed down from generation to generation and even created whole books, which, if necessary, corresponded. </p><div class="photo" data-original="origami.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a paper dog" class="if uuid-2320253" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2320253.jpg"></div><p>  Origami can be considered the most unusual and original form of art.  The main rule here is not to make changes or remove parts, even if they seem redundant.  It is this approach to business that the Japanese prefer, creating real masterpieces from solid sheets of paper.  Initially, this technology was widely used for many ceremonies, both secular and religious.  For example, during the marriage, butterflies in the origami style were made to decorate the glasses of people present at the celebration, and they did not forget about the figures symbolizing the young couple. </p><p>  It is interesting that origami could serve as a kind of amulet for samurai, for this paper was additionally decorated with dried meat or shark skin.  Such amulets were supposed to keep the soldiers and help them win victories.  As you can see from the article, origami is a whole art, which will be interesting not only for adults, but also for children.  If you master simple works first, then gradually you can move on to real masterpieces. </p>
