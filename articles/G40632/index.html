    <p>  The state is one of the most important social institutions that organize and control the relations and interactions of individuals and groups.  The sovereignty of the state is its inherent quality as an active <span>subject of international law,</span> characterized by political and legal independence, determined by the legal law of equality of independent states. </p><p>  The sovereignty of power means its independence and independence in making fundamental decisions.  Of course, in the modern world there can be no absolute independence.  Any state in one way or another depends on the influence of other countries or their associations.  However, this does not mean that education does not have <span>state sovereignty.</span> </p><p>  In modern law, in addition to the concept of ‚Äústate sovereignty‚Äù, there is the concept of popular sovereignty, the essence of which is in the supremacy of the people.  He is considered at the same time as the only legitimate and competent carrier of supreme power. </p><p>  However, state sovereignty differs from popular sovereignty.  In the first case, the carrier (subject) is the state, in the other - the people.  In addition, popular sovereignty can be manifested not only in the exercise of power through elected bodies and other political mechanisms, but also in various forms of public self-government. </p><p>  Currently, the concept of popular sovereignty is recognized in the world, which is reflected, for example, in article twenty-first of the <span>Universal Declaration of Human Rights,</span> which states that the expression of the will of the people should be the basis of power and should be expressed in regular and un rigged elections.  The concept of people's sovereignty is manifested in the right to ownership of natural wealth and in other forms. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The sovereignty of the state, without a doubt, is closely connected with the people‚Äôs, because it is the state that should act as the main spokesman for the will of society. </p><p>  The tasks and <span>functions of the state are</span> determined by its social essence.  If it expresses the interests of one social group as opposed to the interests of others, then the tasks of the state will be reduced to ensuring group domination.  If it expresses the interests of most of the people, then the concern for the welfare of society will come to the fore. </p><p>  Speaking of the state, it is necessary to highlight its main features.  This is, first and foremost, a single <span>political power that</span> applies to the entire population.  Secondly, the possession of sovereignty.  The third sign is the existence of an independent and independent legislative, executive and judicial powers.  The fourth sign of the state is supremacy in relation to other authorities within the country.  Fifth, the presence of a special apparatus of power, as well as governance and coercion.  Sixth, the organization and exercise of power solely on a legal basis. </p><p>  Under the functions of the state understand the main areas of activity that express its essence and purpose.  They can be considered by areas of distribution.  Then it will be internal and external. </p><p>  Internal functions include economic (budget formation and control over its spending; development of an economic development program, etc.);  social (assistance to needy members of the society, allocation of funds for health care, education, recreation, culture, etc.);  <span>financial control;</span>  law enforcement;  ecological. </p><p>  <span>External functions of the state</span> include cooperation with other states in the economic, political, scientific, technical, environmental, military and cultural spheres;  defense of the country from external aggressors, border protection. </p><p>  These are the main features and functions of the state. </p>
