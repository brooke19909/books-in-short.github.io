The city has a long and interesting history, full of numerous events.  The peak of the city's development occurred in the 4th century.  In those ancient times, Queen Theodelinda ordered the construction of a magnificent palace and monastery on this land.  In the Middle Ages, the city repeatedly tried to gain independence from Milan, withstood numerous attacks and sieges. </p><p>  Monza is reminded of the history of numerous monuments and architectural structures, to which the locals are very careful.  We invite you to take a short trip with us to this sunny and hospitable city.  You will not need trips to Italy.  We hope that the description and photos of the memorable places will allow you to get to know Monza better. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="monza italy" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1616422.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Monza: attractions.  City Museum </h2><p>  Sometimes tourists consider that it is not worth the time to visit ‚Äúboring‚Äù museums.  It's a delusion.  Monza museum collections contain unique documents and antiques.  Scientists, researchers, historians have spent decades creating a magnificent collection.  After the Napoleonic campaign, many priceless specimens taken out were taken out of the city abroad. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1965, the museum received its first visitors.  There are many exhibits, art paintings that belong to the XIII-XIV centuries.  Here you can find household items, jewelry, church books and chronicles. </p><h2>  Town Hall </h2><p>  This city building is a symbol of political autonomy.  The town hall was erected in the middle of the XIII century as the residence of city government.  The building is located in the center of the medieval city, 100 meters from the cathedral. </p><p>  Locals often call this building "arenarium".  This word comes from the German <em>hari-hriggs</em> .  It can be translated as "circle of warriors."  The building of the town hall is made in the Gothic style, but at the same time it has some features that were inherent in the architecture of northern Italy.  The building has an external balcony, which served as a kind of tribune for the rulers who addressed their people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monza race track" class="if" height="476" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1616416.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The tower of the bell tower, which was built in the XIV century, adjoins the palace.  It has a square shape and is made of brick.  Crowned by the town hall are the Gibellin battlements and a pointed spire.  At the base, the structure has the shape of a parallelogram.  In its lower part there is an arched gallery, and at the top - office space.  The gallery consists of three rows of stone pillars, which are covered with lancet brick arches and decorated with inlaid white marble.  In ancient times, this area was used for trade. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1890, the architect Luca Beltram restored the palace.  In the tower, restoration work took place a little later (1903).  During these works, a spiral staircase was attached to the tower.  Today, the town hall building is used as an exhibition hall.  It constantly hosts exhibitions not only of ancient masters, but also of contemporary artists. </p><h2>  Villa Reale </h2><p>  The city of Monza has on its territory many unique structures.  Villa Reale is one of them.  This estate was built in honor of the son of Ferdinand.  The villa is surrounded by a magnificent park, the entrance to which is open for locals and tourists around the clock. </p><p>  But to see the interiors of the palace, you must take part in the tour.  First, guests are invited to inspect the dwelling of royal persons.  Then the tour continues at the theater and chapel.  Ancient frescoes and unique wall paintings deserve special attention here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="formula 1 track" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1616418.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  The central building, which is rightfully proud of Monza (Italy), is the Cathedral of John the Baptist.  Despite the fact that the temple is not officially considered a cathedral, it is headed by the archbishop, which gives the cathedral significance. </p><p>  Before the cathedral, there was a chapel on this site, which was built during the reign of Theodeline.  In the 7th century, it was decided to dismantle the chapel and build a temple in its place.  From the primordial structure to our days, little has been preserved: it has transferred too many reconstructions in its history.  In the XIII century, its appearance was completely changed, and in the XVI century, murals appeared on its internal walls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trips to Italy" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1616421.jpg" width="600"></div>

Monza (Italy) was not chosen by chance to build a villa for the Archduke: clean air, picturesque surroundings, and in addition, the city was a symbol of the connection between Milan and Vienna. </p><p>  The facade decoration may be considered by many to be too strict: it is composed of tympans, colonnades and relief window frames.

    <h2>  City Park </h2><p>  A hundred years ago, people treated the parks with special trepidation.  The wealthy nobles invested fortunes in their creation.  Monza (Italy) has one of the most beautiful monuments of landscape gardening art.  The founder of this picturesque site in the city was the <span>king of Italy,</span> Beauharnais.  The author of the project is the famous architect Luigi Canonika. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="monza sights" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1616415.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Today, the park is a favorite vacation spot for citizens and tourists.  In addition, at the beginning of the 20th century a circuit (Monza) and a hippodrome were built here.  And a little later (1928) a golf course was created. </p><h2>  Autodrom (Monza) </h2><p>  It is no secret that trips to Italy are acquired not only by fans of beach vacations, lovers of historical attractions, shopping, but also fans of motorsport.  Monza Track (Italy) is a legendary racing facility located in this small Italian town.  The circuit is one of the oldest racing tracks in the world.  It is popular and respected by all athletes and fans of this exciting sport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monza Italy" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1616419.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The circuit was opened in September 1922 in the famous city park and was originally intended for the Milan Automobile Club.  He became the third in the world with a constant expressway.  Initially, two tracks were built: a ring with seven turns and an elliptical ring that had two turns, which involved racing at high speed. </p><p>  After the tragedy that happened in 1928, when twenty spectators and the pilot of one of the cars died, the tracks were combined into one to reduce speed.  In the fifties, the high-speed ring was concreted, and for some time competitions were held on it, but in the early sixties it was no longer used. </p><p>  In Monza, one of the stages of the international competition "Formula 1".  The track is also used for smaller competitions.  Due to the presence of straight sections, the circuit is recognized as one of the most dynamic in the world.  Numerous speed records for motorcycles and sports cars are set here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monza city" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1616420.jpg" width="600"></div>

The stands of the circuit accommodate about sixty thousand spectators. </p><h2>  Chapel </h2><p>  The unique city of Monza (Italy) fascinates with its unique buildings, picturesque nature of tourists.  Among its many attractions, one cannot but note the exquisite and sophisticated Chapel, which was built in honor of the murdered Umberto the First. </p><p>  The architect of this building is the famous Giuseppe Sacconi.  But fate decreed that he was not able to complete his project.  After his death, the work was continued by the apprentice of the master - Guido Chirili.  The discovery of the Chapel took place ten years after the death of a brilliant architect (1910).  The building impresses with its magnificent view.  At the very top is a sculpture group.  It is called Compassion. </p><p>  If you have visited all the brightest places in the city, just walk along its narrow streets, wander along stone roads, admire the bright, colorful, as if toy, houses. </p>
