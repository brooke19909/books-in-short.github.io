    <h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  Los Angeles (California, USA) is located on the West Coast of the Pacific Ocean.  The settlement is located in a comfortable low-lying lagoon, surrounded on all sides by the mountains of San Gabriel, Santa Ana and Santa Monica.  The region is irrigated by the waters of the Los Angeles River, most of which is walled into a pipe.  In the hot months, it almost dries up.  The area around the city has a diverse landscape, there are hills, plains, swamps.  The proximity of mountain systems makes this area a seismic hazard, in the 20th century there were 4 fairly large earthquakes.  A favorable geographical position creates the conditions for the formation of diverse flora and fauna. </p>

    <h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  Favorable living conditions have long attracted people to the Pacific coast.  Research by anthropologists, linguists and archaeologists suggests that the indigenous population lived in the territory of modern California 2-2.5 thousand years ago.  These were semi-nomadic tribes that gradually switched to a settled way of life.  It has been documented that in the place where Los Angeles, California today stands, the first settlers lived in the 16th century.  These were the <span>Indian tribes of</span> Tongwa and Chumash.  They were engaged in hunting and fishing, possessed the skills of manufacturing tools and pottery. </p><p>  In 1542, the Spanish conquerors arrived, led by the Portuguese navigator Cabrillo.  After 30 years, the British citizen F. Drake arrived on the same coast, who declared these lands the property of England.  This conquest was purely formal, a large migration of Europeans to this region was not observed for another two centuries.  At the end of the 18th century, people from different countries and with different goals came here: someone with Christian missions, someone for the purpose of hunting, someone to capture new lands.  Moreover, all the conquerors brutally exterminated and expelled the local population. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the 19th century, part of the land regained its independence from the Spaniards, so Mexico appeared, for a short time Los Angeles was part of it.  In the middle of the century, the city was taken over by the United States.  In the last quarter of the 19th century, a railway comes here, and the rapid development of the city begins.  In the 20th century, the city is growing rapidly, industrial enterprises are opening up, the population is growing, construction is underway.  There were several breakthroughs in the development of Los Angeles in the last century: during the Second World War, in the post-war years.  Today, the city is a large industrial and economic center of a global scale.  Almost 4 million people live here, and if you count the entire agglomeration, then almost 20 million. </p>
