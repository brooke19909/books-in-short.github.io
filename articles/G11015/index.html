    <h2>  Let's define in terms </h2><p>  Under a non-burning flame, chemistry means a chain oxidation reaction in which a glow is observed.  So if you strictly follow the terminology, cold <span>fire is</span> not a <span>flame</span> .  It is used to create very spectacular special effects and some varieties of fireworks.  A number of ethers and acids, both organic and inorganic, are capable of producing cold flames.  The most commonly used ethyl derivative of boric acid. </p><p>  Often, cold fire also means a visual "trick" in which there is no combustion process as such.  It is usually used not for tricks, but for design purposes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cold fire at home" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/1165441.jpg" width="480"></div>

Take a spoonful of alcohol (medical or chemically pure, used for analysis).  It is mixed with an equal volume of boric acid in the powder.  It, like alcohol, can be bought at any pharmacy.  A drop of concentrated strong acid, hydrochloric or sulfuric, is dripped into the solution.  For the ignorant: this is poured into batteries, so getting it is also not a problem.  The vessel with the billet heats up.  The quickest and safest way to do this is in a primitive water bath.  When the mixture becomes noticeably warm, but not yet hot, you can begin to show the focus. </p><p>  If you have never made a cold fire, do not set it on fire in the palm of your hand - in the absence of dexterity, you will be injured.  It is better to roll a <span>ball of thread,</span> soak it with the composition and only then set fire.  The match (lighter) of the thread ball should not touch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself cold fire" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/1165439.jpg" width="539"></div>

    <h2>  Caution Above All! </h2><p>  Cold fire remains only until the ether formed by the reagents burns.  When it is over, ethanol will be directly involved - but its combustion temperature is quite high.  In addition, do not forget that the acid involved in the creation of the flame is a dangerous substance.  So you should take care of precautions: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Never increase the dose of acid.  Firstly, an explosive mixture may result.  Secondly, you can get a chemical burn by putting the ball on your palm. </li><li>  Make sure that there is no hair or clothing edge near the lighted ball.  An inexperienced magician may not catch the moment of fire ignition, and these things are easily ignited. </li><li>  Keep a non-combustible small container nearby to close and extinguish a cold fire when it becomes hot.  Or show the focus over the kitchen sink to quickly throw it into it. </li></ol><p>  After a certain amount of training, when you learn to control temperature changes to such an extent that you do not get burns, the non-burning flame can be lit right in the palm of your hand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a cold fire at home" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/1165442.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  Safer option </h2><p>  You can make a cold fire in another way, although it will look less spectacular, since the flame from it has the usual color that is not painted greenish.  A small piece of cotton cloth is taken, rolled into a ball and wrapped (or better - stitched) with threads so that it does not unfold.  Low-temperature fuel, for example, isopropanol, is poured into a shallow bowl.  You can take the so-called <span>gasoline for lighters,</span> but here you need to be careful: these liquids have a different burning temperature, you can run into quite tangible.  The fabric ball is dipped in fuel, squeezed out and set on fire.  The lump of the hand will warm, but if you roll it over the palm of your hand and between your fingers, you will feel only pleasant warmth.  And if you grease the place of laying the ball with cream, then you can keep it in one place.  The only safety measure - do not touch the top of the flame - this is a guaranteed burn. </p><h2>  Short flame </h2><p>  There are other techniques for making cold fire with your own hands, based mostly on the skill of a magician and small tricks.  The easiest way to implement two options: </p><ol><li>  Mix alcohol or acetone with water to a concentration such that the liquid burns but does not flash.  Hands are lubricated with a special flame-retardant gel (sold in stores specializing in props and sweepstakes).  Fuel is poured into the boat from the palm of your hand and set on fire.  Strictly speaking, this is not a cold fire, since the combustion temperature is standard, and it is maintained painlessly only due to the gel.  But it looks impressive and convincing. </li><li>  Thin tissue is impregnated with vodka, and the vapors are set on fire when the matter is spread in the palm of your hand.  The handkerchief lights up, but due to the low concentration of alcohol, it goes out before burns form.  An additional security guarantee is to keep your palm as straight as possible. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="make a cold fire" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/1165438.jpg" width="480"></div></li></ol><h2>  Flame simulation </h2><p>  It remains to consider the chimney cold fire.  At home, not being able to lay out a real fireplace, many romantics do just that.  A fan is placed in a box (even a cardboard one) so that the air flow from it is directed upwards.  LEDs and optical filters in red, blue and yellow are placed in the corners.  On the sides inside are mirrors.  Triangles are cut from the fabric and glued to the box.  The system is plugged in - and a cold flame creates comfort in the room. </p>
