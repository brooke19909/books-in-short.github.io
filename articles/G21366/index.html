Tax deduction when buying an apartment</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Now we will try to figure out how to return 13 percent of the purchase of an apartment.  This opportunity attracts many homeowners.  After all, 13% of the amount spent is a very good compensation.  It turns out that in Russia you can not only give to the state, but also get something in return.  There are options for both a regular transaction and a mortgage.  But in any case, you need documents.  How to return 13 percent of the purchase of an apartment?  What is required for this?  Why cook yourself? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to return 13 percent of the purchase of an apartment" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1224637.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Not everyone </h2><p>  It is worth noting right away - this opportunity does not apply to all citizens.  Many, but not absolutely the entire population.  Deductions for the apartment (they are called property) can be received by each taxpayer with income.  That is, one who pays income tax.  Under this concept it is customary to understand, as a rule, an officially employed citizen. </p><p>  But those who do not have any declared income do not have the right to receive deductions.  Moreover, a large purchase in the form of real estate will attract the attention of tax authorities.  And this is not always good. </p><p>  Pensioners are also entitled to return 13 percent for the apartment.  Only for them the list of everything necessary for the operation is somewhat expanded.  But it's not a problem. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Terms of circulation </h2><p>  In what period of time is it advised to deal with this issue?  According to modern laws, you can ask for a deduction for an apartment within 3 years from the date of conclusion of the transaction, but no later.  Only such rules are established by tax laws in Russia. </p><p>  But in practice, everything is somewhat different.  Is it possible to return 13 percent for a real estate transaction?  Easy!  Only deal with the task as soon as possible.  Experts and citizens recommend meeting the end of the tax reporting period.  After all, it takes some time to consider your case, as well as to transfer funds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="is it possible to return 13 percent" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1224635.jpg"></div>

    <p>  How much will a decision be made to satisfy the request or to refuse?  About 1.5-2 months.  And additionally you need about 60 days to transfer the deduction.  The result is everything, if you do not take into account the preparation of documents, it takes about 4 months.  So, if you are thinking about how you can return personal income tax from buying an apartment, it‚Äôs worth starting to deal with this problem sooner. </p><h2>  Identification </h2><p>  Of course, the first and most important document that is useful in our business is an identity card.  In general, anyone will do, but the tax authorities assure that you must present your passport without fail.  More precisely, its ordinary copy.  All pages should be photocopied and attached to the main list of documents.  Without an <span>identity card, you</span> can‚Äôt answer how to return 13 percent of the purchase of an apartment.  You will simply be refused in this case.  Perhaps a citizen‚Äôs passport is what is required for any transactions and operations in Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  According to the statement </h2><p>  Pay attention to another very interesting fact - the statement.  It must be compiled and submitted to the tax authorities.  It can be said in free form.  According to modern laws, VAT can be returned from the purchase of an apartment (13% of the deduction) only if there is a buyer's request. </p><p>  Without fail, it indicates information about the former owner of the home, as well as your data, information about the apartment and its cost.  Do not forget to attach the details of the account to which it is worth making a refund.  If this is not done, then you will have to inform the missing papers, or, as often happens, you will be denied a deduction - you will have to file a tax application with documents from the very beginning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage how to return 13 percent" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1224636.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Reporting </h2><p>  What's next?  How to return <span>13 percent of the purchase of an apartment?</span>  The so-called tax return is required to be submitted to the tax authorities.  It is called 3-personal income tax.  You should have only its original, no copies. </p><p>  What is this report about?  Information about your income.  If you work for yourself, you will have to make a declaration yourself.  Otherwise, you can contact your employer for help.  But in practice, just 3-NDFL is filled in by each taxpayer independently.  In fact, it is not as difficult as it might seem at first glance. </p><h2>  Income </h2><p>  Regardless of what kind of form of housing acquisition took place to be (mortgage or simple purchase and sale), you need to somehow confirm your income.  Here you will have to submit a certificate of form 2-NDFL.  As in the past case, only original paper is needed. </p><p>  If you work for yourself, you will have to fill out this certificate on your own.  Have an official employer?  Then contact the accounting department of your company, there they will give you 2-personal income tax.  There are no problems with this document, in principle.  Unless the preparation of the certificate may in some cases take some time. </p><h2>  About deal </h2><p>  The complete list of all the essentials for a refund of money spent is almost complete.  In fact, we should not forget about the most important thing - information about the deal.  Without some documents, you can‚Äôt get a deduction for the purchase of an apartment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="return 13 percent for an apartment" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1224634.jpg"></div>

    <p>  So what can come in handy?  First of all, this is a contract of sale.  It is advisable to sign an additional original copy for the deduction.  Otherwise, a certified copy is sufficient. </p><p>  Next, you will need a certificate of ownership of the apartment.  Without it, it makes no sense to apply for a deduction.  So, you have to wait a while until you get this document.  A plain copy of an unapproved certificate will do.  Although, as practice shows, citizens are most often reinsured and reassure. </p><p>  <span>Receipts of payment,</span> receipts of receipt of funds by the former owner - all this must also be attached to the declaration and application.  You can make copies.  The main thing is to make sure that all documents contain your initials.  If you bought an apartment for someone, it is almost impossible to prove your deduction rights in Russia.  All information should indicate that you are the buyer. </p><h2>  Mortgage </h2><p>  Now quite often there is a mortgage.  How to return 13 percent in this case for the purchase?  This is not too difficult to do.  After all, you just have to supplement the above list with some documents.  There are only two of them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="return personal income tax from the purchase of an apartment" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1224638.jpg"></div>
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The first is a mortgage agreement.  As in the case of purchase and sale, either the original or a certified copy is sufficient.  Without this document, the deduction will not be refunded. </p><p>  The second is a receipt on payment of interest on a mortgage.  For debts, a 13% refund will be refused until repayment.  Consider this feature.  No one makes deductions to debtors.  In principle, that‚Äôs all.  No more documents will be required from you. </p><h2>  Other </h2><p>  Although there are exceptions.  How to return 13 percent of the purchase of an apartment?  In some cases, the following documents may be requested from you, but they are not mandatory (it is advisable to prepare them and present them in advance): </p><ul><li>  TIN; </li><li>  marriage / divorce certificate; </li><li>  birth certificates of children; </li><li>  <span>pension certificate</span> ; </li><li>  SNILS; </li><li>  military ID. </li></ul>
