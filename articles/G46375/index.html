In some cases, it loses its meaning, in others it acquires a completely different meaning.  Consider the concept of the "inquisitor" in the article.  The meaning of the word has not changed over the centuries, but only expanded the original meaning. </p><h2>  Origin of the word </h2><p>  Many concepts of our time are rooted in the <span>Latin language.</span>  The same story happened with the word "inquisitor".  This is who what this person is doing can be found in the literal translation of this term into Russian.  The Latin word inquisitio means "investigation", "inquiry".  Therefore, the answer to the question, who is the inquisitor, will sound like <span>an interrogator, an</span> investigator, and sometimes a judge.  A simple Latin word began to mean a formidable force that terrified the inhabitants of medieval Europe. </p>

    <h2>  Who is the Inquisitor </h2><p>  The inquisition dates back to the beginning of the 12th century.  Until that time, no one knew who the Inquisitor was and had no idea that faith needed to be upheld in quite terrible ways.  At the end of the XII century, the growth of various opposition Christian movements began, which questioned some of the dogmas of the church, and at the same time reduced the influence of the papacy on the mind of Catholics.  This trend could not but worry the Catholics, because the challenge was not posed by the poor pagans of the past, but by representatives of fairly noble and wealthy families. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of the movements of Christianity was called Albigensia.  The Cathars posed a serious threat to the power of Rome.  It was to combat them that the first courts of faith were established. </p><p>  Initially, the inquisitor's role came down to inquiry.  Representatives of the Inquisition units were sent to various places where they asked a lot of questions about the mood that prevailed in this territory.  It is clear that such a collection of information opened up wide opportunities for unrighteous denunciation. </p><p>  All suspects of dissent were brought to the bishop to judge and pass judgment.  But secular executions were entrusted to secular authorities.  Often, those sentenced were never executed due to the timely escape to another province. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the inquisitor is who" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1364113.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Such a frivolous attitude towards heresies forced the church to take extreme measures.  Starting from the 13th century, crimes against faith began to be considered one of the gravest, and those who were found guilty were waiting for a terrible death - burning at the stake.  Everyone knew who the inquisitor was, because papacy decrees allowed even children to be executed from the age of seven.  Even the grave did not save from the sentence.  The bodies of the deceased are often excavated and then burned at the stake. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Inquisitors and Witches </h2><p>  The last hotbed of dissent was suppressed in Languedoc.  In this province in the south of France, heresy were accused and executed at the same time more than two hundred people.  The church officially won, entire institutes of the inquisitors searched for new victims.  They became women and girls caught in witchcraft. </p><p>  To identify witches and force them to confess, there was a special book called The Hammer of the Witches.  A special role was given to the inquiry officers.  The concept of who the inquisitor was was a bit changed - now they called witch hunters and sorcerers.  It was because of the zeal of the Inquisitors that many women were terribly tormented and ended their days at the stake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="inquisitor meaning of the word" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1364112.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The modern meaning of the word </h2><p>  Our contemporaries will learn about who the Inquisitor is from books or films.  The theme of the Inquisition in fantasy and science fiction has become widespread.  The ancient duties of the zealots of the faith, of course, could partially change, but sometimes the inquisitors in the fantasies of the author perform absolutely unusual functions for them, for example, take part in battles. </p><p>  It should be understood that the Inquisition is part of the secret church police, and in its meaning it was far from secular power.  Therefore, the Inquisitors could not actively participate in the hostilities.  For the faith of Christ, completely different representatives of the church fought, for example, knights of warrants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="inquisitor synonyms" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1364122.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Thanks to the influence of the media, new meanings of the word ‚Äúinquisitor‚Äù have appeared.  Its synonyms in modern Russian are executioner, asp, flayer, sometimes corrosive interrogator.  Less commonly, the inquisitor is a judge passing harsh and unjust sentences. </p>
