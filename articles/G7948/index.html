  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Kemerovo: city history, foundation, interesting facts, photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sometimes many educated people confine themselves to the history of Moscow, St. Petersburg and several other large cities of Russia, forgetting about other cities no less significant in their culture, industry and eminent people.  What is the history of the city of Kemerovo, the regional center and a well-known coal mining place for many distances?  What people were brought up in this city and how thanks to them did their native land grow and develop?  Many streets are named after famous people, and the number of monuments is growing.  The city really appreciates the story of itself.  Well, then other people need to study it too. </p><div class="photo" data-author=": " data-original="citiesofsiberia.blogspot.com"><img alt="Kemerovo has an excellent traffic intersection" class="if uuid-2832632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2832632.jpg?1575137865"></div><h2>  General information </h2><p>  This administrative center is located 2987 km from Moscow, if you count in a straight line.  Geographically, it is located in the Kuzbass - Kuznetsk coal basin, and therefore is rich in coal.  It occupies both banks of the Tom River, and also affects the place where it merges with the other river - Iskitimka.  Kemerovo can also use groundwater beneath it.  Due to its location, the city experiences all the hardships of the continental climate.  Sometimes cyclones affected him, which caused snow to fall in the summer.  The rest of the time, the average summer temperature is +15 degrees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-zoom="9" data-type="roadmap" data-lng="86.06230440000002" data-lat="55.3450231"><img class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/0/6/5/9065.png"></div><p>  The history of Kemerovo (photo of the city, see the article) remembers the foundation of each plant: chemical, light industry, coal and machine building.  At one time, they greatly influenced the rapid growth of the city, but now they are creating a tense environmental situation.  Nevertheless, the factories provide a stable financial background, and there is no need to talk about the problem of unemployment.  Kemerovo is considered the 15th city by area in the country and occupies 30th place in terms of population. </p><div class="photo" data-author=": " data-original="commons.wikimedia.org"><img alt="Kemerovo city" class="if uuid-2832639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2832639.jpg?1575137865"></div><h2>  Name history </h2><p>  There are two versions of the origin of the name, based on the history of Kemerovo.  Philologists and candidates of philological sciences suggest that the T√ºrkic word "kemir", which means "shore, cliff", could alternate with "kim-rva" meaning "combustible stone."  The designation of the area was initially conditional, along its rocky shores and coal, but then it became its own name.  Stanislav Olenev, rhetoric and stylist, draws attention to the right bank of Tom.  He is rocky and rich in cliffs, and therefore this version has a right to exist.  In addition, coal was first found on this shore, which marked the beginning of the coal industry. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another version is more believable, because it is confirmed by documents.  After the start of the resettlement to this area, he was mentioned by the name of the first who arrived there - Stepan Kemirov.  While he lived at the end of the 17th - beginning of the 18th century, his son, Athanasius, in the 18th century founded the settlement, taking up organizational issues.  It was called the village of Kemerovo or Komarovo.  Perhaps the replacement of the letter in the surname occurred on purpose, but the similarity and logical validity remained. </p><div class="photo" data-author=": " data-original="sites.google.com"><img alt="The history of the construction of the city of Kemeroo" class="if uuid-2832637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2832637.jpg?1575137865"></div><h2>  The history of the construction of Kemerovo </h2><p>  A significant role was played by mass relocations and exiles to Siberia, although Kemerovo is not the northernmost city.  It is located in the south of Western Siberia, and originated from the village of Scheglovo and the newly formed village of Kemerovo.  In 1721, the Russian Cossack son Mikhailo Volkov, experienced in ore mining, ascending upstream, stopped at one of the banks on the right side of the Tom River and discovered a three-seated coal seam.  He sent samples to the tsarist government, but with the change of power, no one could develop a new territory for oil production, although the lack of heat was sharply felt in these cold lands. </p><p>  What laid the foundation for the history of the city of Kemerovo?  As early as 1701, immigrants formed the village of Shcheglovo, but after the active relocation of foreign specialists, the village grew into a city.  Young people, having just settled in a small village, diversified his life and brought a lot of new things to the culture of the city.  Soon, in 1924, Shcheglovsk became the administrative center, and Kuznetsk and Shcheglovsky counties were joined under his responsibility, transformed into the Kuznetsk circle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-author=": " data-original="nailizakon.com"><img alt="History of Kemerovo" class="if uuid-2832654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2832654.jpg?1575137865"></div><h2>  Continued development </h2><p>  Due to the growth of industry, a greater number of workers were required, who increasingly settled near the city.  Along with the increase in the number of people, markets, new homes, schools began to appear.  The city began to develop, grow at a rapid pace, and since 1921 the next five years went into the development of coke production.  The city took a leading place in this type of production and became an important object.  Soon, a relocation of engineers and specialists was organized to support what was started. </p><p>  During these years, many new pages appeared in the history of the city of Kemerovo, and then Shcheglovsk.  Coal mining was actively developing, and in 1932 there was a question about another name for the city.  Still, Shcheglov has nothing to do with the history of the village.  And on March 27, the decision that Shcheglovsk should be renamed Kemerovo was approved.  And after 9 years the war began and many townspeople left as ordinary soldiers, commanders and partisans to defend their city.  This is the story of the creation of Kemerovo. </p><div class="photo" data-author=": " data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk"><img alt="from the village of Kemerovo turned into a city" class="if uuid-2832631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2832631.jpg?1575137865"></div><h2>  Kemerovo as a regional center </h2><p>  The city received this title in 1943.  In wartime, the administrative center was a sad sight - ruined, dirty, with barracks and one-story houses.  Nobody dealt with the streets, and therefore it was sometimes difficult to walk along them.  By the end of 1951, a master plan was created, according to which the city was to be rebuilt, put in order, the streets were named after the heroes of the war and residential areas were arranged.  Kemerovo again learned what a massive and rapid population growth, improvement of entire areas is. </p><p>  From 1970 to 1980, a project was planned to equip Shalgotaryan microdistrict in the Leninsky district.  It was something unusual: the development of multi-storey buildings, tiled with ceramic tiles.  Between the houses organized outlets.  Now the construction of objects of cultural significance both for the city and for the country continues to develop. </p><h2>  The history of Kemerovo streets </h2><p>  In Kemerovo there is Shcheglovsky Lane.  Why is he given such a name?  Since the history of the city of Kemerovo began with the village of Scheglovo, the townspeople do not forget this period of time.  They left in the name of the alley a memory of how the city grew and developed.  In addition, there is Derzhavin Street - a famous geologist who conducted research on the Tom River.  The scientist gained his knowledge at the Vologda Gymnasium and Kazan University, after which he was a mentor in Irkutsk, a teacher‚Äôs seminary.  He was the curator of the mineralogical cabinet at Tomsk State University and was published in "Investigations along the Railroad." </p><p>  The history of the streets does not end there.  One of the streets of the city is named after Timiryazev, a naturalist and active defender of Darwin's theory.  Being an honored scientist, he studied photosynthesis, plant physiology and achieved great results in this.  One of the streets of Kemerovo also bears the surname of Kirchanov: the painter was brought up in the spirit of socialism, which was reflected in his work.  One of the first was recognized as a national and honored artist of the USSR.  Another 1,100 streets can boast of their beautiful, and sometimes historical, name. </p><div class="photo" data-author=": " data-original="russiatrek.org"><img alt="streets of Kemerovo" class="if uuid-2832643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2832643.jpg?1575137865"></div><h2>  Surnames associated with the city </h2><p>  Rukavishnikov, Stepan Ivanovich, originally from Kemerovo, was a witness to the development of the city of Kemerovo, whose history you already know.  He was the first of the chairmen of the Shcheglovsky Council, and therefore in his own way a pioneer.  When the imperialist war began, he participated in it, and after demobilization he returned to Shcheglovo.  He took part in the development of a coke-chemical plant, and when the Bolshevik uprising began, he commanded a detachment of Red Army soldiers. </p><p>  Little known Nazarov Ilya Semenovich, although he was a participant in hostilities.  Originally from the Novokuznetsk district, he was captured wounded by German troops.  By his behavior, he proved that the son of a peasant has the honor of escaping captivity and soon became a commander.  In a leadership position, he proved himself to be a brave, but disciplined person who knows the value of human life and courage.  Posthumously received the title of hero. </p><h2>  Stories of famous people </h2><p>  Leonov is a surname that often appears in the history of Kemerovo and the USSR as a whole.  Originally from the Kemerovo region, Alexey Arkhipovich moved to Kemerovo and studied the profession of a pilot.  Together with Belyaev, he flew on Voskhod-2, a spaceship where he was a co-pilot.  On this his merits did not end, and Leonov went on.  In 1981, he was a State Prize laureate, academician of astronautics, and a member of the International Academy of Astronautics. </p><p>  Voloshina Vera Danilovna - a war hero, a young girl who was at the front.  She was part of the partisan movement, but after an unsuccessful set of circumstances in November 1941 fell into the hands of the Nazi army and was hanged on a willow near the road, next to the Golovkov state farm.  Kemerovo knows many more names (the stories of people known in the city will be interesting for everyone to read): war heroes, scientists, writers, politicians and others have contributed to its history and are not forgotten by the townspeople. </p><h2>  Mikhailo Volkov </h2><p>  The previous mentions were about those who, during their lifetime or posthumously received the title of hero, recognition, however, for his huge discovery, Mikhailo Volkov received nothing.  He is considered the discoverer of the Kuznetsk coal basin.  Although Mikhailo is considered to be a Cossack son, there is still debate about his origin - there is an opinion that the discoverer was from a family of a peasant and landowner.  After finding the coal, he immediately reported this to the Berg College.  She drew attention to the document, but subsequent events made the authorities forget about coal mining for a long 200 years. </p><p>  The street in Kemerovo, the square and two lanes of the Rudnichny district, was named after Mikhail Volkov.  In addition, a monument was erected on the square named after the discoverer, and in 2003 the medal "For the Service of Kuzbass" was named after him.  Thus, Volkov, who made the great discovery, became an important person for the townspeople, almost a hero. </p><div class="photo" data-author=": " data-original="www.ribttes.com"><img alt="square in the city of Kemerovo, fountain" class="if uuid-2832641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73434/2832641.jpg?1575137865"></div><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  There are several interesting details that relate to the history of the city of Kemerovo.  For example, the Sverdlovsk film studio released the film "The Secret of the Golden Mountain", which, despite its intriguing name, has not received world fame, but is valued as the story of Mikhail Volkov.  The administration of Kemerovo ordered a souvenir depicting a hero at a jewelry factory, which did not go unnoticed by the media. </p><p>  The transport interchange is very well organized in the city, and there were prerequisites for this throughout history - the railway passed through the city for many decades.  Now there is a railway bridge, two automobile ones; communication between other cities is convenient. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Having learned the history of the name Kemerovo, having examined the beginning of the birth of the city, you can imagine how much an old building can tell about itself in this regional center.  So, among the attractions there is the Museum of Railway Engineering, ‚ÄúKrasnaya Sopka‚Äù - a museum-reserve.  The city has a Coal Museum, where you can find out how coal is mined in this mining region and how it is deposited.  The history of Kemerovo streets is forever connected with the coal industry, the heroes of this city and the creation of the city. </p><p>  Thus, Kemerovo is by no means a place whose history should be neglected.  Reflecting on how many difficult moments the city had to go through, everyone can realize that building a city is a complex, long process, and if something doesn‚Äôt work out right now, the problems will surely be fixed in the future. </p>
