    <p>  Owners of their own vehicles will be pleased in the future with an underground parking for 960 cars.  It will help to use its roof under the yard space as functionally as possible.  It will house children's playgrounds and sports grounds, a recreation area for children and adults.  The developer of the residential complex ‚ÄúBirch Alley‚Äù will green the entire yard territory and ennoble it according to a pre-thought out landscape design. </p><p>  For the most comfortable stay of residents, the developer of the complex equipped it with automatic engineering systems, the operation of which can be controlled in only one control room.  Fiber-optic Internet and television lines will also be held.  Security of the residents of the complex will be ensured by CCTV cameras and an electronic access system installed around the perimeter and at the entrances. </p><p>  As for the external infrastructure, the location of the complex in the city gives its residents the opportunity to use all the social infrastructure facilities that are located in convenient accessibility.  These are several schools, gymnasiums, kindergartens.  About a few minutes by shuttle bus are large chain supermarkets.  At a distance of less than one kilometer there is a botanical garden, which significantly improves the ecological situation of the area and allows residents of the complex to enjoy relatively fresh and clean air, as much as possible in a huge metropolis. </p><h2>  Reviews about the residential complex </h2><p>  Reviews for the residential complex ‚ÄúBirch Alley‚Äù currently concern in most cases the progress of construction of the complex.  Since it has not yet been built, it is difficult to judge the quality of apartments or finishes, the residential buildings themselves and the courtyard.  Interest holders are looking forward to putting the objects into operation. </p><h2>  Apartments: layout and cost </h2><p>  The apartments in the complex the developer has provided the most diverse: one-room, two-room and three-room.  The smallest one-room apartments do not exceed 25 square meters in area.  The largest, three-room, reach a little over 79 square meters. </p><p>  As for the cost of housing, here it is not the cheapest.  The price of one square meter starts from 132 thousand rubles.  The most expensive are one-room.  They are sold at about 155 thousand rubles per square meter of housing.  The cheapest are traditional two-room and three-room.  They are sold at the above cost. </p>
