  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Xiomi mobile phones: reviews, model overview, specifications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the world of mobile technology, a real mess is happening now.  Top brands fight among themselves for a place in the sun, and in the budget and mid-price segments they are crushed by mighty, cheeky predators who offer high-tech devices at bargain prices.  If companies such as Samsung or HTC still exist in the flagship category, then they have already lost the battle for the middle and initial levels to companies such as Meizu and Xiaomi.  About the products of the latter will be discussed in this material.  After all, Xiaomi mobile phones are not only affordable, but also very popular among potential buyers.  And now we will consider the most interesting models. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi 5A </h2><div class="photo" data-original="gadgets.ndtv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiomi phone reviews" class="if uuid-3240866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240866.jpg"></div><p>  This is one of the most affordable devices from this manufacturer today.  The model belongs to the category of budget, but at the same time it has good technical characteristics.  A powerful quad-core processor and 2 gigabytes of RAM are installed here.  In modern realities, this is more than enough for the normal operation of the device.  Also here is the main camera with a resolution of 8 megapixels.  The quality of the photographs is acceptable in daylight.  But at dusk a lot of extraneous noise appears.  At the same time, the smartphone is equipped with a high-quality display built on the IPS matrix. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The screen has an almost correct color rendering.  Problems are observed only with the display of black.  But these are the features of IPS.  But the screen has excellent viewing angles.  This Xiomi <span>phone</span> model, which we will review reviews a bit later, also supports almost all communication standards except LTE.  Apparently, the company decided to reduce the cost of the device as much as possible.  Nevertheless, it is an order of magnitude more powerful than what other manufacturers offer in the budget segment.  The body of the device is made of metal.  The screen is covered with tempered glass.  This is a great modern smartphone with rich functionality and good performance.  It is suitable for solving almost all everyday tasks.  However, he will not pull demanding toys.  This is a state employee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi mobile phone" class="if uuid-3240867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240867.jpg"></div><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi 5A User Reviews </h2><p>  Now let's see what users say about this Xiaomi mobile phone.  Almost everyone believes that this model turned out to be very successful.  The owners of this device note that its screen looks exactly the same as in other, more expensive smartphones from other manufacturers.  Many also claim that it launches almost all games.  The only exceptions are the coolest titles (like WoT Blitz or PUBG Mobile).  All users agree that this is one of the best public sector employees in the world.  Once the devices from the ‚ÄúHuawei‚Äù were not bad.  But now this company imagines too much about itself.  And against the backdrop of this Xiomi phone, which we are now reviewing, the technology from Huawei looks faded.  Also, users say that the device has a pretty good camera.  It turns out quite high-quality images.  Even at night you can make a decent photo if you play a little with the settings.  In general, this is a very successful model.  But you need to move on. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi 6 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.digit.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi mi5" class="if uuid-3240871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240871.jpg"></div><p>  This is an excellent device with a fashionable display, which has a very thin frame.  It should be noted that the screen occupies almost the entire front part.  The characteristics of the Xiaomi phone of this model inspire respect.  For example, it has 3 gigabytes of RAM and an internal drive of 32 gigabytes.  This is enough for everyday use.  Also under the ‚Äúhood‚Äù of the device is a powerful eight-core processor with a good graphics adapter.  Such a successful tandem allows the smartphone to run even the most difficult games.  Let at the minimum graphics settings. </p><p>  The phone has a main dual camera with lenses of 12 and 5 megapixels, respectively.  This allows you to take high-quality pictures with a fashionable bokeh effect.  The front camera also has good parameters.  In the arsenal of the device there is even a lightning-fast fingerprint scanner.  The phone unlocks in a split second.  But the coolest thing, of course, is the display.  This is a giant bright panel made on the basis of the IPS matrix and covered with tempered glass.  With all this, the smartphone belongs to the category of budget products.  But you yourself may have noticed that he has the characteristics of an apparatus of the middle price segment.  No less. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.thinkofus.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiomi phone models" class="if uuid-3240874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240874.jpg"></div><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi 6 user reviews </h2><p>  What say those who have already managed to purchase this model of phone "Xiomi".  Reviews about this gadget are extremely positive.  People like everything about him.  Separately, they note a giant screen with almost the correct color reproduction and excellent viewing angles.  Many users claim that working with such a screen is a pleasure.  Also, users were exclusively pleased with the battery life of the smartphone.  With these characteristics, it easily withstands two days.  This is an incredible result.  But the case on the phone "Xiomi" of this model is quite difficult to find.  I have to use the simple one that came with the device.  Nevertheless, the owners of this miracle claim that this is a completely modern phone with rich functionality and up-to-date appearance.  The smartphone camera also received praise.  Some users managed to create real masterpieces with it.  And the quality of the pictures pleases.  But the price of the device pleased people the most.  Before Xiaomi entered the market, no one could have imagined that such advanced gadgets could cost so little.  The Chinese have revolutionized the world of smartphones.  What an honor and praise to them.  However, we will move on to the next model. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi Max 3 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="gadgets.ndtv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiomi phone features" class="if uuid-3240879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240879.jpg"></div><p>  But this is a more serious device.  It belongs to the middle price segment and has incredible characteristics.  The key features of the gadget are a powerful battery and a huge screen.  The Xiaomi mobile phone of this model lives quietly on a single charge for 2.5 days.  And this is with its characteristics.  To begin with, he has a ‚Äúmonstrous‚Äù screen.  Its diagonal is almost 7 inches.  The display is based on the IPS matrix with some modifications and is characterized by the highest color quality.  The most powerful eight-core processor and no less powerful graphics adapter are responsible for the performance.  The device is able to easily launch even the most demanding games.  The amount of RAM is as much as 4 gigabytes.  At the same time, it works in two-channel mode.  The phone is equipped with an internal drive of 64 gigabytes, which is quite enough for all the data. </p><p>  The battery of this unit has a record capacity of 5000 mAh.  This allows him to stay afloat for a long time.  Charging the phone "Xiomi" of this model is very fast.  This is possible due to the presence of the option "Quick charge".  The camera deserves special mention.  This is something incredible.  The main photomodule is represented by two sensors of 12 and 5 megapixels, respectively.  Images are incredibly high quality.  And the device shoots well in the dark.  As you can see, the characteristics of the device are more than worthy.  But it costs as much as the usual "average" from other manufacturers. </p><h2>  User reviews about Xiaomi Mi Max 3 </h2><p>  What do the owners of this Xiomi phone say?  Reviews about this gadget are mostly positive.  Of the negative sides, users note only the gigantic dimensions of the device.  Therefore, sometimes it is inconvenient to use.  The rest does not cause any complaints.  Owners are satisfied with almost everything: from build quality to performance.  Separately, they mention the incredible battery life.  This is almost a champion among devices of this level.  In addition, there is a special energy-saving mode in the settings of the phone ‚ÄúXiomi‚Äù of this model.  And he helps out a lot in cases where the battery charge is very low.  The incredible display has also been the subject of endorsement from users.  They note that reading information from this screen is very convenient and comfortable.  No need to strain your eyesight.  And watching a video on such a display is completely excellent.  Adequate operation of the fingerprint scanner is also noted separately.  It unlocks the device in a split second and almost never "dulls" and is not mistaken.  In general, users are very satisfied with the device, and especially at its price.  And we move on to the next model. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi5 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="gadgets.ndtv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiomi phone settings" class="if uuid-3240880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240880.jpg"></div><p>  This is a flagship from the past.  It was released in 2016.  But it is still relevant.  Phone "Xiomi" of this model is notable for good performance and excellent autonomy, even in modern realities.  He is able to plug almost all the devices of the middle price segment from other manufacturers into his belt.  A powerful processor, 3 or 4 gigabytes of RAM and a built-in 64 gigabyte drive are installed on board the device.  The screen is completely excellent.  This is a panel based on AMOLED technology.  The color rendition is simply amazing.  Moreover, the black color is exactly what it should be.  Xiaomi Mi5 is still relevant if only because it supports all existing communication standards and has an excellent main camera that copes with shooting even in complete darkness.  Also, the device has a decent battery life.  He is able to work 2 days from a single battery charge.  And this is an incredible result for the flagship.  Also, the device quietly copes with modern toys.  Although the heaviest he already runs only at the minimum graphics settings.  But this is not so critical.  Xiaomi Mi5 can still serve faithfully for a long time.  Therefore, it is still so popular among knowledgeable users. </p><h2>  User reviews about Xiaomi Mi 5 </h2><p>  So, we are trying to choose a good Xiomi phone.  Which is better?  Find the answer to this question will help us reviews of the owners.  Moreover, in the case of this model there are a lot of them.  Users note that the Mi5 model is characterized by incredible performance with very modest characteristics.  Apparently, the whole point is to optimize the firmware for this particular flagship.  The icons on the Xiomi phone of this model indicate that Sony optics are used here.  That is why the device‚Äôs camera produces such high-quality images.  Users note that the main camera is really impressive.  It is capable of delivering high-quality images even in very poor lighting conditions.  And she is able to freely record video in Full HD at a speed of 60 frames per second.  And all this was in the flagship back in 2016.  According to users, this device will be relevant for at least another 2-3 years.  Although some believe that in five years he will still be able to compete with modern devices.  Be that as it may, the Mi5 is a great option for those who want to get a flagship at a budget price.  And we move on to the next model. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi8 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pianetacellulare.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiomi phone which is better" class="if uuid-3240883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240883.jpg"></div><p>  And this is the latest flagship from a Chinese manufacturer.  It is distinguished by the presence of all advanced technologies and corresponds to modern trends.  For example, if you are thinking about how to connect the Xiomi headphones to the phone, and they are wired, then quit this venture.  The device does not have a jack for connecting classic headphones.  Only wireless can be used.  But this is not the point.  But the main thing is that the device looks exactly the way the modern flagship should look like.  Almost the entire front panel is occupied by an incredible screen based on an AMOLED matrix.  Above the screen is a fashionable "monobrow", in which the necessary sensors, a speaker and a front camera are hidden.  The screen itself is frameless.  The body of the device is made of ceramic, which is very unusual.  On the rear panel is the main photomodule of two lenses and a fingerprint scanner.  The device received the most modern "stuffing".  This is a powerful eight-core processor with a separate unit for controlling artificial intelligence, a powerful graphics adapter, 6 gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of space on the internal drive.  The cameras in the device are simply excellent.  They can create real masterpieces even in complete darkness, and all because their work is controlled by artificial intelligence.  The battery charge of this smartphone lasts for a day and a half.  Not bad for a modern flagship.  Separately, I would like to note that you can install any games on the phone "Xiomi" of this model.  He can easily cope with even the most demanding specimens.  However, this device also stands as it should be for the flagship.  But still much cheaper than the Samsung. </p><h2>  User reviews about Xiaomi Mi8 </h2><p>  We continue to consider this phone "Xiomi".  Its functions are already known to you.  Now it's the turn of the reviews.  What do those who managed to purchase it say about the gadget?  It is worth noting that most users are incredibly enthusiastic about this device.  They like almost everything in it, but the screen and camera are especially happy.  The first, although large, does not cause any discomfort.  And the camera is so cool that it can compete with some iPhone models.  This fact already says a lot.  Particularly impressed users of the ceramic case.  Users note that he looks very beautiful.  And pleasant to the touch.  But they immediately note that it is better to carry a smartphone in a case, since this notorious ceramic is very fragile.  It is enough to fall from a small height onto the carpet - and all this beauty will crumble into small fragments.  So it‚Äôs better not to risk such an expensive device. </p><p>  The feedback on the performance of this Xiomi phone is clear: it's just an airplane.  Users notice that there is still no such game that could load this device in full.  And we willingly believe them, since synthetic tests are more eloquent than any reviews.  This is one of the most powerful devices on the Android operating system of all existing in the modern market. </p><p>  Nevertheless, some found flaws.  First of all, they relate to a fingerprint sensor.  The company decided to use its new development.  But probably they did not bring her to mind.  Therefore, the scanner works very poorly.  It is sometimes "stupid" and "buggy."  But it is still bearable.  But he does not want to recognize wet fingers at all.  And this is a serious flaw.  I want to believe that the company will correct the situation in the new firmware version.  Unless, of course, the problem is associated with a software error, and not with a hardware error. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, to summarize and try to summarize all the information written above.  We tried to talk about the best Xiaomi phones.  User reviews make it clear that the products of this company are clearly worthy of attention.  After all, the manufacturer offers powerful, modern and multifunctional devices for frankly ridiculous money.  The company's lineup is unusually large.  Here everyone can find a smartphone that meets their requirements and financial capabilities.  Xiomi phones have a wide variety of functions.  It all depends on which category the gadget belongs to. </p><p>  But why does the company sell its devices at such prices?  The fact is that ‚ÄúXiomi‚Äù does not earn on sales, but on advertising.  Her signature MIUI shell is full of various advertising content.  Advertising there even in the device‚Äôs setup menu.  But at least the fact that the manufacturer makes it possible to disable advertising completely is good.  In general, devices from this company are a very worthy option for those who want to get a powerful, inexpensive and modern gadget.  The prices for the devices are such that they can, without a doubt, be able to afford everyone.  Even a person with a very modest income.  So it‚Äôs worth buying such a smartphone. </p>
