    <h2>  Amara Wing Resort Comfort 5 *: 2016 reviews, negative comments </h2><p>  Some flaws and shortcomings are inherent in any, even the best hotel.  Amara Wing Resort Comfort 5 * was no exception.  Traveler reviews allow us to talk about such negative points: </p><ul><li>  maids do not replenish the supplies of the tea set (nevertheless, everything you need can be taken for free at the bar); </li><li>  until late at night you will not be allowed to fall asleep music from the night bar, as well as the sounds of a disco from neighboring hotels; </li><li>  lack of sound insulation between numbers; </li><li>  in most cases, cleaning is done after lunch, when guests want to relax in their rooms; </li><li>  the main restaurant‚Äôs menu is too modest for a five-star hotel; </li><li>  the halls of the hotel are very gloomy, and the corridors are practically not lit; </li><li>  the air conditioning in the lobby bar is so powerful that it blows you in minutes; </li><li>  there are practically no places for walking on the territory (this drawback is compensated by the proximity to the city center); </li><li>  wireless internet is very slow; </li><li>  very expensive procedures in the SPA center (similar services in the neighboring Quartet will cost you almost half the price); </li><li>  very cold water in the pools; </li><li>  you can only settle in the bungalow during the "high season", and the rest of the time this zone is closed; </li><li>  "catching" in a Wi-Fi number is almost impossible; </li><li>  the impression is that the animators entertain themselves, not the rest; </li><li>  there is very little entertainment for children (older children gather in companies and come up with activities for themselves); </li><li>  in A La Carte restaurants, waiters are incredibly slow (you can wait almost an hour for an order); </li><li>  the hotel needs redecorating; </li><li>  persistent problems with air conditioners; </li><li>  uncomfortable hard pillows, after sleep on which the neck hurts; </li><li>  a car rental worker is almost never there (it‚Äôs good that there are similar agencies nearby); </li><li>  at a distribution in a restaurant, a queue for hot dishes is often going; </li><li>  the curtains in the rooms do not completely close the windows, and therefore in the morning there is a lot of light in the room that interferes with sleep; </li><li>  there are no bonuses and privileges for regular guests; </li><li>  even if you order and pay for the transfer in advance, this does not mean that someone will meet you at the airport (this is often forgotten); </li><li>  a boring evening show that repeats day after day; </li><li>  despite the fact that the restaurant has a dress code, many guests come to eat almost topless, and the employees do not follow this in any way. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Hotel Amara Wing Resort Comfort (Kemer) leaves a rather mixed impression.  It is worth noting that in most cases the disappointment of tourists is due to the fact that the hotel clearly does not correspond to its five-star status.  If it were the Quartet, there would be much less complaints.  But the prices for accommodation and services are high. </p><p>  What immediately bribes is the location.  In the immediate vicinity there is a clean beach, picturesque mountains and the main street of Kemer.  But the hotel has practically no territory.  A small space is built up very densely, and therefore you will have nowhere to walk.  If we talk about food, it is certainly of high quality, but, again, travelers expect much more from a hotel with 5 stars. </p><p>  Why there are no complaints, it is to the service.  All staff are very polite and do their best to please guests.  At the same time, no one will look askance at you if you do not want to leave a tip.  It is possible that this behavior of employees is caused by total control by senior management, whose representatives are always present at the hotel. </p>
