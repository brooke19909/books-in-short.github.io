    <p>  In statistical demography, urbanization is a process of urban development.  It is characterized by an increase in territory and an increase in population.  For several centuries, <span>this concept has been</span> used as a development strategy for countries with various socio-economic indicators and systems. </p><p>  It should be noted that urbanization is a process that depends on various factors: political, ethnic, economic, psychological, religious, etc.  Since the 19th century, there has been a sharp increase in the growth of cities and the population in them.  If in 1800 the number of citizens around the world was 5%, then by 1980 this figure had increased by eight times. </p><p>  ‚ÄúUrbanization‚Äù - the definition of this term first appeared in Spain in 1867.  What is the reason for this process?  From a socio-philosophical point of view, urbanization is a transition from a traditional <span>social system</span> to a new industrial one.  The increase in the urban population is due to the transformation of rural-type settlements into urban ones, the formation of new megacities and migrations.  In some large cities, an increase in the population is observed not only due to residents from the periphery, but also due to foreign migrants, often illegal.  Also, pendulum migration is characteristic of many megacities, when residents of the surrounding area go to work in the center. </p><p>  Stages of urbanization </p><p>  The first period dates back to the 18-20 centuries and covers the developing <span>countries of North America</span> and Western Europe.  During this time, urbanization caused a population growth from 5% to 13%, the number of citizens increased by 180 million people.  The reason for this was the colonial policy of Great Britain and other European states. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second period dates back to the time of the establishment of imperialism (1900-1950).  It is characterized by the active industrial development of most countries of the world, the growth of large cities.  For 50 years, the number of citizens has increased by another 100 thousand people. </p><p>  The third stage is called "global."  Beginning in the 20th century, this period is closely connected with the scientific and technological revolution.  She brought industrial production and many other industries to a new, higher level. </p><p>  Modern urbanization is one of the most significant factors in globalization throughout the world.  It refers mainly to large cities in which at least 500 thousand inhabitants live. </p><p>  Functions </p><p>  Organizational and unifying - spreads the culture and lifestyle of the city from the center to the provinces. </p><p>  Differentiating.  In the process of mastering by individual areas the achievements of spiritual and material urban culture, very specific and even unique types of activity arise in their midst. </p><p>  As a result of the interaction of various types of settlements (villages, cities and agglomerations), the adaptive potential of the social sphere increases significantly, and spiritual and <span>material culture</span> develops <span>.</span> </p><p>  However, urbanization has negative features.  This is an uneven development of central cities and peripheries, <span>environmental pollution,</span> stress and mental disorders due to the rapidly increasing density of space intended for normal human life. </p><p>  There is also the concept of ‚Äúfalse urbanization‚Äù - this is one of the characteristics of the situation in developing countries.  As a result of agrarian overpopulation of rural areas, their residents, leaving the suburbs, are forced to look for a new place to live in cities.  In this case, the number of jobs becomes insufficient for the employment of the entire population.  <span>Rural residents,</span> arriving in the city, replenish the ranks of the unemployed, and the lack of housing for many of them becomes the cause of the undeveloped outskirts and unsanitary conditions. </p>
