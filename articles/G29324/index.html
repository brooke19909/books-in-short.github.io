One of the largest mobile operators in the country, MTS, is available for connecting auto payment by Sberbank card.  But not everyone wants to recharge the phone automatically using a free service.  How to disable MTS auto payment from a Sberbank card to pay for cellular communication yourself? </p><h2>  Briefly about the service </h2><p>  Sberbank car payment for mobile communications is a free service that saves time when replenishing the balance of a mobile phone.

The client himself chooses what amount of payment will be optimal for him. </p><h2>  MTS auto payment rates from Sberbank </h2><p>  Before disabling the service, you need to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rates of auto payment.  They are designed according to the wishes of customers.  At any time, the Sberbank card holder can edit the terms of auto payment.
