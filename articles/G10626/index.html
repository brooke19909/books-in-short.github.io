Therefore, it’s safe to live and walk there.  This area is located in the western part of the city.  He appeared recently.

Almost the entire area is built up with villas, where mainly couples live.  The buildings here are new and beautiful.  There are household appliances stores, a veterinary clinic.

    <h2>  Sea, beach, pool </h2><p>  This hotel is, of course, urban.  But the public Jumeirah Open Beach is not very far from Citymax Hotel Al Barsha.  Reviews claim that a free shuttle carries there.  According to the rules, you need to register in advance, but most often there is always room.  The bus runs twice a day.  Drive about ten minutes.  This beach is located near the Parus Hotel.  It is not too equipped, sometimes it is windy.  Umbrellas and bedding should be taken with you - they can be rented at the hotel on deposit.  But the coast is wide, not crowded, and the sea is clear.  This beach is very good in the summer heat.  There are showers and cafes with freshly squeezed juices.  Some guests prefer to go to another coast - Marina Beach.  You need to get there by metro and tram.  But the sea there is said to be too warm during the season.  But here it is beautiful in the evening: lights, yachts, luxury.  In general, there are many beaches near the hotel, they are different, you can change them at least every day.  There is a swimming pool on the roof of the hotel building, from where you can see all of Dubai.  It is good to sunbathe in the afternoon and swim in the evening. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  To visit most of <span>Dubai’s attractions,</span> Citymax Hotel Al Barsha Dubai is best served by public transport.  It is cheap and safe.  For example, to use the metro, you need to buy a special card.  For tourists, you need silver, which costs twenty-five dirhams.  The metro is beautiful, there are special cars for women and children.  A visit to the “Burj Khalifa”, for example, will cost you one hundred and thirty dirhams (five - travel and 125 - the entrance ticket to the roof of the famous skyscraper).  By metro you can get to the elite residential area "Dubai Marina".  Of the excursions that can be purchased at the hotel, the most popular sightseeing in Dubai is a trip to Abu Dhabi.  Children will love the Atlantis and Wild Wadi water parks.  You will have to take a taxi to Madinat Jumeirah - Dubai in Venice, but it will cost about twenty dirhams.  There you can not only walk and wander around the real eastern market, but also ride boats in canals.  Many praise desert jeeps and cruises to Oman. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Citymax Hotel Al Barsha" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1652300.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Guests of the Citymax Hotel Al Barsha 3 * (UAE, Dubai), we can say, were lucky.  If they wish to make gifts to friends, family and loved ones, they can do so at Mall Emirates.  Is your travel budget not too big?  Then just walk down the first floor.  There are always discounts.  Pakistani supermarket Lulu sells good and inexpensive Indian knitwear.  And it’s better to buy cheap iPhones in the Ibn Batut mall.  It can be reached by metro.  But to go shopping is best not on Thursday and not on Friday.  This is a weekend in the Emirates, and in malls it is always very crowded. </p><h2>  Citymax Hotel Al Barsha 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists write that CityMax in Dubai is a great city hotel in a convenient location.  Living at this hotel, you can freely move around the city without spending taxis.  The comfort and services of the hotel justify the cost of the room.  The reception staff is attentive, the cooks are excellent, the maids and the cleaners are executive.  Many say that having a rooftop pool is a special bonus.  Tourists in their reviews only advise taking more swimsuits per shift, because things in this climate dry for a long time.  The hotel leaves a very pleasant impression, and the vast majority of guests recommend it for a visit.  It is good for excursions, and for shopping, and for a beach holiday.  No wonder she got into the top twenty hotels by the rating of the TripAdvisor website in two thousand and thirteen. </p>
