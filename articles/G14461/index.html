    <h2>  Finam: what is it? </h2><p>  The fact that Finam is an investment company, a broker on the stock exchange, reviews are mentioned very often.  But what lies behind these words?  After all, the name of the company and the designation of its field of activity is only the tip of the iceberg.  In fact, this huge holding specializing in investing unites a group of companies.  One of them is investment.  At the moment, the Russian stock market is in the top.  A separate subject of pride is the customer base.  It is known that Finam IC has the largest number of active clients. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Finam Investment Company is a broker whose reviews are credible (of course, you need to understand that only someone who knows the market mechanisms can earn, and not everyone who first arrives), but at the same time it is also a bank.  As a banking structure, Finam offers a variety of cash related services.  Clients of the company are not only legal entities, but also individuals.  In recent years, the head office has been actively working on expansion, so many regional representative offices were opened.  This made the name ‚ÄúFinam‚Äù familiar to ordinary people from various parts of the country.  Such fame creates an additional positive image (coupled with positive reviews) for the Forex broker Finam. </p><h2>  Finam: who else is part of the holding? </h2><p>  The structure also includes Finam Management.  It provides services to individuals, managing their investments: assets, stocks, securities, pension savings.  This company works actively interacting with institutional clients, that is, SK, PF, SRO and other similar legal entities.  There are a lot of positive reviews about the Finam broker (the rating is also high) as an educational center.  In fact, this is not part of the broker's activity, but a separate company, also included in the group of companies.  It offers educational services and in the field of its specialization (work in the stock market) in Russia is currently the leader.  Every year, tens of thousands of individuals go through training programs and become qualified, successful investors.  Of course, mostly flattering reviews about the Finam broker sound on their part, and the comments explain in detail what the main advantages of working with this company are. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The holding includes its own news agency, which occupies the top positions in ratings among publications monitoring the financial world.  This is exactly what IA helps to develop business portals.  It should be noted that analytics and accurate information about what is happening in the world of money are really important for those working on the exchange, and their own IA creates a good reputation for the company.  This also explains the abundance of positive reviews about the Finam broker.  St. Petersburg, Moscow, and other large cities are rich in news publications, but access to truly timely and reliable information is not always available.  This is exactly what the organization in question provides. </p><p>  In addition, the group of companies includes a European broker operating in the international market, a specially licensed American broker and a broker who has received membership in NASDAQ. </p><h2>  To summarize: what do we know about the company? </h2><p>  So, the reviews about the Finam MICEX broker are positive, which can be explained by the huge capabilities of the group of companies.  The company has significant resources and can afford to create comfortable working conditions for all customers.  This allowed in 2014 to occupy the first line of the rating among Russian brokers.  Turnovers already became more than seven trillion, and since then the amount has only increased. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Today, residents of more than a hundred Russian cities have access to Finam branches, and the broker continues to expand.  The company has its own offices in several countries, including representative offices in the USA, Asia, and Europe.  Several mutual funds have already been opened, a diverse service in the field of financial management has been offered.  Finam consolidates the packages of the most promising, developed companies from the field of information technology - in a word, it keeps abreast and looks far ahead.  The company has been operating since 1994, focuses on the promotion of innovative technologies, on which it was able to create a solid base for development today and in the future. </p><h2>  We work together: what business to build? </h2><p>  Nevertheless, the Finam broker is known among a wide range of people.  The reviews also clearly demonstrate this: there is a lot of information about the company as an intermediary for working on the stock exchange, but narrower categories of people resort to the services of a bank or management company.  How can I work with a company?  Key features: </p><ul><li>  stock market; </li><li>  Currencies </li><li>  urgent section; </li><li>  <span>American exchanges</span> ; </li><li>  Mutual fund; </li><li>  automatic follow; </li><li>  financial management. </li></ul><h2>  Auto follow </h2><p>  About how it works, say reviews about the Forex broker "Finam".  First, the user opens an account, where he credits a certain amount, then selects a strategy.  You can become a member of one of the strategies of a trading center.  This gives you access to information about transactions concluded by professionals, you can simply copy their behavior. </p>

    <p>  An alternative is to choose to follow one of the successful market players.  The system will automatically repeat the actions of the selected person, and you do not need to develop your own strategy.  Reviews of Finam brokers who resorted to this opportunity are mostly positive.  However, the fact that the object of succession will make an unsuccessful transaction is not ruled out.  Then the next one will repeat it too.  This risk must be recognized and constantly analyzed.  But if a market player has already succeeded as a trader, he can become the character to be followed.  Each subscriber will bring a certain amount of money, a reward for success.  Such a double encouragement from the broker encourages you to work more and more productively.  As the reviews of Finam broker's clients show, it is the market participants who have acquired followers who are most satisfied with the company's service and their earnings. </p><h2>  Believe it or not? </h2><p>  Reviews about the Finam broker on the virtual web are rather contradictory.  Of course, there are many more positive ones, but there are also negative ones.  Each negative response gives rise to a rather strong distrust, which means that the potential trader will think twice whether to trust this company.  Of course, the holding is large, therefore, probably reliable, but its internal kitchen is unknown to outsiders, so it is necessary to carefully evaluate the risks so as not to be a loser. </p><p>  In fact, reviews of the Finam broker most closely resemble the information war.  This is explained simply - the services of an intermediary in the stock market in Russia today are provided by many companies, forced to fight for each client.  And when there is no way to operate with factors that attract a potential participant in the system, you have to resort to the opposite marketing strategy, namely to denigrate a successful competitor.  Evaluating such tactics of conducting an ‚Äúinformation war‚Äù, one should not think that Finam is an injured party, in fact, all participants contribute a lot, and the person who is trying to find out where the reviews about the Finam broker are real and true, and where - far-fetched. </p><h2>  How it works? </h2><p>  How often do you write positive reviews if you liked the <span>services, service, service</span> ?  Usually a person rarely thinks to leave a positive response.  Having received the necessary, having come to success, they soon forget about the method used or continue to regularly resort to it, especially without advertising this information.  But if you didn‚Äôt like something, then you immediately want to convey this to the outside world.  On the one hand, this is reasonable - everyone should know what troubles to be prepared for.  On the other hand, the picture can be created and incorrect, literally turned upside down - the service is good, but only satisfied customers don‚Äôt write responses, and those who do not have a relationship with the resource, the company spare no time and emotions to create a negative review about the broker ‚ÄúFinam ". </p>

    <p>  It follows from the described logic (one can assume that the reader agrees with it) that there will always be more negative responses than positive ones.  But the criticality of information processing involves an assessment of not only this factor, but also an analysis of those reviews that can be found on the World Wide Web.  The fact is that often on different sites there are completely identical negative reviews about the Finam broker.  That is, one person dissatisfied with the system shares his opinion through different portals.  On the one hand, it can be understood - he wants to convey his experience to many.  On the other hand, it gives the false impression that it is not one user, but many.  But the authors of positive feedback do not do so. </p><h2>  What to count on? </h2><p>  To form a more or less folding, clear, fair picture, you really need to work a lot on the reviews, bring them together.  This will allow us to note that in general there are more positive responses, and negative ones usually come down to complaints about the Finam broker commission.  Reviews often contain wishes for the complete absence of one or its significant reduction.  At the same time, in comparison with competitors, the company has quite decent service tariffs. </p><p>  On the other hand, cooperation with Finam will allow working with the oldest company in the Russian market in the chosen direction, and even with good geographical coverage, which in itself gives rise to trust in the enterprise.  The project offers a useful virtual resource filled with relevant information for traders, regularly updated and allowing better orientation in the currency world.  Useful tools have been developed and implemented, including unique ones that are absent from competitors.  And for all this, as you can see from the positive reviews about the Finam broker, the tariffs are quite reasonable.  Of course, not for free, well, cheese without payment can only be, as you know, in a mousetrap. </p><h2>  Opportunities and disadvantages </h2><p>  In collaboration with Finam, a trader gains access to an abundance of <span>trading platforms.</span>  This makes it possible to choose the most convenient option for yourself.  Among competitors, it is Finam that can offer the largest variety of trading platforms.  The holding also received many awards for its long work confirming the quality of work.  Comfortable conditions for cooperation were developed for participants, and for those who wish to improve, they have their own center, regularly inviting distance and full-time training.  Outreach courses are also held for residents of other cities.  Such seminars allow you to learn more about the Forex market and possibly find your calling in life.  Finally, to start your career with Finam, you need to have a fairly small amount.  Starting capital - about 30,000 rubles.  You can take part in seminars, including virtual ones, for the company's customers for free.  If it was decided to open an IIS, an additional percentage relies on all available funds. </p>

    <p>  But if we talk about the shortcomings, then most of them can be seen from the very negative reviews that spoil the reputation of the company.  Many note that it is very difficult to enter, figure out how to work with the company.  This is due to the specifics of the work, because Finam simultaneously represents two brokers.  An abundance of trading terminals, a variety of user accounts, a lot of accounts, tools, buttons - information on a beginner crashes with an avalanche, and it is easy to lose orientation in it.  If this data stream did not scare off from the very beginning, then in the future it is not difficult to come to success.  The most important thing is to understand the period of entry into the system. </p><h2>  Sociability - minus or plus? </h2><p>  Many users of the Finam trading platform note that when saving contact information on the site, it is then difficult to get rid of the ongoing flow of calls from the holding service.  And practically all users of the Finam trading platform, one way or another, leave contact information, even if only a demo version of the account is opened to study the toolkit of the program. </p>

    <p>  Over time, users are really bored that they are being attacked by phone calls, operators are regularly interested in whether the site is convenient, whether there is a desire to continue working and when the client decides to open a permanent account.  However, if the demo version was interesting and it was decided to work with the company, during the next such call you can check with the operator any questions of interest.  Since the consultants are experienced, have access to a database of the company‚Äôs work, they can quickly answer any questions.  And at first there are, as you know, a lot of questions, and this is only exacerbated by the not-so-clear system interface. </p><h2>  Efficiency and Earnings </h2><p>  Perhaps the most interesting part of the reviews are those that describe the opportunity to make money with Finam.  This information is somewhat contradictory.  Someone complains that the money was invested, there was no earnings, and even the little that was able to get, problems with the withdrawal collapsed.  Others firmly assure that they have been working with Finam for many years and regularly receive a lot of money.  To understand where the truth is, it is worth taking a closer look at the logic of the company.  The fact is that the services of a broker, although paid, do not guarantee profit. </p>

    <p>  A program participant invests hard-earned money in the system, and then he himself decides how to dispose of these funds.  Of course, some actions can lead to loss, others will be a source of good gain.  Functionality of automatic follow has already been mentioned.  It is suitable for those who are not confident in their own abilities and the ability to make the right decision when concluding a transaction.  If the user is ready to take responsibility, spend time creating his own strategy or mastering the already well-known effective one, then one can expect more success than with automatic transactions.  On the other hand, there is a risk in both cases.  With an unsuccessful transaction, you can‚Äôt not only put something in your pocket, but you can also lose your money. </p><h2>  How to avoid? </h2><p>  Many experienced users of Finam trading floors say that avoiding failure is easy.  Just first you need to delve into the functionality of the service provided by the broker, and then understand the work of the stock market, especially the selected sector.  Understanding its mechanisms and laws, evaluating the dependence on external factors, incoming information, we can learn to accurately predict the development of the situation.  And this will be a guaranteed guarantee of regular earnings. </p>

    <p>  Of course, with a snap, you should not expect profits from the very beginning.  Moreover, it is the beginners who have the greatest risk of losing money.  To this end, Finam developed a test mode that allows you to first get acquainted with the capabilities and mechanisms of the system for free, and only then invest in the program.  Already in the demo version, the user can evaluate his abilities and try to understand whether it suits him or not.  However, we will be honest, in the same reviews there are many references to the fact that the demo version is much simpler than the real functionality.  There, of course, there are many opportunities for managing an account, but nevertheless, management has been reduced in comparison with a real trading platform.  In addition, managing virtual money is simple, it is not related to stress, even recklessly.  But when it comes to real risk, with your own finances, earned, as they say, later with blood, then your nerves can take it, especially at first. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p> Reviews about the work of the Finam broker as a whole inspire confidence in this large company, which is stable in the Russian market of investment services.  But no one can guarantee the success of earnings with this intermediary due to the specifics of the region - transactions on the stock exchange.  Therefore, the experience of interacting with the company will be positive only if the person is ready to responsibly approach the work, invest all his strength in it.  Then the return will not disappoint.  But users who neglected the capabilities and responsibilities of the trader were disappointed - they didn‚Äôt earn anything, and they lost nothing. </p>
