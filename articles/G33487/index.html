Or cute figurines made of similar material, chic candlesticks and much more.  This beauty always delights and makes you want to have such decorative elements in your home.  This begs the question: how much does it cost and is it possible to make such beauty with your own hands?  Of course you can.  There are several simple options for making gypsum figures.  This article will provide recommendations to help you understand how to make gypsum flowers at home. </p><h2>  The first option: from artificial flowers </h2><p>  To make flowers at home, we need: </p><ul><li>  Artificial flowers. </li><li>  Powder gypsum. </li><li>  Dyes for flowers. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.blissbridalmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="step by step work" class="if uuid-3050968" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112111/3050968.jpg"></div><p>  All of these items can be found in any hardware store.  Flowers can be from any material.  It can be either specially acquired or unnecessary, from any outdated compositions. </p><p>  First you need to prepare a workplace where the production of flowers will take place.  According to the instructions on the packaging, we prepare gypsum.  Stir the solution carefully and slowly so that no bubbles appear.  You can immediately add dye to the mixture to obtain a fully colored flower.  Attach a wire to the prepared flowers to make it convenient to hang for drying. After all preparations, immerse the artificial flower in a plaster mix.  Gently remove and hang to dry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.studiofmp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="drying flowers" class="if uuid-3050948" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112111/3050948.jpg"></div><p>  After our plaster flower has dried out, it can be additionally stained, add sparkles or droplets of artificial dew.  After decoration, you need to cover the product with varnish. </p><h2>  Second option: use silicone molds </h2><p>  He is also very simple.  Thanks to the simple process, you can attract children to work.  Such a plaster flower will rightfully take its place in the children's room, and the child will be able to show it to his friends.  For work, we need: </p><ul><li>  Plaster or alabaster. </li><li>  Paints. </li><li>  Silicone flower shapes. </li><li>  Paints and items for decoration. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Silicone molds" class="if uuid-3051354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112111/3051354.jpg"></div><p>  As in the previous example, all the necessary materials can be purchased at the store.  Pour the prepared mixture into molds.  You can immediately attach pieces of thread, if in the future you want to hang the product on the wall.  After drying, we take out the flower from the mold and decorate it with paints, sparkles, rhinestones, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bas-relief on the wall </h2><p>  To decorate the walls, many resort to a bas-relief.  If you want to do everything yourself, you need to be prepared for the fact that this is a very time-consuming process.  Perhaps it is better to use the services of professionals.  If you decide to make gypsum flowers on the wall yourself, then you can use stencils and forms that are sold in hardware stores.  Following the instructions, we bring our work to life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tah-heetch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wall application" class="if uuid-3050958" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112111/3050958.jpg"></div><p>  This composition will look amazing in your room and bring style and richness to the interior.  You can also make a wall composition yourself, without patterns and shapes.  To do this, it is enough to cut the necessary details of flowers, leaves and additional accessories from cardboard and polystyrene.  Plaster everything and use glue to assemble the bas-relief on the wall.  If the parts are quite large, then you need to put the wire inside, it will act as a reinforcement.  Small parts can be molded manually and also attached to the wall.  It can be small leaves, berries, clusters of grapes, etc. </p><p>  The next step is to close all the seams.  They can be hidden both with gypsum and with white sealant.  We process the finished product with a primer, it will not allow the bas-relief to get dirty and crumble. </p><div class="photo" data-original="boschettodecorazioni.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="plaster pono" class="if uuid-3051002" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112111/3051002.jpg"></div><h2>  Garden sculptures </h2><p>  When summer comes, we all try to decorate our personal plots, cottages or houses - we plant flowers and get all kinds of figurines or lanterns.  You can make a decorative flower with your own hands, which will give the landscape additional chic.  In order to make a large garden flower from gypsum, we need to purchase the appropriate material and form for filling. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Garden flowers" class="if uuid-3051374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112111/3051374.jpg"></div><p>  We can also use children's sand pyramids.  After our flower hardens, we take it out of shape, sand it with sandpaper and paint it in several layers with acrylic paint.  If necessary, add sparkles or rhinestones, which are glued with glue, and complete the entire process by applying varnish.  Our plaster flower is ready. </p><p>  Such sculptures will complement the living composition in the flowerbed or become a wonderful decoration of the porch.  You can beautifully design a playground for children.  As shown in the photo, plaster flowers will fit beautifully into your landscape design. </p><h2>  Plaster Crafts </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself flowers in plaster not only look chic on their own, but can also be part of many compositions.  For example, you can arrange a frame for photographs, strew it with many small plaster flowers, or create a beautiful candlestick in the form of a blossoming flower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.studiofmp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="plaster candle holder" class="if uuid-3050945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112111/3050945.jpg"></div><p>  A plaster flower stand can be a great housewarming gift.  With these colors and additional elements to them, you can arrange interior arches or cornices.  Caskets or jars look very beautiful for all kinds of women's little things.  If the jar covers for trifles are made in the same style, they will look harmoniously on the dressing table in the bedroom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="madeheart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts on the wall" class="if uuid-3051018" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112111/3051018.jpg"></div><h2>  Dried flower in plaster </h2><p>  For the manufacture of gypsum flower arrangements, not only shapes and artificial plants can be used.  Dry harvested in advance is also perfect.  Loved one gave you a bouquet of gorgeous roses?  Over time, the flowers will fade and fall off.  To save it for a long time, the flowers can be dried and used for interior composition: </p><ol><li>  Dilute the gypsum in warm water to the consistency of sour cream. </li><li>  Dip each flower in a solution and hang it on a rope so that the gypsum freezes. </li><li>  After drying, the bouquet can be painted and brought flowers in proper form. </li></ol><p>  Now just put the composition in a vase, and your bouquet will remain with you for a long time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Plaster Wreath" class="if uuid-3051355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112111/3051355.jpg"></div><p>  On New Year's holidays, you can decorate the house with thematic crafts.  Gypsum or fir branches to plaster and arrange a Christmas wreath with a beautiful candlestick and New Year's toys.  Such a decor element can be placed on a chest of drawers or a fireplace.  Bring children to work, this will help to develop fine motor skills of hands, develop a sense of color and aesthetic taste. </p>
