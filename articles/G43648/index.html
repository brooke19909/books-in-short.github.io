First of all, they say this because the swimming season is the longest in the country.  Already in mid-April, in the bay of Alanya, you can see the first bathers.  Local beaches empty only by November.  They are mostly narrow, coated with dense yellow sand.  Moreover, this resort has a very gentle entry into the water.  All this creates truly ideal conditions for recreation for those tourists who go on vacation with their children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Orient Suite Hotel 3" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2112535.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, Alanya has a very developed tourist infrastructure.  There are countless places where you can have fun, for example, discos and bars, restaurants and nightclubs.  The resort even has its own amusement park.  A visit to the Water Planet water park with twenty-three slides is remembered by many, especially children.  The resort has a lot of young people. </p><p>  One of the surroundings of Alanya, which is part of it, is Incekum - an eight-kilometer stretch on the Mediterranean coast.  The beaches of this resort village are covered with very fine sand.  It is precisely because of this that the name of the area appeared (Inzhekum ‚Äã‚Äãtranslated - "fine sand").  The mountains here form an arched wide bay.  That is why the climate here is so convenient for families with children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Flat beaches, turquoise water in the sea, beautiful nature, lack of wind - all this contributes to the popularity of the resort. </p><p>  Another no less important advantage of the resort of Alanya is its relatively inexpensive accommodation.  Prices in local hotels are ten to fifteen percent lower than in counterparts located in other Turkish cities.  It should be borne in mind that there are practically no prestigious hotels in the region: here the hotel fund is represented mainly by two or three star options, one of which is the Orient Suite Hotel 3 * (Turkey, Incekum-Alania).  For several years now, Russian tourists have chosen it.  This article provides their feedback, as well as information about the location and services provided at this hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Orient Suite Hotel 3 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2112542.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Orient Suite Hotel 3 * was built in 2002.  Several times it was a complete update.  The last major overhaul of the hotel was made in 2014.  Judging by the reviews, the hotel territory is small - two thousand square meters.  However, it is well equipped and completely surrounded by greenery.  Location Orient Suite Hotel 3 * is quite successful.  Only the highway separates it from the sea.  At the same time, the hotel is located in the very center of the resort, within walking distance of many facilities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Nearby are many interesting places that tourists can visit.  For example, the famous Water Planet water park operates in half an hour's walk, at the same distance are the gardens of Alanya, the Red Tower, the Archaeological Museum, etc. </p><p>  The International Airport Terminal (Antalya) is a two-hour drive from the hotel.  This is perhaps the biggest minus Orient Suite Hotel 3 *.  Feedback from Russians who have already visited it suggests that the transfer is quite long and exhausting for young children.  Therefore, this hotel is mainly chosen by those tourists who are not afraid of this circumstance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Orient Suite Hotel 3 Turkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2112536.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, the vast majority of Russians are satisfied with their stay spent in Orient Suite Hotel 3 *.  Alanya, as our compatriots say, is one of the best Turkish resorts, including the price level of hotels.  Both check-in and check-out are made clearly according to the schedule established by the rules of the hotel.  Guests must leave the room before noon, and keys can be received at two in the afternoon.  Calculation can be made both in cash or using the cards of the most famous systems.  For a surcharge, guests have access to an airport shuttle.  For the use of air conditioning in the apartments you need to pay ten euros per day, and in standard rooms - seven. </p><h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  Orient Suite Hotel 3 * in size is considered a small hotel.

I must say that many Russians choose this concept in order to disconnect from everyday worries on vacation and not think about food.

    <p>  As part of the all-inclusive concept, guests can enjoy free local drinks and sandwiches at the poolside bar throughout the day. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  Orient Suite Hotel 3 * is focused not only on youth, but also for tourists who come with small children.  For the latter, a playground has been arranged on site, there is also a shallow compartment in the adult pool.  Parents can get a cot in the room upon request.  The restaurant in the public domain always has high chairs for the convenience of feeding babies.  If desired, you can invite a nanny to your room upon request: the service is paid. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  To the sea only three hundred meters.  You need to go through a not very busy road.  There is a ground crosswalk. </p><p>  Beach own, with a sand covering.  Sunbeds and umbrellas with a bracelet of this hotel guests receive free of charge.  The entrance to the sea is gentle, without stones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Orient Suite Hotel 3 Turkey reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2112540.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  This three-star hotel has an outdoor pool with sun loungers and parasols around it.  There is also a bar. </p><p>  In Orient Suite Hotel 3 * there are no rooms for disabled guests.  Pets, including guide dogs, are not allowed.  You can connect to the Internet for free only in the lobby at the reception desk. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The main range is presented on the beach.  There is no entertainment on the territory of the hotel itself.  Of the free games, only darts and ping pong are presented.  But on the seashore you can buy all kinds of water activities, including parasailing, cheesecake or banana riding.  Here you can rent a boat or catamaran. </p><p>  A paid service is also a massage course on site or a visit to a beauty salon. </p><h2>  Orient Suite Hotel 3 * (Turkey): reviews </h2><p>  The vast majority of Russians liked this hotel.  The reviews separately noted a good location: on the one hand, there are many necessary infrastructures nearby, and on the other, you can count on silence and privacy. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned regularly, towels are changed daily.  Despite the relatively new plumbing, there are no interruptions in hot water.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  Guests at this hotel are very welcome. </p><p>  In the restaurant, judging by the reviews, quite acceptable service.  The products on the trays are always fresh, although not always varied.  The beach is beautiful and always clean.  But although most reviews about staying at Orient Suite Hotel 3 * are positive, there are also negative ones. </p><p>  The biggest drawback is the Russians call poor service in the main restaurant and a lot of convenience foods on the menu.  Another circumstance that caused discontent among our compatriots was the lines and the fact that both non-smokers and smokers were sitting in the same room in the dining room.  Moreover, even hotel staff can afford to smoke in the restaurant. </p><p>  In general, many Russians noted the rest in Orient Suite Hotel 3 * as good.  And the beach, and the clear sea, and the conditions acceptable for living - all this was noted by many tourists who visited it.  Yes, of course, the hotel is not a five-star hotel, but the cost of the tours is very affordable. </p>
