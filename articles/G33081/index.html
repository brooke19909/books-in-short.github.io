The characteristics of the device are rather mediocre.  Along with this model, another device appeared on the market - Asha 306. They can be safely called twins that complement each other.  They differ in the support of two ‚ÄúSIM cards‚Äù - it is implemented only in a smartphone with an index of 305. This decision by the Finnish manufacturer made buyers think about the choice, preferring certain options.  The average cost of a gadget is about 4 thousand rubles.  For this money, the user gets a 3-inch touch screen, Series 40 software, a 2 megapixel optical module.  Let's get acquainted in detail not only with the characteristics of the smartphone, but also with the reviews of the owners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 305 feature" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2140936.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Sizes, appearance, materials </h2><p>  We will begin to study characteristics of <span>Nokia Asha 305</span> with appearance.  The phone has standard case sizes: thickness - 12.8 mm, width - 53.8 mm, height - 110.3 mm.  Many users will think that the smartphone is quite thick, but you need to understand that it was released five years ago, and at that time this figure was within the normal range.  The gadget is very light.  Its mass does not exceed 100 g. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the front panel there are: a touch screen, two control keys (receive and reset a call), a speaker.  In the upper and lower parts of the body there are pads with a glossy surface.  The remaining panels are made of matte plastic.  The manufacturer introduced the buyer several color solutions.  The originality of the smartphone is given by the beveled side edges and smooth lines of the case. </p><p>  At the upper end, the developers located the connectors for the charger (2 mm), microUSB and a mini-jack (3.5 mm).  On the opposite side is a small strap mount.  The side faces are quite informative.  The on / off key (it also performs the function of locking the screen) and the volume ‚Äúswing‚Äù are displayed on the right side.  On the left are slots for an external drive and a SIM card.  In order to prevent the ingress of dust and other small particles of debris, these connectors were covered with plastic plugs.  On the back of the phone are the camera lens and speaker hole. </p><p>  Reviews about the assembly can be found only positive.  The case, although plastic, but there are no deflections and crunching when pressed.  Ergonomics at a high level.  Tactile sensations are pleasant, it is convenient to hold the device in the palm of your hand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia asha 305 specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2140937.jpg"></div>

RAM, the developers installed only 32 MB.  This, of course, can not be compared with modern gadgets, but in reality it is more than enough.  Built-in storage is also not surprising in large volumes.  Only 64 MB are implemented in the phone, of which 54 MB are already taken.  But do not be upset ahead of time, because to increase memory you can use a 32 GB flash card.  Note that the manufacturer provides a 2 GB external drive in the kit. </p><p>  The Nokia 305 specification clearly demonstrates that this device belongs to entry-level devices.  It does not work on Windows Phone, but on Series 40. However, the smartphone owners claim that the interface is very convenient and intuitive.  In a locked state, missed events (notifications), date and current time are displayed on the screen.  The process of unlocking itself is quite simple - swipe left or right.  On the desktop there is a service line on which the signal of the mobile operator, clock, battery status, activated mode is displayed.  Applications for quick access are selected in the settings menu.  There are two keyboards: the first is standard, the second is QWERTY.  In the reviews, users assure that the latter is not very convenient to use, since with quick typing, the probability of clicking on the next character (letter) is significantly increased. </p><p>  The phone only works with second-generation networks.  There is bluetooth and an FM radio.  A microUSB port is provided for connecting to a PC.  The lack of Wi-Fi support is the biggest drawback. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia asha 305 phone specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2140938.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nokia 305 screen: specifications and reviews </h2><p>  In 2012, a phone with a 3-inch screen was still a novelty.  The device has a resistive display that recognizes the touch not only of fingers, but also of other objects (pencil, pen, etc.).  The resolution is modest - 400 √ó 240 px.  Matrix - TFT.  The maximum number of colors is 65 thousand.  Viewing angles are average, but using the phone is quite comfortable.  The image is colorful.  In the reviews, users claim that the screen shows good results, but its characteristics are significantly inferior to the gadgets of the middle segment. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the smartphone does not provide for backlight adjustment.  There is also no familiar proximity sensor, so the screen locks automatically during a call. </p><p>  Users were impressed with the Nokia 305's sensor specifications.  Sensitivity is within normal limits.  The accuracy of pressing is not always on top, but you can get used to it.  The main thing is that the sensor works correctly even in winter and recognizes a gloved touch. </p><h2>  Camera Features and Owner Reviews </h2><p>  How did owners evaluate the camera capabilities of the Nokia 305?  The characteristics of optics, of course, will not impress a modern user.  The phone uses a 2-megapixel module located on the back of the case (there is no front camera).  The maximum photo resolution is 1600 √ó 1200 px.  You can shoot movies using the camera.  The recording speed is 10 frames per second.  Resolution - 176 √ó 144 px. </p><p>  Reviews about the quality of photos can hardly be called enthusiastic.  The pictures are, frankly, mediocre.  The menu is convenient.  There are portrait and landscape modes.  Users noticed that the manufacturer provided only standard effects: sepia, negative, etc. If necessary, you can change the lighting using the following modes "incandescent lamp", "daylight" and so on. </p><p>  In the comments, users say that the image in the pictures is quite blurry.  On the big screen, pixelation is very noticeable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 305 specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2140939.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Battery Life </h2><p>  Most Finnish devices have gained popularity due to the high autonomy results.  The Nokia 305 was no exception. Battery specifications: </p><ul><li>  chemical composition - lithium-ion; </li><li>  type - removable; </li><li>  capacity - 1110 mAh. </li></ul><p>  Given the equipment of the phone, we can say that this battery provides up to 2 days of operation on a single charge.  Official data from the manufacturer: </p><ul><li>  standby time - 22 days; </li><li>  talk time - about 14 hours </li></ul>

The advantages include high-quality speaker, loud sound, comfortable control keys, decent battery life. </p>
