However, this does not mean that they do not undergo changes.  The latest <span>methods of geographical research</span> are appearing <span>,</span> which can significantly expand the capabilities of mankind and the borders of the unknown.  But before you consider these innovations, you need to understand the usual classification. </p><p>  Methods of geographical research are various ways of obtaining information in the framework of the science of geography.  They are divided into several groups.  So, the <span>cartographic method</span> is the use of maps as the main <span>source of information.</span>  They can give an idea not only about the relative position of objects, but also about their size, the degree to which various phenomena are spread and a lot of useful information. </p><p>  The statistical method says that it is impossible to consider and study peoples, countries, natural objects without using statistical data.  That is, it is very important to know what is the depth, height, reserves of <span>natural resources of</span> a particular territory, its area, the population of a particular country, its demographic indicators, as well as production indicators. </p><p>  The historical method implies that our world has developed and everything on the planet has its own rich history.  Thus, in order to study modern geography, it is necessary to have knowledge about the history of the development of the Earth itself and humanity living on it. </p><p>  Methods of geographical research continues the economic and mathematical method.  These are nothing but numbers: calculations of mortality, birth rate, <span>population density,</span> resource supply, migration balance, and so on. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The comparative geographical method</span> helps to more fully evaluate and describe the differences and similarities of geographical objects.  After all, everything in this world can be compared: less or more, slower or faster, lower or higher, and so on.  This method allows you to make classifications of geographical features and predict their changes. </p><p>  Methods of geographical research cannot be imagined without observation.  They can be continuous or periodic, area and route, distance or stationary, all the less they provide the most important data on the development of geographical objects and the changes that they undergo.  It is impossible to study geography while sitting at a desk in an office or at a school desk in a classroom, you need to learn how to extract useful information from what you can see with your own eyes. </p><p>  One of the important methods for the study of geography has been and remains a method of geographical zoning.  This is the allocation of economic and natural (physical-geographical) areas.  No less important is the method of geographical modeling.  From the school bench, we all know the most striking example of a geographical model - the globe.  But modeling can be machine, mathematical, and graphic. </p><p>  Geographic forecasting is the ability to predict the consequences that may arise as a result of the development of mankind.  This method allows you to reduce the negative impact of human activities on the environment, avoid undesirable phenomena, rationally use all kinds of resources and so on. </p><p>  Modern methods of geographical research have revealed to the world GIS - geographic information systems, that is, a set of digital maps, software and statistics attached to them, which enable people to work with maps directly on a computer.  And thanks to the Internet, sub-satellite positioning systems, popularly known as GPS, have appeared.  They consist of ground-based tracking tools, navigation satellites and various instruments that receive information and determine the coordinates. </p>
