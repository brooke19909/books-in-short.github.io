If not on a full vacation, then at least for the <span>May holidays.</span>  And indeed, if fate rewarded you with life in the southwestern region of Russia, why not move a little further south - closer to the warm sea and the dazzling sun?  Moreover, the bus to the sea from Voronezh is not so long and expensive to travel.  In this article we will consider several options for such a trip.  Many tourists from Voronezh have already made their way to the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory in their own cars.  If you don‚Äôt have a car (or you don‚Äôt want to beat it on the famous Russian roads), you can use public transport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours on the sea from Voronezh" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1219137.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  We are going to Yeysk </h2><p>  The nearest sea from Voronezh is Azov.  This shallow water area with wide sandy beaches and gentle entry into the water is suitable for families with children.  There are many resorts on the Russian shores of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, but the most popular of them is Yeysk.  This city is located in the south of the <span>Taganrog Bay.</span>  In the Temryuk region there are mud volcanoes and, accordingly, balneological resorts.  If you are planning to take a bus to the sea from Voronezh with a small child, it is better not to delay your trip.  We must strive to make the path as short as possible.  Therefore, it is best to choose the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  Two buses go to Yeysk and <span>Dolzhanskaya village</span> - From Moscow and St. Petersburg.  Both routes follow through Voronezh.  But it should be said that these buses are not scheduled, but tourist.  In order to reserve a seat in them and buy a ticket, you should contact the travel agency. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="From Voronezh to the sea" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1218931.jpg" width="600"></div>

By bus, overcoming this distance will take about eight hours.  But it‚Äôs too early to go to the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov on May holidays.  And the resorts of this reservoir are significantly inferior to Sochi in infrastructure.  Well, if you go to relax on the sea, then on the Black.  Here we have several possibilities.  Firstly, a service such as blah blah car.  This is a trip in a private car, the driver of which is with you along the way.  Prices on average - one thousand seven hundred rubles per passenger.  But to find such a car on an acceptable date for you is quite difficult.  And buses run regularly.  And, unlike those passing in the direction of Yeysk, they depart directly from Voronezh. </p><h2>  Destinations in the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory </h2><p>  Travel agencies have already run in two routes - to Anapa and Adler.  If you want to travel by bus to the sea from Voronezh as comfortably as possible, it is best to contact the agency.  There are several of them in the city.  Most serve brand new buses with a media system, toilet and air conditioning.  It is not necessary to buy a ticket to the final stop.  You can go to any resort you like.  The Voronezh-Adler bus makes stops in Tuapse, Lazarevsky, Loo and Sochi.  At your request, the driver can drop you off in Lermontovo or Dzhugba, Olginka, Novomikhailovsky, Agoy, Gebug, Magri, Shepsi, Ashe.  Volkonke, Khost.  Dagomys, Anchor and Blue Slits, Golovinka and Vardana.  The route Voronezh - Anapa makes mandatory stops in Gelendzhik and Novorossiysk.  At the request of passengers, the driver can drop them off in Arkhipo-Osipovka, Pshad, Divnomorsky and Kabardinka. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The nearest sea from Voronezh" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1218938.jpg" width="600"></div>

The regularity of the runs depends on the season.  For example, in May, buses run once every six days.  But this is in the offer of one travel agency.  Surely there are several more in the city sending their buses towards Greater Sochi.  In peak season, there are several flights on the mentioned routes daily.  It takes about seventeen hours to get to Adler.  Buses depart from <span>Voronezh</span> railway <span>station,</span> from pl.  Chernyakhovsky.  Tickets are sold at the box offices of the agencies "Lux Tour" and "Trans-Flight".  Buses arrive at the railway station in Adler or Kurortny Prospekt in Anapa.  How much does it cost to get a bus to the sea from Voronezh?  If to Yeysk, then the ticket price will be about two and a half thousand rubles.  Travel to Adler will cost more.  The exact price depends on the travel agency.  But on average, a ticket costs about three and a half thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="by bus to the sea from Voronezh" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1219129.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tours to the sea from Voronezh </h2><p>  Many travelers recommend buying round-trip tickets, as the resorts do not have ticket offices for these travel agencies.  These travel agencies provide a variety of services to their clients.  After all, you can pay not only for travel in the direction of Voronezh - the sea, but also for the whole rest.  You will not need to think about a transfer to a hotel, book a room and take care of other details.  Directly in the travel agency you will be advised by a good resort hotel, a boarding house or a recreation center - possibly with all-inclusive meals.  In this case, travel to the desired resorts will cost you less.  After all, you buy the whole tour package. </p>
