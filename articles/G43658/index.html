  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rattlesnake</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most dangerous reptiles is the rattlesnake.  She is a member of the pit family.  This animal lives mainly in the countries of Southeast Asia, America and Russia. </p><p>  How does a rattlesnake look?  The head of the animal has a triangular shape, the pupils of the eyes are vertical.  The length of an adult can reach more than one and a half meters.  A characteristic feature of representatives of this species is the presence of two hollow long teeth, from which deadly poison is released.  On the head of reptiles, between the eyes and nostrils, there are two thermoreceptor fossae, allowing them to recognize the victim by the difference in temperature.  These amazing receptors are able to respond to even the smallest changes in air temperature (0.1 degrees).  This feature allows animals to hunt quite successfully, even at night. </p><p>  The rattlesnake got its name thanks to the rattle located on the tip of its tail.  It is a movable modified scales.  In the process of oscillation, they hit each other, making a characteristic ‚Äúthundering‚Äù sound. </p><p>  All <span>species of pit</span> family <span>snakes</span> mainly feed on small vertebrate mammals.  They can be ambushed for quite some time, waiting for the victim to get as close as possible, and then suddenly attack her.  For wintering, rattlesnakes choose places where they can feel comfortable warming against each other for the entire period of hibernation.  In autumn, reptiles try to crawl out into the sun as often as possible in order to bask under its rays. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Almost all representatives of the family of pit viviparous.  A few minutes after laying eggs, young offspring tears the shell and is born.  Adult snakes tirelessly ensure that no one approaches the nest with offspring.  At a young age, the tails of snakes have a bright color, contrasting with the color of the whole body.  At the same time, the young rattle is missing at the tip of the tail, it appears much later. </p><p>  Like many other scaly reptile classes, rattlesnakes periodically molt.  After each skin change, an additional new cornified segment appears in the animal on the rattle.  In young snakes, molting occurs quite often - up to six times a year.  In adults, once a year and a half.  Before molting begins, the <span>cornea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe</span> animal's <span>eye</span> loses its transparency, becomes cloudy.  At this time, the snake is not able to see.  She spends almost all the time in shelter until her vision returns.  The tongue helps to navigate in the space of the snake, and the radar helps to get food.  The reptile uses his teeth in order to seize and kill his victim. </p><p>  When the rattlesnake senses danger, it folds into a tight spring, ready at any moment to turn around with great force.  In this case, the tail part resembles a spiral ring, in the center of which there is a rattle rattle, emitting a frightening rustle.  The front part takes the form of a high column. </p><p>  Rattlesnakes are mostly nocturnal.  Indeed, it is in the dark that the majority of their victims are active.  In addition, night hunting allows animals to avoid heat and sunburn.  During the day, reptiles hide under stones or in the burrows of rodents. </p><p>  The mortal danger to humans is carried by the poison of the snake, which is contained in the salivary glands of the animal and transmitted through the bite.  It is a thick transparent liquid with a consistency, containing a huge amount of complex biologically active substances.  Once in the blood, the poison instantly affects all the vessels and cells of the human body.  Therefore, when a <span>snake bites,</span> it is very important to provide a person with qualified medical care in a timely manner. </p>
