Many people do not take seriously old phone models at all, considering them archaic and unsuitable for anything.  Despite the prevailing stereotypes, there is a caste of people who value reliability and simplicity in gadgets, despite modern applications and ultra-high-resolution cameras.  In this review, we will talk about one of the Nokia models.  This is a good phone that has become a victim of time. </p>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Nokia is known worldwide for its unique devices.  Phones under the Finnish brand have been distributed since the 90s and have a rich history.  Around the phones of this brand a whole cult has formed.  Unfortunately, like many other companies, Nokia was not able to survive the war with Apple and its iPhone. </p><p>  Conservatives today also prefer the legendary brand and are happy to use old people like the Nokia 5200. </p>

    <h2>  Device design </h2><p>  The body of the device is made of plastic, reliable enough and not too easily soiled.  The phone is a slider, has a sliding mechanism and a full-format QWERTY-keyboard.  The keyboard will delight you with a design similar to previous models, which allows you to enter texts with maximum speed and comfort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the side faces are the power key and audio playback control buttons.  Pressing the side key can start the player in the background. </p><p>  The gadget is available in several colors, among them: white with red, white with blue and matte black.  The phone is very voluminous (its weight is 104 grams), while it lies very well in the hand, fits in any, even the smallest (say, children's) palm. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Nokia 5200:</span> characteristics, technical equipment </h2><p>  The phone is a compact slider based on the Series 40 operating system. A CSTN display is located on the front panel, and a camera eye with a resolution of 0.3 megapixels has found its place on the rear panel.  The device has rather poor equipment, but at the same time it has all the necessary, basic set of functions: a web browser for accessing the Internet, support for second-generation networks, Bluetooth, USB.  Also in the Nokia 5200 there was a place for a battery (volume - 760 milliampere-hours), according to the manufacturer, this should be enough for 280 hours of standby time and 3 hours of talk time. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The device is equipped with a tiny screen with an STN-matrix and a weak resolution - 128 by 160 dpi.  The picture is clearly grainy, which annoys a lot, it‚Äôs easy to notice every pixel without even looking (after looking at the screens of modern phones, such a display panel is not taken seriously).  In addition to the very limited resolution, poor color rendering, rather low brightness (which is especially noticeable in the sun) and very limited viewing angles disappoint.  You can look at a smartphone only when it is located opposite the eyes, any, even tiny, tilt will lead to a complete loss of vision.  Still, the phone is chosen by those who like to listen to music, so the display fades into the background. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  There is nothing to talk about either.  The Nokia 5200 has a terrible photo module with a resolution of 0.3 megapixels.  It will not be possible to remove at least something decent, therefore the camera will carry, rather, a utilitarian function. </p><h2>  Interface Operating System </h2><p>  The phone runs on the Series 40 operating system. The system includes a basic set of features.  Among the entertainment you can find several games, among them an aquarium in the style of ‚ÄúTamogochi‚Äù and the well-known ‚ÄúSnake‚Äù.  One of the most important components of the device is a music player. </p>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Unlike other devices in the series, the Nokia 5200 phone is somewhat understaffed.  The kit does not even have a mini-USB wire, it will have to be purchased separately.  I am glad that this wire is worth a penny.  Also in the kit there is no memory card, the user was left the right to choose. </p><p>  Of course, the kit includes a headset, which is pretty good, but with a very non-standard port 2.5 millimeters. </p><h2>  Nokia 5200: reviews, conclusion </h2><p>  This inexpensive, cute device has been enjoyed by many users.  People appreciate the compactness of the device and its reliability.  In most cases, the opinion is expressed by people who have owned the device for more than three and four years, which indicates its ‚Äúsurvivability‚Äù (the same applies to the device‚Äôs resistance to falls).  There are individuals who used it for games and watching videos (the idea, it is worth saying, is stupid, but the phone coped with it, although it was discharged as soon as possible). </p><p>  If in games autonomy clearly suffers, then in standby mode the gadget shows its best and remains operational for up to three days.  Users note the possibility of using the phone as a flash drive. </p><p>  The bottom line to the potential buyer is a very good phone, far from modern smartphones, but still quite high quality and worthy of attention. </p>
