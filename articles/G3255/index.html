    <p>  You can also do jipping (traveling on UAZs along mountain rivers and trails) and trips on a motor hang glider. </p><p>  Once in the base of the "Mountain Village" in Adygea, you should definitely try to visit the magnificent Mount Trident. </p><h2>  Mount Trident </h2><p>  At a village in Adygea, Mount Trezubets rushed up from the bowels of the earth.  In fact, there are several peaks, so the locals called them a trident. </p><p>  The main path to it originates in the Blockhouse Glade (near the village of Hamyshki).  After about 200 meters, the path rises to the spur and becomes a slightly noticeable path.  The entire climb takes about an hour to the top at a height of 1050 meters. </p><p>  From the top of the Trident there is a stunning view of the Belaya Valley, the village of Hamyshki and the village of Dakhovskaya, Lago-Naki, the Azish-Tau ridge, and Granite Gorge.  Sometimes, being at the foot, you can see wild goats quickly galloping along the ridge, having settled in these places inaccessible to humans. </p><p>  Trident - the beginning of the Du-Du-Gush ridge, which is one of the most beautiful corners of Adygea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adygea, Mountain Village (photo)" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1812369.jpg"></div>
