  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wild beaches of the world: overview and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Are you dreaming of a break from everyday life, soaking up on the shores of the sea or ocean, enjoying the bright sun, but not jostling on the city beach?  In this case, you have to find a wild beach.  Despite the general urbanization, there are still secluded corners in the world where you can relax alone or only with your family. </p><h2>  Germany </h2><p>  This country is one of the leaders in the number of tourists coming.  Some vacationers go to admire the architecture, someone try all sorts of beer, and someone prefers to enjoy a vacation by the sea.  The north of the country is washed by two seas: the Baltic and the North.  There are beaches on the coast for the most respectable travelers, but there are also wild beaches in Germany where democratically-minded people and those who seek privacy rest. </p><p>  Fans of a relaxing holiday can go to the island of R√ºgen, where there is soft and snow-white sand, with many secluded coves.  You should not look for traditional entertainments here, but not here.  But everywhere cabins for changing clothes are installed, and all this is surrounded by forests and fields where poppies bloom. </p><p>  Sylt Island or "King of the North", with the wild beaches of Germany.  Here you can retire to the beautiful bay, behind the dunes and feel truly on a desert island. </p><p>  Do not know where else to hide from prying eyes, go to the island of Hiddensee.  It is always clean and there are many secluded places, the coastline is gentle and convenient for swimming with children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.reiseuhu.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches on the island of Rugen" class="if uuid-2559077" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2559077.jpg"></div><h2>  Krasnodar region </h2><p>  No way to go to the Mediterranean Sea?  It doesn‚Äôt matter - in our country the beautiful Black Sea.  There are also many places where you can retire. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Not so long ago, the Bugaz Spit ‚Äúescaped‚Äù into the leaders of the wild beaches of the Krasnodar Territory.  This is as much as 15 kilometers of undeveloped beaches, from the village of Blagoveshchensk to Veselovka.  The coastline is very popular among kite surfers, as there is always wind. </p><p>  And between Dzhanhot and Praskoveevka there is one of the most environmentally friendly places, with pebbles and clear water of the sea - Blue Abyss beach.  And all this is surrounded by relict forest and rocks. </p><p>  Another wild beach in the Krasnodar Territory is Sosnovka.  It is located between Divnomorskom and Gelendzhik, there are few vacationers and beautiful nature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kukarta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bugaz Spit" class="if uuid-2559081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2559081.jpg"></div><h2>  Crimean peninsula </h2><p>  Not so long ago, the returning territory of Crimea to Russia can offer many interesting and, most importantly, secluded places for recreation.  Perhaps these are not the leaders of the wild beaches of the world, but they are very beautiful. </p><p>  One of these is Generalsky beach, it is located between the villages of Resort and Golden, on the coast of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  There are beautiful ledges, cliffs and open bays.  The Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov also boasts that it is almost always warm water.  And on the <span>General's beach,</span> even in high season, there are very few vacationers. </p><p>  Another beach located on the Black Sea is Tsarskiy in the New World.  You can get here exclusively on foot, from the western part of the village there is an ecotropic. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The beach on Arshintsevskaya Spit is famous not only for its open spaces with a small number of vacationers, but also for the fact that two seas are connected in this place: the Black and Azov. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gotonature.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal beach Crimea" class="if uuid-2559092" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2559092.jpg"></div><h2>  Brazil </h2><p>  Have the opportunity to go abroad?  Go to Brazil.  There are still places untouched by civilization, one of them is Baixio Beach on the Costa dos Coqueiros, which is 30 kilometers from the city of Condi.  However, there are always big waves and only one small settlement of the same name. </p><p>  Another wild beach in Brazil is Calcanhar.  There are no hotels and attractions, only one building of human hands is the Kabluk lighthouse.  <span>This is the beach</span> resort of Torus. </p><p>  And in the inaccessible area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island of Ilhabela there is another wild Bonet beach.  You can get to the coast only by boat and then only in calm weather. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pousadaangabahia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baixio Beach" class="if uuid-2559085" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2559085.jpg"></div><h2>  Tuapse </h2><p>  This resort of Russia also boasts the presence of secluded places.  One of Tuapse's wild beaches is the rocky coast of Cape Kadosh (northwest of the city).  There are small and large pebbles, the bottom is also rocky, so it is better to walk in shoes.  There are also reefs on the coast, so they don‚Äôt come here with children.  And towards the rock of Kiselev there is a small street of the beach where nudists rest.  This beach is well hidden by cliffs from prying eyes, and the easiest way to get to it is by walking along Kadosh beach.  The beach is not suitable for tourists who do not stay well on the water, the coast here is steep. </p><p>  These two places are surrounded by a forest park zone, which is protected by law. </p><p>  Another wild beach is Spider.  Almost the entire coastline and bottom are strewn with boulders, sharp stones, so the beach is very wild.  By the way, it was in this place that an episode was shot from the film ‚ÄúDiamond Hand‚Äù, a boy walked along the reefs of Spider Beach.  Another minus is that it is rather dirty here, especially after a storm, when everything returns to land, which was thrown out by a person earlier.  But it is precisely to this coast that dolphins often swim across, you can admire the beauties of the underwater world by diving in a mask. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bestmaps.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rocky beach of Cape Kadosh" class="if uuid-2559090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2559090.jpg"></div><h2>  The wildest beaches in the world </h2><p>  If possible, go to California, there is one of the most uninhabited beaches in the world - Point Reyes, located in the eponymous national park.  To get to the coastline, you have to walk about 5 miles.  And for a romantic dinner around the campfire you will even have to get special permission. </p><p>  There is also a unique place in America, in the state of Florida - Cayo Costa Beach.  This is as much as 18 kilometers of the wild beach of the world.  To get here is quite problematic, boats and a ferry very rarely go to the island, but secluded conditions are provided. </p><p>  Do you like islands?  Go to Antigua and Barbuda.  There are always many tourists and yachtsmen, but few of them go further to Low Bay beach, but in vain.  Some 14 kilometers from Palmetto is a beach called Pink.  In fact, it is a bulk island, but there are practically no vacationers here. </p><p>  In Ecuador, the most wild beach in the world is considered Los Frail.  It is located in the park of Maaalil, tourists rarely come here because of the remoteness. </p><p>  If you find yourself in Mexico, then <span>Puerto Vallarta</span> is considered a secluded beach <span>.</span>  You can get here exclusively by boat, from the bay of Banderas Bay.  But the trip to the beach will leave a lasting impression of palm trees and the underwater world. </p><p>  Another wild beach that can only be reached by boat is Stor, but it is located in Australia and is surrounded by impregnable cliffs, in the territory of Sydney Harbor National Park. </p><p>  There are still many mysterious and wild places in the world that you should definitely visit. </p>
