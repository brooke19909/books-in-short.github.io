Total to the maximum cost you need to add another 17 250 for the service and the notorious fee of 15 AED.  Total - from above you will have to pay about 22 thousand rubles.  This is important to consider.  And if you want a breakfast, you‚Äôll have to pay 115-140 thousand rubles without any fees. </p><p>  What are the conditions?  Guests at Acacia By Bin Majid Hotels Resort claim that the apartments are very comfortable.  The huge size is comfortable with a comfortable bed, air conditioning, safe, desk, soft carpet, wardrobe and a private spacious bathroom with shower and bath.  In addition, there are such trifles as slippers, a minibar, bathrobes and free toiletries.  And of course there is a TV. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Suite </h2><p>  This is a category of rooms that is also in demand at Acacia By Bin Majid Hotels Resorts.  The cost of such apartments is 128-150 thousand rubles for two without breakfast and fees.  It is worth explaining that prices vary depending on the season and the presence (or absence) of any stocks and special offers.

    <h2>  One bedroom apartment </h2><p>  This is the last category of rooms that I would like to talk about.  So, the <span>living area</span> is 52 square meters.  Despite the fact that the room is very spacious and very comfortable, two, maximum three people can live in it.  Booking will cost 170-195 thousand rubles for 15 nights (without fees and taxes). </p><p>  What can you tell about these apartments, which are the best in the Acacia By Bin Majid Hotels Resorts?  Reviews are encouraging in any case.  And the guests themselves claim that these apartments are perhaps one of the best options that are here.  Firstly, the bedroom has a huge and wide king-size bed.  Secondly, inside there is everything that you might need for a good rest and stay.  There is a refrigerator here, as well as a private kitchen.  A minibar is also stated in the conditions.  Plus, there is a large TV (LCD), bathroom with shower, telephone, channels (satellite), toilet, ironing facilities and much more.  What is available in other room categories is also available here.  So it is not surprising why bedroom apartments are in such great demand. </p>

    <h2>  Service and maintenance </h2><p>  We can not touch on this topic, talking about the Acacia By Bin Majid Hotels Resorts.  <span>Acacia Hotel 4 *</span> is a complex that boasts not only excellent and comfortable rooms, but also worthy service. </p><p>  So, the reception is open around the clock in the hotel - you don‚Äôt have to worry that the plane will land later or earlier than the appointed time, in any case, the check-in will be made.  The press is also delivered.  Upon request, luggage storage can be provided.  There is also a dry cleaning and laundry service on site, which guests can also use.  Car rental, currency exchange, food, drinks, packed lunches in the room, babysitting services, a tour desk and even shoe shine - all this is here.  Needless to say, the hotel even has its own beauty salon and hairdresser.  There are even halls for banquets and conferences, as well as a business center in the hotel.  And, of course, the administration provides VIP services. </p><p>  Now about nutrition.  The hotel guests are fed with delicious and fresh breakfasts.  They are prepared in the Al Nakhla restaurant, which is located next to the pool.  Lunches and dinners are served right there.  There is also a bar called ‚ÄúFlamingo‚Äù - there guests can try some cocktails and smoke a cigar.  And if guests can‚Äôt imagine their life without coffee, then in the local cafe they perfectly prepare this drink - it‚Äôs worth keeping in mind. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment and leisure </h2><p>  One of the most popular ways to relax in the complex Acacia By Bin Majid Hotels Resorts 4 * (Ras al-Khaimah) is considered a visit to the SPA salon.  Here guests can rejuvenate, soak in the jacuzzi or visit the massage room.  The hotel also has a gym with modern fitness equipment.  There is also an outdoor swimming pool.  And, of course, the main entertainment is the sea.  The beach here is very close. </p><p>  The complex also has a real sauna, karaoke bar and night club. </p><p>  Although, I must say, few people who come here decide to spend time in the complex.  Of course, the above entertainment is good, but the UAE is such a place where there are plenty of other ways to keep yourself busy.  Numerous excursions, trips, hikes, exploring the surroundings, shopping - which is just not there.  Yes, and get acquainted with the local culture, too, will not be superfluous (although this lesson is still more for adult tourists).  Young people, however, will not be bored either - in the vicinity there are a lot of night clubs and other establishments of a similar nature.  Well, in the hotel you can just relax in the evening and relax after a busy day. </p><p>  A lot of positive reviews about the hotel are left by guests who have already been here.  In addition to the excellent service, the hotel administration also provides various compliments.  On the birthday, in honor of the wedding anniversary, for newlyweds or regular guests.  And in general, as <span>tourists</span> say <span>, this is a</span> good hotel for the UAE.  The prices here are very reasonable, the rooms are comfortable and well decorated, they are regularly cleaned and fed to their conscience.  So there is everything necessary for a good rest here, and this is important. </p>
