L. Bennigsen, showed the world the unconditional superiority of the French army - the strongest in the world at that time.  Hardened in the numerous battles and hard times of the Great French Revolution, the Napoleonic troops were distinguished by excellent training and discipline.  Thanks to this, the victory in the battle of Friedland was another weighty argument that forced Russia to leave the war and begin peace negotiations.  Data on the number of troops and the progress of the battle are very contradictory.  However, first things first. </p>

    <h2>  Situation and conditions on the eve of a grand battle </h2><p>  Friedland was located about 45 km from Konigsberg.  It was there that the cavalry general Leonty Leontyevich Bennigsen was in a hurry.  The aid that England provided in this war was brought up.  The battles preceding the events described led to the strategic advantage of Napoleon 1, but the war was still far from over.  A general battle was necessary. </p><p>  However, opponents were equally enthusiastic about their chances of success.  The battle of Eilau, in January 1807, when the Russian troops came very close to the headquarters of the French emperor, gave Leonty Leontyevich Bennigsen hope for the laurels of the winner.  The end of the spring thaw meant the resumption of full-scale hostilities, which both warring parties expected with equal enthusiasm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What did Napoleon I bet on? </h2><p>  It should be noted the strategic insight of the Napoleonic troops.  Having created a threat to Koenigsberg, they lured Bennigsen for a general battle.  And the Russian troops had no choice but to abandon their well-prepared positions and rush to save the main city of East Prussia. </p><p>  The battle of Heidelberg, on the eve of the decisive battle of Friedland, battered the French army, but did not stop it.  Napoleon 1 continued on his way to Koenigsberg, and the Russian troops had no choice but to occupy Friedland, a small provincial town. </p>

    <h2>  The number of troops on both sides </h2><p>  Data, as in most cases, vary.  And these figures are so contradictory in additional historical studies.  From the Russian troops participated from 45 to 60 thousand people.  The last digit is more likely.  Napoleon I had forces of about 80 thousand manpower, which also looks quite reliable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is suggested that the French were able to win only due to numerical superiority.  This hypothesis is not consistent.  It is enough to recall the quantitative ratio of the troops of the French and Russian in the battle of Eylau.  Much depended on the commanders of the Battle of Friedland.  Their leadership talents and the ability of soldiers and officers to show initiative and local training.  However, as in all armed conflicts, a few words must be said about the commanders of the Battle of Friedland. </p>

    <h2>  Commander Jean Lannes </h2><p>  This ambitious Gascon was born in the house of a peasant on April 10, 1769.  The family was big: 4 brothers and 3 sisters, but this did not stop the young guy from studying to read and write.  He worked as a pupil of a dyer, but the young man did not dream about it and therefore, as soon as possible, joined as a volunteer.  Very soon he won the respect not only of his colleagues, but also of his command and received the rank of lieutenant. </p><p>  His baptism of fire as an officer took place in battles with the Spaniards at the Saint-Laurent-de-Cerdan Pass.  When the battalion panicked, and the soldiers fled, the second lieutenant did not stand on ceremony.  With the help of kicks and curses, he restored the fighting spirit of the unit entrusted to him and inspired a counterattack.  Very quickly received the rank of captain and his first wound.  Management praised his merits and appointed to command the brigade. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Jean Lannes was making a dizzying career.  But the Directory reigned in France, which reorganized the armed forces of France.  As a result, Lanne resigned.  He considered insulting a decrease in rank and a decrease in salary.  However, the rest did not last long.  In early 1796, France again needed experienced officers.  The talents of Jean Lanna were noticed by Napoleon I. The front roads led this remarkable commander not only across Europe, but also to the Middle East. </p><p>  And in 1800, Lannes took an active part in overthrowing the power of the Directory and was honored to command the Consular Guard, the most elite unit in the French armed forces.  But his indefatigable energy and shortage of 200,000 francs at the box office of the Consular Guard forced Napoleon I to send his friend with a diplomatic mission to Portugal.  You can continue to list the virtues of the great French commander Jean Lannes.  An interesting fact is that before the battle of Friedland he already had the experience of meeting with Russian troops.  In the battle of Pultusk, he, having 20,000 men under his command, pushed Bennigsen, who had an advantage in manpower in 2 times and 40 guns.  Marshal Lanne was injured. </p>

    <h2>  Cavalry General L. L. Bennigsen </h2><p>  Leonty Leontyevich Bennigsen - a person quite controversial in historiography.  Some modern historians call him an intriguer, and at the same time, the hero of the war in the Caucasus, Yermolov, characterized him positively.  Bennigsen began his career at the age of 14, when he joined the Hanoverian army.  He received the rank of lieutenant colonel by the age of 28, having experience in military operations in the Seven Years War (1756-1763). </p><p>  This was a man who acted in accordance with his conscience.  Such conclusions suggest themselves based on the battle of Pultusk.  The army is most vulnerable to retreat.  And he, ignoring the order, gave the battle against Marshal Lann just to gain time for the regrouping of Russian troops.  During the battle of Friedland, L. L. Bennigsen was sick, but courageously fulfilled his military duty, although on the eve he had lost consciousness from stomach pain. </p>

    <h2>  Beginning of the Battle of Friedland </h2><p>  Russian troops occupied Friedland.  In front of them stood Lann's corps.  As L. L. Bennigsen later recalled in his memoirs, if he knew about Napoleon‚Äôs approaching army, he would prefer to avoid this clash.  But the false reports did their dirty deed, Bennigsen was not informed about the actual number of enemy troops.  And as soon as he got into a fight, the emperor of France hastily turned back. </p><p>  The battle of Friedland began slowly.  Starting at 3 a.m., Russian troops, crossing the river Alla, seized the bridgehead and held it, waiting for the approach of their main forces.  Decisive action was not taken, limited to an artillery duel.  By 9 o‚Äôclock in the morning, the concentration of Russian troops reached about 45 thousand people against 17 thousand French troops.  But even with this ratio, Bennigsen was extremely cautious. </p><p>  Gradually, the number of French troops receiving reinforcements increased.  Different sources call different numbers from 27 to 33 thousand.  Lann brilliantly coped with the task.  He kept the Russian army, waiting for the approach of Napoleon I. In fact, Lannes used the same strategy that he had previously used at the battle of Montebello - he restrained the enemy, waiting for reinforcements, and set the stage for a subsequent counterattack. </p>

    <h2>  Battle of friedland </h2><p>  Napoleon immediately appreciated the unfavorable strategic position of the Russian troops, who had stumped together in a narrow bend of the river.  At 17.30 the French troops decided to bring the battle to its logical conclusion.  They went on the attack.  The Russians began to retreat, and, developing success, General Marchand's French division deviated to the right, thereby creating a gap. </p><p>  Bennigsen took a chance and tried using the cavalry to wedge himself between the French, but the Russian cavalry were thrown back.  Continuing the offensive, the French met with a well-organized work of Russian artillery, which was supported by cavalrymen, striking the left flank.  The French began to hesitate.  The critical, decisive moment of the Battle of Friedland came. </p><p>  However, in time the reserve entered not only saved the French from defeat, but also threw back the Russian cavalry.  Panic began in the ranks of the Russians under the command of the illustrious Bagration.  Hurried to their rescue other Russian soldiers courageously died, trying to divert the advancing French forces.  And even the Russian guard regiments introduced into the battle only added the amount of losses from the Russian side. </p>

    <h2>  Tilsit world </h2><p>  The result of the Battle of Friedland.  Russia has lost not only the best sons on the battlefield.  She had to sign, as some historians estimate, the humiliating Tilsit world.  Although he was so humiliating?  The conquests of Napoleon were recognized.  France was looking for an ally and looked with hope at Russia.  An agreement was signed by which Russia joined the blockade of England. </p><p>  Relationship with England is the subject of a number of separate historical studies.  British diplomacy wisely pitted European states and, using their weaknesses, strengthened their position in the world.  Napoleon I also needed a reliable strategic partner in the military sphere.  A military alliance was concluded.  So in the war with Sweden, the French helped the Russians, as a result of which Finland became part of the Russian Empire. </p><p>  Russia did not render assistance to France in its war with Austria.  And this, despite all the help provided by Napoleon I, in addition to everything who refused to help his allies, the Turks, in the war that they waged with the Russian Empire.  But the main result was the rise of France in Europe.  Now she has become a full-fledged mistress. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The commanders of the Battle of Friedland and their army differed both in the level of strategic planning and in the level of interaction between their units.
