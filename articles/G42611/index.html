    <p>  The initiator of this project was Moscow Dolphinarium.  As it became known to reporters, the ordered detailed analysis made it possible to justify why the dolphinarium should be built in Samara.  Among the reasons explaining the relevance of this object in this city is the combination of many traffic flows.  Their presence allows specialists to put forward the most daring and optimistic forecasts.  Dolphinarium in Samara promises to become popular not only with local spectators, but also with visitors from other cities: Orenburg, Ulyanovsk, etc.  This project is currently under discussion. </p><h2>  Mobile dolphinarium - a holiday for lovers of the sea </h2><p>  According to reviews, for the inhabitants of the region, the sea and marine animals are some kind of exotic, which many people dream of getting to know from childhood.  Therefore, touring in the city of the Moscow mobile dolphinarium is perceived by Samaritans as a dream come true. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  So, potential viewers are advised to study the schedule of the dolphinarium in Samara, note that you can‚Äôt pre-book seats in the hall, tickets should be purchased in advance at the ticket office, which is open from 10 to 20.  Those who want to see the show, who have free time only on weekends, need to take care of tickets in advance - at least a week before the presentation, otherwise they can not be found at the box office.  Those who decide to visit the dolphinarium in Samara on weekdays can rejoice: the authors of the reviews report that tickets can be bought at the box office 1-2 weeks before the show during the week.  Viewers consider the price considerable, especially it bites for those who go to the dolphinarium as part of a large family. </p><p>  Children who are not yet 3 years old go to the show for free if their parents have a document, for the rest, tickets are sold at the same price as adults.  Many visitors are surprised that the hall, designed to accommodate 600 guests at a time, is almost always full, despite the fact that the dolphinarium has been working in the city for quite some time. </p><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  The authors of the reviews believe that viewers should know about some of the nuances in advance.  The list of participants in the show consists of two <span>dolphins, a white</span> whale, a walrus and a fur seal.  The time taken by the performance is 40-45 minutes.  It is not too difficult to endure restless young spectators.  Taking pictures during the show is allowed, but photos with animals are issued after the end of the performance and payment of 500 rubles.  Tickets for the 1st row should not be bought, because the seats in it are located near the water itself and the audience during the show is completely wet. </p><h2>  Impressions </h2><p>  There are few rows in the room where the show takes place, the audience is divided, so everything is clearly visible even from the upper rows.  But this applies only to adults, while children, especially small ones, parents have to keep in their arms.  The show takes place within 40-45 minutes, this time includes, in addition to performances of animals, at least 15-20 minutes.  auction, leading conversations and so on.  For those who have never seen such animals before, the performance seems truly fabulous. </p><p>  Viewers report that the performance of the white whale and dolphins consists of 2 parts, between the fur seal and walrus Walrus Lyubasha.  Here you can see the game of dolphins and a whale with hoops and balls, magnificent animals jumping through hoops raised, trainers riding around the pool and much more.  The performance, according to the reviews of guests who visited it, charges with an extraordinary positive.  Spectators leave admiring from acquaintance with amazing inhabitants of the sea. </p><h2>  On the position of opponents of the project </h2><p>  It should be noted that not everyone in Samara welcomes the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding a dolphinarium in the city.  Many citizens opposed the implementation of this project.  Activists made a petition to the governor of the Samara region, under which about two thousand people had already signed. </p>

    <p>  Opponents of the project believe that keeping marine animals in dolphinariums is a real torment for them.  In addition, as stated in the petition, dolphinariums are potentially dangerous for visitors.  It is unacceptable to receive from animals that were forcibly taken out of their habitat and imprisoned, suffering from daily hours of work, possibly feeling unwell, ‚Äúa charge of vivacity and a piece of happiness,‚Äù according to Samara citizens who signed the document.  Such entertaining shows definitely lead to moral degradation of the audience. </p>
