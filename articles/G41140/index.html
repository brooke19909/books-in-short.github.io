Here you can spend an unforgettable vacation on the shores of one of the two seas that wash the peninsula: Azov and Black.  The number of resorts located here is difficult to count, because there are a lot of them.  And each of them daily pleases guests with its unique flavor, beautiful nature, numerous attractions and, of course, beaches. </p><p>  One of the well-known resort places of Crimea is Sudak.  The city is famous primarily because it has an old fortress.  And in the immediate vicinity of it, the Soldaya Grand Hotel &amp; Resort recently appeared, a vacation in which many tourists will appreciate. </p><h2>  Rest in the Pike perch: the sea and sights </h2><p>  The city of Sudak (Crimea) is located in the southeastern part of the coast of the peninsula.  It appeared thanks to the Alanian tribes a very long time: in 212.  The city received its name in Ottoman times, and it was chosen for a reason.  The name of the city perfectly reflects its location.  The fact is that in the Turkic language this word is divided into two: ‚Äúsu‚Äù, which means water, and ‚Äúdak‚Äù, which means mountain forest. </p>

    <p>  A long time ago Sudak became a place where many tourists from Ukraine, Russia and other CIS countries flock.  After all, here you can not only swim in the Black Sea, enjoy the excellent pebble beaches and see with your own eyes the wonderful and unusual Crimean nature.  Here you can also get culturally rich while visiting all kinds of attractions - some of them have a very ancient history. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to see in Sudak </h2><p>  The first thing the city of Sudak (Crimea) is associated with is, of course, the <span>Genoese fortress.</span>  This magnificent monument, which has come down to us since the Middle Ages, still stands today on a massive mountain.  It is possible to approach it only by the sloping descent in the north, so the choice of location for the construction of such a protective structure is understandable and justified. </p><p>  Today, the fortress is a very valuable architectural monument, which all visitors to the city seek to see closer.  You can go inside the fortress, take a walk along its walls and look inside some of the towers.  There are also organized various thematic events during which tourists can feel like residents of the Middle Ages, change into appropriate outfits, shoot archery, ride horses and, of course, take pictures for a long memory. </p><p>  Another interesting place in Sudak is the temple, built in the Byzantine style approximately in the XII-XV centuries.  It is located at the foot of a mountain called Polwani-Oba closer to the village of Cozy.  Once there were murals depicting Jesus Christ and the Twelve Apostles.  Alas, today we are not destined to look at them, but the name of the place is directly connected with them: after all, the construction is called the Temple of the Twelve Apostles.  And next to it is a tower called Portovaya, or Astagwera. </p>

    <p>  Resting in Sudak, it is very convenient to visit the small village of New World, which is famous for its beautiful bays, juniper groves, <span>the Golitsyn Trail</span> and a champagne wine factory.  Also in these places in the Soviet years, many films were shot in which the beauty of the Crimean nature is clearly visible.  ‚ÄúSportloto-82‚Äù, ‚ÄúThree plus two‚Äù, ‚ÄúAmphibian Man‚Äù and many other films give viewers the opportunity to visit these parts without leaving home.  And everyone probably wants to see with their own eyes all these beauties, so a trip to the New World is a must-see destination for many Sudak guests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Italian holidays in Crimea </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the Genoese fortress is located in Sudak, the spirit of the Middle Ages is partly felt here.  And for those guests of the resort who want to completely plunge into that distant era and feel like part of those old years, we offer relaxation in the new and unique hotel Soldaya Grand Hotel &amp; Resort.  It was built recently - in 2014, but has already managed to gain popularity among vacationers. </p><p>  Perhaps the name of the Soldaya Grand Hotel &amp; Resort may seem strange to someone.  "Soldaya" is an Italian word.  This is exactly what the Italians called the city in ancient times.  Thus, this word appeared in the name of the hotel as a link between our time and the ancient era of the intersection of different cultures in these parts. </p><p>  The uniqueness of the hotel is that it is not just some kind of building with rooms, no!  This is a whole medieval Italian town, comfortably located in close proximity to the Genoese fortress.  Hotel Soldaya Grand Hotel &amp; Resort (Sudak) consists of low buildings, which are made in a <span>Mediterranean style</span> and transport tourists to cozy Italian courtyards. </p>

    <p>  This medieval corner of the Crimean resort has everything you need for the best and most delightful vacation.  An excellent pool is located right in the middle of the entire protected area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Soldaya Grand Hotel &amp; Resort, so guests can not worry about the fact that someone else can be here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Where is the hotel situated </h2><p>  As noted above, the Soldaya Grand Hotel &amp; Resort is very close to the Genoese fortress.  Moreover, it was built directly at the foot of the mountain, on which this medieval defensive structure towers.  Therefore, finding this hotel in Sudak is quite easy. </p><p>  Of course, it is much easier to find the necessary object in the city, if you know its exact address.  Soldaya Grand Hotel &amp; Resort 4 * is located on Morskaya Street, house 23. You need to walk only 300 meters to the equipped beach, which will not take guests a lot of time.  You will have to go longer to the Sudak water park, about 2 kilometers. </p><p>  But in order to be near the Soldaya Grand Hotel &amp; Resort itself, you must first get to the territory of the peninsula itself.  This can be done with the help of an airplane landing at the airport of the city of Simferopol, or with the help of a <span>ferry through the Kerch Strait</span> by bus or personal transport. </p>
