    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  First, find out what we are dealing with.  There are many taxes, especially in Russia.  And every citizen should know what he pays for.  Otherwise, complete confusion and chaos will begin.  In addition, not all make certain payments to the state treasury.  In some cases, a partial or full exemption from payment is possible. </p><p>  Thus, income tax is the so-called income tax.  He is direct.  That is, non-regional.  This type of tax calculation is the same for all territorial units.  Of course, there are still their own rules, but they are also the same in Kaliningrad, in Moscow, and somewhere in Siberia.  The most common case is a <span>personal income tax.</span>  Perhaps, every working citizen is familiar with him.  Anyway, income tax is an income tax.  Remember this.  The question is different: who pays it and how exactly? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Whom to pay? </h2><p>  Who should pay such a fee?  Practice (and legislation) shows that all taxpayers are subject to income tax.  That is, individuals resident in the country.  Non-residents should not be forgotten either.  True, the second category of people usually pays this fee only when they have any income in the territory of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  In addition, there is also a corporate income tax.  He is also considered.  It turns out that all firms, companies and organizations, as well as working individuals, pay income tax.  Regardless of age.  The main thing is that they should be officially hired.  Exceptions exist in the case of individuals and organizations.  Which ones?  Who and when can be exempted from the annual report and payment?  What is the procedure for calculating income tax for citizens and companies?  We will answer all questions in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="corporate income tax" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1204465.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Who does not pay? </h2><p>  Of course, in all the rules there are exceptions.  And taxes also apply.  So, in Russia, citizens who do not have any tax are exempt from annual income payments.  Most often these are women on maternity leave, elderly people, and also minor children.  Nevertheless, if the latter go to official work and begin to receive income, you will have to pay the corresponding tax.  What to do with companies and firms?  An organization‚Äôs income tax is not calculated if a special taxation form has been used.  For example, a simplified system, a single contribution to <span>imputed income,</span> agricultural tax.  Also, those who pay for the gambling business are exempted from this payment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 2016, participants in a special project called the Skolkovo Innovation Center may also evade payment.  But all the other companies and organizations pay income tax.  Legal entities including.  And foreign organizations, if they make a profit in the Russian Federation, as well as those who work through a permanent government.  As you can see, there are not so many exceptions.  Nevertheless, it is too early to give an example of the calculation of income tax.  Indeed, regarding individuals there are some features.  Which ones? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax calculation" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1204464.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Features before calculations </h2><p>  Having received this or that income, there is no need to rush to take it into account right away and consider how much you should give.  Especially when it comes to an individual or individual entrepreneur.  The thing is that the corporate profit tax, as we have already found out, is not always levied.  Companies with special <span>forms of taxation are exempted.</span>  To understand exactly what is meant, you can put it extremely simply.  The calculation of taxes on company income is carried out when it has expenses.  An appropriate deduction relies on them.  By the way, IPs most often use a simplified system.  This is a kind of tax that is paid at the end of the reporting period.  But about him a little later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But with individuals, everything is much more complicated.  After all, citizens can earn income not only through employment.  And from sales, renting out property and so on.  What is obtained in practice?  Income tax is not taxed on income derived from close relatives: parents, grandparents, children, brothers and sisters, including step-by-step ones.  You can also not be afraid that you will be required to pay fees if you sold something that you have owned for more than three years.  Inheritance, according to Article 214 of the Tax Code, also bypasses income tax.  But all the rest of the profit (from renting, selling property, income outside the Russian Federation, winnings, and so on) is taxed with income tax.  But in what sizes?  How is income tax calculated (2014-2016)? </p><h2>  For organizations </h2><p>  It is very easy to get confused.  Yes, there is a single formula for calculations.  But in each case it changes in one direction or another.  When it comes to organizations, the calculations are completely thought-provoking.  Especially when you consider that the firm must clearly know what it has income and expenses.  It also takes into account what exactly needs to be borne in mind when implementing this function.  Tax calculations of organizations can be carried out using two different methods.  More precisely, there are different forms of tax accounting.  What kind? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax calculations" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1204463.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The first is the accrual method.  Here the date of receipt and expenditure of funds is not taken into account.  That is, all expenses and incomes are simply indicated for the period when they took place.  The second is the cash method.  It is more convenient.  And practiced in many organizations.  Here, for the tax report, the specific time and date of the income and expenses received plays a role.  They must be indicated. </p><h2>  Single formula </h2><p>  Well, before you look at an example of calculating income tax in a particular case, you should find out a unified calculation formula.  It is suitable for both organizations and <span>individuals.</span>  True, it will have to be changed depending on the situation.  The thing is that the amount of tax depends on the so-called tax base and rate.  Moreover, the dependence is direct.  The work of these is the profit tax.  The calculation formula does not change either for companies, or for legal entities, or for individuals.  The difference is only in <span>tax rates.</span>  And in the appropriate database. </p><p>  What is it about?  As we have already found out, tax calculations of income are made using the accounting of revenues and expenses.  The tax base is the amount received after deduction of losses.  That is, income-expenses are equated to it.  Everything is easy and simple.  If there are no expenses, then only profit plays a role. </p><h2>  Organization Betting </h2><p>  Of course, for tax calculation to be accurate, you need to know the appropriate rates.  There are many nuances.  Therefore, special attention is paid to individuals, and then to organizations.  Without a tax rate, an example of settlements will simply lose its meaning.  So what can you prepare for in the Russian Federation? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="2014 income tax calculation" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1204462.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The main income tax rate in Russia for 2016, according to information posted on the website of the tax authorities of the Russian Federation, is 20%.  That is, it is this percentage of the base that will be paid to the state treasury by organizations most often. </p><p>  If the income is obtained from securities, then you will have to pay 30%.  they pay half less when it is received by the owners of municipal and state enterprises, as well as from dividends of a foreign organization on shares of Russian companies.  Depositary receipts allow you to pay 13%.  Foreign organizations that are not connected with activities in Russia through a permanent government pay income tax in the amount of 10 percent, and 9% is the rarest rate.  It is possible upon receipt of income on certain municipal securities (for details, see article 284 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, part 4, paragraph 2). </p><h2>  Personal Income Rates </h2><p>  An example of calculating corporate income tax can already be given.  But if we are talking about individuals, do not rush.  The thing is that the single income tax rate for citizens in the Russian Federation is set at 13%.  This figure is taken into account most often.  But there are exceptions.  For example, you can take 9% of the profit for the tax rate.  But such a rule applies only when dividends are received by citizens until 2015, and bonds with a mortgage - until 2007.  Dividends from organizations received by individuals who are not residents of the Russian Federation are taxed at 15%.  Other income requires payment of 30%, and winnings, and, for example, credit ruble loans - 35. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="organization profit tax calculation" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1204461.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Example (enterprises) </h2><p>  Now that all the basic information is known, you can give a clear example of the calculation of income tax.  And for individuals and for organizations.  Let's start with the second option.  After all, there are a lot of nuances.  It is important to consider all input data.  Otherwise, errors in the calculations are possible. </p><p>  Suppose we have an enterprise in Russia.  It receives a loan from the bank for this tax reporting period in the amount of one million rubles.  In <span>this case, the prepayment</span> fluctuates at the level of 400,000. Revenues and VAT amounted to 1,770 and 270 thousand rubles, respectively, in the first quarter.  At the same time, production costs amounted to 560,000, 350,000 were paid to employees, insurance amounted to about 91,000, depreciation - 60,000. The company also gives a loan to another company in the amount of 25 thousand rubles, and in the previous period tax loss amounted to 120,000. </p><p>  So, how to calculate how much and where to pay?  First you need to calculate the costs for the specified quarter.  It summarizes salary, depreciation, issued credit, insurance, production costs.  It turns out that the expense will be: 560 + 350 + 25 + 91 + 60 + 350 = 1,086 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Next, you need to find out how much will be the tax base.  For this, all expenses and VAT are subtracted from revenue.  Losses in the previous reporting period are also counted.  The following example will turn out: 1,770,000 - 270,000 - 1,086,000 - 120,000 = 294 thousand rubles.  This amount will be taxed. </p><p>  What's next?  Only a few left.  For example, in our case, the company does not have any features.  So, it‚Äôs enough to multiply the tax base by the tax rate.  And we will get the exact amount due for income tax for our organization.  It turns out: 294,000 * 20% = 58,800 rubles.  They must be paid in the first quarter as a tax. </p><h2>  Settlements for individuals </h2><p>  This is not worth ending.  For individuals, there are also very interesting options.  For example, when they are entitled to any deduction.  Suppose that citizen N receives a salary of 58 thousand rubles and has one child.  An example of calculating income tax will be as follows. </p><p>  The standard deduction for a minor in this case will be 1,400 rubles.  This amount should be taken from the salary.  We get a tax base of 56,600. From this amount, you will have to calculate the income tax of 13%.  It turns out: 56 600 * 13% = 7 280 rubles.  That is how much you will need to pay as income tax. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="income tax calculation procedure" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1204460.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  IP with the simplified tax system </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the so-called simplified system is characteristic of individual entrepreneurs.  They pay income tax, but in a slightly different form.  The rate will be 6% for 2016.  Perhaps this is the only contribution (with the exception of contributions to the FIU and insurance), which worries entrepreneurs. </p><p>  The example of calculating income tax in this case is more than simple.  It all depends on what kind of income a citizen receives.  The amount necessary for payment will be taken from him.  For example, an entrepreneur earned 360,000 rubles a year.  He works on the simplified tax system.  At the end of the tax reporting period (this is by April 30) you need to pay: 360,000 * 6% = 21,600 rubles.  Everything is easy and simple.  No expenses - only income.  As you can see, tax calculations are actually not so difficult.  True, if you only know all the features of their charges.  Most often, to make accurate calculations, people use online calculators for a particular case. </p>
