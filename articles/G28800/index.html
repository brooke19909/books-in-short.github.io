The health and general well-being of a person depend on how correctly these processes go.  What is a <span>metabolism?</span>  These are chemical, physiological and physical processes that occur in the field of material exchange and energy exchange in living organisms.  This also includes the metabolism between the body itself and the environment that surrounds it. </p><p>  Simply put, then in the process of life, the human body receives substances that are used by it for full functioning.  Then the decay products unnecessary to the body are released into the environment. </p><p>  This conversion of matter and energy is called metabolism.  This is a complex process, which at the cellular level represents a huge chain of chemical reactions.  They have a certain sequence and constitute a metabolic pathway.  The metabolism in the cell depends on many genetic and <span>chemical processes</span> that occur in the body. </p><p>  What is a metabolism and what is its sequence? </p><p>  The first stage is the flow of air into the lungs, and nutrients into the system of the gastrointestinal tract. </p><p>  Then <span>chemical reactions occur,</span> as a result of which proteins, carbohydrates and fats are broken down into water-soluble compounds.  Then they enter the lymph and blood. </p><p>  The next stage is the transportation of substances to the organs and tissues by blood.  More complex chemical reactions take place there, which include the breakdown of substances, the release of energy.  As a result of this process, decay products appear. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the third stage, the decomposition products are removed from the body. </p><p>  Metabolism takes place in two directions.  Distinguish between anabolism and catabolism. </p><p>  Anabolism is a process of biosynthesis of <span>substances of organic</span> origin.  It is necessary for the development, growth of cells.  In addition, these processes provide energy storage.  What is the metabolism at this level?  This is the chemical transformation of substances entering the body with food into other compounds with a more complex structure. </p><p>  Catabolism is the opposite reaction in meaning.  This is a splitting of reactions having a complex formula into simpler substances.  Some of these substances are used for biosynthesis, and some are excreted as decay products. </p><p>  These two kinds of processes complement each other.  The physical and psychological state of a person depends on this.  Violations of this balance lead to a malfunction in the body.  The cause of this may be chronic or hereditary diseases.  Improper nutrition also affects the <span>metabolism of</span> substances. </p><p>  It is possible to improve a metabolism, using a certain set of products.  Citrus fruits are among the most powerful metabolic regulators.  They improve digestion and, therefore, the metabolic process. </p><p>  Green tea is famous for its beneficial qualities.  It also improves metabolic processes and lowers cholesterol. </p><p>  The absence of certain chemicals or their lack significantly inhibits metabolic processes.  Calcium deficiency leads to delayed processing of fats and their removal from the body. </p><p>  Almonds are another product that speeds up metabolism.  In addition, it improves vision and heart function. </p><p>  Natural coffee speeds up metabolic processes by about three percent. </p><p>  Products that have a beneficial effect on metabolism include turkey meat, apples, beans, spinach, broccoli, cinnamon, oatmeal, curry and soy milk. </p><p>  We figured out what metabolism is.  But the cause of his violations may not be one.  To identify it, you should undergo a full examination.  But in any case, proper nutrition is beneficial for any organism and has a beneficial effect on all its processes. </p>
