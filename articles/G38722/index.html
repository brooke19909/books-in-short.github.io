It is prudent to arrange a transfer from the airport and on the way back, because getting to the hotel is not easy.  The path takes a couple of hours, but according to the reviews of tourists who visited this place, it is worth it to get to such a picturesque corner on the farthest island of Thailand. </p><p>  In those rooms that have a TV, cable channels work, including one Russian.  Every year more and more tourists from Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union come to Thailand, so do not be surprised if a smiling local Russian-speaking girl meets you at the reception. </p><p>  If you want to travel alone on the island, you can order a rental car directly at the hotel, especially since the parking lot will be free.  For lovers of organized trips to the sights at the hotel there is a tour desk where you can join a group of compatriots. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Siam Beach Resort reviews provide an overview of breakfast in the hotel restaurant.  Although they are served on a buffet basis, many describe the set of products as traditional for three-star hotels in the world.  These are boiled eggs or scrambled eggs, sausages, meat and cheese slices, cereal and pancakes, jam for sandwiches, drinks - tea, coffee, juices.  Rice and stewed vegetables are also prepared.  Adds a lot of positive fruits. </p><p>  For lunch and dinner, tourists go to a cafe in the village, which is a 15-minute walk along a sandy beach.  Prices are low, and the food is all tasty and fresh.  Many heartily ate seafood.  There is even a restaurant of Russian cuisine, which (according to reviews) serves excellent borsch. </p><h2>  Opinions of tourists </h2><p>  The quality of service at Siam Beach Resort, as well as in other places of rest, is easy to determine by reading the reviews of tourists who visited there.  About the hotel on the island of Koh Chang, opinions of people agree.  This is just a wonderful place to relax, where you can stay in nature and enjoy the silence.  They note a beautiful and clean beach, warm water of the bay.  Many were engaged in diving and admired the beauty of the underwater world of the island. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, some noted poor soundproofing in the rooms, tourists were prevented by the sound of the waves falling asleep at night.  Many may not agree with this opinion, but this should be taken into account for people with a weak nervous system.  It is also advised not to leave any products on the veranda, as it attracts local monkeys at night. </p><p>  We hope that the information received will help you make a choice in favor of this hotel, because after noisy megalopolises many people want to relax in nature. </p>
