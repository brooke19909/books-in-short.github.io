It is these associations that appear in the imagination of a person who presents a set of these objects on a desk.  Agree, if you add some light, successfully pick up the shadows and take a picture of this picture, you will get an element of mystery. </p><h2>  Numismatists - who are they? </h2><p>  A coin collector is called a numismatist.  Now this is not a person with a great fortune.  Collectibles are currently engaged in people of different interests, professions and financial opportunities. </p><p>  Common interest rallied the numismatists.  You can see a lot of ads like: "Collecting coins in Russia" or "Buy coins."  And make sure how wide the geography of communication of numismatists is. </p><h2>  What is the demand for coins? </h2><p>  Now the coin market is a full-fledged business that is developing and is gaining more and more momentum every year.  Why?  Yes, because time goes on, coins become only more expensive from this, the demand for them rises.  On average, coins in only one year increase in price by 7-8%. </p><p>  Collectors and distributors of antique coins operate in the same business system.  On the network you can see a dozen online stores that offer their services for the sale of old coins.  You may encounter different prices for them.  Some copies can reach 200,000 rubles for an audience, while simple ones can be purchased for 150 rubles. </p><h2>  What determines the price? </h2><p>  Novice collectors of antique coins may face problems in pricing.  Consider specific examples. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1. The appearance of the coin and its circulation.  You see in front of you two coins of 5 kopecks in 2002 without letters with an approximate value of 3,000 rubles.  They have the same circulation, but one is more expensive.  Why?  Because she has a much better appearance and degree of preservation. </p><p>  2. The rarity of the coin.  It often happens that a 1960 coin will cost more than the same price counterpart in 1950.  You say - she is 10 years older than her, which means it should be more expensive.  This logic has the right to life, but if coins of the 1960 model were issued in a smaller edition, then the price advantage would be in this case. </p><p>  3. In the catalogs of numismatists, coin prices are often indicated.  They are not always accurate.  The first and second paragraphs clearly demonstrate why this is happening. </p><p>  Buying and selling occurs through bank numbers of coin collectors.  Using the Internet and banks, money exchange is not difficult. </p><h2>  Collecting - a hobby or something more? </h2><p>  Now collectors of ancient coins are stepping up their activities in the market.  This is due to good demand for goods.  There is a buzzword - investment.  Now it‚Äôs fashionable to invest not only in apartments, cars and securities, but also <span>coins.</span>  <span>Securities</span> and apartments may depreciate due to the difficult political and economic situation in a country or region.  Coins only go up.  According to the authoritative publication "Vedomosti": "Prices for ancient coins are increasing annually." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="antique coin collectors" class="if" height="492" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25101/553466.jpg" width="486"></div>

    <p>  Russian coin collectors use the services of the Moscow and St. Petersburg <span>mints.</span>  After minting, the coins are launched by the Russian Central Bank into circulation and for sale.  Russian coins are produced for different audiences.  You can find coins with cheap finishes designed for wide demand.  There are Russian coins made of precious metals.  As a rule, they come out in a limited edition, have a high cost.  However, coins are sold very quickly due to high demand. </p><p>  Buying coins is not only a business.  This is still a hobby and a real genuine love for Russian history.  Now collectors of Russian coins are not only Russians and residents of the CIS countries.  Interest in Russian coins has recently been increased in foreign countries. </p><p>  Coins of Russia are minted from 1992 to the present.  They have long found their client and are regularly in demand in the market.  A complete list of the coin catalog can be found on the website of the Central Bank of Russia. </p><p>  The coin collector is often called the patriot of Russia.  Indeed, about 40% of numismatists in Russia are engaged in collecting domestic coins. </p><h2>  Soviet coins </h2>

    <p>  Coins from 1922 to 1991 are considered Soviet.  This is a long period of time for which millions of copies were minted.  Most coins of the Soviet period are inexpensive and have always been issued in large numbers.  Consequently, they are in high demand in the market due to reasonable prices. </p><p>  The collector of Soviet coins knows which period of the USSR is most relevant for numismatists.  The most interesting and expensive coins in the USSR were issued in 1961.  If 1 kopek of 1960 will cost 40 rubles, then 1 kopek of 1961 costs about 400 rubles.  The difference is ten times significant.  Collectors of Soviet coins always turn their eyes to the wave of production in 1961.  Their circulation is reduced annually, and the cost increases.  This is a smart investment. </p><p>  In 1961, a radius was added to the KGB‚Äôs decision.  This is radioactive material.  Moreover, the coins from the Stradius over time began to bring benefits.  They were used as fuel at nuclear power plants. </p><p>  It is now profitable to sell coins of this period abroad.  So, Japan is buying our coins.  The price for 1 ruble is a trifle - 1,500 dollars. </p><h2>  Commemorative coins </h2><p>  Commemorative coins have nothing to do with ordinary Soviet and Russian coins.  These are coins of a special sample, which by no means always fall into common use.  Commemorative coins can not always be paid.  Often they act as a memory of an event or an anniversary of that event. </p><p>  The collector of commemorative coins always pays attention to the circulation and significance of the coin when buying.  Examples of commemorative coins: </p><p>  1. "200th anniversary of the lunch in the Patriotic War of 1812" with the emblem. </p><p>  2. "30 years of the Communist Party of the USSR." </p><p>  3. "The 20th anniversary of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow." </p><p>  4. ‚ÄúTorch of the Olympic flame in Sochi‚Äù (2014 coin). </p><p>  Coins became widely known during the period of the Soviet Union.  They are no less popular in modern Russia.  Such coins are usually sold by the Central Bank.  Own coin production is regarded as counterfeiting.  This rule is valid even if the coins are not intended to be paid by them. </p><h2>  Foreign coins </h2><p>  The category of foreign coins includes all coins that have been produced and minted abroad at different intervals.  In history, it turned out that foreign coins are always in high demand.  For Canadians, medieval coins of the Russian Mint are interesting, and Russians are interested in Canadian money during its capitalization of the early twentieth century. </p><p>  Many collectors of old coins are not engaged in numismatics randomly, but thoughtfully and for a specific purpose.  The Russians are in demand money and <span>coins of Germany</span> from the period 20-30-ies.  Often the goal is to collect all the possible coins that were issued on a particular territory in the period 1933.  The period is interesting, filled with political events, and the coins have their own historical spirit.  The more complete the <span>collection of coins,</span> the more it will cost on the market. </p><p>  You can purchase coins of other states.  A more diverse and wide selection is provided than in Soviet and Russian coins.  Pricing policy allows people with different financial conditions to collect foreign currency. </p><h2>  World famous collectors </h2><p>  Famous collectors of ancient coins are wealthy and influential people.  You will not always be able to meet them on the street or in the nearest pizzeria.  However, they are definitely on the Forbes Top 50 ranking pages. </p>

    <h2>  How to store and clean coins </h2><p>  In the article, we have already mentioned that the most successful way of storing coins is through special albums. </p><p>  To maintain the specimens in good condition, constant air temperature and moderate humidity are required.  Coins should be protected from moisture as much as possible.  They can not be cleaned with improvised household means.  To do this, there are special tools for coins, with which you can monitor their quality. </p><h2>  Prospect for the future </h2><p>  Collectors are people who know a lot about not only coins, but also history itself.  It is she who makes it possible to understand the value of each coin, based on the historical era.  We already mentioned the period of 1961 in the USSR in the context of the article.  This is one of the striking examples of understanding the historical process. </p><p>  There is an unwritten rule: bought a coin - forget about it.  Be sure to remember it after 4-5 years, when it grows in price.  This is how business is done in monetary affairs. </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="commemorative coin collector" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25101/553504.jpg" width="514"></div>  When buying a coin, you need to compare its circulation and value.  The benefit of selling a coin depends on this.  In conclusion, it should be said that not every business in which money is invested is profitable.  Even if we are talking about collecting old coins.

    <p>  There are always risks.  They are associated with currency purchases and dollar fluctuations.  The coin "50 years of victory in the Second World War" cost - at the rate - $ 3.  Now - less than 1 dollar.  In fact, we invested wisely.  And they bought a <span>collectible coin.</span>  They waited for time and wanted to sell it.  The market allows you to sell a coin, but does not provide an opportunity to earn. </p><p>  Invest wisely, carefully and correctly. </p>
