  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Direct democracy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern democracy is significantly different from ancient democracy.  However, along with this, the <span>concept of "democracy"</span> can be interpreted in different ways.  Today, the term "direct democracy" is increasingly used.  In a broad sense, <span>this definition</span> means that citizens have the right to participate in the development of decisions on major government issues.  This right is exercised in the form of a popular vote.  Direct democracy is the result of both its own initiative and the implementation of mandatory constitutional provisions, that is, it does not depend on the will of the government or parliament. </p><p>  The above definition expresses the first mandatory criterion for public law.  So, direct democracy does not apply to individuals.  Activity in this case is aimed at solving key government issues.  For example, direct elections of the president or mayors are not a manifestation of direct democracy. </p><p>  The second mandatory criterion is the empowerment of citizens.  Moreover, direct democracy procedures are aimed at the separation of these powers.  The separation of powers, as a rule, means that a specific number of citizens (the number of people in a group is determined by law) can initiate the implementation of popular law, regardless of the desire of the legislative or executive branch.  In other words, plebiscites (nationwide voting), initiated not by citizens, but by authorities, also do not belong to direct democracy.  Based on this criterion, the difference between a referendum and a plebiscite is determined. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Direct democracy includes three types of procedures: referendum, counter (alternative) proposal and initiative.  Each type has its own implementation method.  For all methods, there are different institutions of direct democracy. </p><p>  A referendum is the <span>civil right to</span> reject or decide on a power body.  This right is exercised by popular vote.  In the case when the vote is initiated by decision of the authorities, they are not talking about a referendum, but about a plebiscite. </p><p>  The initiative is the right of a specific number of citizens to the proposal to all voters to introduce a new law or amend an existing one.  The decision is made on the basis of the results of the popular vote. </p><p>  Citizens organizing the initiative can seek a referendum on their proposals (provided that this initiative is formally adopted).  Citizens are also entitled to withdraw their proposal.  This condition must be permitted by law. </p><p>  A counter proposal from citizens is formulated in the framework of a referendum or procedure for organizing an initiative.  After that, the decision on the alternative proposal (as well as on the original one) is taken in accordance with the voting results. </p><p>  The nature and degree of application of direct democracy procedures depends on certain factors.  The existing traditions for resolving various situations in society have a great influence, that is, their (society) <span>political culture</span> and the number of conflicts themselves.  Equally important is the degree of complexity of the structure in a given society, and the alignment of political forces in it. </p><p>  The effectiveness of direct democracy depends on the objectivity and completeness of compliance with basic conditions.  At the same time, on the other hand, there is also a dependence on specific forms of civil law instruments and their applicability in practice.  As you know, democracy cannot exist where violent methods are used.  In addition, incomplete and incorrectly applied procedures can be not only ineffective, but in some cases can be counterproductive. </p>
