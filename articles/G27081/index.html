They are located on the territory of the Tyumen administrative district.  This system consists of 9 small reservoirs that are interconnected by straits. </p><p>  Andreevsky Lake Complex is a popular place to visit in this region.  There are always a lot of tourists, and local residents are also frequent visitors to the ponds.  It is worth noting that St. Andrew's Lakes (Tyumen) are the largest in this area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Andreev lakes Tyumen" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1147029.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Natural features </h2><p>  Conventionally, the lake system is divided into: </p><ul><li>  Upper - Big and Small Lake. </li><li>  The lower ones are Nazarikovo, Dirty, Big Duvan, Pesyanka, Batarlyga and Duban. </li></ul><p>  Not far from this complex there are two more reservoirs, and although they are not connected to the Andreevsky straits, they nevertheless have a similar origin.  These are Chapkul and Mostovoe lakes. </p><p>  All ponds were formed in a valley of a dried river.  St. Andrew's Lakes (Tyumen) are of river origin.  All are characterized by insignificant depth. </p><h2>  Upper lakes </h2><p>  Although these areas are often visited by locals and are favorite vacation spots for the Tyumen, only the Upper Lakes are suitable for swimming.  On the coastline there are small sandy beaches with a smooth approach to the water. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Those who like to live in comfortable conditions even during <span>their holidays</span> should pay attention to the <span>Upper Lake</span> Andreevskoye (Tyumen).  The Borovoye recreation center will welcome tourists with pleasure.  This complex belongs to the budget, so there is not much entertainment.  In the warmer months there are a lot of vacationers. </p><p>  If you are willing to spend a large amount on vacation, you can stay at the Lost Paradise base.  There is an individual beach, a bathhouse is built, a TV is installed in each room.  Also provided is another entertainment complex that is organized for tourists visiting the Big Lake Andreevskoye (Tyumen).  <span>The recreation center</span> is distinguished by good living conditions and cleanliness on site. </p><p>  The most expensive pleasure is the yacht club.  A day from one person costs from 1300 rubles.  However, here you can rent a catamaran, a boat and even a yacht, there is the opportunity to ride a jet ski.  Sports grounds were built on the territory.  For those who want to sunbathe and swim, there is a clean sandy beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Andreevskoe Tyumen recreation center" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1147028.jpg" width="513"></div>

    <h2>  Lower lakes </h2><p>  Lower St. Andrew's Lakes (Tyumen) do not differ in developed infrastructure.  All these reservoirs have ‚Äúwild‚Äù coasts, there are practically no vacationers here.  However, thanks to the dense forest, you can collect many berries and medicinal plants here.  People who collect them wander into these places. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The lower lakes have marshy shores and a silt bottom, so they are not suitable for swimming.  However, these places can be considered a paradise for fishermen.  Around the lake system is a pine forest - a great place for hunters.  On the bank of Pesyanka - the lower lake Andreevskoe (Tyumen), the photo of which you see below - there is a hunting farm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Andreevskoe Tyumen photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1147027.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Archeological excavations </h2><p>  But St. Andrew's Lakes received great popularity in the archaeological plan.  As a result of excavations, scientists found several dozen sites of ancient people on their shores.  According to the results of the expeditions, a separate Andreevsky <span>archaeological culture</span> was even distinguished <span>.</span> </p><p>  The first excavations in these places began at the end of the 19th century by the local historian Ivan Tyantsov.  After his death, the study of this area continued for several decades.  Many memorials, parking lots, jewelry made of silver and bronze, household items, a bronze idol of worship, and even the remains of an ancient ‚Äútown‚Äù, which they called Andryushin, were found.  Currently, it can be seen on the shores of lakes.  Some finds are dated by chronological frames of the V century.  In the town of Andryushin, there are now more than 30 ruins, half-dugouts. </p><p>  In the 80 years on the territory where the main excavations took place, the St. Andrew's Archaeological Museum was built, in which the finds are stored.  This place is not quite ordinary, except for the halls that are familiar to us, here you can walk along a special path, visit places of parking and even sanctuaries.  The museum is open from 10 to 18 hours, Monday and Tuesday - weekends.  The entire local area is a conservation area.  It is strictly prohibited any kind of "human intervention" - hunting, spending the night and so on. </p><p>  In early spring, you can witness an interesting spectacle: on the Big St. Andrew's Lake, a real reconstruction <span>of the Battle of Ice is</span> taking place <span>.</span>  On the southern shore of this reservoir, a small children's railway was laid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Andreevskoe Lake Tyumen how to get there" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1147026.jpg" width="600"></div>
