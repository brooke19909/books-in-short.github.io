  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to recover deleted files from your phone: instructions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Surely, there have been cases when everyone with one wrong hand movement accidentally deleted important information from a mobile gadget.  And if such problems are solved relatively easily on a personal computer, then things are much more complicated with smartphones and tablets. </p><p>  If you deleted a file on your phone, you can, in principle, restore it, and this is not as complicated as it seems at first glance.  But there are some nuances that relate not only to the software part, but also to the hardware.  Nevertheless, the hope of not reanimating lost data is always there. </p><p>  From our article you will find out whether it is possible to recover deleted files from the phone and how to do it with the least loss for both the mobile device and your nerves.  We will consider the main tools necessary for this event and give a brief briefing on each. </p><h2>  Features of mobile platforms </h2><p>  It‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that devices on iOS and Windows Phone platforms are no good in this regard and that lost information is reanimated extremely reluctantly and only with rare exceptions.  So if you deleted a file on your phone, it is impossible to restore it on these OSs.  The only thing that at least somehow lends itself to a specific software aimed at resuscitation of data is a memory card.  And from the internal drives, alas, everything is permanently deleted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techworm.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="deleted file on phone how to recover" class="if uuid-2988052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2988052.jpg"></div><p>  The Android platform, unlike iOS and Windows Phone, is much more flexible in terms of data recovery.  Despite the abundance of various proprietary firmware, all of them provide more or less free access to the internal drive, not to mention memory cards.  In the case of Android, recovering deleted files on the phone is noticeably easier.  We will consider this platform just. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to reanimate files? </h2><p>  In order to recover deleted files on the phone, you will have to turn to a third-party software for help.  There is a lot of the latter on the Internet, but not every utility adequately copes with the tasks. </p><p>  Some programs do not try to recover deleted files from the phone at all, but bring a virus there.  So with the choice of such software you need to be extremely careful.  We will consider the most popular and well-established applications with a lot of positive feedback from users. </p><h2>  Dr.Fone for Android </h2><p>  Many advanced users recommend this particular product.  The utility allows you to recover deleted files both from the phone‚Äôs memory card and from the internal drive.  And copes with the task extremely efficiently.  At least, noticeably better (higher percentage of resuscitation) than other similar software. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to recover deleted files on the phone" class="if uuid-2988049" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2988049.jpg"></div><p>  This is a desktop application, so for it to work, we need a personal computer running the Windows operating system.  The program showed itself equally well both with the new tenth version of the OS, and with the older ones - the "eight" and the "seven". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order to recover deleted files from the phone‚Äôs memory, you need to install the program on your computer, run it and connect your mobile gadget via the USB interface.  It is also worth noting that on a smartphone or tablet you need to enable the "USB Debugging" mode. </p><p>  After the program determines the model of your device, it will start installing drivers for it (you need an Internet connection).  After that, a working window appears with a list of data for resuscitation.  To recover deleted files from your phone, you need to arrange the corresponding beacons - audio, photo, video or all together. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.miui.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to recover deleted files from android phone" class="if uuid-2988053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2988053.jpg"></div><p>  The program also allows you to reanimate call history, contacts, SMS, as well as messages from the popular Vatsap messenger.  The utility scans all drives, including external ones.  So Dr.Fone for Android can also recover deleted files from the phone‚Äôs flash drive. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the received administrator rights (root) significantly increase the chances of successful resuscitation of data. </p><h2>  Distribution Terms </h2><p>  Such an effective and multifunctional software, alas, simply cannot be free.  The developer distributes it only under a paid license without any exceptions like promotions, bonuses and other things.  Therefore, if you want to recover deleted files from your phone and do it as efficiently as possible, you will have to fork out for the key. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As a seed, the developer offers a trial version, where the utility after scanning determines what and how it can reanimate.  If preliminary data suits you, then you can already think about acquiring a license. </p><h2>  Diskdigger </h2><p>  Another program that allows you to recover files deleted from your phone.  The utility's work is mainly aimed at resuscitation of photo images - JPG, PNG, BMP and GIF.  You can find it on Google Play. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.en.uptodown.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="recover deleted files from phone memory" class="if uuid-2988056" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2988056.jpg"></div><p>  To get started, you need to download and install the application.  After starting the wizard window will open, where you need to click on the button ‚ÄúStart image search‚Äù.  Then the utility will analyze all available drives and give a preliminary result.  From the list presented, you need to select the files that you are going to reanimate, and then click on the "Restore" button. </p><p>  If the settings did not indicate the place where the files will appear after the procedure, a window with a file manager will appear.  Here you need to select the folder where all the images will be sent after recovery. </p><p>  The utility can reanimate files without gaining administrator rights, but judging by user reviews, root access significantly increases the chances of success.  Also in the settings you can set more detailed data for searching for deleted images: size, volume and creation date. </p><h2>  Distribution Terms </h2><p>  The program is distributed under a free license and, unlike other similar products, is completely devoid of annoying advertising.  Nevertheless, the latter still occurs, but it cannot be called aggressive.  Because the developer through this utility advertises his adjacent and noticeably more functional product - DiskDigger Pro.  It is paid and allows you to restore not only images, but also other types of files. </p><h2>  GT Recovery for Android </h2><p>  Just like in the previous case, this is a mobile application and a personal computer is not needed for resuscitating files.  The utility showed itself very well in working with, so to speak, problem gadgets and allows you to recover deleted files on Samsung, Motorola, LG phones and other devices with proprietary firmware that reluctantly or does not give access to system data of the Android platform at all ". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gtrecovery.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to recover deleted files from the phone" class="if uuid-2988054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2988054.jpg"></div><p>  The application has wide capabilities and allows you to reanimate not only photo, audio and video content, but also SMS, contacts, text documents, calls, as well as messages from Vatsap and Viber social instant messengers. </p><p>  The utility can be found on Google Play.  After downloading with the subsequent installation, the main window with the assistant wizard will open.  Here, everything is divided into sections, upon opening which the program offers to start scanning the device. </p><p>  Upon completion of the check, a list of found files that can be reanimated is displayed.  Having placed the beacons on the necessary or having selected everything, you must click on the "Restore" button.  After which the program will prompt you to select a location on the drive to save data. </p><p>  If you have administrator rights, the chances of success increase markedly and there are more sections for recovery in the assistant wizard.  But even without root access, the program showed itself very well. </p><h2>  Distribution Terms </h2><p>  The utility is distributed completely free of charge, but the developer, alas, decided how to monetize it using advertising.  Annoying banners, offers from "Aliexpress" and installation packages with games are streaming quite often.  Nevertheless, the product is very sensible and effective, so if you do not want to splurge on serious decisions and rarely indulge in the "Delete" button, then you can be patient. </p><h2>  EaseUS Mobisaver for Android </h2><p>  It is also a mobile file recovery utility, so there is no need to use a personal computer.  Reviews about the program are mostly positive and you can find it on Google Play.  You should immediately warn that for the application to work correctly, you must obtain administrator rights.  Otherwise, the utility simply will not work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="androidcure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to recover deleted files from the phone‚Äôs flash drive" class="if uuid-2988050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2988050.jpg"></div><p>  The program, alas, is devoid of Russian-language localization, but there should not be any problems with installation or with subsequent use.  The application interface is simple, intuitive and even a novice user will understand it. </p><p>  In order to restore files, you need to run the utility and in the window that appears select the necessary section for resuscitation: video, photo, audio, documents, contacts or SMS.  After that, the program will begin to scan drives for deleted data. </p><p>  In the list below, you need to select the files or information that you want to recover.  Then click on the Recovery button, set a location to save and wait for the process to complete. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidheadlines.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="recover deleted files from the phone‚Äôs memory card" class="if uuid-2988055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2988055.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the feedback from users, the utility copes with resuscitation on such finicky gadgets as Samsung, LG, Motorola, NTS, and Google's Nexus.  The application also supports old versions of the Android platform - 2.3 and 4.0. </p><h2>  Distribution Terms </h2><p>  The utility is distributed free of charge and is surprisingly practically devoid of advertising.  It is in very small quantities and can not be called aggressive.  Those who need advanced features without any restrictions on the number of files for resuscitation will have to fork out for the Pro version.  It functions in the same way as free, but is devoid of advertising and works with a wider list of mobile gadgets. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  All the above utilities do not give a 100% guarantee of recovering lost files.  It is also worth considering that the chance to reanimate deleted data is significantly increased if this procedure is carried out immediately after an accidental erasure.  New files overwrite sectors and tracks on the drive, and old information permanently disappears. </p><p>  In order not to suffer with the recovery procedure, it is better to make it a rule to backup data.  Moreover, today it is not necessary to carry out all this manually.  There is a special software which, without your participation, will periodically make copies of all your files.  You just have to indicate which ones. </p><p>  In addition, the abundance of cloud services allows you to completely forget about the problem of data recovery.  At your service "Google Drive", "Dropbox", "Yandex.Disk" and many other similar solutions.  If you are an ordinary user and all your data occupy no more than 5 GB, then the services of these services will be free for you. </p>
