    <h2>  First talk </h2><p>  When you come to the bank for a loan, you need to go through a so-called interview.  This is a mandatory process that will show you from one direction or another.  If you seem suspicious to a bank employee, you cannot get a loan.  You were denied a loan at Sberbank without even looking at the documents?  Then the reason really lies in the conversation.  Most likely, either you seemed a very wealthy person, and this fact is suspicious, or insolvent.  Surprise failures is not worth it.  It remains only to try again after a while. </p><h2>  Income </h2><p>  In order to take a loan from a bank, you must confirm your income.  More precisely, solvency.  Any citizen applying for a loan should be able to repay the debt.  No exceptions!  This is the most important moment that can only be.  Have you been denied a loan at Sberbank?  Why did it happen?  There are several options: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  you have no income; </li><li>  your earnings are too low; </li><li>  suspiciously high profits. </li></ul><p>  Remember, bank loans do not give insolvent citizens, people with low salaries, too.  If you have a high level of income, refusal also takes place.  After all, people do not need self-sufficient loans.  It is likely that you are a scammer.  This is an extra reinsurance by the bank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="refused a loan to Sberbank why" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1320535.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Another bank </h2><p>  Have you been denied a loan at Sberbank?  For what reasons could a failure have followed?  There are a lot of them.  They can find fault with everything.  Therefore, it is worth paying attention to another interesting point.  Remember, have you recently approached any other banking organization for a loan?  If your application is currently under consideration, or you have been refused for some reason, Sberbank is unlikely to contact you.  Addressing competitors is one of the reasons for the sad outcome.  Sberbank is not chasing customers, they themselves come.  Therefore, the organization has the right to put forward stringent requirements for borrowers.  This is quite normal. </p><h2>  Open loan </h2><p>  These are far from all scenarios.  <span>Denied a loan at Sberbank?</span>  <span>The reasons for</span> this behavior are many.  For example, if you already have an outstanding loan, you will not be given a new one.  And not only Sberbank, "but not a single banking company at all. Before applying for a new loan, do not forget to pay off the past. Otherwise, the refusals are guaranteed to you. Only unscrupulous companies contact the debtors. Sberbank does not apply to them. So you‚Äôll either have to close your debts , or it will be necessary to look for some microfinance organization, they often issue loans without any problems, even if in small amounts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="denied a loan to Sberbank when you can apply again" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1320534.jpg" width="600"></div>

I never took a loan from them. Why did this happen?"  - It is such a plan that more and more often questions from citizens arise.  Especially for those who have not previously applied to this company for a loan.  For what reasons can failure follow?  Several options have been listed previously.  But more important is your credit history.  Perhaps it is as important as the level of income. </p><p>  Sberbank will never give a loan to a person with a tarnished credit history.  To receive money from this organization, you should not have any problems earlier.  Only the best and solvent citizens at Sberbank can get a loan.  No exceptions.  Therefore, it is advisable not to contact with a bad credit history.  Look for some other company for a loan. </p><h2>  Age </h2><p>  Denied a loan at Sberbank?  Why did it happen?  Sometimes the age of the borrower is able to play a trick on him.  Sberbank has set its own rules for citizens who want to get money on credit.  One of the selection criteria is the age of the borrower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="denied a loan to Sberbank how to find out the reason" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1320576.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the moment, only a person who has reached the age of 21 is entitled to receive a loan.  At the same time, loans are not issued to pensioners under any pretext.  Citizens have the right to apply to Sberbank for a loan only before they turn 60 years old.  After the probability of receiving a failure increases. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Another reason may be your appearance.  He is often a visiting card of a citizen.  So, he points to the solvency and integrity of the person.  No one will give a loan to someone who looks messy.  Just like those who look very wealthy.  It has already been said that the excessive brilliance and polish of a citizen impels the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfraud.  Therefore, you should not be surprised that you were not given a loan.  This is a common practice. </p><p>  Have you been denied a loan at Sberbank?  When can I apply again?  It is advisable to do this when you meet all the requirements of the organization.  Otherwise, it will not work to bring the idea to life. </p><h2>  No clarification </h2><p>  Many people complain that the bank refuses to explain the true reason for the refusal.  This is a common thing for such organizations.  The thing is that non-disclosure of this information serves as a kind of insurance.  From whom?  From scammers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="refused a loan from Sberbank never took a loan from them why" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1320531.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  Simply tell the real reason for the refusal to grant a loan so that an unscrupulous client could work through all his mistakes, and then try again.  No one wants to mess with scammers.  Therefore, you will not wait for an explanation of why you refused a loan at Sberbank.  How to find out the reason for this?  Only an independent analysis of the documents you have, as well as your personality.  All this will help to find the true cause of the problems. </p><h2>  Action plan </h2><p>  Often, even after several appeals to the bank, citizens are denied loans.  How then to behave?  Many people think about this.  Have you been denied a loan at Sberbank?  Where to get a loan?  In order to get the necessary amount of money in this case, it is recommended not to contact Sberbank again.  Do not waste precious time.  Better look for a more loyal organization that issues loans.  Sberbank is very responsible for the choice of borrowers.  He does not indulge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="denied a loan to Sberbank where to get" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1320530.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  No alternatives are offered.  Remember: a solvent citizen who has been working in one organization for a long time will not be denied.  It is rare for anyone to give out a loan at Sberbank for no reason.  There is a justification for everything.  It is recommended to apply again, but you should not go to Sberbank constantly.  It is much easier to contact a microfinance organization or another bank that is more loyal to customers. </p>
