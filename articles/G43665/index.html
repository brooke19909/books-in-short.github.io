It stands out in accordance with the profile of the earth.  VV Dokuchaev in 1886 for the first time classified types. </p><p>  Soils that arose during the cultivation of plots not previously suitable for the development of agriculture belong to a special group. </p><p>  Some species do not form groups (zones), are found in separate areas within the zones.  This is largely due to the characteristics of the rocks, moisture, topography. </p><p>  The most common are zonal soil types.  They (together with plant and other landscape elements) form natural areas. </p><p>  Soil types </p><ol><li>  Swamp land.  <span>These soils</span> form with prolonged or excessive constant moisture (swamping).  As a rule, they are formed in forest areas of temperate zones. </li><li>  Brown forest.  These types of soils are mainly found in <span>coniferous-deciduous and broad-leaved forests</span> in areas with a moderately warm humid climate. </li><li>  Brown semi-desert, desert-steppe.  These types of soils are formed in areas with a dry climate, in the temperate zone, under desert-steppe plant species. </li><li>  Mountain.  They are a group forming in the highlands.  Almost all types of soils that fall into this category are characterized by graveliness, low thickness and the presence of primary minerals. </li><li>  Chestnut.  Distributed in semi-deserts and steppes of the temperate zone. </li><li>  Meadow soils are formed under meadow plant species, in areas of high surface moisture or in areas subject to continuous groundwater. </li><li>  Saline.  Distributed in arid areas with a high concentration (more than 0.25%) of mineral salts that are readily soluble in water - magnesium, calcium, <span>sodium</span> carbonates <span>, sulfates,</span> chlorides. </li><li>  <span>Podzolic soils</span> are formed in mixed forests and taiga, in a temperate continental and continental climate.  They experience excessive moisture and are constantly washed with leaking water. </li><li>  Sierozems are common in <span>deserts and semi-deserts</span> in the subtropical zone. </li><li>  Merged soils are formed in the subtropical, tropical, <span>equatorial zones.</span>  In their profile, they have a merged horizon, which in the wet state swells strongly and acquires high ductility, and remains dry and solid in the dry state. </li><li>  Tundra.  A combination of soils of the Northern hemisphere, its tundra zone.  This category includes tundra humus-carbonate, sod, podzolic and other soils. </li><li>  Chernozems.  These soils are common in the steppe and forest-steppe zones of the temperate zone. </li></ol><p>  An important indicator in the classification of soil is its composition. </p><p>  Light - sandy - soils include a large amount of sand, a small proportion of humus, a small amount of clay particles.  Soils of higher density are classified as heavy - clay soils.  They do not crumble during processing, on the contrary, form large clods, which makes digging very difficult. </p><p>  Stony soils are common on the slopes of mountains or hills and are not fertile.  Most of their composition is occupied by <span>rock fragments.</span> </p><p>  The basis of <span>peat-bog soils</span> is largely organic matter.  They are rich in nitrogen, contain little potassium and a very small amount of phosphorus.  However, there are peat vivianite soils, in which, on the contrary, there is a high concentration of phosphorus. </p><p>  Sandy loam soils are endowed with many sandy properties with a more balanced ratio of components; they belong to the intermediate variety.  These soils are considered favorable in all respects for the cultivation of plants. </p>
