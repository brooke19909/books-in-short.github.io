Cossack feat</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Unfortunately, few people today remember that during the First World War the Cossack Kozma Kryuchkov lived on the Don.  Meanwhile, he became a real hero of his time.  But after the events of 1917, fame was hushed up about them, and information about their exploits was deliberately destroyed.  But not a single Cossack was so honored with such a rapid rise to the Olympus of national glory, except for him.  And not a single ‚Äústrangler of the revolution‚Äù was so slandered by Soviet officials as Kozma Kryuchkov.  His heroic exploits began to be positioned by the Bolsheviks as a propaganda lie, and a mockery was made of his name.  But the ‚ÄúSt. George's Cross‚Äù is simply not given to a person, which means that Kozma Kryuchkov received it absolutely deservedly.  What was remarkable in the biography of the aforementioned hero of the First World War and for what merits did he become a knight of the George Cross?  Let's consider this question in more detail. </p><h2>  Years of childhood and youth </h2><p>  Kozma Firsovich Kryuchkov was born in 1890 in the village of Nizhne-Kalmykovsky (Ust-Medveditsky District of the Upper Don).  Parents of the future hero adhered to strict rules of upbringing and tried to observe patriarchal foundations in the family. </p><div class="photo" data-author="" data-original=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1475721" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13628/1475721.jpg?1557127403"></div><p>  At the age of 17, Kozma Kryuchkov, whose biography is of particular interest to historians, received a horse and a checker.  Four years later, the young man graduates from the stanitsa school and joins the ranks of the third Don Cossack regiment to serve the Fatherland.  By that time, the young Cossack was already married, and two children grew up in his family - a girl and a boy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The beginning of the First World ... </h2><p>  The young man very quickly established himself as a diligent warrior and already in 1914 he rose to the command of the 6th hundred of the third Don regiment.  Kozma Kryuchkov really turned into a savvy, clever and brave Cossack, who knew a lot about military affairs. </p><p>  He took the news of the war cold-bloodedly and calmly, because he was ready for it both physically and mentally.  Soon, service for him became the main business of his life.  Contemporaries of the hero of World War I recalled that Kozma Firsovich Kryuchkov, whose biography is familiar to only a few, was a modest and shy person, but at the same time he was open to communication and showed sincerity in conversations with friends and associates. </p><div class="photo" data-author="" data-original=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1475723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13628/1475723.jpg?1557127403"></div><p>  Good physical characteristics, dexterity, courage, resourcefulness - all these qualities said that he was the real son of his Fatherland, who could at any time be in his defense. </p><h2>  Feat </h2><p>  Shortly after the outbreak of war, the Cossack Kozma Kryuchkov, together with the regiment, finds himself in the city of Kalwaria (Poland).  This is where the most important event in his life will happen.  At the end of July 1914, he and his three fellow soldiers (Ivan Schegolkov, Vasily Astakhov, Mikhail Ivankin), patrolling the territory, came across the Germans.  The forces were unequal.  The enemy detachment totaled nearly three dozen people.  One way or another, but the Germans panicked from such an unexpected meeting, but when they realized that they were opposed by only 4 Cossacks, they rushed to the attack.  But Kozma Firsovich and his comrades did not want to give up so simply: they intended to give a fitting rebuff to the Germans.  The warring parties came close to each other, and a fierce battle began.  Cossacks boldly shredded enemies with their sabers, remembering well the experience of their fathers and grandfathers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-author="" data-original=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1475727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13628/1475727.jpg?1557127403"></div><p>  At one of the convenient and suitable moments, Kozma contrived, and he had a rifle in his hands.  He wanted to open fire on the Germans, but he pulled the shutter too much and the cartridge jammed.  Then he armed himself with a saber and began to fight the enemy with a vengeance.  The outcome of the fight was stunning.  Most of the enemy detachment of the German cavalry was destroyed: only a few were saved by flight.  Moreover, on the part of the Cossacks there were no ‚Äúfatal‚Äù losses at all, but everyone was wounded.  As fellow soldiers testified, the feat of Kozma Kryuchkov did not give in to reason: he alone killed eleven Germans, and many puncture wounds were recorded on his body, while he remained alive. </p><p>  Subsequently, the hero tells: ‚Äú24 Germans were killed on the ground.  "My comrades were injured, and I received 16 stab injuries, and my horse - 11. Soon, General Rennenkampf visited White Olita and handed me the St. George ribbon."  It was the highest award for the defense of their Fatherland.  Kozma Kryuchkov - the legendary hero of the First World War - was proud of her like no other.  But Vasily Astakhov, Ivan Schegolkov and Mikhail Ivankin were also awarded: they received St. George medals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Vacation </h2><p>  Having healed the wounds in the hospital, the brave Cossack returned to his regiment, but after a short time he was sent to visit his native farm. </p><div class="photo" data-author="" data-original=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1475722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13628/1475722.jpg?1557127403"></div><p>  The fame of the feat of Kryuchkov went far beyond the borders of Nizhne-Kalmykovsky.  The emperor himself found out about him.  And the famous battle with the Germans eloquently outlined the main Russian media.  Kozma Firsovich became a national hero who personified Russian military courage.  Newspapers and paparazzi did not give Kryuchkov access.  He even became a member of the newsreel.  In 1914, almost all periodicals printed photos of the brave Cossack hero.  Kozma Firsovich‚Äôs face was decorated with postage stamps, patriotic posters and even cigarette boxes.  And he could also be seen on candy wrappers "Heroic", which were made at the Kalesnikov factory.  A whole ship was named in his honor.  The famous painter Ilya Repin painted a portrait of the legendary hero of the First World War.  There were even rumors that some young ladies specially went to the front to get acquainted with the brave Cossack. </p><h2>  The army appreciates him ... </h2><p>  Once the printed publication ‚ÄúThe Great War in Pictures and Images‚Äù writes: ‚ÄúKozma Firsovich Kryuchkov, whose feat is impossible to overestimate, became the first of the lower ranks to receive an honorary award‚Äù. </p><p>  One way or another, but his fame pursued not only the "citizen", but also in military service.  He was assigned a "privileged" position at the headquarters of the division - the head of the convoy. </p><div class="photo" data-author="" data-original=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1475724" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13628/1475724.jpg?1557127403"></div><p>  Contemporaries of the hero said that hundreds of letters came to him at the service, and the headquarters was literally filled with food parcels. </p><p>  In <span>Moscow, Kryuchkov</span> received a silver-framed saber as an offering, and in the ‚Äúcity on the Neva‚Äù he was presented with the same gift, but already in a gold rim.  In addition, Kozma Firsovich became the owner of the blade, which was filled with eulogies.  But after some time, "sleek" service at the headquarters began to hate Kryuchkov, and he again asked to fight with the Germans at the front. </p><h2>  Romanian front </h2><p>  The request of the Cossack hero was eventually considered, and Kozma Firsovich, as part of the third Don regiment, was traveling to the Romanian front.  In this theater of operations, battles were regularly fought.  Kryuchkov here shows his best qualities as a soldier.  In particular, in 1915, he and ten other fellow soldiers in one of the villages clashed with an enemy who was twice as strong as they were.  Some of the German occupiers were killed, and some were captured.  Cossacks managed to find the most valuable information about the whereabouts of enemy troops.  And this feat of Kryuchkov was marked by commanders.  Kozma Firsovich was awarded the rank of wahmister, and the general who arrived at the headquarters personally shook his hand and said that he was proud that such a brave and brave warrior served in his regiment.  After some time, Kryuchkov is trusted to command a hundred.  Subsequently, the brave Cossack repeatedly participated in strategic battles, in which he was often injured. </p><div class="photo" data-author="" data-original=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1475726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13628/1475726.jpg?1557127403"></div><p>  Once, after the battle in Poland, his life was in danger, but thanks to timely medical assistance, Kozma Firsovich survived. </p><h2>  Unpleasant incident </h2><p>  Kryuchkov received another serious wound at the turn of 1916-1917.  He was hospitalized in Rostov.  And here an unpleasant incident occurred.  Fraudsters stole the "St. George Order" from the Cossack.  This incident was immediately described in the local press.  After him, the name of Kozma Kryuchkov was practically not mentioned in the newspapers. </p><h2>  Merit Awards </h2><p>  During the years of the First World War, a Cossack from the Upper Don region was awarded several high awards, among which: two St. George crosses, two St. George medals ‚ÄúFor courage‚Äù.  He was promoted to a significant role as a clerk in the Cossacks.  In the midst of the February Revolution, Kryuchkov‚Äôs life undergoes significant changes.  Kozma Firsovich, still fragile after the hospital, "takes over" the duties of the head of the regimental committee.  But after the revolution in Soviet Russia, the former army was disbanded.  Serious disagreements arose in the Cossack milieu: one part supported the new regime, while the other supported the old regime.  Kryuchkov had his own position on this score.  Adhering to the patriarchal principles in society, he spoke for the king and the White Guard movement.  Surrounded by his associates, he returns to his native farm. </p><h2>  The difficult years of the civil war </h2><p>  But peaceful life in his native Nizhne-Kalmykovsky did not work out.  The division into red and white also affected the Cossacks. </p><div class="photo" data-author="" data-original=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1475725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13628/1475725.jpg?1557127403"></div><p>  Enemies overnight became not only bosom friends, but also close relatives.  I had to enter into a confrontation with former comrades and Kozma Kryuchkov. </p><h2>  Death </h2><p>  The legendary hero of the First World War died the death of the brave in the late summer of 1919.  Death overtook Kryuchkov in the village of Lopukhovka (Saratov Region).  The Reds fired at the village and several bullets hit the Cossack.  The comrades managed to pull Kozma Firsovich out of the shelling, but the wound received was incompatible with life.  He was buried in the cemetery of his native farm. </p>
