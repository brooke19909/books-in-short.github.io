Where to go?  How much is it?  Recently, due to the high exchange rate of the dollar, and, as a result, a drop in income, tourists are increasingly inclined to search for budget offers that can save without losing the necessary comfort and package of services. </p>

    <p>  Among tourists from the <span>countries of the former USSR</span> , the Turkish coast of the Mediterranean Sea is especially popular.  Tourists are attracted by the relatively short flight, the all-inclusive concept, as well as the orientation of Turkish hotels, restaurants, amusement parks and other objects of the tourism industry to the Russian-speaking visitor.  Therefore, the leaders in the number of vacationers in the Antalya region are Russian travelers. </p><h2>  Rest on "Fortune" </h2><p>  For those tourists who decided to save money, regardless of the dollar exchange rate and other external factors, the concept of Fortuna All Region 4 * was developed.  Let's see which hotels can fall into this concept. </p><p>  Turkey, and in particular the Mediterranean coast, has a large number of hotels of different categories and stardom.  And it so happens that, having bought a block of numbers, the tour operator cannot sell them, and in order not to lose the money paid, he is ready to give them at a discount, sometimes even without making a profit.  Also, the Fortuna All Regions 4 * system (Turkey) can be used by a travel agent to advertise hotels. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The third option is a newly built hotel.  Turkish hotels, in order not to miss the high season, sometimes open shortly before the final stage of completion of minor finishing works.  And in order to attract tourists, and sometimes check the functionality of the hotel, they give their block of rooms to the Fortuna All Regions 4 * group.  All these situations play into the hands of the tourist and allow you to save on your vacation, getting a guaranteed package of services. <br><br>  The Fortuna All Region 4 * package assumes that the tourist will definitely be populated in the category of at least four stars.  Sometimes tourists are lucky, and they end up in hotels of a higher category: 5 or 5+.  You will recognize the region and the hotel in which you will be accommodated after arrival at the information desk of the local tour operator that serves you.  It is impossible to choose a hotel in advance.  All other conditions depend on the items prescribed in the contract. </p><h2>  Regions and hotels </h2><p>  So, having arrived in Turkey, you can get into one of four regions according to the All Regions concept: Alanya, Kemer, Side, Belek.  Regions are listed by probability of being hit by the Fortune system.  Each of them has its own characteristics and is focused on a certain <span>type of recreation.</span> <br><br>  Belek is located half an hour from <span>Antalya Airport,</span> is the most respectable resort.  Buying a voucher for the Fortuna All Regions 4 * system (reviews of tourists note this) will rarely help to get into this region.  The main reason is the small number of 4-star hotels.  And if you got here, then you are unbelievably lucky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fortuna all regions 4 reviews" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33695/770088.jpg" width="440"></div><br>  Side is a region located between Antalya and Manavgat.  It features large sandy beaches.  Designed for a family relaxing holiday.  Quite regularly, tourists arriving on Fortuna are accommodated in hotels in this region. <br><br>  Alanya, the budget resort, is two hours drive from the airport.  Designed for budget and loyal tourists.  Well suited for travelers with children due to the good sandy beaches.  Customers who choose a ticket to the Fortuna All Regions 4 * system bring their photos from the rest no worse than those who rested in more presentable areas.  The likelihood that a tourist will get to this region by Fortune is more than 40 percent. <br><br>  Kemer is located near Antalya and is famous for its nightlife and youth parties.  The beach is pebble, so those who do not need a sandy bottom tend here.  A large number of budget hotels is a guarantee that Kemer will drop out to you according to the Fortuna All Regions 4 * system.  Turkey is waiting for budget tourists here.

    <h2>  Supply system </h2><p>  Another important component of relaxation is nutrition.  Given that everyone goes to Turkey for a "lazy" vacation, the following are popular when choosing <span>a food system</span> : </p><ol><li>  Half Board - includes breakfast and dinner and drinks during them.  Sometimes, however, drinks are paid.  Such a system can be useful to those who do not drink alcohol and do not spend much time in the hotel. </li><li>  <span>All Inclusive</span> - a system by which food is included on the territory of hotels, except for restaurants of the Oriental system, as well as a certain list of local and sometimes imported alcoholic drinks. </li></ol><p>  It is worth noting that each hotel itself establishes the conditions of the food system, so they can vary.  But the food option is one of those that you can choose when ordering tickets for the Fortuna All Region 4 * system. </p>

    <h2>  Rating </h2><p>  In general, given the cost of the Fortuna All Region 4 * package (often it is lower than the cost of the cheapest 4-star hotel), it is quite possible to use this concept and get quality rest for reasonable money. </p>
