Where to get a tax deduction</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The legislation of the Russian Federation allows citizens to draw up various tax deductions.  They can be associated with the acquisition or sale of property, the implementation of social protection mechanisms, professional activities, training, treatment, childbirth.  What is the specificity of the most demanded tax deductions by Russian citizens? </p><h2>  Kinds </h2><p>  Why can I get tax deductions in accordance with the legislation of Russia?  The Tax Code of the Russian Federation provides the following combination of them: standard, paid for children, property, social, professional, as well as those calculated on the fact of losses associated with the turnover of securities.  The first four types of deductions are the most sought after. </p><h2>  Production methods </h2><p>  How are tax deductions calculated and paid?  The legislation of the Russian Federation provides for two relevant mechanisms.  In the framework of the first, the deduction is calculated and paid once a year after the end of the tax period on the basis of payments already made to the treasury in the form of personal income tax (on salaries and other income). </p>

    <p>  The second mechanism assumes that a citizen legally can not pay personal income tax to the state for a certain period and with certain amounts of income.  Depending on the specific type of deduction, one or another scheme is implemented. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who has the right to deduction </h2><p>  The considered type of <span>tax preferences</span> can be granted to citizens receiving income that is taxed at a rate of 13%.  Most often this is, as we noted above, a salary.  But the corresponding income can also be formed, for example, after the sale of real estate and other types of property.  Is it possible to get a tax deduction with a simplified system of calculating fees to the treasury?  No, such mechanisms are not provided.  Similarly, the right to a tax deduction cannot be exercised by persons in the status of non-residents. </p><h2>  How are deductions made </h2><p>  Where can I get a tax deduction?  The corresponding preference for citizens is issued by the Federal Tax Service - in the territorial divisions of the regions and municipalities of Russia. </p>

    <p>  In order to receive a payment, you must contact the Federal <span>Tax Service</span> with the package of documents provided for each type of deduction.  Consider the specifics of the various types of financial preferences in question, in more detail. </p><h2>  Standard deductions </h2><p>  Why can I get tax deductions related to the category of standard?  This type of payment is made to certain categories of persons.  The deductions in question are fixed.  Depending on the basis, they can be calculated on the basis of, for example, 3 thousand rubles.  or 500 rubles.  in relation to the month.  The indicated amounts thus constitute the basis for calculating the deduction - at a rate of 13%.  That is, a person is not paid 3 thousand rubles.  and not 500 rubles, but 13% of the corresponding amount - 390 rubles.  or 75 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The legislation of the Russian Federation provides for several categories of citizens who are entitled to receive the type of deduction in question. </p><p>  Firstly, these are participants in the liquidation of <span>the Chernobyl accident, the</span> consequences of other nuclear tests, as well as citizens who have received disabilities while participating in hostilities.  In relation to them, the legislation of the Russian Federation provides for a tax deduction based on the amount of 3 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Secondly, these are the heroes of the USSR and Russia, citizens with disabilities of groups 1 and 2 and having limited opportunities since childhood, participants in hostilities, as well as residents of Chernobyl evacuated after the accident at the nuclear power plant.  Persons in this category can receive standard deductions based on the amount of 500 rubles. </p><p>  Thirdly, individuals who do not belong to the indicated categories of citizens can rely on tax preferences based on the amount of 400 rubles.  But it is guaranteed to them until their annual income reaches 40 thousand rubles. </p><p>  How many tax deductions can a person get if he has several reasons, and if it comes to standard preferences?  Only one is the one that implies the largest payout.  Moreover, standard deductions may well be combined with other types of preferences, for example, property. </p><h2>  Deductions for children </h2><p>  Strictly speaking, this type of deduction also belongs to the standard ones, however, at the same time, it is sufficiently isolated from it.  In particular, it may be combined with any of the above.  Parents or adoptive parents may receive tax deductions of the type in question.  The amount of the corresponding preference is based on the amount of 1,000 rubles.  for each child per month. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The tax deduction in question can be paid until the child is 18 years old, and if he goes to study full-time, then until he reaches 24 years of age.  Another limitation regarding the relevant payments is that a person‚Äôs income should not exceed 280 thousand rubles.  in year.  If the salary or other sources of income are greater, then the deduction is not provided. </p><p>  Also, the legislation of the Russian Federation provides for payments based on the amount of 2 thousand rubles.  They are provided if the child has a disability or is raised by a single parent. </p><p>  One parent may legally delegate the right to deductions for children to another.  This mechanism is advisable if one of the parents has unstable work.  In order to exercise this right, a person who refuses the deduction must draw up documents confirming the intention to transfer the right to the preference in question to another. </p><h2>  Nuances of standard deduction </h2><p>  If a person expects a standard tax deduction, when can I get it?  First of all, we note that direct assistance to a citizen in the implementation of the right to appropriate preferences should be provided by an employer who has the status of a <span>tax agent.</span>  Calculate the deduction and ensure its payment, or rather, to allow the legal non-payment of personal income tax in the appropriate amount, is the company's responsibility. </p><p>  However, in order to start receiving standard tax deductions, the employee must notify the employer of his desire to use the appropriate preference.  This can be done through a written statement in the prescribed form.  Also, documents confirming the employee's right to receive a standard deduction must be attached to it. </p><p>  Note that there is an alternative scenario.  It involves contacting the Federal Tax Service at the end of the tax year.  But this scheme is usually not very popular for the type of deduction in question, since it requires the employee to spend a lot of time collecting the necessary documents and interacting with the department. </p><h2>  Property Deductions </h2><p>  What can I get property type tax deductions for?  The right to register them arises from citizens most often upon the fact of certain transactions with real estate: purchase, sale or construction, as well as due to transactions with other property with high value, for example, with cars. </p>

    <p>  Regarding real estate, it can be noted that there are two main categories of property deductions of this type - those associated with expenses for the purchase of housing or those that can be formalized in connection with the income received by a citizen from the sale of their possessions.  The mechanisms by which a person can use this type of preference are different.  And therefore, each type of deduction, despite its classification as a general category, is usually considered within a separate scheme. </p><h2>  Property deductions for housing </h2><p>  The first type of property deduction is associated with the acquisition by citizens of residential real estate.  It can be an apartment, a room or a house.  The acquisition mechanism may be expressed in the form of a transaction of sale, construction of an object or participation in an equity project.  Most importantly, a citizen bears personal expenses. </p><p>  From the purchase of an apartment a person can return up to 260 thousand rubles.  from the amount of money transferred to the seller of real estate or invested in repairs, that is, on the basis of an amount of up to 2 million rubles.  Until 2014, the corresponding deduction could be issued only for one apartment, after - for any number of residential facilities.  If a citizen made a purchase of real estate through a mortgage, then he can also return up to 390 thousand rubles.  of the amount of interest payments to the bank, that is, on the basis of the amount of up to 3 million rubles.  Note that for transactions completed before 2014, the limit on payments from the Federal Tax Service on interest transferred on a mortgage loan is not limited. </p><h2>  Ways of making a deduction when buying an apartment </h2><p>  Where can I get a tax deduction for buying an apartment?  As in the case of standard payments, you can apply for the preference either through the employer or by contacting the Federal Tax Service.  Moreover, unlike the scenario with the previous type of deduction, the second method is very popular among Russians.  This is largely due to the fact that a person receives a significant amount in their hands, the equivalent of which is not easy to collect using monthly salary increases in the form of legal non-payment of personal income tax. </p><p>  Where the <span>tax deduction</span> can be obtained <span>when buying an apartment, the</span> citizen determines himself, based on personal preferences.  It can be noted that the set of documents for registration of the corresponding preference is approximately the same in both scenarios. </p><p>  What can I get tax deductions for when building a house?  In this case, the base amount for calculating payments may include expenses for the services of contractors, as well as for the purchase of building materials.  Relevant costs must be confirmed by receipts, checks and other documents, the legal force of which is recognized by the inspectors of the Federal Tax Service. </p><p>  How many tax deductions can I get by buying an apartment?  As soon as a citizen has exhausted the maximum amount of payments - 260 thousand for housing expenses and 390 thousand for interest (if the mortgage is registered), then he loses the right to apply to the Federal Tax Service for the appropriate preference, no matter how many real estate objects he subsequently acquires. </p><h2>  Property deductions for housing sales </h2><p>  What can I get tax deductions for when selling an apartment?  The mechanism for their design is as follows.  The fact is that income from the sale of housing, like salary, is taxed at a rate of 13%.  The corresponding fee should be calculated if the person owns the property for less than 3 years.  But the legislator guaranteed the participants in real estate purchase and sale transactions a deduction of 1 million rubles.  By this amount, you can reduce the cost of housing, which appears in the contract between the seller and the buyer of the apartment.  That is, if the price of housing under the contract is 1 million 200 thousand rubles, then the base for calculating personal income tax when using the indicated type of deduction will be 200 thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  It can be noted that both types of property deduction - provided that the transactions were made in the same tax period - it is permissible to mutually compensate.  For example, if a person bought an apartment for 2 million rubles, then the state should return 260 thousand rubles to him.  If in the same year he sold another property for 1.5 million rubles, then his debt to the Federal Tax Service in the amount of 13% of 500 thousand rubles.  (remaining when using the second type of deduction), namely 75 thousand rubles, it can be canceled by reducing the obligations of the state.  That is, as a result, the Federal Tax Service will have to pay the citizen upon the fact of two transactions completed by him 185 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Other deductions for the sale of property </h2><p>  The legislation of the Russian Federation allows citizens to receive not only those property deductions that are associated with the sale of housing.  There is a more universal preference in the amount of 250 thousand rubles.  It can be applied to any type of property, such as a car.  The main criterion for calculating income tax here is similar to the operation with the sale of an apartment - the corresponding fee must be paid if the property is owned for less than 3 years.  Note that a citizen can try to prove to the Federal Tax Service that he once had expenses associated with the acquisition of property, as an option - a car or other expensive type of property.  If this succeeds, then they are also used as a form of deduction.  In this case, the preference guaranteed by law may not be included in the calculation at all or partially used. </p><p>  Now you know where you can get the <span>tax deduction for an apartment.</span>  We studied the mechanisms by which it can be implemented, as well as other types of property preferences.  Let's move on to the following types of payments - social. </p><h2>  The specifics of social deductions </h2><p>  What tax deductions can be obtained from those that are social?  The legislation of the Russian Federation forms their varieties calculated on the basis of the following types of expenses: </p><p>  - for charity; </p><p>  - for training - both the taxpayer himself and his children; </p><p>  - to undergo treatment - the citizen himself, as well as members of his family; </p><p>  - to participate in programs of non-state pension funds. </p><p>  The principle of calculating the deduction is the same as for the types of payments discussed above: the Federal Tax Service must return 13% of the corresponding base. </p><p>  Regarding charity expenses, the deduction can be calculated on the basis of their entire amount, but not exceeding 25% of the citizen's income for the tax period. </p>

Where can I get a tax deduction for treatment?  It is best to contact the Federal Tax Service in the year that follows the reporting one. </p><h2>  Professional Deductions </h2><p>  The following categories of tax payers may receive professional tax deductions: </p><p>  - Entrepreneurs under the general taxation regime; </p><p>  - Citizens performing work and services under contracts; </p><p>  - notaries, lawyers and other specialists engaged in private practice. </p><p>  It can be noted that the structure of professional deductions is quite complicated.  The basic principle of exercising citizens' rights to these preferences is their ability to submit documents to the Federal Tax Service confirming the costs associated with a particular activity. </p>
