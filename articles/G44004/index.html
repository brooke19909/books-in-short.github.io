  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chic flowers do-it-yourself from fabric and felt</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To decorate clothes or the interior, you can make decorative <span>flowers with your own hands from fabric,</span> using only those materials and tools that are always at hand.  In every house there are scissors, matches and rags of synthetic material, in order to make simple <span>flowers from fabric</span> this is enough. </p><p>  You probably already had to <span>cut</span> flowers <span>out of paper</span> with your own hands.  It is no more difficult to make them from fabric.  First decide on the type of flower.  The easiest way is to make it terry, resembling a rose from nylon fabric of any color.  You can work in several ways. </p><p>  <strong>Method 1</strong> </p><p>  Cut out the required number of petals from the fabric using a paper template.  The flower is multi-tiered, therefore there should be at least 3 patterns - for the largest lower petals, for medium and small, internal ones.  Enough 5 pieces of each size.  When blanks are cut, scorch the edges of the fabric with a lighter or candle flame.  To get started, practice the scraps.  This operation will prevent the shedding of threads and make the edges of each petal stiff, and the petals themselves - voluminous, similar to real ones, in the shape of cups.  It is necessary to move the fabric along the flame evenly, not lingering in separate areas. </p><p>  Now you can start assembling.  They collect the flower on a solid foundation - a circle made of fabric or cardboard, sometimes immediately on the subject of a wardrobe or accessory that they want to decorate.  Lay out the largest petals in the desired order and grab them in the center with a thread crosswise, and then walk in a circle with a simple basting seam.  The outer edges remain free.  Next, follow the same steps for medium and small petals.  In the middle of the flower, make stamens from nodules or beads. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Method 2</strong> </p><p>  There is an easier way to create flowers with your own hands.  Only 3 pieces of different sizes in the shape of a flower with five or six petals are cut out of fabric.  The edges of the fabric are treated like petals, and the assembly takes literally several minutes. </p><p>  If you want to use a denser material, for example, fleece or felt, then the blanks of a multi-tiered flower should be different from each other in size so that each tier is visible.  These fabrics do not need to be processed - they do not crumble, and the slices always look neat. </p><p>  <strong>Method 3</strong> </p><p>  This option is suitable even for children who would like to make flowers with their own hands.  Inflorescences themselves are cut out of a fabric with a floral pattern, after which the edges are processed taking into account the properties of the material.  Fuse the synthetics over the fire, sew the cotton with a seam ‚Äúover the edge‚Äù manually or with an overlock.  It may seem to some <span>that such flowers</span> made of fabric are simple, but they look very interesting when pasted on a postcard or sewn onto a children's handbag.  Of course, it is important to choose the right pattern for the fabric from which you will cut the inflorescences, this is what determines the type of future work. </p><p>  <strong>Method 4</strong> </p><p>  Petals are cut out of white <span>cotton fabric</span> , after which they need to be starched.  Use saturated starch, giving the workpieces a curved shape, like real petals.  In this way, it is better to create flowers for the interior, which will lie in one place.  If you use them to decorate clothes - the petals are frayed and lose their appearance.  The dried starched details can be painted with a brush and paints, and then assembled into a flower. </p><p>  Thus, you can create inflorescences indistinguishable from real ones.  Subsequently, it is good to make compositions of them, decorate furniture, walls, and give to friends. </p><p>  You can apply several manufacturing methods in one work at once.  It all depends on the idea and the material that you have.  In addition to threads, glue can also be used to assemble the petals - this is more convenient, or even better, a special glue gun can be used that allows you to work without getting dirty in the adhesive. </p>
