This is a city hotel that allows tourists who come to this fabulous land to visit all the interesting places, enjoy the sea and the sun, but do not pay the last money.  In this article, we made an attempt not only to obtain information from tourist reviews about this hotel, but also to tell you which hotels are waiting for you in Mallorca and what to expect from them.  Indeed, not everyone knows that vacation in Europe, like the types of service, is very different from a trip to <span>Turkey, Tunisia or</span> Egypt.  Therefore, vacationers better know both the bonuses and features of the hotels of this <span>Spanish island,</span> as well as pitfalls.  Therefore, we begin our story with the characteristics of local hotels in general. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mediodia hotel 3" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/594178.jpg" width="227"></div>

    <h2>  Mallorca Island - hotels </h2><p>  First of all, you should decide when to go here.  It is clear that you can spend winter in Mallorca, as Chopin did with <span>George Sand,</span> but know that then you will have to look for a budget option for a long time.  Most local hotels work only during the season.  And at this time, the Germans and the British manage to book them almost completely.  After all, Mallorca is their favorite resort.  Of course, ultra-expensive hotels on the island are located near the sea.  But if you buy a ticket to such a hotel, know that there will not be special ‚Äúscourge battles‚Äù chasing strangers from ‚Äúyour‚Äù coast.  Mallorca hotels with their own beaches are a rarity.  Indeed, on the island, as in all of Spain, the seashore is a municipal property.  And anyone can come here.  So think in advance, but is it worth paying more?  After all, there are fairly cheap offers and even hostels, which are also almost on the shore.  For example, Mediodia Hotel 3, although it belongs to the class of ‚Äúthree stars,‚Äù however, it is located fifty meters from the sea.  From it, three minutes walk to the beach and four minutes to the bus stop at the airport.  And two hundred and fifty meters away is the famous port of Arenal. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  All inclusive: what does this mean in Mallorca? </h2><p>  This food system is not very popular on the island.  Moreover, all-inclusive Mallorca hotels are a rare occurrence.  And against the expansion of their number even the local hotel business is protesting.  Therefore, mainly these hotels in Mallorca are networked.  These are the Iberostar, MAR and some others, such as Delta, S'Olivera, Club Alltora Badia Park, Sumba, Vanity Hotel Suite, etc. Rest in them is somewhat reminiscent of Turkish or Egyptian, only, of course , the quality of service and products exceeds the countries mentioned by several times.  But there are also disadvantages to this.  Yes, you will have everything you want, yes, you will overeat with seafood and drink them with delicate local wine, yes, your stay here will be serene, like in paradise, but at the same time, if you are not an oligarch, of course, you don‚Äôt have any money or time left to explore the island itself.  And in cheaper hotels, such a system, in principle, is not practiced.  Therefore, for those who want to enjoy trips around the island, it is better to look for hotels with half board or breakfast.  Mediodia, which is located on the Arenal, can provide you with both. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Spain, Majorca,</span> 4 Star Hotels </h2><p>  Guests of this category - Apartamentos Mix Bahia Real, Hotel Delfin Mar, Iberostar Exagon Park, Hotel Cosmopolitan and others - the most common accommodation offer in Mallorca.  They compete with each other and vying offer various surprises and special features in service.  Some hotels have unique amusement parks, others have spas, and others have an exclusive animation team.  Someone attracts guests discharged from Italy, France or Japan by a chef, while someone attracts free diving and bike rental.  Despite the fact that not all 4 star hotels in Mallorca are located near the beach, they find something to fill this gap.  Some are built on cliffs and have gorgeous views.  There are hotels offering great packed lunches for excursions.  Almost all of them have been renovated in recent years, they have all modern and well-functioning appliances, large swimming pools and chic green areas.  Therefore, if you stay somewhere in Santa Pons or Magaluf, then most likely you will prefer a hotel of this kind.  But somewhere in the ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù Arenal, your preferences may correspond to a ‚Äútreshka‚Äù. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  If you are traveling with children </h2><p>  Family people also often think about traveling with a baby.  And a trip to Mallorca is a great choice.  It is warm here, often there is a gentle entrance to the sea, and it is very safe.  Hotels for children in Mallorca - Sol Katmandu Park &amp; ‚Äã‚ÄãResort Magalluf (ex. Sol Katmandu Resort Magalluf) <span>4 *, Delfin Playa 4 *,</span> Ola Club Maioris 4 * and others - have long attracted Europeans, and Russian tourists have already reached here with families.  Great nature, sandy beaches and, most importantly, the lack of strong heat in the summer, as well as the fact that the locals are friendly and admired by the kids, are the main reasons that many travelers burdened with offspring come here.  The local hotel business meets these wishes. </p><h2>  What hotels for children offer </h2><p>  Majorca hotels vying offer families with children special animation, swimming pools, high chairs in the restaurant, mini-clubs and babysitters.  Of course, there are hotels for adults only.  But most hotels in Mallorca accept guests with children.  If you are aiming for a budget vacation and choose El Arenal for your vacation, then your child will like it here.  You can save on luxury hotels, but at the same time, choosing, for example, inexpensive Mediodia, you get bonuses such as proximity to the beach, gentle entrance to the sea, comfortable and roomy rooms, as well as the opportunity to rent a car nearby and take your child to all the amusement parks on the island. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Majorca map" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/595389.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <h2>  "Three stars" </h2><p>  Even if you choose a hotel with a class below the Quartet, you will still not be disappointed.  Reviews of tourists about Mediodia let us know that this hotel, in principle, meets all the standards of three stars.  Excellent location, proximity to the center and the beach, as well as convenient transport interchanges, entertainment venues, shops and in general all that El Arenal is famous for, are all the main advantages of this hotel.  Such "treshki" are popular both among young people who came to "hang out", and among families on a budget, and, of course, among active tourists who prefer independent excursions.  After all, if your goal is to swim during the day and dance at discotheques at night or use the ‚Äúfull‚Äù vacation time to see Lluck, Valldemose, Soler, and luxurious Palma, then a hotel of this category usually pleases not only with its service, but also with prices .  And the hospitality of the Balearians will always remain uniquely Spanish, despite the "stardom" of the hotel where you stay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain Mallorca Hotels 4" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/594212.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  Service and rooms </h2><p>  Hotel Mediodia is quite large - it has more than one hundred and sixty rooms.  There is free Wi-Fi in the lobby of the hotel, and it‚Äôs very fast.  If you are accommodated in rooms near the lobby, you will have the opportunity to use it without going down.  The rooms offer sea views - both angular and direct.  If you do not live in a single room (and this is very rare, because our compatriots travel mainly in pairs or families), then at your service is a huge balcony with chairs and tables.  The rooms are absolutely standard - TV, air conditioning, large bathroom.  They are clean, spacious, they have everything you need.  Cleaned daily, linen changed several times a week.  Check in the room immediately, without any problems, even if you arrive ahead of time.  There is no animation, of course, but is it needed in Mediodia Hotel 3?  Mallorca is a famous center of partying youth, and the Arenal is a favorite place for thirsty discos and nightclubs.  The hotel is right in the midst of entertainment, and when you go to the promenade, at your service is everything that the soul desires. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mallorca All Inclusive Hotels" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/594199.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  At Mediodia Hotel 3 you can choose only breakfast or half board.  Of course, breakfast here, as in many European "treshki", is continental: sausage, cheese, coffee, tea, eggs, fruits, vegetables.  But for dinner, the choice is richer, there are several types of meat and fish, sweets, fruits, very good, freshest bread and delicious ice cream.  Dishes are not repeated daily.  But if you want to not just lie on the beach, but to see Mallorca, then experienced tourists believe that it is best to take only breakfast.  After all, you have so many trips that you still will not have time for dinner.  At the first intersection there is a huge grocery store where you can buy everything your heart desires, including ready-made meals.  And around the hotel you can not find a variety of cafes.  Choose a ‚Äúdaily menu‚Äù that matches our ‚Äúset lunch‚Äù and get delicious food and wine (and often coffee and dessert) for a very small price.  So you definitely will not stay hungry. </p><h2>  Beach and Pool </h2><p>  Very close to the Mediodia Hotel 3 (Mallorca) is the famous fifteen-kilometer El Arenal beach.  In fact, this area got its name from the name of the coast.  Despite the fact that many British, Germans and Dutch hang out here in the summer, there is nothing to complain about.  You can always find a free seat (especially if you arrive early).  The sea is clean, the beach is well maintained, there is no rubbish, no muck in the water or under your feet.  A lot of sports and water activities, everything is equipped.  True, the entrance to the water is quite shallow, but gentle and convenient.  Beautiful promenade with palm trees.  And if you linger here until dark, you will watch an amazing sunset.  The pool at the hotel is small, but refreshing in the morning or evening is still nice there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mallorca hotels with private beaches" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/594181.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Staying at this hotel on average will cost you about four hundred and twenty euros for eight days for a double room with half board.  Only with breakfast, of course, cheaper.  If you take a taxi from the airport to get to the hotel, then pay fifteen to eighteen euros.  So if you want to save money, it is better to go with a transfer through Palma, since the bus stop is nearby.  Then your trip will noticeably cheaper and will cost from three to five euros per person.  The difference in price appears depending on whether you buy a special card that entitles you to discounts.  A set lunch in a cafe in the Arenal area costs eight to ten euros.  This includes both wines and desserts.  Alcohol is inexpensive, very decent local wines can be bought for three to four euros / bottle. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  In general, tourists highly value the hotel Mediodia Hotel 3, calling it very decent.  It is located in the center of the city‚Äôs Arenal entertainment, but it is not noisy.  For this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMallorca, the combination of such bonuses is almost unreal!  Nearby is a <span>bus stop,</span> from which you can reach Palma in half an hour.  Close to beaches, shops and bars.  The staff is friendly and friendly.  You will be listened carefully, any damage will be corrected.  This is a great place for those who prefer outdoor activities.  If you rent a car, you will not regret it - go around the island, save time and money.  Moreover, there is a rental point near the hotel, where, according to reviews, prices are lower than the average for the island.  Mallorca, whose map is full of various sights and natural beauties, is waiting for you!  And budget hotels with good European service, such as Mediodia, will help to save the funds necessary for travel. </p>
