These were international joys and world tragedies.  And each of the events has its own key significance, because no one knows how the world would turn if something specific had not happened at all.  World history knows a lot of wars, feuds and the ensuing peace talks and alliances.  For example, the world of Toru≈Ñ 1466, Westphalian - 1648, Andrianopolis - 1713, Paris - 1814, San Stefansky - 1878, Portsmouth - 1905, Paris - 1947 and many others.  The Utrecht Peace is a peace treaty that put an end to the war that took place over the Spanish inheritance.  The agreements were signed in the Netherlands Utrecht in April-June in 1713.  The parties involved in the signing were France and Spain on the one hand, and the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, the Roman Empire, Portugal and Savoy on the other.  March 1714 went down in history with the addition of the Utrecht Peace of Rastatt, and September 1714 - with the Baden Treaty. </p><h2>  Spanish Inheritance </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="utrecht world" class="if uuid-2293703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64742/2293703.jpg"></div><p>  For almost thirteen years, from 1701 to 1714, one of the largest European conflicts took place - the war for the Spanish inheritance.  It began in 1701, after Charles II, the last Spanish king who belonged to the Habsburg dynasty, passed away.  According to the will of the king, power was vested in Philip, the <span>Duke of Anjou,</span> who was the grandson of the French king Louis XIV.  Philip eventually became known as Philip V of Spain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Start of war </h2><div class="photo" data-original="artuk.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãof utrecht" class="if uuid-2293706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64742/2293706.jpg"></div><p>  It all starts with the attempts of Leopold I, who was the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, to defend the right of the Habsburg dynasty (his own dynasty) to the possessions of Spain.  Louis XIV, in turn, began to pursue an aggressive policy to expand its territories.  England and the Dutch Republic supported the side of Leopold I and wanted to prevent the strengthening of French positions.  It is noteworthy that hostilities spread not only in Europe, but also raided into North America, where they received the name "Queen Anne War."  The Utrecht world helped bring the world back to its former relative equilibrium. </p><h2>  Chronology </h2><div class="photo" data-original="teresas.ac.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="world history" class="if uuid-2293709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64742/2293709.jpg"></div><p>  The Utrecht Peace of 1713 is a complex of several peace agreements that, together with the peace in Rastatt in 1714, ended the war for the legacy of Spain.  The dates of the signing of agreements in history are as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  April 11, 1713 - France and England, the Dutch Republic, Prussia, Savoy, Portugal. </li><li>  July 13, 1713 - Spain and England, Spain and Savoy. </li><li>  June 26, 1714 - Spain and the Netherlands. </li><li>  February 6, 1715 - Spain and Portugal. </li></ul><h2>  The first stages of negotiations </h2><div class="photo" data-original="carolyntorbettjohnson.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old war" class="if uuid-2293716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64742/2293716.jpg"></div><p>  The significance of the Utrecht world was great, as it finally resolved the conflict, which lasted more than a decade.  In 1711, in England, the ministries began to possess power - Tory supporters who wanted peace.  They began the first secret negotiations regarding the end of hostilities.  France experienced a breakdown due to military defeats and also wanted peace.  One of the reasons why England began to strive for peace was because disagreements began to arise with the members of the alliance (that is, Austria and Holland) regarding the growth of spending on the war.  The British began to truly fear that the Spanish and Austrian possessions would unite.  The British allies initially protested against the negotiation process with France, but eventually agreed. </p><h2>  Negotiation process </h2><div class="photo" data-original="4vector.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old map" class="if uuid-2293717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64742/2293717.jpg"></div><p>  The formation of the Utrecht world began on January 29, 1712.  The confrontation began - three delegates from France and seventy diplomats from the other side, hostile.  Several people from England were intermediaries whose purpose was to undermine unity in the opposing side of France, which played an important role in the Utrecht world and its international significance.  There were no French opponents who would not require its border fortifications and territories. </p><h2>  Secret events </h2><p>  In parallel with the main negotiation process, in fact, there was also a secret one - between France and England.  And in July 1712 they entered into a truce, which confused maps of all of Europe.  The achievement of the Utrecht world for all at that moment became illusory.  The Union of France and England helped the first country put forward its proposals in negotiations with other parties to the conflict.  Agreements were signed Spain - England and Spain - Savoy.  In the end, what is the Utrecht world?  What were the conditions of his detention?  He became the most profitable for England, which was able to take advantage of the situation and create a position for itself to strengthen its influence in the trading markets of that time - it got the Strait of Gibraltar.  France, in turn, removed the fortifications in Dunkirk.  Holland received some trade benefits, as well as the right to locate several garrisons on the French border.  Another meaning of the Utrecht peace was the accession of the Bourbon dynasty in Spain and their preservation of the American and Philippine colonies.  The Austrian achievements were as follows - the country began to own the Neapolitan state, Sardinia, part of Tuscany, the Duchy of Milan and the Spanish part of the Netherlands.  In addition, Mantua moved to Austria.  Savoy, on the other hand, began to possess the Kingdom of Sicily, the Margrave of Monferrati, and the western part of the Duchy of Milan.  Here is the picture ended the struggle for the succession of Spain.  The Utrecht world, together with the world in Rastatt, established the following picture of the world of that time - the huge Spanish monarchy was divided, and on this basis the foundation was laid for the further development of the borders of the states of Western Europe of the 18th century. </p>
