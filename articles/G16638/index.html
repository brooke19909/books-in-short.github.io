What interesting things can be seen at the festival "Circle of Light" in Moscow?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the brightest events in the life of the Russian capital is recognized as the Circle of Light festival.  The audience‚Äôs reviews clearly reflect the atmosphere of the holiday, which is often called the festival of light. </p><h2>  The first festivals of light </h2><p>  For the first time such a holiday was held in the XIX century in Lyon.  A kind of festival was purely religious in nature.  It was a celebration dedicated to the worship of the Virgin Mary, who saved the city from the plague.  The inhabitants of Lyon, in gratitude to her, put candles in the windows, which filled the city with magical light.  Nowadays, this holiday has become secular and attracts millions of tourists. </p><p>  With the development of technology, light festivals have become larger.  These are whole performances on the streets of cities.  Modern holidays are multimedia and laser shows, video mapping.  They are held annually in Berlin, Prague, Lyon, Jerusalem and other cities of the world.  Over the past four years, a similar festival could be seen in Moscow. </p>
