    <p>  This hotel can be seen right away: the complex, made in a unique and unique style, harmoniously fits into the overall landscape design.  It was built only two years ago, in 2012, but thousands of tourists have already managed to evaluate the quality of service in this place and even return here again. </p><h2>  Apartments </h2><p>  Hotel Royal Alhambra Palace 5 * is a six-story building, made in the original style.  The complex offers a variety of accommodation options: a total of 414 standard rooms, of which six are with special conditions, for guests with disabilities.  There are also 83 family apartments, which are divided into two types.  Of these, 48 are two-level.  On the first - a bathroom with a shower and a bedroom, on the second - the same, only the shower is replaced by a bath.  There are also 35 two-room apartments - two bedrooms and one beautifully equipped bathroom.  The hotel also offers 60 one-room rooms with one spacious bedroom.  If the listed options do not suit you - no problem.  There are 20 two bedroom apartments with sea views, a luxurious living room, two bathrooms and a bedroom with a jacuzzi.  And the last accommodation option is a two-level room, equipped with everything necessary.  This is a living room, bedroom, bathroom on the first level and the same thing on the second, only with a jacuzzi. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Accommodation cost </h2><p>  Now we should talk about how much it will cost to spend an unforgettable vacation in one of the rooms of Royal Alhambra Palace 5 *.  Prices, it should be said, are not as high as it might seem.  The hotel regularly provides discounts, and very substantial ones - up to 50 percent!  You can save half!  So, for example, a standard double room for two with all amenities for seven days will cost 55 thousand rubles - and this is for the all-inclusive service!  Junior Suite will cost 116 thousand rubles.  This room is 70 square meters.  m. It is equipped with everything necessary for life and relaxation, plus everything has a picturesque view from the window on the sea surface.  Family apartments for four will cost exactly the same.  In general, as you can see, the price is quite a compromise - and this is for all the advantages offered by the hotel. </p>
