According to researchers, the battle is characterized by complexity, tension and scope of military operations.  The battle for Moscow lasted more than six months.  The length of the front on which the battle was fought is about two thousand kilometers.  More than 2.8 million military personnel, 21 thousand mortars and guns, about 2 thousand units of tank equipment, more than 1.6 thousand units of aviation were involved in hostilities on both sides. </p><p>  In the fall of 1941, the Soviet Union was in a very difficult and dangerous <span>martial law.</span>  The strategic initiative was in the hands of the German troops, but at the same time, in the battles with the <span>Soviet Army, the</span> main plans of the Wehrmacht were disrupted.  Failed to break into the capital, Army Group Center.  According to the German command, the blockade of Leningrad, as well as the successes that were achieved in Ukraine, created favorable conditions for the offensive. </p><p>  The battle for Moscow began on September 30.  This attack on the capital of the Soviet <span>Union by the German</span> command was preparing as the final throughout the campaign.  The Germans gave the name of this operation "Typhoon."  Apparently, they did not suggest any resistance and confrontation against the crushing fascist hurricane. </p><p>  The battle for Moscow took place with the numerical advantage of German troops.  However, despite this, the Russian troops were able to adequately confront the enemy. </p><p>  The German government planned to occupy the capital of the Soviet Union before the onset of cold weather.  Support by large aviation forces allowed the Germans to break through the front, encircling six Russian armies in the region of Vyazma and Bryansk.  According to German data, 663 thousand people were captured.  Using tank formations, the German army advanced almost 250 kilometers for ten days and reached the Kalinin (Tver) - Mozhaysk - Kaluga line. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By October 30, the invaders occupied the Kalinin-Tula line.  The German command began to tighten reserves and engaged in a regrouping of forces.  At the same time, attacks from the flanks were planned in order to encircle the capital of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  A new German offensive began on November 16th.  However, on the first day she met the fierce resistance of Soviet soldiers.  Over the next three weeks, the <span>German army</span> advanced only 50-80 kilometers, without achieving decisive success. </p><p>  The Germans managed to get closest to Moscow near the village of Kryukovo, which is located 23 kilometers northwest of the city.  At the same time, from November 16 to December 5, in the battle, the German army lost 153 thousand people wounded, killed, frostbite. </p><p>  The end of November - the beginning of December was marked by several counterattacks, including along with the reserves that arrived from the east of the country.  On December 5, the battle of Moscow turned into an offensive.  Being in a numerical minority, Soviet soldiers were distinguished by a more persistent fighting spirit, a firm desire to defeat the enemy and protect the capital of their homeland. </p><p>  At the same time, the German army was in crisis conditions associated with the collapse of their hopes for an easy victory, as well as a battle in harsh, unusual climatic conditions.  Soviet troops were able to push the invaders 200 kilometers, but then they could not completely defeat them. </p><p>  The fiercest battles were in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãVyazma and Rzhev.  Battles unfolded there from February to April 1942.  The battle for the capital ended on April 20. </p><p>  The battle for Moscow, in short, dispelled the opinion of the invincibility of Hitler‚Äôs army.  This victory was the first large-scale defeat of the German army and meant the failure of all its plans for an ‚Äúeasy, lightning-fast war‚Äù, as well as the disruption of the foreign policy program of the German government. </p>
