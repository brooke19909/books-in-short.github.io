This is the trend of the latest, newest ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù models.  Therefore, it seems that the times when suspicions about unfinished devices that constantly failed were appropriate, have long been over. </p><p>  We will try to prove this in today's review, which is dedicated to the <span>Elephone P8000</span> 4G LTE <span>smartphone</span> .  In it, we describe the technical characteristics of the device, give its advantages and disadvantages, and also find out what customers report about it in their reviews. </p>

    <h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  You probably have not heard of a brand like Elephone.  This is not surprising, since the company has been present in our market not so long ago.  Moreover, the time of its arrival coincided with the period when dozens of Chinese manufacturers began selling their smartphones.  To see one brand against their background, which in our eyes is no different from others, is not so simple. </p><p>  The smartphone developer Elephone P8000 4G is not only in the CIS market - this company also covers European and American audiences.  This may already be an excellent indicator of the fairly high quality of their product.  And we hope you will see for yourself after our review. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A little about the smartphone itself - it is presented as a ‚Äúflagship‚Äù - the best device in the lineup.  You can understand this both at the price (about $ 210), which is a high bar for the phones of this manufacturer, and the technical characteristics that the Elephone P8000 4G LTE has.  The reviews confirm that according to the "behavior" of the model can be safely attributed to the category of "flagships". </p>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  So, we will begin the characteristic with the description of the kit in which the telephone is offered.  First of all, it is worth noting that it is sold in a box of cardboard, decorated with a signature pattern.  Opening it, we see a not too rich set, as for the Chinese manufacturer.  So, in addition to the Elephone P8000 4G LTE device itself, it comes with a charger (separated, in the form of an adapter and a cord for connecting to a PC), as well as instructions. </p><p>  Some buyers note that they also came across screen protectors, but their presence, apparently, depends on the seller or store where the phone is purchased. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The second aspect that I would like to draw attention to in our review is the design of the device.  After all, it is believed that Chinese phones have a boring, and sometimes even simply copied from other devices design, which, as a rule, is nothing special.  We admit that in the case of the Elephone P8000 4G LTE (reviews of which we are interested), everything is somewhat different.  In fact, the phone turned out to be very cute, and not the least role in this is played by well-selected body materials and a good color scheme.  Regarding the first ones, it is worth noting that we are talking about a metal stroke and plastic inserts with a pleasant relief;  as for color design, it can be seen in the photographs given in the article. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Some reviews on the Elephone P8000 4G LTE testify that the phone turned out to be too bulky.  Honestly, there is some truth in this - the device reaches almost a centimeter in thickness and weighs about 200 grams.  Perhaps the manufacturer wanted to take a position between the smartphone and tablet, working on the model‚Äôs body.  The many metal elements that make the phone even more massive just emphasize this. </p>

    <p>  The smartphone comes on the market in three colors - white, silver and golden. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The large weight of the device is not least due to the large battery, which occupies a significant fraction of the space inside the smartphone.  And this is not surprising, because its capacity is 4165 mAh.  Apparently, the manufacturer wanted to bet on a high level of model autonomy, to increase the duration of its work.  Judging by what customer reviews describe regarding the Elephone P8000 4G LTE, they succeeded - the phone really works longer than similar models. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  It should be noted immediately that a 5.5-inch display is installed on the Elephone P8000 4G LTE (mobile phone).  We agree that a screen of this size is more inherent in phablets (something between a phone and a tablet computer), but, nevertheless, manufacturers opted for precisely such dimensions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The quality of the display, whose resolution is 1920 by 1080 pixels, is quite high.  The image on it is at least very clear and saturated with colors - the density of dots is 401 pixels per inch. </p>

    <p>  The brightness of the display allows you to comfortably work with the device both in complete darkness and in the sun.  Also, the screen coating has a special anti-reflective coating that adds comfort during work during the day.  The developers took care of two adjustment modes - manually and automatically. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The device operates on a <span>MediaTek MT6753 processor,</span> which is typical of low-cost models <span>,</span> and whose core is 8 cores.  Each clock frequency reaches 1.3 GHz. </p><p>  These are ‚Äúdry‚Äù indicators, which in practice are expressed in the fact that a smartphone is able to perform most of the basic, most simple tasks, while we can‚Äôt talk about working with games containing more complex graphics. </p><p>  As for the RAM Elephone P8000 4G LTE, the characteristics of which we give, it has a capacity of 3 GB.  Physical memory is limited to 16 GB, of which 11 are available to the user. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The phone is equipped with two cameras with a resolution of 13 and 5 megapixels.  Despite such high indicators, the quality of pictures and videos leaves much to be desired - detail, color balance, and also illumination suffer.  And not the most powerful autofocus is installed on the Elephone P8000 4G LTE.  W3bsit3-dns.com (a forum where Android devices are discussed) contains the opinions of many users confirming this.  A smartphone at the software level is not able to distinguish between faces, adjust photo saturation and perform other stabilization actions.  As a result, talking about upscale photos would be naive. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The description devoted to the Elephone P8000 4G LTE indicates that the model supports two SIM cards.  It is noteworthy that both are capable of functioning in 2G / 3G / LTE networks, thereby ensuring the reception of a high-speed Internet signal on the device. </p><p>  In addition, there are modules for receiving a signal - Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, as well as GPS and GLONASS systems for navigation on the ground. </p><p>  Unfortunately, NFC for <span>wireless charging</span> and payments by a smartphone instead of a credit card is not here. </p>

    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  As a software basis, Android Lollipop 5.1 is preinstalled on the smartphone.  The developers did not begin to change anything in it, to create their own interface or some original shell.  As the drawbacks of this system in its ‚Äúpure‚Äù form, users call the lack of a display of the charge level in percent, as well as the mandatory distribution of programs installed on the phone into folders. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  As you know, best of all, what is this or that model of smartphone, the recommendations left by customers will tell.  They note that the original Elephone P8000 4G LTE has wide functionality, excellent technical specifications, a powerful battery and an attractive design.  In fact, all this corresponds to what we managed to find out in the process of writing the review. </p><p>  However, reviews also contain information about the disadvantages of the device.  These include, for example, strong heating of the processor during operation.  This indicates an insufficient degree of optimization of the filling of the device, an uneconomical consumption of energy.  The second common problem with the device is a weak camera.  As we noted, in the pictures taken with the Elephone P8000 4G LTE (review, reviews confirm this), the colors are poorly displayed.  Because of this, the photos do not seem so bright and colorful as they should be. </p><p>  There are also some minor comments on the operation of the device - sometimes it loses the Network for no apparent reason, there are ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù in the process of working with games and other similar problems.  Some users say that it‚Äôs not very comfortable to work with the phone because of the too bright ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button that shines in the eyes. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  We have given, in our opinion, a rather detailed review of the Elephone P8000 mobile phone, on the basis of which you can form some own opinion on the device. </p><p>  Of course, the model deserves attention because of the high degree of autonomy and good equipment, as well as due to the responsible approach of the manufacturer to the assembly and quality of materials. </p><p>  Also, the developers clearly saved on the camera - it is better not to take this device to take pictures.  In addition, there are some minor problems in the process of interacting with the phone (such as glitches of a module, loss of communication, and so on). </p><p>  If you agree to put up with the latter in order to use a budget but functional smartphone, then the P8000 is what you need. </p>
