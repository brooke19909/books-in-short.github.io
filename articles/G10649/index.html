    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Until the 17th century, the lands of the present province of Ontario were inhabited by Native American tribes.  These were the Iroquois, Ottawa, Hurons, Algonquins and some other groups.  In 1611, the first British visited the territory.  A little later, a few years later, the first French settlers landed in the area near <span>Lake Huron</span> .  For some time, the struggle for land ownership between the inhabitants of two European states lasted.  After 1763, the British retained the right to rule. </p><p>  A clear division into provinces occurred in the second half of the 19th century.  Toronto becomes the capital of Ontario, industry is gradually developing in the region, the first power plants appear.  And in the 20th century, the automotive industry became the main profitable industry: it was then that companies such as Ford Motor and General Motors appeared. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="toronto ontario" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2092156.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The elevation differences in the area are mostly small.  The relief is mainly dominated by plains and lowlands.  As for the mountains, the highest point is Ishfatina peak.  It is located at an altitude of 693 meters above sea level. </p><p>  The types of natural areas that can be seen in Ontario are the tundra, taiga and mixed forests.  The climate of the north and south varies significantly.  The southern part has a high rainfall, but the seasons are relatively warm.  In the northern zones, the climate is characterized by short cool summers and long winters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ontario Economy </h2><p>  The province has a very developed industrial production.  Ontario is even ahead of Quebec in this indicator.  In addition to the aforementioned automotive industry, various types of equipment and plastics are produced in the region, a significant share goes for export to the United States.  The mining industry is also developed: the subsoil is rich in salt, silver, granite and marble. </p><p>  In Ontario, six nuclear power plants have been built to this day.  One of the world's largest energy companies, Ontario Power Generation, operates here.  It is also worth noting that in the province there are no problems with aviation and transport links.  In addition to roads and railways, there are also waterways that run along rivers and canals. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The main and most popular tourist attraction in Ontario is Niagara Falls.  It is located near the border with America, on <span>the Niagara River.</span>  In fact, a tourist site is a whole complex of waterfalls, which include the following: ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù, ‚ÄúFata‚Äù and ‚ÄúHorseshoe‚Äù.  For the most part, the territory of Canada belongs to the latter.  On both sides of the border of the two states are the cities of Niagara Falls.  These are two different settlements, despite the same name.  In Canadian territory, a famous golf club is located near the waterfall. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ontario province attractions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2092150.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Those wishing to explore the vegetation and fauna of Ontario (Canada) should definitely visit one of the local National Parks.  These include the Royal Botanic Gardens in the south of the province.  The object is divided into five separate zones.  In the arboretum and rose garden visitors will see rare plant species.  In a separate area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe garden, lilac bushes of various varieties are planted. </p><p>  Rare and endangered deer pitchforks live in northern Canada, in Pukaskua National Park.  Arriving in this area, you should stop in the town of Marathon - the nearest settlement that is located on the shores of Lake Superior.  Rare plants such as black spruce are also found in the park. </p><h2>  Toronto </h2><p>  The largest, most developed, and most modern city in Ontario is Toronto.  It is the business center of the whole country.  A transport system is well developed here, and the construction of high-rise buildings is currently underway.  The population of the city in 2016 amounted to 2.7 million people, if you do not take into account the inhabitants of nearby settlements.  It is in this area that the business and finances of the entire state are concentrated.  With the advent of a large number of jobs and an increase in the standard of living of the <span>population, Toronto has</span> become the largest city in the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ontario canada" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2092153.jpg"></div>

    <p>  From the 50s of the last century, the construction of the subway began, which today includes 4 lines and 69 stations.  In Toronto, there is also the main <span>airport of Canada.</span> </p><p>  City attractions such as the CN Tower (553-meter TV tower, considered to be the highest on the planet until 2007), the Masonic Temple CTV, the Signs restaurant, which is unusual in that only deaf waiters work in it, have gained worldwide fame. </p><h2>  Ottawa </h2><p>  The capital of Canada is also in Ontario.  This is the city of Ottawa, inferior to Toronto in terms of population and area.  It lies on the banks of the river of the same name, very close to the neighboring province of Quebec and its village of Gatineau.  The city is located in a zone of mixed forests, has several cultural heritage sites on its territory.  For example, the gateway station Black Rapids.  There are also architectural monuments of the 19th century, interesting sculptural compositions, museums and concert halls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ontario capital" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2092997.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Depending on the purpose of the visit, tourists visit a particular area of ‚Äã‚ÄãOttawa.  In Downtown, there are mainly government buildings and office centers, in Lowertown - shops and expensive restaurants.  Historical buffs are advised to visit Sandy Hill, East or South Ottawa. </p><h2>  Lakes </h2><p>  Ontario's attractions also include local lakes.  There are quite a lot of them, there are about five hundred thousand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ontario economy" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2092152.jpg"></div>  It is worth starting the description with the reservoir of the same name.  Lake Ontario (Canada) is included in the Great Lakes system, most of which are located in the United States.  The mentioned reservoir is the smallest in area, and its depth is 244 meters.  This is quite a lot, so Ontario is rarely covered with ice even in cold winters.  Trout, pike, carp and some other fish species live in its waters.  Beautiful and picturesque lakes of the region are also called Nipissing, Simko, Rice, Nipigon.  Almost everyone has developed fishing.  The names of the reservoirs have been preserved since the days when the Indians lived on the territory.

    <h2>  Museums </h2><p>  Ontario's most popular museum is the Royal Museum (ROM).  Its expositions are devoted to history and culture, not only from Canada, but also from other states.  In the museum you can see objects found in Africa, the Middle East and Europe.  Among the exhibits are skeletons of dinosaurs, Egyptian sarcophagus, works of ancient and modern art.  The building is located in Toronto, next to Queen's Park. </p><p>  There, in Toronto, is the Art Gallery, where visitors get acquainted with the paintings and sculptures of Canadian authors.  Visitors who want to learn more about the history of the country must visit the Museum of the Canadian War (in Ottawa).  The building houses a large collection of military artifacts, some of which can even be picked up. </p><p>  If you plan your trip to Ottawa in advance, you can get to the air show, which is annually held by the Canadian <span>Museum of Aviation</span> and Space.  And in the museum building, visitors will see some military aircraft.  The local museum of nature is also unique: in the early 2000s, its building was reconstructed and now has a glass dome on several sides with several floors. </p>
