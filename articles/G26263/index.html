    <p>  Lost your SIM card?  Then restore her! </p><p>  In today's world, great importance is attached to mobile communications.  The phone becomes our indispensable assistant and friend.  That is why many mobile operators are trying to provide their customers with maximum services.  The constant competition between different providers makes the leadership of mobile companies in a constant search for ways to attract new customers. </p><p>  Now there are several large companies that provide mobile services.  One of them is MTS.  This is an international company that provides its services in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus.  For example, in Ukraine this company combined (included in its structure) several smaller companies and divisions.  Now all of them are the property of one company and have one name - MTS. </p><p>  Sometimes people have problems with a SIM card.  Each SIM is password protected.  After the user incorrectly entered the PIN code three times upon switching on, the card is automatically blocked.  The system asks you to enter an additional code to unlock the card.  This is the puk code.  If this code is entered incorrectly, the SIM card is blocked by the system.  After it is locked, the question arises before the person: ‚ÄúHow to unlock a SIM card <br>  MTS? ‚Äù </p><p>  This is pretty simple.  You need to call the operator from another number.  Dial * 101 # and press the call key.  After that, select the seventh item.  It indicates how to unlock the MTS SIM card.  You wait until you are provided with information that in order to connect with the operator, you must press "0". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Contacting a specialist, you need to outline the current situation.  At the same time, you need to ask about how to unlock the MTS SIM card? </p><p>  But before contacting the operator, you must prepare the information that it will require.  You will need to answer a few questions: </p><p>  - First.  The specialist will ask you to name three <span>phone numbers of</span> subscribers whom you often call. </p><p>  - The second one.  It is necessary to indicate when the mobile account was last replenished and for what amount.  Only after that the operator will dictate the new code to you.  You enter it and your SIM card will again be available for communication.  That's why you do not need to puzzle over how to unlock a MTS SIM card. </p><p>  But there are such unpleasant moments as loss, theft of the phone or just a SIM card has become unusable.  And you need this number.  You have the opportunity to restore the MTS SIM card.  But for this you need to contact the operator.  Compared to unlocking, a little more action is required.  First, you need to block the lost SIM card.  When you contact the operator, do it right away.  And only then place an order to restore the MTS SIM card.  But that is not all. </p><p>  How to restore the MTS SIM card, the operator will tell you.  The main thing is to prepare for this procedure.  You will need to indicate the three numbers that you most often called.  Date and amount of the last deposit.  How much money you have left in your account at the time of loss.  When did you make the last call from this card.  Your surname, name, patronymic.  After that, the operator draws up an application for the restoration of the MTS SIM card.  In this case, you will retain your previous mobile phone number. </p><p>  Now you need to write down the information that the operator will provide: the capacity of the SIM card, the number of the application for recovery.  With this data you go to <br>  nearest MTS office.  By presenting a passport and indicating the data that the operator dictated to you, you get a new SIM card with the same number.
