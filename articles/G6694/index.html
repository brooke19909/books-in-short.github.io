Here the flavor of the ‚ÄúArab country‚Äù is not felt, as it is, for example, in Hurghada.  The resort arose in a desert place, just on the shore, where initially there was not even a village.  Therefore, there are simply no local residents here, they are taken for by the hotel staff. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Melia Sinai 5" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1089083.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays in Sharm El Sheikh </h2><p>  It differs from that which can be obtained in Hurghada in several positions at once.  Firstly, excellent service, and secondly, the magnificent sea with coral reefs and, finally, the cost, which is higher here.  But you have to pay for all the good, right? </p><p>  This resort area, located in the south of the Sinai, stretches along the coast of the Red Sea for as much as thirty-five kilometers.  The coast is completely indented with bays.  Each of them has its own characteristics that you need to consider when choosing a hotel for relaxation.  Due to the surrounding mountains, bays such as Sharm El Maya or Naama Bay are windless, but the Nabq region, on the contrary, is known for strong gusts and high waves.  This should not be forgotten during the ‚Äúwind season‚Äù - in winter. </p><p>  The resort itself is two districts: Sharm El Maya, or Old Sharm, and Naama Bay.  They are located six kilometers from each other.  Between them there are fixed-route taxis, the fare is one <span>Egyptian pound.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most popular places with many tourists in Old Sharm are the seaport and market.  It is very large: there are numerous inexpensive souvenir shops, convenience stores, eateries and huge ramparts with fruit. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  In most of the resort there is a conservation area.  Therefore, hotel administrations are prohibited from cleaning the bottom of the sea from corals.  Almost every beach has its own reefs, which, starting at the very edge of the water, stretch in places for thirty or more meters.  That is why it is recommended to use special shoes - slippers for swimming at shallow depths.  This feature also needs to be considered when choosing a hotel in the Sharm El Sheikh area.  In general, its coast is not very convenient for families with children and, conversely, is great for lovers of snorkeling. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Melia Sinai Hotel 5 Sharm El Sheikh" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1089082.jpg" width="600"></div>
