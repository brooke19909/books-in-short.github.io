    <h2>  Hotel complex "Old Courtyard" (Nalchik): negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, no one is safe from negative moments during the vacation, but it is enough to study the reviews of tourists to be ready for them.  So, it is worth paying attention to the following facts: </p><ul><li>  the hotel constantly hosts banquets and corporate events that create a lot of fuss and noise; </li><li>  too cramped rooms, cluttered with unnecessary furniture; </li><li>  in the bathroom due to poor ventilation there is an unpleasant odor, a lot of mold;  old creaking furniture; </li><li>  due to the lack of soundproofing, you will hear everything that happens on the street in neighboring rooms and corridors; </li><li>  low-quality cleaning, which consists only in the careless wiping of dust; </li><li>  it‚Äôs almost impossible to use wireless Internet in the room (signal is too weak); </li><li>  the restaurant‚Äôs work schedule is very strange (apparently, the restaurant opens and closes when it‚Äôs convenient for the chef); </li><li>  There are no public transport stops near the hotel, and therefore you can quickly get anywhere only by taxi; </li><li>  Near the hotel there is practically no civilization (no shops, no pharmacies, no cafes); </li><li>  in the place where the hotel is located, there is practically no mobile communication; </li><li>  inflated rates for accommodation and recreation, given the condition of the number of rooms; </li><li>  despite the fact that smoking is prohibited in the hotel, all the corridors and rooms are saturated with the smell of tobacco smoke; </li><li>  if you are late for a prepaid breakfast (even for a good reason), this service will not be provided to you; </li><li>  prehistoric televisions with poor sound and image quality; </li><li>  until late at night the hotel guests are noisy having fun, and the staff does not make any comments about this; </li><li>  half of the dishes on the menu are virtually unavailable, and food prices are too high; </li><li>  lack of air conditioning (because of this, the room is stuffy during the day). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the original concept, which implies a quiet family vacation, is not respected.  This hotel constantly hosts noisy events that can spoil the mood of those who come for the purpose of quiet eco-tourism.  Nevertheless, if you like walks in the woods, and in the evening you are not averse to having fun in the company of other guests, then you simply cannot find the best option! </p>
