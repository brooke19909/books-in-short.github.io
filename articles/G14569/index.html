There are many situations where this stock of information can come in handy, as well as ways to achieve what was intended.  The only thing that is required from the card holder is to prevent errors during the execution of a particular operation.  Incidentally, this is facilitated by the bank itself, which offers its customers both electronic and real instructions, forms and so on.  So, if everything is in order with the technical means, then the reason for the unsuccessful translation should be sought only in oneself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer money to a sberbank card" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/84755.jpg" width="300"></div><br><br>  So, how <span>to transfer money to a Sberbank card?</span>  Let's start with the simplest (and most likely popular) method - the use of payment terminals and ATMs (or ATM).  That the first, that the second are available everywhere.  For the translation you need a little attention, the amount that you want to transfer plus strict observance of the instructions for using the mentioned units.  Obviously, Sberbank, whose card is available to many Russian citizens, understands the importance of the issue.  Therefore, it tries to saturate the settlements as much as possible with its payment terminals and ATM. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank card" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/84754.jpg" width="283"></div><br>  For those who still do not know very well <span>how to transfer money to a Sberbank card,</span> it should be clarified that in order to complete this action you need to know the exact number of the ‚Äúplastic‚Äù, where, in fact, it is planned to send the funds.  In addition, there are a number of rules that you simply cannot know: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ any transfers are made in a single currency - if you send rubles, then the addressee will receive only rubles; <br>  ‚Ä¢ sending foreign currency is possible.  But only on condition that the ‚Äúplastic‚Äù holder sends money to his second (third, fourth or whatever account) card; <br>  ‚Ä¢ non-cash transfers from a ‚Äúcredit card‚Äù of the said bank are not allowed; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Each sender must take into account that it will be deducted from him the commission for the operation. <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank card number" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/84753.jpg" width="600"></div>  Anyone with all sorts of online services to ‚Äúyou‚Äù will not run to the terminal or to the nearest branch.  Why?  Because he knows how to transfer money to a Sberbank card without all this fuss.  In particular, it should be noted such a wonderful tool as online banking.  True, you must first connect to it.  But this usually does not cause any particular problems. <br><br>  By connecting to the Mobile Bank service, you can not only transfer funds between two card accounts.  Truly wide horizons open before its users.  For example, knowing the number of a Sberbank card, you can withdraw electronic money to it from well-known systems - WebMoney and Yandex.Money. <br><br>  The longest and most nervous way is a personal visit to the department.  Nervous not because the equipment in the bank is old, or the <span>air conditioning</span> system does not work <span>.</span>  But because you have to spend some time surrounded by people.  And it can be guaranteed that half of them will clearly be not positive. <br><br>  As you can see, the owner of the ‚Äúplastic‚Äù of the most famous bank of Russia has many ways in order to achieve its goal.  The choice of a particular replenishment method should be carried out in accordance with current circumstances.
