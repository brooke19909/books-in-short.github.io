    <p>  The construction of the Memorial stands on 50 supporting columns, which creates the illusion of lightness and airiness.  Outside the complex is faced with snow-white marble, the walls are covered with smalt and marble mosaics.  Such a solemn architectural ensemble fascinates and causes a feeling of delight.  In the courtyard of the Memorial you will see the Pribylovskaya cottage - this is a two-story brick building, inside which there is a unique exhibition of gifts from foreign tourists. </p><p>  Near the complex is the third wooden building, once owned by Zharkova.  It was restored more than once, and now a museum is opened here, where objects of the family of the Soviet leader are collected.

True, it is not so famous as the Goncharovsky or Leninist places, but it is, of course, the main <span>aviation</span> industry <span>museum</span> in Ulyanovsk, which has preserved a number of unique historical exhibits of flying vehicles that arrived here on their own.  This is a real repository of the past with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 17 hectares. </p><p>  Other museums in Ulyanovsk cannot boast of a variety of aircraft.  Some of the exhibits are singular and are truly valuable.  So, for example, among a huge amount of airborne equipment, one can single out the MI-1 helicopter, made in 1948. Special attention should be paid to TU-116, TU-134, TB-1 (the first twin-engine bomber), U-2 (operation began in 1929 .) and many other legendary and authentic collections of great value. </p>

    <p>  The mass of reserved places is famous for the city of Ulyanovsk.  The sights of the city are fascinating at first sight.  One of such places is the pine-broad-leaved forest on the Kuibyshev reservoir.  Attracts tourists with the indescribable beauty of wildlife.  An artificially created corner of nature is distinguished by silence, purity and an exciting vacation.  In winter, you can ski and sled, and in summer swim in the Volga River and bask in the gentle sun. </p><p>  In the park there are plants that are listed in the Red Book: comb keleria, Robert geranium, middle grushanka and mesaceous goatskin.  In addition, about 380 species of insects and 58 species of birds live on the territory: urobophobia, <span>small flycatcher,</span> scallop-throat, corolla, spotted woodpecker, white-tailed eagle.  There are also many birds of prey: a goshawk, a black kite, a chiglok, a quail. </p><h2>  Natural Monument - Petrified Tree </h2><p>  It was officially approved as a natural monument in 1961.  The petrified plant is located in the Ulyanovsk region and is very popular among city guests.  The uniqueness of the ‚Äúwood monument‚Äù is that the petrified trunk has a length of 4.83 m and consists of 14 pieces.  The smallest piece with a diameter of 35 cm. Ancient cypress is very similar to ordinary wood.  A sign was placed next to the cypress on which the significance of the natural object is indicated.  In the future, the authorities plan to turn it into a museum, but you need to hurry with this, since winds and rains can quickly carry its remains to different corners and completely destroy it. </p>

    <p>  The museum is directly in the open air, this place is magnified.  On 174 hectares of land a whole ensemble of architectural structures and monuments was built.  All this splendor is located in the Leninsky <span>district of Ulyanovsk.</span>  The main purpose of his creation is to recreate and preserve the appearance of Simbirsk.  And this, I must say, worked out.  Guests and residents can watch the atmosphere of the XIX century, immerse themselves in the provincial history of the ancient city and take a walk among the old houses. </p>

    <h2>  Yulovsky Pond </h2><p>  The best sights of Ulyanovsk are formed on the basis of numerous customer reviews.  A lot of positive exclamations were received by Yulovsky Pond, which was created a hundred years ago and is now a real decoration of the region.  During its existence, the conservation area has been enriched with vegetation and wildlife.  This place is particularly attractive with <span>white water lilies</span> floating on the mirror surface of water. </p><p>  A cattail and reeds surround the shore of the pond: vegetation prevents pollution and is a natural biological filter.  In these thickets nests and <span>waterfowl</span> hatch their chicks <span>.</span>  Flora is rich in various shrubs and trees.  In the vicinity of the reserve there are insects (bumblebees, dragonflies, ants, butterflies, woodcutter beetles). </p><p>  The delightful sights of Ulyanovsk (photo presented in the article) have a long history, which is an undoubted advantage.  In these places you involuntarily feel the atmosphere of past centuries and the Russian spirit. </p>
