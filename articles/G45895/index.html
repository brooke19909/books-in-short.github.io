How to play the "goat"?  This game is quite complicated and reckless.  And besides, it has a very ancient history.  Dominoes are believed to have come from <span>dice.</span>  The first records with dots appeared in India and China.  True, the Chinese domino differs from the Western ones in that there are no dummies in the game, there are dots in white and red, and there are many differences in the rules.  Over time, this game came from China to Italy, and there they learned how to play the goat.  Out of 32 records, 28 remained, the dots became white, a black-and-white robe of knuckles appeared, which resembles the clothes of Dominican monks.  Once upon a time, monks were forbidden to play cards, and then Chinese dominoes were changed.  This game was allowed in monasteries.  With a word of praise of the Lord, every game began.

    <p>  Usually how to play the "goat"?  They play <span>two for two.</span>  Like a team on a team, wall to wall.  To play, you need a good partner, as the game teaches you how to act in a team.  Both you and the partner should be able at any moment to take responsibility and lead.  And such a skill should be present regardless of the alignment that you have.  The partner must play the goat in such a way as to be able to “keep the defense” when you conduct deft operations on the <span>game table</span> and attack.  If one team finishes the distribution, which means that there are no more bones left on the hands, then the losing team counts the points remaining on their hands on the domino records.  It is with this game that a sense of team is brought up.  Here, everyone is not for himself, but is also responsible for a comrade.  This is what dominoes are.  Here you can’t do the games yourself, you need to clearly feel your friend. </p><h2>  Rules of the game </h2>

    <p>  How to play the "goat", we will try to tell.  When the game starts, they draw vertical lines on a piece of paper, dividing them into columns.  Each column is one team.  In vertical order, after each game points are recorded, the number of points on the records of both partners of the losing team.  The first ones to gain 101 points are considered losers - "goats."  There is such a situation in the game as "fish".  When on different sides of the game snake are numbers that are not on hand.  Then they say: "Fish!"  - the goat has not yet been found, as it were.  The goat will be called those who will have 101 points.  After preparing the recording paper, kneading of the plates is carried out.  To do this, slowly begin to mix dominoes.  If you are in a hurry, then under the influence of the center forces the plates can fly apart.  After distribution, each of 7 pieces is watched so that there are no 5 “takes” and 6 identical numbers on hand.  “Double” is a domino with the same number of points on both sides of the plate.  Usually a one-on-one domino game begins.  But you can go in from any knuckle, this is called go in from a hunchback.  Then the rivals will not understand what you are up to.  Players sit down through one with their team members and take turns.  One can be set to unity, the same to any other digit.  Look carefully at what numbers the partner puts up and which ones are the rivals.  All the numbers set by the opponents must be scored, and the numbers set by the partner must be supported.  The point is to help your own and spoil the game to strangers.  Try to remember all combinations of records, and during the game you will remember what is left in your hands.  And then, as the game progresses towards the end, you will know more or less what remains in the hands of the rivals.  And accordingly, you will not substitute the opponent with the required number of points, thereby taking away his move.  In the variety "Goat" (dominoes), the rules encourage you to play hard. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Game varieties </h2><p>  There are many varieties of this interesting game in the world.  Domino "Goat" - the most common game in Russia.  Start the game with the smallest double, one-one.  They take turns and until the moment when the pair scores 101 points.  Anyone who has reached this milestone becomes a losing goat.  An interesting kind of "goat" such as the "sea goat" is interesting.  There, the points are counted as non-losers, and the winners record the points of the opposite team for themselves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="goat domino rules" class="if" height="222" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24337/537285.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <p>  If you have two takes, you can put them on the game table simultaneously from different sides of the game snake.  When they finish the game with the empty-empty record, they consider that they “made” those who lost “bald goats”.  The situation when the game is over, and the loser only has “empty-empty” on his hands, counts as 25 points, if only “six-six”, then 50 points, and if these two knuckles only, then 75 points. </p><h2>  Moral games </h2><p>  Domino is a game that develops intelligence, the ability to count, logically think and remember.  Therefore, it is intended even for preschool children.  True, then on the plates not dots are drawn, but different patterns.  At the same time, as in the adult version, there are doubles - with the same patterns, and dominoes with different patterns on each side.  Children try to fit the same sides together and thus develop logic, learn to distinguish between drawings and look for unifying moments.  Kids begin to distinguish between the forms of objects, get acquainted with the flora and fauna.  And most importantly, domino will teach children the team spirit, the ability to behave properly in a team.  You can start playing dominoes from the age of 1.  The kid, not yet understanding the rules, will learn to consider pictures, build a house out of dominoes and much more.  So play yourself in dominoes and teach your children.  The benefits of this game are huge. </p>
