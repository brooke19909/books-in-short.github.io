And for those who do not ski and do not feel the need for it, there is a water park.  In this article we will give a brief overview of the Abzakovo hotels. </p><p>  Should I stop directly at the resort?  The reviews say that in the village, whose population is only 1330 people, there are many hotels of completely different price segments.  So every tourist can choose a hotel for their own means.  In the description of the hotels, we first of all focused on the reviews of guests.  Based on their praises and complaints, we have compiled a rating of the best hotels.  But first, a few words about the resort itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abzakovo hotels" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2204768.jpg"></div>

Naturally, the closer the mini-hotel or guest house is located to the ski lifts, the more expensive it is.  There are no hostels, as such.  Chain hotels and luxury five-star hotels too.  The entire supply of housing is kept within 3-4 *.  A feature of the resort is that almost all hotels in Abzakovo have rooms of different categories.
