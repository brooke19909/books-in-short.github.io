Usually women know how to bestow and surprise another representative of the fair sex, but with gifts for men often questions arise.  Standard sets of underpants, socks and shaving accessories are not taken into account as unoriginal gifts, and this approach even offends some men.  We propose to make a cake out of <span>beer cans</span> with your own hands - to create such a masterpiece for everyone, but how the hero of the occasion will be surprised! </p>

    <h2>  Benefits of Alcohol Presented as a Gift </h2><p>  There are several objective reasons why you can confidently say that a cake made of cans of beer will be a great addition to any men's holiday.  Be it February 23, New Year's, the birthday of a husband, brother, father, boss or other representative of a strong half of humanity, not a single feast is complete without alcoholic beverages.  Even if the giftee does not drink, he will have friends and friends whom he will be pleased to treat as a hospitable host.  Alcoholic beverages - a non-perishable product, it can not be consumed immediately on the day of donation.  For example, for some time a cake made from beer cans, assembled with your own hands and soul, will decorate the house, and then it will be a wonderful addition to watching an important sporting event or a trip to nature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Components for the cake </h2><p>  If you want to make a cake out of beer cans with your own hands, you first need to decide how many tiers it will consist of: for one you will need about 8 cans, for a two-level 12-15, and for a large three-layer you will need a whole box.  We will consider the most voluminous option.  To make a cake you will need: </p><ul><li>  24 cans of beer (box); </li><li>  thick cardboard; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  wrapping paper; </li><li>  tape; </li><li>  gum; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  glue gun; </li><li>  transparent tape; </li><li>  a tray or a round dish; </li><li>  optionally - <span>filling for the cake</span> (nuts, crackers, chips, squid, small fish in bags). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beer can cake photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17563/383948.jpg" width="374"></div></li></ul><p>  If all the ingredients are cooked, you can proceed to create a masterpiece. </p><h2>  Step-by-step manufacturing process </h2><p>  The round tray serves as the basis, on which the banks of the lower tier are installed (14 pcs.).  Between them lay bags with crackers, bottles in a circle wrapped with tape or tape.  A circle of such a diameter is cut out of cardboard so that it is easily mounted on banks and does not stick out at the edges.  Paste it with wrapping paper in tone to the purchased beer containers.  A cardboard pallet is placed on the first row, and another 7 cans are arranged in a circle on it, bags with nuts are placed in the center, and tied with a ribbon.  In the same way, the second circle is cut out of cardboard, glued with colored paper, put on the second tier.  The remaining three cans make up the top layer, in addition to which you can roll bags with dried squid and small fish, and also tie a ribbon around. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beer can cake" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/384711.jpg?1398760138045" width="320"></div><br>  <span>How to decorate a cake</span> from beer cans (the photo can be seen in the article) everyone decides for himself: someone will like wide satin ribbons, for someone it is more pleasant to immediately see the contents (pasted with adhesive tape), and others will want to hide multi-colored jars behind a thick paper frame.  The whole process of decorating is completely dependent on the imagination and skill of the person who makes the gift.

Relatives are likely to know which drink their relative or friend prefers.  For those who want to avoid being intoxicated, <span>non-alcoholic beer is</span> perfect <span>.</span>  There are those who prefer a variety of cocktails to this foamy drink - they are also sold in banks and can be used as part of such a cake.  The option with no alcohol at all is lemonade. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt like the beer can cake looks too elongated, tall, make it smaller.  There are a couple of ways to do this: </p><ol><li>  Remove one or two tiers at once.  From reducing the number of cans, the final result will not get worse: it is just as supplemented with snacks, decorated with bows or wrapping paper. </li><li>  Find 330 ml beer cans in specialized stores.  They are lower than the usual half-liter, due to this the cake looks more natural, squat. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beer can cake" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17563/383946.jpg?1398682852824" width="303"></div></li></ol><h2>  Beer Gift Supplement </h2><p>  If you made a cake of beer cans with your own hands and it seems to you that you need to complete the gift with something, we offer several options: </p><ul><li>  a bouquet of dried fish wrapped in a newspaper; </li><li>  <span>a set of beer</span> glasses or mugs; </li><li>  a beer helmet with tubes (from the jokes department) or a belt; </li><li>  a bar for alcoholic drinks. </li></ul><p>  Any of the proposed combinations will be enjoyed by beer lovers and will be a memorable gift.  In any case, before giving a man a cake of beer cans, make sure that he will be happy with such a present.  If you are firmly not sure that he drinks at all or prefers stronger drinks, do not present such a surprise. </p>
