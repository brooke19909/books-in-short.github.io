    <h2>  "Driver's license" </h2><p>  It was a real surprise for everyone when a film with such a small budget received such a resounding success.  The amount of profit was eight times the cost.  The film was included in the list of 50 most profitable films of 1988.  And <span>Corey Feldman</span> again became his partner in the film (they had previously played together in the fantasy thriller ‚ÄúLost Guys‚Äù).  The young people turned out to be an excellent tandem on the screen, and in life they became friends.  They even started to be called "Two Measles." </p><h2>  Make a little dream </h2><p>  He became the last of the films in which the popular teenage duo played the main roles.  The film was quite successful with the audience, but could not repeat the triumph of the previous two.  Although the song ‚ÄúMake a Little Dream‚Äù was first performed by Rock on Michael Damian, which afterwards did not leave the top positions of the charts for a long time.  After the career of the hero of our article began to decline.  Cory Heim began to appear much less, and films with his participation were no longer so popular. </p><h2>  Recent successes </h2><p>  In 1991, after a break due to drug problems, he starred in the film "Guardian Angels", for his work received the Saturn Award, which is considered one of the most prestigious awards in the genre of fantasy and horror. </p><p>  And in 1993, he took part in the remake of ‚ÄúJust One of the Girls,‚Äù the film was well received by the audience. </p><p>  In 2009, the last movie with his participation - ‚ÄúAdrenaline‚Äù will be released. </p><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  Corey has never been married.  In 2009, Victoria Beckham said that before the start of her career in the group Spice Girls, she met with the actor.  Their first meeting took place in one of the London music studios.  Victoria broke off because of Corey's addiction to drugs and alcohol. </p><p>  After the actor met with many beautiful girls, such as <span>Nicole Egert, the</span> star of the series ‚ÄúRescuers Malibu‚Äù, or the well-known <span>Alice Milano.</span>  But not one of his novels ended successfully. </p>

    <h2>  Drugs </h2><p>  <span>The actor</span> began to use drugs in his teens.  And in the 1990s, a series of setbacks began for the actor.  He was arrested for possession of drugs.  Much later, in 2007, Corey would say that this addiction ruined his career. </p><p>  Throughout his life, he was often treated and tried to get rid of drug addiction.  And sometimes there was a hope that he would succeed. </p><p>  But, unfortunately, <span>on March 10,</span> 2010, Corey Heim passed away.  The official cause of death was called an overdose of medications.  It is known that shortly before his death, the actor began pneumonia.  Although this is dubious information, it is likely that the darling of millions of drugs was killed. </p><p>  I would like to note that at the time of death, the actor was quite in demand, he had creative plans, he took part in several projects at the same time. </p><p>  Despite his drug addiction and setbacks, Corey Heim, whose films were very successful, always returned to the cinema. </p>
