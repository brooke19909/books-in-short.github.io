One of them is called the new, and the other the old city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the Old Town is the vast majority of architectural monuments, palaces, caves, dolmens, interesting finds of archaeologists.  This is where tourists who visit Bakhchisarai seek. </p><p>  In the New City, more modern buildings, hotels, entertainment centers, public organizations were built.

In Bakhchisarai excellent transport links, trains and buses go to any city in Crimea. </p><p>  Among the large enterprises there is a cement plant, which provides jobs for thousands of people, a wine and brandy factory, an enterprise for the production of bakery products. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Many hundreds of years ago, Neanderthals lived here.  On the territory of the old city to this day you can see ancient ceramics and the tomb of the Tauris.  In the 1st century, the Romans settled here.  The evidence is the fortresses discovered during excavations, military fortifications and jewelry. </p><p>  A small area on the outskirts, called by the locals the ‚ÄúCave City‚Äù, has preserved large structures that served as ancient houses and castles.  You can get to Crimea from Bakhchisaray to Chufut-Kale on the road in the direction of.  Staroselye past the Assumption Cave Monastery. </p><p>  Bakhchisaray received its current name in the XVI century by Khan Mengli Giray.  At the same time, the Khan Saray Palace was built - one of the most visited places in the city.  In the XVII century, the place became one of the largest shopping centers, merchants from all over the world come here.  This time is considered golden for Bakhchisarai.  At the beginning of the XVIII century, the Russian army plundered the city, seeking to weaken the influence of the Tatar people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  During the Crimean War, the wounded were brought here, weapons were stored here.  In the 30s of the last century, the city again began to actively develop.  Enterprises are opening, great attention is paid to gardening. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gohomeandaway.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Courtyard of the Bakhchisarai Palace" class="if uuid-2978480" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2978480.jpg"></div><h2>  Khan's Palace </h2><p>  This is the only object of the Crimean Tatar historical architecture that has survived to this day in the Bakhchisarai region.  It is located at a distance of half (30 km) from Simferopol to Inkerman. </p><p>  On the territory of the palace there is a historical museum, which presents the most valuable exhibits, reflecting the life and culture of that time.  The palace was built for representatives of the Geraev clan.  From the beginning of the 16th to the end of the 18th century, this clan stood at the head of the Crimean state.  For more than two and a half centuries, state issues of different directions have been resolved here. </p><p>  When the city was captured by the troops of Minich, the palace was badly damaged by fire and was restored during the reign of Selamet Gere.  In 1741, the Biyuk Khan Jami Mosque was built on the territory. </p><p>  During the reign of the Russian Empire with the advent of the new ruler, the decoration of the palace changed.  And today you can see some of the things of Catherine II, exhibited in the museum. </p><p>  The entire palace composition is made in the traditional architectural style of the 16th-17th centuries by the Ottomans.  The palace complex consists of two mosques, a mufti house, farm buildings, fountains, towers, a cemetery with a tomb.  Previously, the Khan's Palace with all the adjoining territories occupied 18 hectares, nowadays - a little more than 4 hectares. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ukrainetrek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Khan's Palace" class="if uuid-2978668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2978668.jpg"></div><h2>  Fountain of tears </h2><p>  From Simferopol to Bakhchisarai can be reached by bus, train or taxi.  To see the fountain, you need to transfer to public transport or get to the navigator by setting the address of ul.  River, d.133. </p><p>  The architect who worked on the fountain was the famous architect of his time, Iranian Omer.  The fountain was conceived as a reminder of the sorrow of the Khan of Crimea-Girey about his beloved concubine.  She was a girl from Poland, a person of noble descent, Maria Pototskaya, named in the harem Dilyar Bikech.  She was killed by an envious person. </p><p>  The marble slab reflects the emotional pain of loss, the water slowly flowing down the stone - mean men's tears.  The snail carved on the construction is Khan‚Äôs doubts about whether to live without a beloved among friends, enemies and ill-wishers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fntan of tears" class="if uuid-2978670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2978670.jpg"></div><h2>  Assumption Monastery </h2><p>  The Assumption Monastery is another attraction of Bakhchisarai that must be visited.  How to get to Bakhchisarai, we examined earlier.  To visit the monastery, you need to take bus number 2 from Bakhchisaray to Staroselye, then walk about 500 meters.  By car, it is allowed to stop on. </p><p>  The legend of its creation is very interesting.  Once a shepherd grazing sheep saw an icon of the Mother of God on a rock, and a burning candle nearby.  He took it and brought it to his master, but the next day she disappeared and was in the same place.  The story was repeated many times until the inhabitants realized that it wants to be at the place where it appeared, and built a temple there. </p><p>  Over time, its territory expanded, in the war years the hospital was located in the church building, since 1993 it was again open to parishioners from all over the world.  Near the temple there is a cemetery where church servants and soldiers have been buried since the war. </p><div class="photo" data-original="curiouscatontherun.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Assumption Monastery" class="if uuid-2978496" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2978496.jpg"></div><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  Tourists with children are strongly advised to explore in advance where Bakhchisaray is located.
