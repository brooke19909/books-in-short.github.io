  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Magic in cross stitch patterns of peonies</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Embroidery as one of the popular types of needlework combines not only beautiful subjects and the creation of practical things, but also a magical meaning.  Thanks to sewed motives, you can influence your destiny.  For example, cross-stitch patterns of peonies help to establish personal life and meet a soul mate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lush flower" class="if uuid-3118912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3118912.jpg"></div><h2>  Scheme selection </h2><p>  This is considered the initial step in the preparation process.  The choice of the scheme is an important point, because thanks to it, the needlewoman determines what she wants to see in the finished version, and how it will be framed.  Each needlewoman knows her skill level.  According to it, you can choose a scheme and motive for work. </p><p>  <span>Cross stitch patterns for peonies</span> can be either monochrome or color.  The first option consists of several shades of the same color, which helps to convey its depth.  Monochrome motifs - small, often embroidered for applied things.  Full color pictures can consist of 20-30 shades.  If the work is Haed type, where the parameters allow you to depict the plot in detail, then the number of colors will be much larger - from 40 to 60. </p><p>  When choosing a pattern for embroidering peonies with a cross, you should pay attention to the presence of additional types of stitches and backstitch.  This affects the time of manufacture of the product and the quality of the finished work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="small bud" class="if uuid-3118919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3118919.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of Stitches </h2><p>  A cross is standard for work.  It conveys the clarity of the picture and creates filling.  Convexity and bulkiness depend on the addition of threads.  Needlewomen often alternate a cross with a half-cross to achieve the desired effect of smooth transitions. </p><p>  The backstitch (or back-needle stitch) is for drawing contours.  Not a single design is complete without it.  In cross-stitch patterns of peonies, backstitch is made with threads of different colors.  In other designs, it is often black in one piece. </p><p>  French knots are used to convey bulk and spot application.  In creating flowers, thanks to them, droplets of dew or rain are drawn.  Often embroidered with light threads for extra volume.  Fractional crosses can be used with different types of stitches.  This is a high level of skill, because the cell is divided in half, and the finished stitch looks microscopic. </p><p>  Thanks to them, there is detail in the embroidery, the elements look clear.  Fractional crosses, like a backstitch of this kind, are created on a homespun cloth or linen in order to get as close to naturalness as possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hobi.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="watercolor plot" class="if uuid-3118921" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3118921.jpg"></div><h2>  Popular Stories </h2><p>  Although peonies are embroidered with one flower, needlewomen often choose plots with great content and detail.  Cross stitch patterns of peonies in a vase can be both foreign firms and domestic.  In the first version, clear detail and background scenes are preferred. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Domestic designers develop motifs with a key element.  Even if a whole bouquet is embroidered, one flower should stand out and be more noticeable.  For detailing, several folds of threads and the direction of stitches in different directions are worked out in the schemes. </p><p>  Peonies on the table or with other flowers are also often embroidered.  They symbolize receiving good news and a change for the better.  Embroiderers use popular stories to create not only paintings, but also applied elements.  When choosing a scheme, needlewomen do not look at the level of popularity, but give preference to what they liked. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vase with peonies" class="if uuid-3118933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3118933.jpg"></div><h2>  Cross Magic </h2><p>  <span>Cross stitch patterns of</span> peony <span>flowers are</span> popular through their influence on the needlewoman.  It is believed that embroidered flowers help to build relationships and improve family life, and unmarried girls will be able to find a soul mate. </p><p>  It is not necessary to embroider large and complex plots.  It is enough to sew a flower or a bud to bring changes to your life.  To do this, you need to engage in embroidery in a good mood and imagine the future.  You need to start a new process on the growing moon, preferably at night, so that nothing distracts from work. </p><p>  If you want to create a thing that will always be near, then you can pick up miniature pion patterns in cross-stitch and make a beautiful pendant with them or make a bracelet.  Magical influence is not felt immediately, it is necessary to give positive energy the opportunity to come to life through constant visualization (the embroiderer must imagine the future guy so that the crosses are filled with the energy of love). </p>
