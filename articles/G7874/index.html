At the same time, you also need to find out which plan of your operator will have the really best conditions in order to make the right choice. </p><p>  Today we’ll talk about mobile services at Beeline.  The “International” tariff, which was once the main plan for calls in roaming, is not valid now - only three packages are offered to the client, one of which is focused exclusively on the mobile Internet. </p><p>  Read more about what services can be connected to the subscribers of this operator at the moment, read the article. </p><h2>  Beeline tariffs </h2>

    <p>  As you know, the tariff plans offered by mobile operators (this is not necessarily about roaming services) change quite often.  Service providers do this in order to attract new customers, promising them favorable conditions. </p><p>  This is also the case with Beeline.  The “International” tariff, about which so many flattering reviews wrote in due time, is not offered now.  But in the line of products oriented to work in international roaming, today you can see completely new tariffs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we talk about communication services (calls, SMS), then these are two plans - “My Planet” and “Planet Zero”;  as for network access services, in this vein it is advisable to talk about the option “The most profitable Internet in roaming”.  Let's consider them in detail. </p><h2>  Country Groups </h2><p>  Before that, let me make a small remark about the list of countries in which we are discussing roaming.  The thing is that mobile services abroad are provided by your operator in agreement with other suppliers.  This determines the overpriced cost of calls, calls, Internet connections. </p>

    <p>  Earlier in the Beeline company, the International tariff operated on a slightly different tariffing principle.  Now the cost of service packages depends solely on the country to which the subscriber is sent.  Therefore, the company has two lists of countries.  The first includes the countries of Europe, the CIS, the USA, Canada, as well as a number of the most popular destinations for tourism and migration - Lithuania, Switzerland, Thailand, Egypt, China and so on. </p><p>  The rest includes more countries: the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Algeria, Jamaica, African states and so on.  Their peculiarity lies in the fact that the cost of the services provided is more expensive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "My planet" </h2><p>  Now, with regard to the tariff plans in force at Beeline.  The tariff "International", as you know, we leave out of our <span>sight,</span> because it has lost its relevance.  Let's start with the option “My Planet” - a plan that refuses the monthly fee. </p><p>  For the so-called popular countries, incoming calls cost 15 rubles per minute, outgoing calls cost 25. Each SMS message will cost 9 rubles.  For unpopular areas, respectively, the prices are: 19 p.  incoming, 49 p.  outgoing, 9 p.  - SMS. </p><p>  We can say that “My Planet” is a standard international roaming tariff at Beeline.  The cost of services here, as you can see, is marked by the amount of data used by the user, and there is no monthly fee.  You can connect the tariff plan either by contacting the operator, or using a simple combination * 110 * 0071 #.  To disable, instead of the last digit dial 0. </p>

    <h2>  Planet Zero </h2><p>  Another interesting tariff is Planet Zero.  The package is positioned as one in which there is no fee for incoming calls.  Thus, the subscriber pays only for services that he consumes.  True, you should not be seduced by the low cost of communication within the framework of this service - the operator, obviously, covers its expenses through some tricks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Firstly, like the “International” tariff (Beeline, Moscow), the “Planet Zero” option (also available for subscribers from the capital) provides for a mandatory monthly fee of 60 rubles per day of using the service.  Secondly, the cost depending on the geographic location of the user is divided into three categories.  The first is <span>popular countries</span> in which incoming (after the 20th minute) become paid and cost 10 rubles per minute;  outgoing - 20 rubles, and SMS - 7. The second - the remaining directions, in which the monthly fee is already 100 rubles per day, incoming after the 20th minute - 15 rubles per minute, outgoing - 45 rubles, and SMS - 9 rubles. </p><p>  In addition to the above, there is a third category of countries to which the service does not apply.  These include various island states and some former colonies.  The full list is on the official website of the company. </p><p>  Such is the international Beeline roaming.  The rates above are current as of today.  To activate the Planet Zero service, you need to enter the command * 110 * 331 #.  When disconnecting, accordingly, the last digit must be replaced by zero. </p><h2>  “The most profitable Internet in roaming” </h2>

    <p>  The company also has a tariff for the provision of Internet services abroad in the Beeline network.  The tariff "International 4 G", of course, is currently unavailable, but there is an option, which is called: "The most profitable Internet in roaming."  You do not need to connect it - the subscriber is served by default. </p><p>  As part of the service, you, as a Beeline subscriber, are provided with a 40 megabyte data packet.  Its cost is 200 rubles per day of use.  Moreover, if you spend more, you will have to pay 5 rubles for each megabyte.  The above tariff schedule is valid only in popular countries.  As for the rest of the territories, they will cost 90 rubles per megabyte of Internet for a Beeline user. </p><p>  Tariffs for international calls, as you see, this option does not provide at all. </p><h2>  SMS in international roaming </h2><p>  For those who like to send text messages, the company has an additional service in the form of an SMS package.  Each client who has traveled abroad is provided with 100 messages to be sent to Beeline numbers.  The cost of the package is 295 rubles, which are debited one-time. </p>

    <h2>  How to reduce costs? </h2><p>  Beeline gives some tips on how to reduce mobile costs.  Firstly, for example, on the website it is recommended to pre-activate the tariff for roaming in order to pay for services on special conditions.  Secondly, you need to make sure that your phone can switch to roaming services.  You can do this in the device settings.  Thirdly, do not forget about information support - install the “My Beeline” application to monitor costs and see all the options by your number online.  Also do not hesitate to ask the operator your questions by phone +7 (495) -974-8888 (for subscribers - for free). </p><h2>  How to find out the cost of calls at your tariff? </h2>

    <p>  A frequent problem for travelers (even before the trip) is the difficulty in calculating their own costs.  Given that the amount you have to pay is large enough, a person should not be mistaken, since the difference can become enormous. </p><p>  For greater convenience of subscribers, Beeline tariffs (international communication for which is the main function), the operator has developed a special online calculator.  To determine which package will be more profitable for you, just enter your goals (what services you would like to use on the trip), as well as the country where you are going.  As a result, the system will issue prices for services for one or another option, which will allow a comparison. </p><h2>  Top up your account in roaming </h2><p>  Finally, do not forget about the balance of your account.  Before you go, we recommend replenishing it so as not to look for ways to deposit funds while abroad.  It will be cheaper, because various commissions and additional payments can operate abroad. </p>
