    <p>  Many mothers would like to learn how to crochet <strong>baby hats</strong> <strong>.</strong>  And this is not surprising.  After all, with the help of this device you can not only make a simple accessory, but also create a real object of applied creativity.  This tool allows you to make not only a warm hat, but also a light airy summer panama.  It all depends on the quality of the selected thread, pattern and model.  And therefore, mothers ask themselves: ‚Äú <strong>How to <span>crochet a hat?</span></strong>  What threads should I choose and how much?  Which model is best for the child? ‚Äù </p><p>  First, let's figure out the threads.  For warm winter accessories, you should definitely choose a quality coat that will not prick during socks and will not cause irritation in your child.  <strong>Crochet children's summer hats is</strong> best knitted from yarn, which is 100% cotton.  For a child, depending on the size and model, 100 grams should be enough, but do not forget about the threads for its decoration.  After all, it should be not only practical and high-quality, but also bright, fun, to please your baby.  It is better to choose a hook 0.5 - 1.5 mm for knitting summer hats and a thicker one for winter hats. </p><p>  Fit in <strong> </strong>  <strong>Crochet baby hats</strong> is easy enough.  The main thing is to have the most minimal skills and knowledge about this type of needlework.  It is better to start knitting from above, connecting 5 to 7 air loops in a ring.  If you plan to tie a hat, then knit the main fabric with single crochet columns, trying to tighten the loops as tight as possible.  In this case, the finished product will keep its shape very well during wear.  You can tie a hat and an openwork pattern.  In this case, you will need to fix its shape with a starch or sugar solution.  But in such a hat your child will not be hot, even on the hottest day. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Knitting simple hats without borders can also begin with the formation of a ring of air loops, that is, from top to bottom.  In this case, a circle is tied, the diameter of which will depend on the <span>size of the child‚Äôs head.</span>  Calculating it is quite simple, you just need to remember the math: the length of the head circumference, divided by the number pi (3.14).  The direction of knitting can be reversed.  In this case, you need to start with a set of chains of air loops, the length of which will be equal to the girth of the child‚Äôs head. </p><p>  <strong>Crochet baby hats are</strong> very often made in the form of various animals.  A child with pleasure puts on such a head with a garment, perceiving it more like a toy, because his cap or hat has eyes, a nose and even ears.  It also fits easily enough.  The main thing is to tie the foundation.  All other elements, as a rule, are knitted separately and then sewn to it.  If you decide to please your child with just such a headdress, choose the right thread color, because a hat in the shape of a cat, knitted with blue threads, will not usually look.  But if you pick up gray yarn, then your child will simply have a unique headgear. </p><p>  <strong>Crochet</strong> baby <strong>hats</strong> must be decorated.  For girls, as a rule, flower arrangements and little men are chosen as decoration; for boys, various trains, cars and helicopters.  Sometimes mothers knit out letters and numbers.  In a word, who likes what more. </p><p>  If we talk about the timing of the manufacture of this product, then they directly depend on skills, the size of the child‚Äôs head, as well as the thickness of the threads.  Experienced knitters need only about two hours to make a children's headgear.  If you rarely knit, you will have to spend at least 7-8 hours.  The main thing here is not time, but zeal and desire to do a unique thing for your child, which will undoubtedly please him. </p>
