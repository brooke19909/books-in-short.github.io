A person who knows the history of his people can adequately navigate in the modern space and competently respond to difficulties.  Russian historians help to study the science that tells about the affairs of past centuries.  Let us dwell in more detail on those who played a significant role in scientific research in this area. </p><h2>  First annals </h2><p>  Until writing existed, historical knowledge was passed on by word of mouth.  And such traditions existed among different peoples. </p><p>  When writing appeared, events began to be recorded in the annals.  Experts believe that the first sources date back to the X-XI centuries.  More ancient scriptures have not been preserved. </p><p>  The first surviving chronicle belongs to the pen of the monk of the Kiev-Pechora monastery Nikon.  The most complete work created by Nestor is the "Tale of Bygone Years" (1113). </p><p>  Of course, these works cannot yet be considered scientific, but thanks to them the first stones were laid in the foundation of the historical science of the Russian state. </p><p>  Later, the ‚ÄúChronograph‚Äù appeared, compiled by the monk Philotheos at the end of the XV-beginning of the XVI century.  The document provides an overview of world history and sets out the role of Moscow in particular and Russia as a whole. </p><p>  Of course, history is not just a statement of events; science has a task to comprehend and explain historical turns. </p><h2>  The emergence of history as a science: Vasily Tatishchev </h2><p>  The formation of historical science in Russia began in the 18th century.  At this time, the Russian people tried to realize themselves and their place in the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first historian of Russia is considered <span>Vasily Tatishchev.</span>  This is an outstanding thinker and politician of those <span>years.</span>  <span>The years of</span> his life are 1686-1750.  Tatishchev was a very gifted person, and he managed to make a successful career under Peter I. After participating in the Northern War, Tatishchev was engaged in public affairs.  In parallel, he collected historical chronicles and put them in order.  After his death, a 5-volume work was published, over which Tatishchev worked throughout his life - ‚ÄúRussian History‚Äù. </p><p>  In his work, Tatishchev established causal relationships of the events taking place, based on the annals.  The thinker is rightfully considered the founder of Russian history. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian historians" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2083996.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Mikhail Shcherbatov </h2><p>  The historian of Russia Mikhail Shcherbatov also lived in the XVIII century, he was a member of the Russian Academy. </p><p>  Shcherbatov was born into a wealthy noble family.  This person possessed encyclopedic knowledge.  He created "History of Russia from ancient times." </p><p>  Scholars of later eras criticize Shcherbatov‚Äôs research, accusing him of some haste in writing and gaps in knowledge.  Indeed, Shcherbatov set about studying history even when he began to work on writing it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The history of Shcherbatov was not in demand among contemporaries.

    <h2>  Nikolay Karamzin </h2><p>  Among the historians of Russia Karamzin occupies a leading position.  The writer developed an interest in science in 1790.  Alexander I appointed him historiographer. </p><p>  Karamzin throughout his life worked on the creation of "History of the Russian state."  This book introduced the story to a wide range of readers.  Since Karamzin was more a writer than a historian, in his work he worked on the beauty of expressions. </p><p>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãKaramzin's History was reliance on autocracy.  The historian concluded that only with strong monarch power does a country flourish, and when it is weakened, does it decline. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern historians of Russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2084004.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Konstantin Aksakov </h2><p>  Among the prominent historians of Russia and famous Slavophiles, <span>Konstantin Aksakov,</span> born in 1817, takes his place of honor.  His works promoted the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe opposite of the paths of historical development of Russia and the West. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  He was the author of a dissertation on the significance of Lomonosov‚Äôs personality in the history of Russian culture.  He studied the life of the ancient Slavs. </p><p>  Aksakov was positive about returning to traditional Russian roots.  All his activities called for precisely this - a return to the roots.  Aksakov himself let go of his beard and wore a braid and murmur.  He criticized Western fashion. </p><p>  Aksakov did not leave a single scientific work, but his numerous articles became a significant contribution to Russian history.  Also known as the author of philological works.  Preached freedom of speech.  He believed that the ruler should hear the opinion of the people, but is not obliged to accept it.  On the other hand, people do not need to interfere in government affairs, but rather focus on their moral ideals and spiritual development. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian historians list" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2084065.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nikolay Kostomarov </h2><p>  Another figure from among Russian historians who worked in the 19th century.  He was a friend of Taras Shevchenko, had an acquaintance with Nikolai Chernyshevsky.  He worked as a professor at Kiev University.  He published Russian History in the Biographies of its Figures in several volumes. </p><p>  The value of Kostomarov‚Äôs work in Russian historiography is enormous.  He promoted the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfolk history.  Kostomarov studied the spiritual development of Russians, this idea was supported by scientists of later eras. </p><p>  Around Kostomarov formed a circle of public figures who romanticized the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnationality.  According to the report, all members of the circle were arrested and punished. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Great historians of Russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2084041.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Sergey Soloviev </h2><p>  One of the most famous historians of Russia in the 19th century.  Professor, and later rector of Moscow University.  For 30 years he worked on the History of Russia.  This outstanding work became the pride not only of the scientist himself, but also of the historical science of Russia. </p><p>  All the material collected was studied by Soloviev with sufficient completeness necessary for scientific work.  In his work, he drew the reader's attention to the inner filling of the historical vector.  The originality of Russian history, according to the scientist, consisted in a certain delay in development - compared with the West. </p><p>  Soloviev himself admitted to his ardent Slavophilism, which cooled off a bit when he studied the historical development of the country.  The historian advocated the rational abolition of serfdom and the reform of the bourgeois system. </p><p>  In his scientific work, Soloviev supported the reforms of Peter I, thereby departing from the ideas of the Slavophiles.  Over the years, Soloviev‚Äôs views passed from liberal to conservative.  At the end of his life, the historian supported an enlightened monarchy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first historian of Russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2084082.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Vasily Klyuchevsky </h2><p>  Continuing the list of Russian historians, it should be said about <span>Vasily Klyuchevsky</span> (1841-1911). He worked as a professor at Moscow University.  He was considered a talented lecturer.  His lectures were attended by many students. </p><p>  Klyuchevsky was interested in the basics of folk life, studied folklore, wrote proverbs and sayings.

Klyuchevsky‚Äôs ideas were accompanied by criticism, however, the historian did not engage in polemics on these topics.  He said that he expressed his subjective opinion on many issues. </p><p>  On the pages of the Course, Klyuchevsky gave many brilliant characteristics to <span>historical figures</span> and key moments of Russian history. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prominent historians of Russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2084093.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Sergey Platonov </h2><p>  Speaking of the great historians of Russia, it is worth recalling Sergey Platonov (1860-1933). He was an academician, a lecturer at the university. </p><p>  Platonov developed the ideas of Sergei Solovyov on countering the clan and state principles in the development of Russia.  He saw the cause of modern misfortune in the coming to power of the nobility. </p><p>  Sergey Platonov gained fame thanks to published lectures and a history textbook.  He evaluated the October Revolution from a negative point of view. </p><p>  For hiding important historical documents from Stalin, Platonov was arrested along with friends who had anti-Marxist views. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="famous historians of Russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2084107.jpg"></div>
