  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Audiophile headphones: rating, review of the best models</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Audio lovers are extremely kind to everything that relates to sound, including gadgets.  Therefore, they approach the choice of audiophile headphones with all care and scrupulousness.  The good old principle applies in this segment: the more expensive, the better. </p><p>  But the scrupulous choice and the rather considerable cost of such gadgets are justified by the exceptional sound.  And the latter is especially important for audio fans who are willing to pay almost any money for it. </p><p>  We will consider the best audiophile headphones that can be found on the shelves of domestic stores.  We will analyze the remarkable characteristics of gadgets, as well as the available pros and cons.  For a more visual picture, the devices will be presented in the form of a rating, where the opinions of thematic magazines and respected reviewers are taken as a basis. </p><p>  Audiophile Headphone Rating: </p><ol><li>  Sony WH-1000XM3. </li><li>  Westone W40. </li><li>  Bose QuietComfort 35 II. </li><li>  Plantronics BackBeat PRO 2. </li></ol><p>  Consider the participants in more detail.  It‚Äôs worth immediately clarifying that in the case of audiophile headphones with a cost of less than 20 thousand rubles, you will have to overpay for the brand.  While more expensive premium models cost exactly as much as they invested in technology and materials, as well as other high-quality components. </p><h2>  Sony WH-1000XM3 </h2><p>  ‚ÄúSony‚Äù year after year pleases with high-quality devices that are respected throughout the world.  This model can be safely called the best audiophile wireless headphones.  In its segment, it simply does not have serious competitors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="gadgetpilipinas.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony WH-1000XM3" class="if uuid-3120133" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3120133.jpg"></div><p>  The second generation of the series was considered the standard, and the third received some changes.  And judging by the user reviews, they only went to the benefit of the headphones.  The sound output has become more detailed and balanced.  Sony's WH-1000XM3 audiophile headphones can now handle high-resolution music: LDAC and aptX HD (24 bit / 48 kHz) support. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the model </h2><p>  Here we have soft and voluminous bass, an exceptional balance of medium and high frequencies with a wide stage, as well as an excellent software component.  Sony uses its own codecs, allowing you to listen to tracks without loss of quality.  You can buy a device for about 28 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.harveynorman.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Headphones Sony WH-1000XM3" class="if uuid-3120134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3120134.jpg"></div><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  active noise reduction; </li><li>  autonomy up to 40 hours; </li><li>  atmospheric pressure regulator; </li><li>  excellent ergonomics; </li><li>  attractive appearance; </li><li>  high-quality microphone; </li><li>  Type C interface </li></ul><p>  No flaws were identified. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Westone w40 </h2><p>  Westone's audiophile in <span>-ear headphones from</span> the W40 series performed particularly well when playing classical music as well as rock.  The sound of high and medium frequencies worked out extremely sensibly.  The local bass can be called calm.  They do not bulge and do not put pressure on the ears, as in dynamic models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sweetwater.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Westone w40" class="if uuid-3120135" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3120135.jpg"></div><p>  Also pleased with the ergonomic part.  With Westone's audiophile headphones, you can walk hours and hours without removing or even noticing them.  Nothing will stop you from enjoying your favorite songs.  Build quality, durability and other operational characteristics are fully consistent with the high cost of the gadget.  And this is almost 36 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  perfect sound for this form factor; </li><li>  high ergonomic performance; </li><li>  original and nice looking design; </li><li>  durability of a design; </li><li>  thoughtful and convenient control panel; </li><li>  rich scope of supply (interchangeable ear pads, cables, covers, etc.). </li></ul><p>  No flaws were identified. </p><h2>  Bose QuietComfort 35 II </h2><p>  A model from a famous American brand is ideal for any musical direction.  In addition, the gadget can also perform a wide range of tasks: music, games, TV, conversations, etc. Separately, it is worth noting the excellent noise reduction, which allows you to completely immerse yourself in your world.  The device can not be called popular, because it costs about 27 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="huppins.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bose QuietComfort 35 II" class="if uuid-3120137" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3120137.jpg"></div><p>  In terms of sound quality, the model is quite a bit behind the leader of our rating, but it wins in functionality.  The gadget has a pair of microphones, full support for Apple devices, voice dialing, a mechanical volume control, NFC technology and the ability to connect a cable.  This last point is especially important for gamers who are picky about response times. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  excellent sound in all musical genres; </li><li>  exceptional noise reduction; </li><li>  comfortable to wear design; </li><li>  wide functionality; </li><li>  autonomy up to 20 hours; </li><li>  convenient management. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  the model comes to Russia with a very high price tag; </li><li>  a lot of fakes (especially on "Aliexpress"). </li></ul><h2>  Plantronics BackBeat PRO 2 </h2><p>  Many audiophiles consider this model to be the best in their price category.  The gadget can be called universal due to the presence of a pair of microphones.  So the headphones are great not only for listening to music, but also for gaming. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestbuy.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plantronics BackBeat PRO 2" class="if uuid-3120136" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3120136.jpg"></div><p>  The device has well-set bass, excellent noise reduction, a decent set of functions and ease of use.  Headphones have moderate bass with a barely noticeable dip in the middle.  There are no complaints about other frequencies.  The gadget is omnivorous and practically not picky about the style of compositions. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many audiophiles call this model the golden mean between high sound quality and adequate price.  The latter ranges from 15 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  excellent sound of classical and rock compositions; </li><li>  good noise reduction; </li><li>  wide functionality; </li><li>  autonomous operating time up to 24 hours; </li><li>  high ergonomic performance; </li><li>  nice appearance; </li><li>  rich scope of supply; </li><li>  excellent value for money. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  especially bass tracks the model does not pull; </li><li>  charge indicators sometimes fake. </li></ul>
