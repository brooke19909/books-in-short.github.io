It can store small items, discs, money, etc. For ceremonial occasions, beautiful decorative envelopes are used.  They can present a greeting card or money. </p><p>  Of course, you can purchase ready-made envelopes.  But sometimes it is not possible to find an envelope of suitable size, color, etc. In this case, you can make an origami envelope with your own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY envelope" class="if uuid-3184684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94504/3184684.jpg"></div><h2>  Tools and materials that will be needed in the process </h2><p>  Before proceeding with the manufacture, it is necessary to prepare all the materials.  As a rule, everything you need is at home.  For an origami envelope with your own hands you will need: </p><ul><li>  The main material is paper.  Normal A4 sheets will do.  Or other paper: color, white, wrapping, kraft paper, etc. </li><li>  Glue for paper. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Ruler. </li><li>  Pencil. </li><li>  Decorative jewelry - beads, rhinestones, lace, ribbons, etc. <div class="photo" data-original="laptopsc.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful envelope" class="if uuid-3184678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94504/3184678.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  How to make an envelope from sheet A4 </h2><p>  A4 paper will allow you to create a standard-size envelope (for example, for writing). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  You must place the sheet in front of you in a horizontal position. </li><li>  From the upper right corner measure 72 mm and mark this point with a pencil.  Then connect the mark and the lower right corner with one line. </li><li>  Now you need to measure 72 mm from the lower left corner and draw a line from there to the upper left corner. </li><li>  Now you need to cut the resulting triangles on the sides with scissors, following the drawn lines. </li><li>  The result is a rhombus, which must also be placed horizontally in front of you. </li><li>  The side parts must be bent to the center so that they touch the corners. </li><li>  Bend the upper and lower parts in the same way. </li></ul><p>  Now it remains only to fix with glue everything except the upper part.  It should open freely.  Origami envelope made with A4 paper made, ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oldtownboutiquedistrict.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="holiday envelopes" class="if uuid-3184656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94504/3184656.jpg"></div><h2>  Custom Envelope </h2><p>  For such a product, a sheet of paper of any size is suitable.  It doesn‚Äôt matter what shape it is: square or rectangular. </p><ul><li>  The paper sheet needs to be folded diagonally.  Then turn it back and place it in front of you so that the fold is horizontal. </li><li>  Now the bottom corner should be bent to the center of the sheet.  The corner may protrude slightly beyond the fold. </li><li>  Bend the side parts inward and fix everything with glue.  And the upper part must remain open so that the envelope can be used. </li></ul><p>  The method is very simple.  Depending on the initial shape of the sheet, you can get a rectangular or square envelope. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="jofanza.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kraft paper envelope" class="if uuid-3184702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94504/3184702.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make an envelope for money yourself </h2><p>  You can make your own origami envelope for money.  For this method, A4 format or any other rectangular-shaped sheet is also suitable. </p><p>  You need to do the following: </p><ul><li>  Place the paper rectangle in front of you horizontally.  Divide it with a vertical line so that its side is wider than the other by 1 - 1.5 cm. </li><li>  Bend the sheet along the marked line.  In the same position, it is necessary to bend the sides by 1 - 1.5 cm. </li><li>  After this, the sheet needs to be laid out and narrower side parts cut off over the wider half, following along the marked lines. </li><li>  The result is a workpiece that you only need to fold and fix with glue.  The protruding sides are bent inward, the sheet again folds in half.  Moreover, the part that was wider forms a label for the envelope. <div class="photo" data-original="polkadotsarelove.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bright envelopes" class="if uuid-3184679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94504/3184679.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  DIY origami envelope without glue </h2><p>  The method is also quite simple, even for those who are not keen on origami.  To create an envelope, you only need paper and a scheme by which it can be folded. </p><p>  The paper should be square in shape.  It must be folded diagonally so that a triangle forms.  It must be placed base down. </p><p>  Now, the upper corner of the sheet must be bent down without crossing the bottom line. </p><p>  Lateral corners should be bent inward with an overlap.  The upper corner (‚Äúoverlap‚Äù) must be bent in the opposite direction so that it is in the center of the envelope. </p><p>  In a straightened form, this corner forms a small pocket into which you can tuck the top tab and close the envelope. </p><p>  This craft looks unusual and original. </p><h2>  Fancy DIY Envelopes </h2><p>  Creating an origami envelope with your own hands, you can show imagination and give it an unusual shape. </p><p>  For example, try making an envelope with rounded edges: </p><ul><li>  For manufacturing, you need a square sheet of paper.  In this case, it is desirable that it be dense.  Then the envelope will keep its shape well. </li><li>  In the center of the sheet you need to draw a square of the same size as the finished envelope should turn out. </li><li>  From the side parts you need to form rounded tags.  It turns out a workpiece with a square center and 4 rounded parts on the sides. <div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="square envelopes" class="if uuid-3184673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94504/3184673.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  Now in the center you need to place the contents of the envelope, bend the tabs and fix them (for example, using the tape).  The original origami envelope, made with your own hands, is ready. </p><h2>  Some tips for creating beautiful envelopes </h2><p>  Creating a beautiful envelope is quick and easy.  The main thing is to follow these tips: </p><ul><li>  Using paper that is too thick is not recommended.  For example, the A4 format for a DIY origami envelope is perfect.  It turns out a standard product.  Cardboard can also be used, but not too thick.  Otherwise, all the bends will be sloppy. </li><li>  Do not use too much glue.  Enough just a little bit to fasten and fix the corners of a sheet of paper. </li><li>  Do not be afraid of experiments.  An envelope made of kraft paper, tied with ordinary twine, will look very stylish.  Imagine and use a variety of materials. </li></ul><p>  Ready-made envelopes can very easily be made festive, gift-giving and suitable for a particular event.  Even the most ordinary white envelope can be decorated with colored paper applications, and a bright, unusual product will already be obtained. </p><p>  If the envelope is made for a children's holiday, then you can use jewelry in the form of eyes and ears to get the face of an animal (or images of your favorite cartoon characters). </p><div class="photo" data-original="craftycreationsbyniki.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="envelope for children" class="if uuid-3184704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94504/3184704.jpg"></div><p>  For girls, an envelope decorated with ribbons, lace, beads, etc. is suitable. </p><p>  Do not forget that the envelope is perfect not only for money, letters or notes.  It can also be used to present small items. </p>
