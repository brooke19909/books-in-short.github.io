But not everyone is aware that this type of information exchange is being updated, and over time its new modifications appear.  How to find out the bluetooth version on an ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù phone?  You will find the answer to this question in this article. </p><h2>  Bluetooth  History of creation </h2><p>  Today, almost every device (phone, tablet, laptop) has a built-in bluetooth module.  Bluetooth is a type of wireless connection for transmitting information.  Devices can connect at a distance of up to 10 meters from each other, and the sender and receiver can be in different rooms.  What is the principle of bluetooth?  In the process of exchanging information, this technology uses radio waves. </p><p>  Work on the creation of bluetooth wireless communications began back in 1994, and four years later, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group announced the first versions - 1.0 and 1.0B.  Initially, devices with such versions had poor compatibility between devices from different manufacturers.  But in 2004, a modification of Bluetooth 2.0 was presented, the main feature of which was support for EDR (Enhanced Data Rate) technology, which significantly accelerated data exchange to almost 3 Mbps. </p><h2>  Bluetooth low energy </h2><p>  A huge step in the development of this type of communication was version 4.0, released by Bluetooth SIG in 2010.  Starting with this specification, there has been support for Low Energy, or low power consumption.  This allowed the devices to consume less energy during operation, and, accordingly, work longer without recharging.  Most often, the chips of this particular version are built into many modern devices: watches, motion sensors, gamepads, wireless keyboards, fitness bracelets, etc. These devices can be paired with a phone or tablet to exchange information. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But why is it so important to know the bluetooth version?  For example, the <span>Xiaomi Mi Band</span> 2 <span>bracelet</span> supports Bluetooth 4.0.  But your smartphone may have the previous bluetooth specification - below 4.0, for example, 3.0, and therefore, pairing between devices cannot be established, and the user will experience a huge chagrin.  So, how to find out the bluetooth version on the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù device?  We offer several options. </p><h2>  How to find out the bluetooth version on Android 5.0? </h2><p>  If it‚Äôs easy to determine the version of the Android operating system - just look at the ‚ÄúAbout phone‚Äù or ‚ÄúAbout tablet‚Äù item in the device‚Äôs settings, then it‚Äôs more difficult with Bluetooth: often in the standard menu of the device the digits we need are not indicated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Device settings" class="if uuid-3180050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/3180050.jpg"></div><p>  How to find out the bluetooth version on an ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù smartphone?  You need to download the AIDA64 application to your electronic device.  You can download this program for free on Google Play, the store of games and applications for Android. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="AIDA64 on Google Play" class="if uuid-3180042" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/3180042.jpg"></div><p>  Having launched the application, you must select the "System".  This is where the Bluetooth version of your device will be displayed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="AIDA64 Application" class="if uuid-3180041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/3180041.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to this, there are other interesting details in this program: information about various sensors, the processor, the version of the OpenGL device is indicated, and much more. </p><h2>  How to find out the bluetooth version on "Android" 7.0? </h2><p>  In addition to AIDA64, there is another application that can help in this matter.  This is AnTuTu Benchmark.  It can also be downloaded from the Play Store.  After starting the application, you must click on "My device" - there will be given the characteristics of your device.  Scrolling down a little to the ‚ÄúConnection‚Äù item, the user will be able to read information about the availability and specifications of WI-FI and Bluetooth on his device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Bluetooth version in Antutu" class="if uuid-3180044" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/3180044.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to determining the bluetooth version, in the application you can test the operation of the browser, screen, battery, processor, graphic video accelerator and find out about other characteristics of your own device. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Pairing two devices via Bluetooth is one of the ancient ways of wireless communication.  Despite this, this information transfer technology is still relevant: the vast majority of users use it. </p><p>  So, there are several ways to find out the version of Bluetooth on your device.  Sometimes this information is present on the company box of the goods we bought.  Also, a search on the Internet with a similar query will help determine the bluetooth specification: ‚Äúdevice characteristics‚Äù (instead of the word ‚Äúdevices‚Äù you indicate the full name and model of your device).  On sites where a full description is given and all phone parameters are given, the Bluetooth version will also be indicated.  But it‚Äôs better to use specialized programs that quickly and easily show you the necessary information.  As written above, these are applications such as AIDA64 and AnTuTu Benchmark. </p><p>  Well, for successful pairing of various devices with your phone (for example, a watch or a fitness bracelet), you need to know the Bluetooth version for sure.  This will help to avoid rash costs due to rush purchases. </p><p>  Today we often use this technology - and not only when we transfer any files.  For example, using bluetooth it is very convenient to use a wireless headset or control household appliances from a distance.  According to the developers, Bluetooth 5.1 is coming soon.  The main difference from previous specifications will be the ability to transfer data even faster - up to 100 Mbps.  Well, wait and see.  In the meantime, Bluetooth technology is a great help for us all - the ability to wirelessly exchange information between devices. </p>
