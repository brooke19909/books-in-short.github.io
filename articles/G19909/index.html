    <p>  <span>Headphones Sony MDR-7506 is</span> made almost unchanged since the distant 1992 and is positioned as a standard for studio monitoring.  Perhaps that is why they can often be seen in the hands (on the ears) of a variety of stars: from Justin Bieber to Diane Kroll. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><ul><li>  Headphones Sony MDR-7506. </li><li>  Manual. </li><li>  Carrying Case. </li><li>  Adapter for 3.5 and 6.3 mm connectors. </li><li>  Warranty card. </li></ul><h2>  Packaging and equipment </h2><p>  In a huge box compared to headphones, the model itself and a small set of accessories are located.  The cover, which is made of leatherette, is designed exclusively for carrying headphones: cute, neat and with ties.  The adapter, designed to go from the 3.5 to 6.3 mm jack, works on a screw-on principle and looks quite solid. </p>

    <p>  But if you look at the instructions for the Sony MDR-7506, you can find one interesting point.  It is made, as in most similar cases, in the form of a cardboard booklet.  On one side you can see information about the headphones, and the other side consists of detailed instructions for replacing parts and components. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By and large, with a minimal set of tools at hand, the Sony MDR-7506 can be disassembled and even surely assemble them back.  That is, with minor breakdowns in the service, headphones are optional.  It is encouraging that the company takes care of its consumer, although there is a flip side to this nuance - the warranty ceases to be valid after self-disassembling the Sony MDR-7506.  User reviews are full of technical issues and questions for specialists, so we can conclude that most consumers prefer an independent solution to their problems without contacting service centers. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The design consists mainly of plastic, metal and leatherette.  Everything was collected quite neatly, and, in principle, there was nothing to complain about: there are no crunches, backlashes or any creaks, the headphones sit perfectly on the head, and the adjustment also does not cause any complaints. </p>

    <p>  It is very easy to distinguish the left speaker from the right one - on the headband you can see the blue and red markers with the inscriptions L and R. The headphones can be easily transformed - they can be folded inwards or folded outwards, like in DJ versions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Exploitation </h2><p>  Noise isolation at Sony MDR-7506 is relatively good, despite the fact that the model significantly presses on the ears.  You should not use them in the subway or at the construction site, but for the street or relatively noisy rooms, they are quite suitable.  The external audibility is barely noticeable, and the sound is lost after a distance of a meter and a half. </p><p>  Headphones are comfortable to fit, and you can sit in them almost all day without feeling any discomfort.  The twisted wire is very solid and moves away from only one cup, so it is better to use headphones at home or in the studio, for portable use this is not the best option. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The sound of the model is analytical, but sometimes there is a bias in brightness.  The low-frequency register is well designed, but there is a slight boost.  The depth of the bass is felt to the fullest, and there is no mumbling. </p>

    <p>  Mid frequencies are served without whistles, gently and quite naturally.  All vocal parts of tones are very different, although the high frequencies are slightly exaggerated, but apparently this was done to monitor the range. </p><p>  For <span>closed headphones, the</span> breadth of the stereo panorama is simply impressive, and the effect of the depth of the scene deserves all praise.  Any blurry slips very rarely, except on the most difficult recordings.  The attack is also at a high level along with the dynamic range, so Sony MDR-7506 is perfect for listening to classical music.  Detail is felt in every sound, and you can easily discern the smallest tones of the compositions. </p><p>  It is difficult to identify any particular genre preferences that headphones cope best with, because they are universal and will handle all the loads on the equalizer. </p><h2>  Competitors </h2><p>  Model 7506 with its design and ergonomics is very similar to the HDJ-2000 series from "Pioneer".  Similarities can be seen in the sound signature, but they differ significantly in price, and if Sonya cost about 6-7 thousand rubles, then Pioneer is difficult to find for less than 10 thousand. </p>

    <p>  Judging by the feedback from users of both models, we can conclude that the Pioneer headphones turned out to be more reliable in longer operation than the Sony MDR-7506. </p><h2>  How to distinguish a fake? </h2><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to is the price.  Naturally, for the bargain price you won‚Äôt buy decent headphones, as well as any other high-quality thing, so do not flatter yourself when you see a price tag below $ 100. </p><p>  Next, you need to pay attention to the spelling of the first letter S in the company logo on the product box - it is slightly narrower than the rest.  The designation and annotation of the model itself should be with the edge of the package, and not in the middle. </p><p>  At a fake, the cups leave with great difficulty, while the original ones are easily transformed and put in place.  As for the sound quality, in the Chinese version the bass muffles the remaining frequencies, and with an increase in load, characteristic crackles and blurry tones are heard. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  On the manufacturer‚Äôs official online resources, headphones can be purchased for $ 100-130.  Chinese fakes are sold on eBay at around $ 50, and some high-quality copies are quite suitable for spare parts. </p><p>  In general, we can say that the 7506 is a universal option.  Despite the fact that headphones have been produced practically unchanged since 1992, the line is still relevant, because the ageless classics from Sony are always in price and honor.  For comfortable work, you need an intelligent amplifier, and after connecting the headphones, you most likely will like the result. </p><p>  With its price and characteristics, the model will surely attract the attention of many beginner audiophiles and just lovers of high-quality sound in a classic way. </p>
