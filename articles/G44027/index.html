    <h2>  Lilac garden on Schelkovo highway </h2><p>  This small and not very famous park is located in the eastern part of the capital.  The easiest way to get to it is from the <span>Cherkizovskaya,</span> Shchelkovskaya, <span>Preobrazhenskaya square</span> <span>metro</span> stations using a bus or trolleybus.  The park was established in 1975.  The lilac garden on the Shchelkovo highway was not created immediately.  The base for it was a nursery founded by one of the famous Soviet breeders Kolesnikov Leonid Alekseevich.  It was he who brought about 300 <span>species of lilacs</span> in our country.  Initially, Kolesnikov was appointed technical manager of the kennel in Kaloshin, and only later, in 1956, he was given a leadership position. </p><h2>  Occurrence </h2><p>  The Lilac Garden in Moscow, the photo of which is presented in the article, first settled on the Falcon.  At that time, he was almost crushed by new buildings.  But in the summer of 1956, the Moscow City Council ordered the transplantation of lilac bushes from the Falcon in Kaloshino.  Due to improper transportation and planting of plants with violations in the new nursery, most of them did not adapt.  The place intended for breaking the garden was in potholes and ditches.  But a middle-aged and poor health Leonid Alekseevich enthusiastically set to work.  He personally delivered land on a cart, and at his Stalin Prize he carried out an almost complete reconstruction of the Lilac Garden.  As soon as the plants began to take root, new buildings in the Izmailovo area came close to the plantings.  Since the nursery was not guarded, robbers often visited there.  As a result, the unique yellow lilac was forever ruined. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lilac garden in Moscow photo" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/451972.jpg" width="535"></div>

The lilac was of no interest to anyone, and Kolesnikov himself was "asked" to retire.  The remains of the nursery were given to the state farm of decorative crops Pervomaisky, but even here unique varieties were abandoned.  After a short period of time, a "public landscaping object" was made from the nursery.  In 1975, the Lilac Garden in Moscow began its official existence.  The total area stretches for 7 hectares.  The territory is closed by a fence, the entrances are located on the north and west sides.  At first, 32 different-grade bushes decorated the lilac garden in Moscow.  But thanks to the great work of the breeder, their number subsequently increased significantly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lilac garden in Moscow" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/451971.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <h2>  Breeder's Pride </h2><p>  Of the variety of <span>varieties of lilacs</span> here, Beauty of Moscow ", Hortensia, Leonid Leonov, <span>Red Moscow,</span> Nadezhda, Mechta, <span>Galina Ulanova.</span> The latter, by the way, which grows in <span>Buckingham Palace. The</span> lilac garden in Moscow also adorns the Gastello variety. In 1941, VDNH was high the decorative variety Olympiad Kolesnikov with purple buds was appreciated, it is dedicated to the wife of the breeder. Moscow Beauty was recognized as the floral symbol of the capital. And in 2008 the city authorities allocated 65 million rubles to plant varietal seedlings. They trap dust on their  . Istyah much better than basswood and poplar, and one of the important properties possessed lilac - it's a good gas resistance - a necessary feature for the big cities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Current state </h2><p>  When preparing Moscow for the Olympics-80 in 1980, a fountain was installed in the middle of the garden.  But this architectural element has not been functioning for many years.  In 2000, the fountain was connected, and it even worked for several months.  But now the building is in almost unsuitable condition.  If desired, the Moscow government could find funds to repair this fountain, which is important for the garden.  Since there are no attractions, shopping stalls, in the park you can enjoy peace and quiet.  Some lilac bushes in this garden were transported from a garden in the Sokol area.  Another part was crossed already in the Kaloshinsky nursery.  The mother liquors are large bushes with twisted and curved trunks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reconstruction of the lilac garden" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/451970.jpg" width="534"></div>  They were taken out of the Falcon in 1950.  Looking around, you can see that the garden seems pretty well-groomed and uncluttered.  But if you look closely, you can see a lot of broken branches, overgrown weed plants that clog varietal bushes.  In order to keep unique species preserved, it is necessary to carry out an inventory and registration of the best seedlings, to remove stock.  This is done at a time when the lilac is blooming.  Thus, the heritage of a talented breeder can be preserved and propagated in the botanical gardens.
