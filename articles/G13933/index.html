    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Staying at the Don Juan Beach Resort Adults Area 3 * hotel, there are a number of significant drawbacks.  Based on traveler reviews, it‚Äôs worth noting the following: </p><ul><li>  a small hotel area, which is not carefully looked after; </li><li>  everything in the hotel (both in the courtyard and in the residential buildings) is very old; </li><li>  the fruits served in the restaurant are not the freshest; </li><li>  there is practically no seafood on the menu, which is very strange for a hotel located on the beach; </li><li>  crowds of merchants who too intrusively offer their goods walk along the beach; </li><li>  there is practically no animation, but because the territory is very boring; </li><li>  sometimes the amount paid for accommodation upon the fact does not correspond to the amount indicated in the issued check (in the latter case, the figure may be less); </li><li>  there are practically no entertainment facilities nearby; </li><li>  even the few animations that are at the hotel are conducted in Spanish; </li><li>  in ‚Äúoff season‚Äù A La Carte restaurants do not work; </li><li>  in case of rains the hotel does not provide umbrellas for guests; </li><li>  in the bathroom there is not only a hairdryer, but even disposable shampoos; </li><li>  the sea in the lagoon is quite shallow (this can be an advantage only for vacationers with children); </li><li>  dishes in a restaurant with chips, moreover, are not well washed; </li><li>  old oilcloth is laid on tables in the dining room (it‚Äôs time to replace it a long time ago); </li><li>  pool water cannot be called perfectly clean; </li><li>  the safe is paid (in addition to the daily payment of $ 3, you still need to leave $ 50 as a deposit); </li><li>  TV does not show Russian channels; </li><li>  there are few sunshades on the beach (nevertheless, you can move the sunbed under the shade of the trees); </li><li>  the reception is located on the street, and therefore waiting for registration is hot and uncomfortable; </li><li>  when returning the deposit, they do not give you the bills that you made, but the old and wrinkled ones; </li><li>  air conditioning practically does not cool the air; </li><li>  Reception staff very politely respond to requests and comments from guests, but no action follows. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  This resort is a good budget option for exploring the Dominican Republic.  It is worth noting that the situation here is quite outdated and not the most well-groomed.  However, the institution is not without charm.  As for nutrition, it exceeds all expectations and can be rated much higher than 3 stars.  But the entertainment here is practically absent.  That is why the hotel is often chosen by lovers of a relaxing holiday or noisy companies that can cheer themselves. </p>
