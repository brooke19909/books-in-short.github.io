Only in the last few years the veil began to open and tourists from all over the world successfully take the opportunity to plunge into the world of the Land of the Rising Sun.  And there is something to see here. </p><h2>  brief information </h2><p>  As you know, Japan is located on islands in the Pacific Ocean.  The archipelago includes almost seven thousand islands, on which about 126 million people live, which makes it the tenth largest in the world in terms of population density.  Japan is a country with a very high standard of living, therefore, before applying for a visa, carefully read the financial side of the matter.  The consulate may request financial documents confirming your viability.  Japan, being a country with a rich culture, attracts tourists from all over the world also because the resorts of Japan are considered one of the best in the world.  Due to the mild climate, the temperature here in winter does not drop below ten degrees Celsius and rarely rises above thirty in the summer.  Therefore, relaxing here is a pleasure.  Rest time - from April to October, as well as in Central Russia.  The list of the most interesting places we will consider in the article. </p><h2>  Okinawa </h2><p>  The list of beach resorts in Japan is headed by Okinawa.  This is the largest island of the Ryukyu archipelago.  If you want to find it on a map, turn your eyes to the area between Taiwan and Kyushu Island.  It was there, in the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean, that Okinawa was located. </p><p>  Japanese resorts on the sea can not be imagined without diving.  This is Okinawa's first.  People come here who are eager for marine underwater adventures: complete immersion in water in search of corals and the magnificent coloring of marine life.  Photography on the inhabitants of the seabed is conducted year-round.  Magnificent coral reefs will delight not only children, but also experienced adults.  In addition, there are many dolphinariums and water slides on the beaches and in the heart of the island, designed for both children and adults.  The kitchen is great.  In order to feel the whole taste of relaxation, be sure to try the grilled seafood dishes.  Such tasty, but unpretentious food is served in all cafes not only in the city, but also on the beaches of the island. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.hisgo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Okinawa beaches" class="if uuid-3231881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3231881.jpg"></div><h2>  Ibusuki </h2><p>  Resorts in Japan are famous not only for the beauty of nature and the wealth of marine life.  Japan - islands that arose millions of years ago as a result of volcanic changes in relief.  This directly affected the beach holiday.  Ibusuki is a place that embodies the healing power of the ocean and volcanoes, which is located in the sand itself.  The sand is volcanic, therefore black or dark gray. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="31.2527917" data-lng="130.63304970000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/8/1/1/17811.png"></div><p>  The procedure is completely simple.  You come to the beach, relax, bask in the gentle waves of the Pacific Ocean, and then go to the beach and dig in the sand completely.  Lie still for about fifteen minutes.  To consolidate the maximum effect, it is advisable to repeat the procedure for at least ten consecutive days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="edition.cnn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ibusuki beach" class="if uuid-3231900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3231900.jpg"></div><h2>  Miyazaki </h2><p>  Among all resorts in <span>Japan,</span> Miyazaki <span>beaches are</span> traditionally chosen by families with children.  And not just like that.  All conditions are created here for a moderately lazy, but at the same time cognitive rest.  The vacation will fly by quickly, as the days will be full of various hikes and excursions that will appeal to both adults and children. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The spa town is located between the ridge and the Oeda River and has been functioning as a resort not so long ago.  For lovers of active water recreation, a great wave awaits here: surfing, water skiing, scooters, the choice of entertainment is wide.  For those who prefer hiking, tour organizers offer to climb mountain trails and see with their own eyes the ancient artifacts, buildings, preserved from the beginning of the last millennium. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.japantimes.co.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Miyazaki Beach" class="if uuid-3231902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3231902.jpg"></div><h2>  Hokkaido </h2><p>  In addition to magnificent beaches, there are mountains in the Land of the Rising Sun.  Few people know that the ski resorts in Japan are considered one of the best.  The most famous of them is Hokkaido.  It is the northernmost island in Japan and, in combination, the snowiest island in the world.  People come here to snowboard, ski, jump from a springboard or take part in a winter festival. </p><p>  Hokkaido is divided into three resort areas: Niseko, Furano and Rusutsu.  These are well-equipped ski areas.  Niseko is a place where young people gather.  All kinds of events, discos are held here, in the evening all areas for skiing are lit.  Furano and Rusutsu created for people who prefer peace and silence.  Here you can ride from the slopes of the mountains, not very steep.  For those who do not know how to ride and would like to learn, qualified trainers offer skiing or snowboarding lessons.  The main thing is to choose what you like.  Inveterate fishermen can relax in special ice fishing areas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jw-webmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hokkaido Resort" class="if uuid-3231904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3231904.jpg"></div><h2>  Nagano </h2><p>  Nagano is one of the best winter resorts in Japan.  This is a corner that attracts snowboarders and skiers of all categories.  It was on the territory of Nagano that the Winter Olympic Games were held back in 1998.  Since then, the resort infrastructure has improved several times thanks to the introduction of modern technology.  Often travelers prefer Nagano to all other ski resorts also because local cafes and restaurants are famous for the completely unique taste of the national alcoholic drink sake, which is prepared from special rice grown in those places.  Another attraction of Nagano is the presence of hot springs, namely those in which famous Japanese macaques take water procedures.  For those who want to plunge into the hot waters of the springs, there are special tours that can be purchased from individual travel agencies or at the reception of your hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nozawaholidays.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nagano resort" class="if uuid-3231907" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3231907.jpg"></div><h2>  Tohoku </h2><p>  Information about winter resorts in Japan would not be complete without Tohoku, which in terms of level and technical equipment is more likely for professionals in winter sports.  Trails are designed for a person with experience.  A special charm to this place is added by forests through which some ski slopes pass.  Snow-covered trees in the dark are highlighted in a special way, so that a feeling of a fairy tale is created.  By the way, in these places is the largest snow park in Asia, Alz Bandai. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.japantimes.co.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tohoku slopes" class="if uuid-3231909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3231909.jpg"></div><h2>  Resorts in Japan </h2><p>  The average cost of a ten-day vacation in Japan varies from 1,500 to 3,000 thousand dollars, depending on which routes and conditions you prefer.  Tourists who have already visited the beach or winter resorts in Japan say that the best place is hard to find elsewhere.  The color of the country, woven into all areas of the tourism business, makes you forget about all the difficulties and problems of everyday life.  Those who prefer to bask in the warm sand on the ocean leave enthusiastic reviews about the amazing conditions on the beaches, where you can find everything, including pink rubber slippers.  Delicious food, based mainly on seafood, is wholesome and low-calorie, which always tastes like a diet.  Fans of high-mountain slopes give their enthusiastic voices to the holders of snow slopes and hotels, where you can relax after sports races and relax your muscles in unique saunas, which are heated on local firewood from pine.
