    <h2>  What is a smart home? </h2><p>  Briefly, this concept includes the introduction of the latest technologies in household equipment.  Many have heard and seen about such a system on the Internet or on television.  This equipment is especially relevant for owners of suburban cottages who want to simplify and automate the management of communications and elements of the home as much as possible. </p><p>  Many parts from the general complex have been used for many years in shopping centers and offices.  These elements include: ventilation and air conditioning, video cameras, information portals, motion sensors and much more.  If these components are combined into one, it will turn out to briefly describe what a smart home is. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The basis of an intelligent building includes an integrated approach that allows using central systems to interact with each other to organize centralized control from a single control panel. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  What is a smart home?  Briefly consider the history of creation below.  This system was initially introduced to residents of the United States.  Back in the 70s of the last century, scientists at the Washington Intellectual University implemented a whole program to use the living space using the most modern technologies and the existing life-support systems. </p><p>  In the domestic market, such an invention appeared only after a quarter of a century.  The innovation among the population did not find much enthusiasm, given the high cost of the system itself and the complexity of its operation.  Since energy was worth a penny at that time, a house with intelligence was not widely used in the post-Soviet space.  Only in the early 2000s, the introduction of such a system began, as the computer industry, as well as the audio and television market, began to develop rapidly. </p>

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  Wealthy compatriots liked these schemes.  The symbol of a good life has become the ability to control all functions in household equipment without getting up off the couch.  Such designs have become a status attribute of a successful owner of a private house.  The project was attracted to potential customers in many respects by the fact that all the functionality was realized by pressing a few buttons on the remote control. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Briefly about the advantages of a smart home, we can say that it, with the possibility of access to the Internet, regulates almost all processes in the absence of home owners.  This includes not only the safety of the building, but also all the processes that take place in it.  This solution allows you to almost completely control the situation at a remote distance. </p>

    <h2>  Development </h2><p>  Next, we will consider in general what a smart home system is.  The summary reduces to the fact that it makes it possible to shift most of the household worries to artificial intelligence.  Experts note a steady increase in demand for this kind of technology.  Now all tasks can be programmed in a certain sequence and in the required mode, after which control is carried out by pressing one or two buttons. </p><p>  Many elite new buildings, especially in the capital, are equipped with a "smart home" system at the design stage.  In urban apartments, such technology is more in demand in terms of entertainment (multi-room, lighting control).  But for country houses and cottages, the option "smart home" (what it is - summarized in the previous paragraphs) is a way to optimize life support systems.  Modern residential buildings are a complex engineering structure in which there are various intelligent technologies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Branched electrical networks, air conditioning, ventilation, and thermal insulation nodes are used in country houses.  In addition, automatic systems for opening shutters and gates, and controlling the temperature and volume of water in the pool are installed.  Such multifunctionality - this is the main argument in favor of a smart home, which allows you to reduce the entire engineering part of the home into a single managed complex. </p>

    <h2>  Smart home: a brief description </h2><p>  Country cottages are usually equipped with a special security system, which includes a variety of sensors and controllers.  Typically, such a smart home includes a climate control unit, lighting, watering and fire fighting.  In principle, the possibilities of the technology under consideration are quite wide, so the option can be selected individually, depending on the requirements and wishes of the owner. </p><p>  The disadvantages of a smart home (briefly about the features of which we have already mentioned) are, first of all, in its high cost.  Not everyone can afford such a luxury.  The average price of a standard set in the domestic market is about 2.5-3 million rubles.  Nevertheless, technology is in demand among wealthy people.  Experts suggest that the cost of intelligent housing management will gradually decline, as has happened in Europe and America. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  According to foreign statistics, despite the high cost of the project in question, it pays off relatively quickly.  It is worth considering that a smart home is closely connected with computer science.  Briefly worth mentioning is the main advantage of the system.  Smart home allows you to reduce operating costs for all types of utilities.  As long-term observations show, you can save up to 30% on electricity, 40% on water, and up to 50% on heating. </p><p>  It should be noted that more than 25% of country houses outside the MKAD are already fully or partially equipped with intelligent control.  At the same time, the figure continues to grow steadily. </p><h2>  Globalization </h2><p>  What is a smart home class 7?  Briefly - this is a system that involves the intellectualization of not individual buildings, but entire villages.  Cottages in such a settlement are combined by management in a single <span>control room.</span>  This solution allows you to timely respond to various emergency and emergency situations.  All information from meters and other systems, in the case of a critical value, is transmitted to a common command post. </p><p>  For example, the owner of the cottage is away, and there is a fire.  Information about the accident goes to the owner‚Äôs mobile phone and to the control unit.  To resolve the problem, a monitoring device is provided to determine the source of the failure. </p><p>  In addition, a single intelligent house management will guarantee uninterrupted equipment of cottages with electricity, redistributing the load between all the buildings of the village equally.  This greatly simplifies the monitoring of the status of each building connected to a common console. </p>

    <h2>  What in the future? </h2><p>  Most experts suggest that behind such villages the future of all elite real estate outside the city is seen.  Smart homes, like entire settlements, will undoubtedly find their consumers.  Experts predict that soon buildings that do not have at least partial intellectual equipment will be more difficult to sell. </p><p>  Many experts note that the massive introduction of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù villages in the domestic expanses is still an unrealized dream, the realization of which is still too early to say.  Such settlements can be counted on the fingers.  And if we take into account that foreign analogues include an access control system, fire alarm, lighting control, a data system for existing cars, adjustment of the drainage and drinking systems, then there are no truly ‚Äúsmart villages‚Äù even in elite areas of the Moscow Region. </p>

    <h2>  Total </h2><p>  Experts in the future predict the indispensable development of intelligent homes and towns.  They attribute this to the ability of a smart home to regulate the climate and adapt to other external and internal factors.  Such technologies relate to optimal existence in the era of technological development. </p>
