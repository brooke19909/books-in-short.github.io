    <p>  In the reviews, Russians say that tourists are accommodated in two types of apartments.  The standard suites are 22 m¬≤ in size.  They have beds, tables, tables, chairs.  The balcony offers sea or city street views.  For storing documents in an electronic safe you need to pay extra.  Tariff - 100 rubles per day. </p><p>  A TV is connected to cable TV.  In the list you can find Russian-language channels.  Remote control from the air conditioner must be obtained from reception staff.  Filling the refrigerator with drinks and mineral water is not practiced.  The telephone is used to contact the hotel.  Long-distance communication is paid. </p><p>  The flooring of the room is a laminate board.  Children are given a cot or playpen.  Apartments are cleaned every day.  Bed linen is changed on demand or once a week.  In the bathroom there is a shower cabin, a set of terry towels, and personal hygiene products. </p><h2>  Special offer </h2><p>  The rooms of the Annex category have a usable area of ‚Äã‚Äãonly 18 m¬≤.  They do not have a balcony.  Missing refrigerator.  The rooms are in a separate building, which is located next to the main one.  Russians complain that they are placed in the cheapest suites.  At the same time, they paid the full cost of standard apartments. </p><p>  The rooms are dark and damp.  Windows face the pool.  Therefore noisy.  Mold was found not only in the bathroom, but also in the living room.  The hose from the air conditioner was discharged into a plastic container.  This indicates gross violations of the installation and operation of HVAC equipment.  The rooms that occupied the floor directly above the restaurant‚Äôs kitchen were not in demand either.  Therefore, Europeans were accommodated in standard and improved suites, and Russians were offered less comfortable options. </p><p>  Local staff rudely communicates with dissatisfied vacationers.  The hotel owner has repeatedly participated in fights with customers, throwing their belongings over the threshold.  Issues related to moving to another hotel are decided by a personal guide representing the tour operator. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>

    <p>  The beach, which is rented by the hotel, also causes a lot of complaints.  He is very small.  There are not enough sun loungers in August.  Guests got up at five in the morning to take a lounger by the sea.  Families were on duty in order not to lose their place.  The sand was dirty, silt was found everywhere.  Swimming in such conditions was unpleasant.  The mattresses that they gave out for money were in poor condition.  Multiple holes and holes were visible on them. </p><p>  Food in the restaurant is consistent with the declared status of the hotel.  There was little meat.  He was replaced by soy.  From fruits were given apples, cherries, grapes and watermelons.  There were no juices.  Under their guise, diluted water concentrates were fed.  Alcohol was local, of poor quality. </p><p>  The photographs taken by guests clearly show dilapidated furniture, dirty public areas, and scanty portions.  Customers noted sticky dishes and sluggish waiters.  Technical employees looked tired and were indifferent to the problems of vacationers. </p>
