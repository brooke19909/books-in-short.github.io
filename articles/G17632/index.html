    <h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  Zerich is one of the oldest brokers.  However, at the beginning of its work, the company was called Trust-Service.  The company was founded in 1993, before the appearance of the stock market, when the only instruments were vouchers - privatization checks.  The company was founded by Vladimir Nefedov, he was also its main beneficiary.  At a time when the stock market was just in its infancy, Zerich was one of the first companies to start providing brokers services to private individuals, and not just check funds and institutional investors who took part in privatization.  Although the real success is the start of cooperation with Norilsk Nickel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is difficult to say how profitable corporate actions were for the metallurgical giant.  But this deal gave a serious impetus to the development of Trans-Service. </p><p>  In 1998, the financial crisis was successfully survived and the company entered the field of online commerce.  In 2010, Vladimir Nefedov and his partners acquired Zerich Bank, and from that moment on, Zerich Capital Management public corporation reviews became so numerous. </p><p>  At first, Zerich was a small lending organization that turned into an investment bank as a result of a change of manager.  The company's activities in the securities market expanded, and new opportunities opened up for customers. </p>

    <p>  Representatives of the holding declare that a <span>controlling stake in</span> Zerich Bank was sold in 2015.  The same statement said that the group does not resort to the services of the bank, and the money in customer accounts and other <span>financial assets</span> are stored in another organization.  By some strange coincidence, the company was deprived of a license to issue loans a day after the publication of the application. </p><p>  In this regard, the Zerich company reviews are very mixed.  It is worth noting that negative statements often come from customers who do not know how to manage their assets themselves and fully rely on the broker.  On the one hand, the company has its own training center where beginners can take a high-quality training course with reasonable prices for services, and on the other hand, they will not always be able to provide an answer to your question in technical support.  In addition, unstable servers are the moment that causes the most complaints. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Company Features </h2><p>  As already noted, the company OJSC IC Zerich Capital Management today is one of the most famous and respectable brokers in Russia with more than twenty years of experience in the stock markets.  Until 2000, she worked under the name “TRUST SERVICE Financial Company”.  Many years of experience, the quality of operations and an impeccable reputation helped her to get the AA category in 2014 from the National Rating Agency - a rating of very high reliability. </p><p>  Today the company “Zerich Capital Management”, reviews of which are very interesting, offers legal entities and individuals a wide variety of services, providing: </p><p>  <em>1. Access to stock markets for stocks and bonds.</em> </p><p>  With the help of this broker, it is possible to carry out operations of purchase and sale of securities, including many types of Eurobonds, federal loan bonds, US stocks, etc. </p><p>  <em>2. The possibility of independent trading in the derivatives, foreign exchange and commodity markets.</em> </p><p>  Clients get access to options and futures for gold, oil, exchange rates, shares of major companies, etc. </p><p>  At the same time, traders are offered about 100 trading platforms in 25 countries of the world. </p>

    <p>  In addition, Zerich professionally helps legal entities conduct a successful IPO of their companies.  As reported by Zerich Capital Management, reviews, cooperation with the company means the actual receipt of dividends and profits and the withdrawal of securities in the registers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Since 2015, investors have been able to open the so-called <span>individual investment accounts</span> (IMS) - a tool that allows you to invest in the stock market with tax deductions and benefits.  If we study the reviews of employees about Zerich Capital Management, we can conclude that the company really fulfills the promised guarantees. </p><h2>  Zerich in Russia </h2><p>  In Russia, through this company, customers gain access to the largest exchange platform in the country - the Moscow Exchange (MOEX).  But in addition to the opportunity to buy Russian blue chips on this site, customers are also offered shares of promising fast-growing companies belonging to the second and third tier, which in the future can bring good profitability. </p><p>  MOEX provides an opportunity to purchase ETF shares (exchange-traded funds that invest in target assets) by paying in rubles at the current exchange rate.  The value of the share is fixed in currency.  In addition, as an alternative to bank deposits, you can invest in Euro funds with guaranteed returns of at least 8% per annum, which will help reduce the risk of losses from inflation and the devaluation of the ruble. </p><p>  IC Zerich Capital Management, reviews of which are more positive, offers a profitable commission.  It depends on the tariff plan chosen by the trader and the operation market.  It can be set both in a fixed amount in rubles per contract and as a percentage of the daily turnover or of the transaction volume (from 0.01% to 0.21% and from 0.35 to 10 rubles, respectively).  The minimum amount required to open an account is only 30,000 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Zerich Capital: reviews on the trading platform </h2><p>  Zerich provides Quik as the software for online transactions.  This is a system that allows you to track and conduct transactions (exchange and over-the-counter) either independently or with the help of a broker.  It has established itself as a product, perhaps with the highest data transfer speed and reliability. </p><p>  The program can be downloaded on the company's website.  According to reviews available at Zerich, the advantage of Quik is its unique multifunctionality, which covers almost all the nuances of working in the stock markets.  It allows you to both program your own tables and connect to various trading systems, track the dynamics of changes in indicators with a simultaneous brief analysis of these changes, gain access to several markets from one terminal, etc. </p>

    <h2>  International markets </h2><p>  As previously noted, Zerich clients have the opportunity to invest their funds in 25 countries on 100 sites.  These include NASDAQ, New York, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong and other exchanges in the USA, Canada, China, Mexico, Germany, Britain and many other countries. </p><p>  Operations with traders are available not only with any individual futures, stocks and options, but also with entire portfolios of various securities - all this is equally offered by Zerich.  Customer reviews often affect the conditions for transactions. </p><p>  As for tariffs, then: </p><p>  - as noted above, the minimum amount required to open an account is from 5,000 US dollars, </p><p>  - broker's remuneration - $ 0.005 per share if there is a turnover of more than 3 million shares per month or $ 0.5 per contract for 100,000 or more contracts per month (these tariffs are valid for US exchanges). </p><h2>  How is Zerich Capital Management (investment company) characterized? </h2><p>  Employee reviews suggest that the broker has a significant customer base and huge turnover.  He is constantly included in the top 10 MICEX, and this says a lot.  The service is always on top, as the selection of employees is very careful.  Negative comments are mainly associated with insufficient client skills in the field of trade and investment. </p><p>  Some negative reviews about “Zerich Capital Management” reviews are also related to the insufficiently good operation of the servers and their periodic freezes.  If you are not engaged in intraday trading, then such technical problems are not scary for you.  There are traders who make dozens of transactions per day.  The Zerich broker is not particularly suitable for such traders due to problems with periodic freezes. </p>

    <p>  Most of all, it is desirable for investors.  They simply will not notice some technical imperfections.  In Russia, a law is in force, according to which, in order to be able to purchase shares in foreign companies, you must comply with a set of requirements. </p><p>  Here is some of them: </p><p>  - possess assets in securities and financial instruments in an amount exceeding 6 million rubles; </p><p>  - have a certificate of a specialist in the financial market or a higher economic education; </p><p>  - the number of transactions with securities should be less than six per quarter and the total turnover of all these transactions should exceed 6 million rubles. </p><p>  It also requires experience in a company engaged in conducting operations with securities and comprising at least two or three years.  For an ordinary citizen, all this is too complicated, but outside the Russian Federation this law does not apply. </p><p>  The broker has a Russian registration, but it has subsidiary registration in Cyprus, so it is possible to circumvent this law.  Each client gets access to hundreds of exchanges located abroad.  Since 2004, Cyprus is no longer an <span>offshore zone.</span>  The regulators of the Zerich company are EU laws.  It is also regulated by CySec and MiFID. </p><h2>  How to start trading and investing? </h2><p>  To get started, you need to open an account.  This is done at the company’s offices or on the broker's website.  The minimum amount for a deposit is 30,000 rubles or 5,000 USD.  As reported by Zerich, there are no commissions for depositing and withdrawing money. </p><p>  When opening an account via the Internet, you need to fill out a form.  Name and surname must be written in Latin letters.  You need to scan your passport and attach it to the form during online registration.  Only two pages from a personal passport are needed: with a photo (main) and with registration.  Then a consultant will contact you and help you complete the registration process. </p>

It has a very convenient and simple interface.  To master it is not difficult.  This process does not require much effort, even if this is your first time doing online trading.  The program allows a trader to trade on operating systems such as iOS and Android.  This is an effective and fast trading in real time in an easily accessible, but at the same time high-tech format.  User-friendly interface is expressed in TCTI and TWS API for third-party developers. </p><h2>  Lite version of the trading platform </h2><p>  There is also a light version for deals on the go that supports the most common distributions of mobile operating systems.  With it, you can control risks in real time.
