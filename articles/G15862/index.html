  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modular Origami Crane</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  We offer a master class on creating three-dimensional <span>origami "crane</span> soaring in the air."  Before proceeding to the technique of folding sheets of paper, it is necessary to specify the number of such sheets and their color.  The uniqueness of modular origami lies in the fact that design allows you to convey the most fully features of the selected object. </p><p>  For work, we need paper in two colors: white and gray (black paper for the beak is not taken into account now).  From white paper we will make the tail and the inside of the wings.  And the use of the second color will be relevant for determining the wings and the long crane neck.  To make an origami crane model, 199 modules are needed.  The size of the finished product, the crane, directly depends on the size of these parts. </p><p>  In detail, it looks like this: the main white color will be needed for 112 modules, gray - for 85, and black - for 2 (beak).  In the classic version, only seven sheets of A4 paper are used, dividing each sheet into 32 equal parts.  The proportion of the use of the color palette 4: 3. </p><p>  How is each part assembled?  The collection is carried out in several stages.  First, fold the sheet in half, then another.  Now turn each half down from the center.  We turn the workpiece so that in front of us is a whole plane with two ends.  We bend these ends in a straight line of our triangular part so that there is a triangle in our hands.  Next, we form a pocket, from which we get a corner, hereinafter referred to as a module. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Everything is elementary, and the collection of origami "crane in flight" will not complicate even the novice creator.  Each action is due to the presence of only one plane.  Each individual part is fixed and projected on one side.  Oddly enough, but the assembly of the crane begins not from the head, but from the tail.  To assemble the first four rows, it is necessary to assemble one module for the first row, for the second - two and so on up to the fourth row. </p><p>  Starting from the fifth row, the ratio of the number of modules and rows varies.  Thus, the 5th row of the tail consists of 4 parts, the 6th row of 3, the 7th row of 2. That's all.  The tail of our crane is ready. </p><p>  After the tail, we proceed to the feathers for the wings.  To do this, you need to continue the 6th and 7th rows of the tail of the crane, first to the right and then to the left.  Further in the sixth and seventh rows we insert additional modules from the edges to begin the collection of wings.  Therefore, we take these series as the beginning and call them the 1st and 2nd, respectively. </p><p>  Change the color palette of origami paper cranes, collecting in the first row of the wing 10 parts, and in the second - 11. Similarly, we collect two more rows on the left. </p><p>  The next 23 modules will be needed for the third row of the wing.  4 and 3 modules are projected strictly in the center in the 4th and 5th rows.  Further, with white modules, we supplement the fourth and fifth rows, first to the right (9 + 10), and then to the left (9 + 10). <br>  It should focus on the most extreme modules of the 5th row.  After all, they are inserted not only in the 3rd, but also in the 4th row. </p><p>  The following steps according to the scheme: in the 6th row we use 22 modules.  In the 7th row - 23 modules.  As in the fifth row, here the extreme modules are inserted in the 6th and 5th rows. <br>  In order for the wings of our origami <span>"Japanese crane" to</span> take a sickle-shaped appearance, you need to insert the parts in the center closer to each other. </p><p>  In the 8th row, insert 4 modules.  The two central components form the beginning of the neck.  And the remaining two are distributed one at a time to the ends of the wings. <br>  Turn the workpiece over.  It remains to collect the head, beak and neck.  Let's start with the beak.  This is the most difficult and painstaking part of the work.  Take one module and add it as follows.  As in the beginning, to create a module, we do all the same work until we get a triangle.  After that, bend two halves down from the center so that the back side is a flat sheet.  After that, we bend in the center. </p><p>  Now connect the converted module to another, ordinary module. <br>  Here are the pockets in which you need to insert the following two modules. <br>  We connect the head with the neck.  And her, in turn, with the central modules of the wings.  That's all.  Our origami crane is ready to fly. </p>
