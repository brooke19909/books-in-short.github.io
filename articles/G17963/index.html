    <p>  Pension "Agatha" (Anapa) has its own dining room, where you can have breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Food is served on time, at 9 in the morning, at one in the afternoon and at seven in the evening.  Complex meals are offered.  Dishes to choose from.  Food quality depends on funding.  Women and children can get enough of the offered dishes.  Men are not always of such quantity.  Especially delicious here are pancakes, cheesecakes, cottage cheese casseroles.  It is better to enjoy meat dishes in other gastronomic establishments, which are not so few in Vityazevo.  For lunch in the dining room exhibit all kinds of dietary salads.  It is healthy and tasty. </p><p>  If you wish, you can go to other dining rooms, which are quite a lot in the village.  You can even visit the facilities located at other hotels.  Basically, they all work on a buffet system. </p><p>  However, the administration of the Agata boarding house strongly recommends purchasing food from them.  For breakfast, they are fed porridge, bread and butter, cheese and sausage.  Tea, coffee, packaged. </p><h2>  What's on the territory </h2>

    <p>  Ideal conditions are created for children here.  There is a playground.  You can take scooters and children's bicycles.  Being in the boarding house, you can inhale the healing air, saturated with aromas of needles.  Around everything just is buried in green spaces. </p><p>  I am glad that the boarding house is a bit far from the center of Vityazevo.  Cafes and restaurants located nearby try not to bother vacationers too much, so the music here only sounds until 22:00.  In the center, noisy festivities can last until three in the morning. </p><h2>  Path to the sea </h2>

    <p>  For guests, the pension offers its own beach, the path to which takes only five minutes.  Previously, there was a children's camp.  Many features of the beach area, adapted for children, are preserved today.  A shallow bottom is very convenient for swimming with young children. </p><p>  The beach is equipped with shade canopies, fountains with drinking water, sun loungers, toilets and locker rooms.  Rescuers are on duty around the clock. </p><p>  On the shore you can have some fun.  There are many attractions on the beach.  You can ride a catamaran, banana or paraglide.  Many are grateful for a great stay in Anapa.  Pension "Agatha" is one of the worthy pearls of this resort. </p><h2>  Advice to parents with children </h2><p>  Around the pension "Agatha" there are many hotels and children's camps, each of which has its own beach.  But it‚Äôs best to visit the coast exactly ‚ÄúAgatha‚Äù.  Firstly, it‚Äôs close, and secondly, a ‚Äútrade attack‚Äù can be avoided.  The fact is that on the road to the sea there are numerous stalls with children's toys.  Traders even put it all under their feet on the ground to breed more unhappy parents for money.  Children immediately react to numerous toys and throw tantrums in the hope that their parents will buy at least something.  Naturally, the prices at the resort are several times overstated, so sometimes it‚Äôs not even possible to please your baby with a new trinket. </p><h2>  Additional boarding house services </h2>
