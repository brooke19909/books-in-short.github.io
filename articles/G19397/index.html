  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Disability allowance.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Issues that are related to the lives of people with disabilities in our country have always been, are and remain one of the most pressing today.  The thing is that in this case, so that citizens of this category do not remain completely unprotected, it is necessary to properly understand all the laws that are adopted and agreed by the government of our country. </p><p>  The case, first of all, concerns such a question as the allowance for the disabled.  The first thing you should pay attention to when deciding this issue is who is considered to be a group of people with disabilities.  As you know, there are three degrees of <span>disability.</span>  <span>This is the</span> first, second and third.  The degree of disability is determined by the degree of disability resulting from any injuries or diseases.  Disability benefits will also depend on the group.  It is necessary to answer the question whether a person can serve himself, provide everything necessary, whether he can independently move and communicate with others.  If in this case children under the age of majority are considered, then they talk about children with disabilities who are entitled to benefits.  It is called an allowance for disabled children. </p><p>  If you read carefully the Federal Law adopted in November 1995, it becomes clear that the disability of the first group is established for a period of two years.  With regard to disabilities of the second and third groups, they have a term of up to one year. </p><p>  After this period, it is necessary to undergo a medical examination again.  But there are also diseases that require the so-called perpetual disability. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Disability allowance is granted on an indefinite basis in two cases.  Firstly, when it comes to the fact that a person has a disease, according to which it must be assigned for life.  Secondly, disability without a term is granted no later than four years from the date of its assignment, if no improvement is observed. </p><p>  The allowance plays a large role for people with disabilities, as they no longer have any other livelihoods, because they do not work.  An equally important issue is the question regarding the timing of the grant.  The age allowance will be assigned from the very day the application for its appointment was submitted.  Disability allowance will be assigned from the moment the <span>disability group is</span> established <span>.</span>  However, there is one peculiarity: the allowance will be paid less than three months before the day of direct application for it. </p><p>  <span>Benefit payments</span> are usually made for the current month.  If the recipient dies unexpectedly, then the benefit is paid in full until the month of his death.  The entire amount of the allowance, which was not timely claimed by the recipient, is paid for a period not exceeding three years before the moment of appeal. </p><p>  An important aspect is also the issue of obtaining preferential housing for persons with disabilities.  If we again turn to legislative acts, we can conclude that if people with disabilities, as well as families in which children with disabilities grow, are registered before January 2005, then they will receive so-called subventions, that is, funds that used to <span>improve housing conditions.</span>  At the same time, such a fact as the provision of housing at a given time, as well as the condition of the disabled person, is taken into account. </p><p>  Housing for such people and families is given on the basis of a contract of employment. </p><p>  If we talk about children with disabilities who are orphans or left without parental care, then they are entitled not only to disability benefits, but also a guarantee of providing living space as soon as they are eighteen years old.  However, living space will be given to them if they can service themselves. </p>
