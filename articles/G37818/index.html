    <p>  The border of the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve is 15 km from the resort, and the city of Adler is 42 km away.  On all sides, Krasnaya Polyana is surrounded <span>by the Mzymta River</span> and its tributaries - the Melnichniy stream and the Beshenka river, as well as high mountain ranges. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The resort has a mild, relatively warm mountain-sea climate.  In summer, the air temperature here can rise to + 38 ¬∞ C, and in winter days - drop to -22 ¬∞ C.  In December-March, snow with a depth of 50-150 cm covers the slopes of Rosa-Khutor GC. </p><p>  Reviews of employees and ski lovers say that the best month to stay at the resort is February - during this period the snow cover is quite sufficient, and severe frosts are already behind. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  In order to reach your destination, you can use almost any type of transport - by plane, train, bus or your own car.  In Adler there is an airport that accepts flights from different regions of the Russian Federation, the same applies to the railway station.

To do this, you can use, for example, an electric train that follows the route "Airport-Krasnaya Polyana".  This is especially convenient for those who have arrived in Adler by air, since you can immediately go to the railway station from the airport via a covered gallery and be there in an hour.

    <h2>  Equipment rental </h2><p>  Equipment rental points are located at the lower stations of the <span>cable cars</span> , so tourists can not take bulky ski equipment with them, but take it in place. </p><p>  Many vacationers live in cities from which Krasnaya Polyana (Rosa Khutor) is located quite far from.  Reviews of tourists note that employees of rental offices pay special attention to the selection of equipment for each person. </p><p>  In rental points, tourists are offered skiing, snowboarding, sports shoes, clothes and other equipment in a wide range.  Most of the equipment collections are made by such well-known companies as Rossignol, Volki, Salomon, Fisher, Berton.

The first is intended for use by entry-level skiers for skiing on medium difficulty trails.  And the second - for experienced athletes who prefer routes of higher than average difficulty, which are available in sufficient quantity at the Rosa Khutor GC.  Reviews about skiing tourists, using the quality equipment of local rental points, leave only positive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Lift pass: price and discounts </h2><p>  In the current ski season, the cost of ski passes ranges from 1,000 to 3,000 rubles during the First Snow period (until December 25), from 2,500 to 13,500 during the Peak period (December 26-10, 01), from 1,700 to 9,700 in the high season (11.01-31.03) and from 1,400 to 7,700 in the Spring Snow season (from 1.04).

    <p>  Tourists write <span>that such prices</span> for souvenirs, as in the local shops, have not been met either in Austria, or in France, or elsewhere.  The same goes for nutrition.  The average tourist can only afford to eat at McDonald's; in other cafes and restaurants, prices are similar to Moscow prices.  However, in all other aspects, the resort is called the best. </p>
