  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Details on how to disable the family filter in Yandex</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Previously, only a few had a computer.  The Internet appeared among our fellow citizens recently.  Modems are not considered, they could not be considered an Internet user, because they are incredibly slow, limited and often crashed, but now even children have access to the Internet, and even on the street.  But how to protect them from unwanted information?  There are many methods to solve this problem, but sometimes you want to disable this function if the necessary information is on an undesirable site.  Therefore, the topic of this article is about <span>how to disable the family filter</span> in Yandex.  But, in order. </p><h2>  What is the Yandex family filter?  Why is it needed? </h2><p>  Now it’s no secret that absolutely anyone can create a website, because every year computer technologies, including programming, are becoming more and more accessible to the masses.  But not all people are quite adequate.  It’s all because of the conditions for the growth of consciousness, and it differs incredibly strongly in each person.  If you search well, then the Internet will become for you a place that is much worse than any horror movie, because as everyone knows, a person is the worst thing that another person can meet.  Many companies struggle with inappropriate content on the Internet, including RosKomNadzor, which bans all sites left and right, but this is just a waste of time, because more than a million new web pages are created every day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.geek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yandex search engine" class="if uuid-2284090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64377/2284090.jpg"></div><p>  Fortunately, there are several search modes in the Yandex search engine: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Family.  Only the information in which there is no 18+ content or bad words, or sites that have already been registered with RosKomNadzor, is allowed to display the required information. </li><li>  Standard.  This is the mode that any search engine meets us.  Access to inappropriate content is only available if there is a specific request for it.  For example, when you request "red peppers", they will be provided to you, and not something else. </li><li>  No limits.  All information that only the search engine found is allowed. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, Yandex takes care of us even at the first acquaintance, however, <span>how to disable the family filter</span> in Yandex will be described in the next paragraph of this article.  By the way, the ways to turn the family filter on and off are identical to each other. </p><h2>  How to turn off the Yandex family filter? </h2><p>  If you use the same computer with a person under the age of 18, we strongly advise against this.  However, this method can sometimes help students, because in the "family" mode, sometimes you can’t see pages that for some reason are in the list of undesirable sites.  And all the same, that there was information, for example, about numerical methods.  The current system of blocking sites has many flaws that create such incidents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.linuxbabe.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yandex browser" class="if uuid-2284087" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64377/2284087.jpg"></div><p>  Instructions on how to disable the family filter in Yandex </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  First you need to enter something in the search for Yandex.  The main thing for us is to have a search page open, and not the main one. </li><li>  At the bottom of the page with the results there will be a button “Settings”, click on it. </li><li>  You will see many detailed settings, starting from the language, ending with the method of filtering pages that we need. </li><li>  Select the "No Limit" mode.  Now you will be provided with the full range of search for a given question. </li></ol><p>  If for some reason you want to change the filtering mode to the one you had before, then this is done in a similar way, and absolutely free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="motherboard.vice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yandex search" class="if uuid-2284094" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64377/2284094.jpg"></div><h2>  Other ways to protect against unwanted information </h2><p>  Many have heard about Addblock - this is a special extension for your browser that, thanks to its smart algorithms, prevents unwanted information from appearing in your search.  Also, this extension effectively fights with advertising, even on YouTube.  Installing the extension is very easy, you only need to go to your browser’s online store, then enter “Addblock” and install it.  In the upper right corner of the browser there will be a corresponding button showing the number of blocked elements per page - these numbers will surely surprise you. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  We hope that after reading this article you understand how to disable the family filter in Yandex.  After all, blocking Russian sites is not always logical, and the reason was not very significant, but the site was nevertheless included in the list of undesirable ones, which is why Yandex search algorithms circumvent its tenth way.  But not now that you know how to make them more global. </p>
