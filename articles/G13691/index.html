    <p>  Blonie Garden (Smolensk) is one of the most visited places in the city.  Both locals and guests love him.  Walking in the center of Smolensk, no one will pass by the Blonie Garden. </p><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  The pronunciation of the word "Blonie" clearly heard French tint.  Nevertheless, it is native Russian. </p><p>  Blonie Garden is one of the legendary historical sites of Smolensk, whose official opening dates back to the first half of the 19th century.  In those days, there was a parade ground in this place. </p><p>  The history of the name of this part of the city is pretty well studied by experts.  Scientists have found that the word "Blonie" is of Russian origin and means open space, the suburbs, the outskirts of the city.  Such an interpretation gives him Dahl's Explanatory Dictionary. </p><p>  In the old days, the area where Blonie‚Äôs garden is now located was simply an open space in front of the city walls.  During the defense of Smolensk it was used for firing from fortified ramparts.  In peacetime, the inhabitants here grazed cattle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is known that in the Smolensk region there are 20 villages and villages with names that reflect the word "blonie" or its derivatives.  Only the former Dukhovschinsky district has nine villages called Abolon.  Such a village appears in the former Porec district.  In Sychevsky district, they point to the village of Zabolon.  The name Obolensk is also known, mentioned among the ancient cities of Smolensk. </p><h2>  Blonie Garden (Smolensk): history </h2><p>  In the city, the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBlonie was in the XVI century.  In the <span>history of Smolensk, the</span> now famous throughout Russia garden fell in 1885.  At this time, the grand opening of the monument to the composer M.I. Glinka, which became one of the first monuments erected in the Russian Empire, took place here. </p><p>  At the end of World War II, a bronze sculpture of a deer and two lions was installed in Blonja, which were taken as trophies, according to historians, from Goering's dacha. </p><p>  In the XX century, at the end of the seventies, the composition of the Glinka monument was improved: speakers were placed nearby, through which it became possible to systematically broadcast fragments from the composer's works. </p><p>  In 2009, Blognier Garden changed its appearance for the umpteenth time: forged openwork lattices were installed in the corners of the park, which changed it somewhat.  In 2012, the city‚Äôs first light-music fountain was launched in the center of the garden. </p>

    <h2>  More details </h2><p>  The official year of the park is considered to be the 1830th.  It was at this time that the flat ground near the walls of the <span>Smolensk Fortress, which was</span> used as a bridgehead for the soldiers ‚Äôdrill, by the decree of Emperor Nicholas I began to be converted into a garden.  The then governor of the Smolensk region Nikolay Ivanovich Khmelnitsky supervised the construction.  A senior official took an active part in planting trees, in addition, attracted subordinates to this campaign. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1830, the parade ground parade was moved to the Royal Bastion.  Now at this place is the stadium "Spartak". </p><p>  The governor and officials planted trees with their own hands.  Since then, among the local ladies, it has become fashionable to plant flower beds in their own gardens. </p><p>  The garden was opened in 1885, at the same time as the monument was erected to the great fellow countryman of the Smolyan - <span>composer Glinka.</span>  Money from the townspeople collected for him for 15 years. </p><p>  Nikolai Khmelnitsky is still remembered as the city governor, who is not indifferent to the aspirations of the inhabitants.  His merits are: </p><ul><li>  opening of the first provincial library; </li><li>  organization of manufactory and craft exhibitions; </li><li>  construction of new and repair of old stone and wooden houses; </li><li>  paving stone and rubble of streets, reconstruction of bridges. </li></ul><p>  But the loan received from the king, of 1 million rubles to the spiteful critics and envious people, did not give rest.  Slander and denunciations were carried on the governor unlike the others, who in the end did their job.  By the will of the sovereign, the Smolensk governor was entrusted to the casemates of the Peter and Paul Fortress. </p><p>  And yet history knows that it is thanks to Nikolai Khmelnitsky that the townspeople and guests of the city have a happy opportunity, relaxing, unhurriedly walking along the beautiful alleys, with slender rows of lanterns installed on their sides, sitting on cozy benches and reflect on something good. </p>

    <p>  For this, Smolensk was chosen by chance - the birthplace of the great composer is the village of Novospasskoye (Yelninsky district).  The author of the monument was a famous sculptor - A.R. von Bock.  For the creation of the monument for 15 years, voluntary donations were collected.  In May 1885, the monument was unveiled in the presence of many famous cultural figures and with a huge gathering of people. </p><p>  The composer is depicted with his back to the music stand.  The symbolism of this pose is that Glinka was not only the conductor of the orchestra, but above all the composer.  An interesting and surprising detail for many is that the coat on the figure of a musician is made for some reason in a feminine manner: the buttons on it are on the left, and it is wraped on the right side. </p><p>  A cast-iron fence around the monument (in the form of a musical staff) was cast according to the project of academician I. S. Bogomolov.  On it froze forever cast-iron musical notes of excerpts from the composer's works: the operas Prince Kholmsky, Ruslan and Lyudmila, Ivan Susanin and others. Hourly world-famous works sound from the speakers. </p><h2>  Deer statue </h2><p>  After the Great Victory, three more statues were installed in the garden - the famous bronze deer and two lions. </p><p>  Smolensk deer are considered a peculiar symbol of good luck: if you make a wish and rub a monument, the hidden one will certainly come true.  There are always too many people who want to check the legend, so the monument had to be restored several times.  The statue of a deer for more than a hundred years, it was erected in honor of the hunting trophies of King of Prussia William II near the chapel. </p>

    <p>  The origins of the history of this sculptural work go back to 1909.  <span>Kaiser Wilhelm</span> II in the vicinity of his possessions in Romintenskaya Pushcha was shot by a deer with unusual branching horns.  The animal shocked the ruler so much that he commanded to immortalize him in bronze.  In 1910, the sculpture, created one and a half times larger than the original, was installed at the chapel of St.  Hubert. </p><p>  From there, the sculpture suddenly disappeared.  Soon she was discovered at the cottage of one of the leaders of the Third Reich Hermann Goering.  From here, the work was taken out by the Red Army.  A sign with the date of its creation and the surname of the sculpture - Richard Frize is installed near the deer in Smolensk Park.  On the side of the monument there is an inscription that says that it is a gift to the children of Smolensk from East Prussia from the guards of the N-corps. </p><h2>  Lions </h2><p>  Near the statue of a deer are two small sculptural images of lions.  Near them people like to gather, musicians often play. </p>
