Such practice was especially relevant at the very beginning of the 2000s.  Lending was a real salvation for those who wanted to buy a TV, refrigerator or even a car. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ladyshop.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Calculator and money" class="if uuid-2300236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2300236.jpg"></div><p>  However, sooner or later you have to pay for any service.  The same thing happens with loans.  By the time of the initial repayment of the loan, most people simply forget about their obligations and successfully fall into the black lists of banking institutions.  Unfortunately, even if the client repaid the existing debt, but did not pay the necessary part of the amount of money on time, the bank's trust in such a borrower is significantly reduced.  This leads to the fact that in the future it will be very difficult for the client to receive even the minimum amount of money in any large financial organization.  This phenomenon is called "bad credit history."  Unfortunately, many are unaware of its existence and are genuinely surprised when the bank refuses them a loan. </p><p>  Is it really impossible to get a loan with bad credit history?  Of course, there are no hopeless situations.  However, you need to understand that in this case you will have to spend a lot of effort to prove your financial viability to the bank.  Let us consider in more detail what to do if you need a loan, and a bad credit history becomes a rather serious obstacle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Prove your innocence </h2><p>  If after the last loan processing the client was blacklisted, then this is not a reason to despair.  First of all, it is necessary to confirm the fact that payments were not made on time due to serious circumstances. </p><p>  For example, if a client wants to take out a loan with bad credit history in one bank, then he can provide documents that confirm that he was in the hospital at the time of paying the loan in another financial institution, and therefore physically could not make the necessary amount of money to the account. </p><p>  Airplane tickets and confirmation from work on business trips are also significant evidence. </p><div class="photo" data-original="humanities.tau.ac.il" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Contract signing" class="if uuid-2300245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2300245.jpg"></div><p>  Also, those who want to take a loan with bad credit history should carefully prepare before going to the bank.  In order to inspire confidence in the inspector, you must take with you all the documents that confirm the financial stability of the client.  To do this, you can prepare a certificate of employment indicating salary and length of service, receipts for the purchase of large household appliances, payment receipts for housing and communal services and more.  Additionally, you can ask the boss to write a positive profile.  All these documents can help in obtaining a new loan, even if the old one was repaid in violation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Refinancing </h2><p>  If you have a loan that has already pretty much "tarnished" the borrower's reputation, but still remains unpaid until the end, it is worth considering refinancing.  In this case, you can contact another bank and arrange a new debt to pay off the old one.  In this case, the chance of rejection is minimized, and the person‚Äôs credit history becomes more attractive to future lenders. </p><p>  However, in this case, you need to carefully calculate your capabilities.  If the second loan is paid in arrears, then after that it will be almost impossible to take out a loan with bad credit history.  Therefore, refinancing is not recommended to everyone. </p><h2>  Credit Deletion Application </h2><p>  This is possible if you contact the Central Bank directly.  However, in this case, you can count on the success of the event only if the loan was not completely past due.  If the client had significant reasons for breach of contractual relations, then there is a chance to clear his financial biography. </p><div class="photo" data-original="academyforinvinciblehealers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank loan" class="if uuid-2300238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2300238.jpg"></div><p>  However, you need to understand that an application for a loan with a bad credit history and a statement from a client who, according to documents and databases, did not register loans earlier anywhere, are approximately the same thing.  Banks are reluctant to issue funds to customers about whom there is no data.  Therefore, it is worth considering several times before sending such a request to the Central Bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Very bad credit history: which bank will give a loan </h2><p>  Today, there are several financial organizations that are ready to provide loans to people who are already on the black list of banking institutions. </p><p>  For example, you can contact the "Post Bank".  This relatively new financial institution is quite willing to lend to people who had previously paid arrears.  In this case, you can count on a loan for 5 years.  However, one must be prepared for the fact that the amount of overpayment can be from 14.9 to 34.5% per annum.  This scatter is explained by the circumstances in which the client could be in the <span>black list of banks.</span>  If it is not credible, then the financial institution will want to protect its assets by raising the credit rate. </p><p>  A slightly lower percentage can be obtained at Renaissance Credit.  Here you can get a loan with a bad credit history at 15-20% per annum.  You should also familiarize yourself with the offers of City Bank. </p><h2>  Under what conditions the bank will definitely not give a loan </h2><p>  If the client not only overdue the payment, but also opened a lawsuit against him, then in this case the chances of getting a loan again in serious financial institutions are reduced to zero.  The same applies to those who have not made a single payment on the previous loan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="leveraged1.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Money bag" class="if uuid-2300254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2300254.jpg"></div><p>  Which bank will give a loan with bad credit history if the client has not paid a single debt, but several?  No respectable financial institution will take a risk in such a situation.  However, do not despair.  You can always try to get a loan with a bad credit history in the MFI.  Today there are a lot of these organizations. </p><h2>  Microloan in MFIs </h2><p>  Microfinance organizations are distinguished by the fact that in order to obtain a loan from customers they do not require a wide range of documents confirming their solvency.  In MFIs, loans with bad credit history are most often issued without reference.  At the same time, employees of microfinance organizations rarely pay attention to previous payments by people. </p><p>  However, it should be borne in mind that in this case we are talking about minimum loans that are provided for a very short period of time.  You can only consider lending to MFIs from the point of view to straighten your payment history a little.  After successful repayment of the debt, a positive inscription will appear in the person‚Äôs file.  Then it will be possible to try to contact larger financial organizations. </p><h2>  Where to issue </h2><p>  If we talk about where you can get such a mini loan with a passport with a bad credit history, then you can find hundreds of organizations of this type.  For example, you can apply for an E-loan.  In this MFI, you can get an instant loan at 1.5% per day for a month.  However, it is better to repay such a loan as quickly as possible, since the overpayment is quite impressive if you stretch the pleasure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diepresse.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transfer of money" class="if uuid-2300243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2300243.jpg"></div><p>  Slightly less can be overpaid at Smsfinans.  In this case, customers are offered microloans at 0.9% per day.  In this case, funds can be obtained for a period of 21 days. </p><h2>  Requirements </h2><p>  To get a loan with a bad credit history without information, you need to meet just a few requirements.  First of all, the borrower must be a citizen of the Russian Federation at least 18 years old.  Additionally, you will need to provide a contact phone number.  After that, the client will be provided with a loan within a few minutes. </p><p>  If we talk about large banks, then in this case there is an option to try to get a loan with a bad credit history on bail.  In this case, it will be necessary to indicate movable or immovable property, which in case of failure to pay the debt will be sold, and the proceeds of the money used to pay the loan.  There is another option that will help in obtaining cash.  For example, you can get a loan with a bad credit history with a guarantor.  In this case, the whole responsibility for non-payment of the debt lies with the other person.  Hence the rather obvious problems of processing such loans.  Few would agree to be responsible for paying the debt of another person. </p><div class="photo" data-original="agora.md" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loan money" class="if uuid-2300235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2300235.jpg"></div><p>  From this point of view, it is more convenient to issue a microloan, clear the payment history, and after that apply to a more serious financial institution for a loan. </p><h2>  Documents </h2><p>  To obtain a loan from the bank, provided that the previous loan was still paid, but with delays, an extended list of securities will be required.  First of all, you must provide an official certificate from the place of work, where the length of the borrower and his monthly salary will be indicated.  In addition, a copy of the work book and an indication of the contact phone number of the chief, who is most likely to be called by a bank representative, will be required to verify the veracity of the data provided. </p><p>  If we talk about MFIs, then in this case there will be enough passports and applications.  However, before signing the contract, it is worth studying it in detail.  There are frequent cases when such documents indicated completely different amounts and rates.  Therefore, in case of doubt, it is better to contact another MFI. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shutterstock.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Contract study" class="if uuid-2300247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2300247.jpg"></div><h2>  How much can you expect </h2><p>  If we are talking about a bank and obtaining a loan on bail, then everything directly depends on how much the property of the borrower will be valued.  The same applies to situations when a loan is issued with a surety.  A comrade or relative will have to provide documents confirming his solvency, on the basis of which the amount of money will be calculated.  As a rule, banks issue loans from 20 thousand, rubles to several million. </p><p>  If we are talking about MFIs, then in this case it is worth counting on more modest amounts.  The client can receive from 1 thousand rubles to a maximum of 60 thousand. </p><h2>  How to restore credit standing </h2><p>  First and foremost, it is important to pay off all existing debts, if any.  After this, you need to be prepared for the fact that not a single large bank will immediately decide to provide a large sum of money.  Therefore, you can go the other way.  First of all, it is necessary to open a deposit in a financial institution that can be replenished.  At the next stage, it is necessary to start making payments through an open account so that the bank can record the receipt of certain amounts of cash. </p><p>  After that, you can try to open a credit card in the same bank.  In the process of its use, delays in payments should not be allowed.  Such procedures must be performed for at least two years.  After that, you can safely apply for a more impressive loan. </p><p>  After checking the data, the bank employee will make sure that the client is really able to pay debts in a timely manner.  This will allow you to forget about the negative credit history.  However, this procedure for returning financial reputation takes a lot of time.  But if over time the client wants to get a mortgage or car loan, then this is the surest way. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  <span>Whether a loan with a bad credit history will be given</span> depends on many factors.  However, there is always a risk that a bank employee will be confused by a previous outstanding debt.  Particularly thorough checks are carried out if it is a mortgage or other large loans.  In order not to rack your brains once again, it is best to make payments on time. </p><p>  Also, do not trust individuals and organizations that claim that for a certain amount of money they can clear any person‚Äôs credit history.  It should be understood that these are just scammers.  To clear the history of your payments, you can only personally contact the Central Bank.  Therefore, do not waste time and money on scams. </p>
