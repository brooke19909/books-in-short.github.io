At the same time, the establishment of tax rates and benefits for the corresponding accrual remains for each region separately.  Next, we will talk about what kind of transport tax in Krasnoyarsk.  The information presented to you will help to understand how to calculate and pay the tax charge for transport in 2019.  What is recommended for everyone to remember? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drivenn.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much to pay for a car in the Krasnoyarsk Territory" class="if uuid-3205644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3205644.jpg"></div><h2>  Who pays </h2><p>  Who should pay the appropriate tax?  It is charged, as has already been said, for finding a car or other vehicle to be registered in authorized services in the ownership of a person.  This means that the owner of the movable property will have to pay. </p><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter what kind of person the owner is - physical or legal.  Who owns a motor vehicle, therefore, must pay in the manner prescribed by law. </p><h2>  Local benefits - full exemption </h2><p>  Is transport tax paid by pensioners in the Krasnoyarsk Territory?  And those with many children or others requiring state support?  To correctly answer the relevant questions, you need to refer to regional legislation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among the local transport tax benefits in the Krasnoyarsk Territory are: </p><ul><li>  full exemption from payment; </li><li>  discount in various sizes. </li></ul><p>  At the same time, they can completely not pay: </p><ul><li>  veterans and the disabled, their widows; </li><li>  adoptive parents or other legal representatives of children with disabilities under 18 years of age; </li><li>  military or internal organs personnel injured in execution; </li><li>  irradiated during accidents at the Mayak or Chernobyl, during tests in Semipalatinsk; </li><li>  disabled people (1 or 2 groups); </li><li>  FE engaged in agricultural production; </li><li>  manufacturers of products for the disabled, as well as those who sell it; </li><li>  organizations of persons with disabilities; </li><li>  budget organizations financed from the regional budget. </li></ul><p>  Also, pensioners who own a vehicle of up to 100 horsepower can not pay for a car.  And who is eligible for the discount? </p><h2>  Discounts for taxpayers </h2><p>  The transport tax <span>in the Krasnoyarsk Territory</span> also provides for the possibility of providing a discount of 90% of the tax charge.  But who is eligible for this benefit? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drivenn.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible not to pay vehicle tax" class="if uuid-3205647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3205647.jpg"></div><p>  Today it is: </p><ul><li>  pensioners with cars up to 150 liters.  with., motorcycles and scooters - up to 40 liters.  with., water transport - up to 100 "horses"; </li><li>  citizens and entrepreneurs who raise and live together with three or more minor children. </li></ul><p>  There is nothing difficult to remember this information.  However, it is also worth noting that the transport tax in the Krasnoyarsk Territory also provides for federal benefits.  What are you talking about? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  At the federal level </h2><p>  The thing is that some vehicles are exempt from taxation, regardless of where they are registered.  Only not everyone knows when to take advantage of the relevant benefits. </p><p>  At the moment, they do not pay at the federal level for: </p><ul><li>  public transport; </li><li>  vehicles for special services; </li><li>  boats with a motor no more than 5 horsepower; </li><li>  rowing boats; </li><li>  agricultural transport; </li><li>  transport intended for the transport of goods and passengers; </li><li>  a car belonging to the disabled or used for their transportation; </li><li>  cars purchased with the support of social services, if they do not exceed the capacity of 100 "horses". </li></ul><p>  Nor do vessels that have been entered in the register of the Russian Federation provide for taxation.  For other vehicles you have to pay in the manner prescribed by law. </p><h2>  Preparation for calculations </h2><p>  We have already studied the benefits of transport tax in Krasnoyarsk.  We will find out later how to arrange them.  First you have to understand how to calculate, pay and check the tax on the vehicle. </p><p>  The formula for calculating tax on a car in Krasnoyarsk is used exactly the same as in other cities of the country.  A citizen will need: </p><ol><li>  Get the quotient from dividing the months of vehicle ownership in the year by 12. </li><li>  Multiply the tax rate on engine power, and then on the quotient of the division obtained in advance according to the principle proposed above. </li><li>  If necessary, multiply the resulting amount by the coefficient of tax increase on vehicles.  This is necessary when it comes to luxury cars. </li></ol><p>  Perhaps this is all.  This formula is used to calculate the transport tax in Krasnoyarsk and other regions of the Russian Federation in relation to individuals.  Organizations use an advanced formula. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ldk1.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The formula for transport tax in the Russian Federation" class="if uuid-3205648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3205648.jpg"></div><p>  To do this, the previously obtained figure must be multiplied by the organization‚Äôs share in the ownership of the movable object, and then, if necessary, deduct the benefits. </p><h2>  Payment time </h2><p>  What is the time to pay the transport tax in the Krasnoyarsk Territory?  At the moment, organizations in the respective region make advance payments.  They are made at the end of each reporting period - 1, 2 and 3 quarters.  Moreover, payments must be made no later than the end of the month following the end of the quarter. </p><p>  With individuals, everything is much simpler.  The thing is that the transport tax in Krasnoyarsk is paid until the first of December.  And no later than that.  The next day, the delay in tax accrual will begin. </p><h2>  If not pay </h2><p>  What will be the consequences of the resulting tax overdue?  They depend on the specific case. </p><p>  If tax delinquency is allowed unintentionally, a twenty percent penalty is imposed, otherwise a forty percent penalty.  From the first day of delay in tax, a penalty will be calculated, and as soon as the amount of debt reaches significant amounts (from three thousand), the case can be transferred to the bailiffs.  Where it leads? </p><p>  Bailiffs can arrest and sell the property of the debtor for debts (not only in taxes), as well as block bank cards.  The debtor is also often barred from leaving Russia. </p><h2>  Tax rates </h2><p>  Below you can see the transport tax rates in Krasnoyarsk.  They are relevant today, but may change at any time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Transport tax rates in Krasnoyarsk" class="if uuid-3205645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3205645.jpg"></div><p>  That is why it is better to specify tax rates in authorized bodies before calculating tax on vehicles.  Then the probability of a mistake will be minimal. </p><h2>  The procedure for applying for benefits </h2><p>  The procedure and deadlines for paying transport tax in the Krasnoyarsk Territory need to know.  But it is also important to remember how to properly apply for vehicle tax benefits.  This with timely preparation will be a fairly simple task. </p><p>  To achieve the desired goal, a citizen or organization requires: </p><ol><li>  Prepare documents for further maintenance. </li><li>  Fill in the application of the established form for the appointment of the prescribed benefits. </li><li>  Submit an application to the selected authorized body.  We are talking about the Federal Tax Service at the place of registration of transport. </li><li>  Wait a while. </li></ol><p>  If everything is done correctly, the applicant will be granted a car tax exemption.  Otherwise, this will be denied. </p><h2>  Help calculator </h2><p>  It is better not to carry out independent calculations of the transport tax in Krasnoyarsk.  The thing is that they can be wrong.  For safety, it is recommended to use special online calculators. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.province.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax Code and transport tax" class="if uuid-3205642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3205642.jpg"></div><p>  The most reliable and reliable is the service from the Tax Service of Russia.  To use it, you need to do the following: </p><ol><li>  Find the Tax Calculator service on the website of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation, and then open it. </li><li>  Select the "Transport tax" option. </li><li>  Set the values ‚Äã‚Äãin the form that appears to help calculate the amount due. </li><li>  Submit a processing request. </li></ol><p>  Fast, easy and very convenient.  This technique will exempt from the need to clarify tax rates for calculating the transport tax in the end.  The corresponding calculator works in all regions of the country. </p><p>  Important: the service is provided free of charge. </p><h2>  About debt verification methods </h2><p>  Transport tax for large families in Krasnoyarsk, as already noted, is absent.  But every taxpayer must know how to check whether he has certain debts.  And for the car as well. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.malyi-biznes.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Calculation and payment of tax on a car" class="if uuid-3205646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3205646.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, to achieve the corresponding goal, you can: </p><ul><li>  go to the FSSP, Federal Tax Service or MFC with a request; </li><li>  use the e-government website of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  use the site "Payment of public services"; </li><li>  ‚Äúpunch‚Äù data on the website of the Federal Service of Bailiffs; </li><li>  check information on the website of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation (in your account); </li><li>  work with online banking or electronic payment systems. </li></ul><p>  On third-party websites, it is not recommended to use tax debt verification services.  This is an extremely risky step - you can be left without money and with false data. </p><h2>  How can I pay </h2><p>  Pay taxes also need to be able to.  Otherwise, the information offered to attention will lose all meaning - a person will know how much he owes to the state, but he can not do anything about it. </p><p>  You can pay taxes by almost all of the above methods of checking debts.  An exception is the FSSP website.  Additionally, you can deposit funds into the state treasury: </p><ul><li>  through cash desks of financial organizations; </li><li>  through payment terminals; </li><li>  using ATM. </li></ul><p>  Next, we consider the process of finding tax debts, as well as their repayment in more detail.  This information is useful not only to residents of the Krasnoyarsk Territory. </p><h2>  "Public services" to help </h2><p>  The public services web portal is very popular among the population of the Russian Federation.  In Krasnoyarsk and other cities of the country, using this site, citizens can receive various municipal and state services.  Say, register the vehicle, register the rights and check taxes. </p><p>  To successfully cope with the relevant tasks, you must first register for ESIA, and then go through the account activation procedure.  We assume that these conditions have already been met. </p><p>  Then, to check through the State Services in Krasnoyarsk the debts on the tax on the vehicle, you have to: </p><ol><li>  Log into your account and open an archive of available options. </li><li>  Find the function "Check your taxes." </li><li>  Indicate taxpayer TIN. </li><li>  Click on the button responsible for starting the scan of the FTS database. </li></ol><p>  Now you need to carefully study the proposed list.  We should be interested in blocks with the signature "Transport tax". </p><div class="photo" data-original="gosuslugi.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Checking transport taxes in Krasnoyarsk" class="if uuid-3205643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3205643.jpg"></div><p>  To pay, you need to select it, and then press the "Go to payment" button.  An electronic form will appear on the screen, in which you have to choose the method of depositing funds into the state treasury, as well as register the payment details. </p><p>  Important: there is no fee for such a payment.  The funds will go to the Federal Tax Service within a few days. </p>
