On its territory, a wonderful climate reigns, which attracts the attention of vacationers.  They also enjoy visiting local attractions and exploring the culture of the multinational population of the peninsula. </p><p>  Often, tourists prefer to go here to relax with their families.  Where in Crimea is it better to relax with children?  Where to go and what to see?  What features is this type of holiday famous for, and which beaches of Crimea are most suitable for families with children?  About all this further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="qha.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where in Crimea it is better to relax with children" class="if uuid-2300228" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2300228.jpg"></div><h2>  Features for families with children </h2><p>  What should be considered when arranging holidays with children in Crimea?  In the reviews, many tourists often share their comments on this subject.  They say that, on the whole, this peninsula is a great place for spending summer time here, the climate and surrounding nature are quite favorable therefor.  However, of course, all tourists should pay attention to some points, choosing a vacation option. </p><p>  When arranging a vacation with children in the Crimea, one should especially responsibly approach the choice of an area for living.  Experienced family tourists recommend the east, south and west coast of the peninsula and not the central part of it for families with a child, since it is quite problematic and long to get from the cities located far from the coastline with a child in the company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the nuances associated with the choice of the type of housing for living, parents who have previously had a rest with their child recommend turning their attention to motels and boarding houses, where three meals a day are provided.  In the event that you have a very small child in your arms, you should give preference to the private sector, where, as a rule, there is the possibility of self-cooking - it will certainly be fresh and made from the necessary products. </p><p>  When choosing a place of rest with children in Crimea, it is necessary to take into account the fact that in some cases you should give your preference to hotels, boarding houses and sanatoriums that have a private beach, which is closed for visiting by unauthorized persons.  This is especially true during the peak holiday season, which occurs in July and August.  This observation is connected with the fact that during this period it is very difficult to find a normal free place on a public beach.  Some tourists generally recommend that parents arrange a family vacation in the company of a child in mid-September - at this time there are not many people in the resorts, and the weather allows you to stay at sea for at least a day. </p><p>  So where is the best vacation with children in Crimea?  In the reviews of tourists, individual resorts are often mentioned, as well as the advantages and their disadvantages.  Further we will consider the most popular regions. </p><h2>  Theodosius </h2><p>  This resort is located in the southeastern part of the peninsula and is considered one of the best places for organizing children's vacations in the Crimea.  In the summer, favorable weather prevails in this region. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are a large number of excellent beaches, the total length of which is more than 20 kilometers.  All of them are clean, covered with soft sand and quite small, with a gradual descent into the sea.  This factor must certainly be taken into account by tourists at the time of organizing holidays with children in Crimea.  In addition to the magnificent beaches, there is beautiful nature and very fresh air, which is valuable not only for children, but also for adults. </p><p>  Where can I spend time with my child, relaxing in Feodosia?  First of all, you should pay attention to the possibility of taking walks along the city's promenade.  It always has a large amount of entertainment, as well as urban musicians.  From the promenade you can watch the beautiful port, in which large ships regularly arrive. </p><p>  A family trip to the Nemo Dolphinarium, where there are dolphin therapy courses and regular performances, will be very exciting.  It is located on the Golden Beach, which is located in the direction of the Kerch highway. </p><p>  In addition to the dolphinarium, tourists are very fond of visiting the water park located in the direction of Koktebel.  It offers attractions for vacationers, both for adults and for children.  In addition to them, there is a large sauna and several jacuzzis with hydromassage. </p><p>  As for the hotels that are most suitable for families with young tourists, among them are the "Scarlet Sails", the guest house "Sefa" and the sanatorium "Health".  In each of these places there are playgrounds, animation and a separate meal for babies is offered. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="visittoukraine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Crimea with children reviews" class="if uuid-2300225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2300225.jpg"></div><h2>  Zander </h2><p>  Another city in the Crimea, where it is better to relax with children, is Sudak.  People often come here with young tourists, not only because the settlement is small in size and has a beautiful, clean nature, but also because all the shores of Sudak are rather shallow, so they quickly warm up, and the water temperature is maintained at a high level for a long time .  There are practically no waves near the coast of the city. </p><p>  It is in Sudak that the best yarns of Crimea are for relaxing with children.  All of them have a certain feature, which is a gray color, provided due to the warm and safe fine pebble coating.  The beginning of the beach season here is very early, and it lasts quite a long time - for 138 days. </p><p>  As for entertainment, while in Sudak, you can visit the interesting <span>Genoese Helmet</span> festival with your child <span>,</span> which is held every year from July to August.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe small village of New World, located on the outskirts of Sudak, there is a large and well-equipped water park, as well as the famous Tsar's Beach, which is considered one of the best on the peninsula. </p><p>  As for the choice of hotels and pensions, when thinking about where in the Crimea it is better to relax with children, you should pay attention to the Zvezdny and Sudak pensions, which have their own beaches, playgrounds, as well as separate game rooms.  Also noteworthy is the hotel "Soldaya", which is classified as a luxury.  It is in his address that tourists often leave a large number of positive comments that speak of excellent service, the availability of an ideal clean beach with lots of equipment and entertainment, as well as special conditions for children and families. </p><h2>  New World </h2><p>  This settlement is a small village, which is quite inconspicuous among tourists.  However, in vain, since the best holidays in Crimea with children can be organized here. </p><p>  The New World is located next to Sudak and is washed by the waters of the same shallow small bay, which is part of the Black Sea.  The peculiarity of this settlement is that its coast (Tsarsky beach) is washed by the waters of three colors, provided due to the different depths of the reservoir.  According to tourists, the water here is clean, the beaches are gentle and very warm, and the nature is truly magnificent.  All these qualities inherent in the village make it an ideal place for a better vacation with children in Crimea. </p><p>  Around the New World there are a huge number of legends associated with pirates - no doubt, it will be very interesting to listen to both adults and children who come to rest with their parents. </p><p>  As for the organization of a place to live in this village, it is better to give preference to the private sector somewhere in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGreen Bay.  It is its coast that is completely covered with fine and very soft sand, which will positively affect the health of both the child and adults. </p><h2>  Koktebel </h2><p>  The city of Koktebel, which is also located on the Crimean coast, attracts a lot of tourists' attention.  It is famous for its active life, as well as regularly held festivals and holidays, in which it will definitely be interesting to participate both for children and adults.  The location of the beaches of Koktebel in a quiet bay, where there are practically no waves, as well as a gradual hundred-meter descent into the sea makes it an ideal place for families with children in Crimea.  In the reviews of tourists very often it is said about the ideal beaches of the village - they are all covered with sand and quite warm. </p><p>  In the city you can visit several interesting places, among which travelers often highlight Kara-Dag, as well as the famous Golden Gate, a historical monument from the time of the horde.  In these areas, you can also search for real treasures - by doing this, kids can feel like real gold diggers.  No less interesting places will be Dinoterium and the Karadag Natural Museum. </p><p>  What are the <span>best Crimea hotels</span> for families with children in Koktebel?  First of all, you should pay attention to the hotel "Villa Classic".  Despite the fact that it is small in size, this place has excellent conditions for families with children, including a closed territory, playground, as well as beautiful nature.  Also, the Tropical Wave boarding house is considered to be a great place to relax, where there are a couple of separate pools for the child, an outdoor area for entertainment and games, a games room, as well as the possibility of organizing a free transfer to the picturesque city beach, which also has a lot of children's entertainment.  The hotel has its own shoreline area, which is completely covered with clean and very soft sand, and also has a gentle slope into the sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="caravansbythesea.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best vacation in Crimea with children" class="if uuid-2300255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2300255.jpg"></div><h2>  Yalta </h2><p>  Where in Crimea is it better to relax with children?
