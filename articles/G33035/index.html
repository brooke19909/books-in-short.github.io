    <p>  "National" (hotel, Moscow) is an operating museum that receives its guests in unique interiors.  At the dawn of creation, the distinguished guests of the last Russian emperor and many representatives of the reigning European dynasties stayed in it. </p><p>  After the 1917 revolution, the National Hotel (Moscow), whose history has truly legendary milestones, turned into a place where many members of the Soviet government lived for a short period of time.  There were Lenin, Dzerzhinsky and Trotsky.  Subsequently, the building was transformed into the House of Soviets and became a hostel for the Soviet nomenclature. </p><p>  During the Second World War, this hotel served as a residence for sixteen foreign embassies and diplomatic missions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical interiors </h2><p>  Among the items that can be seen in the interior of the National, there are personally owned by the Romanovs royal family and well-preserved to date furniture sets and many works of art transferred here from Tsarskoye Selo and Anichkov palaces. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="National Moscow Hotel reviews" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/582403.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <p>  The National Hotel (Moscow), reviews of which note the unique atmosphere prevailing here, cannot be compared with any other world hotel.  She has the highest level of highly artistic interior, in which valuable pieces of furniture and decor, as well as rare examples of painting and applied art, have found their place.  The hotel is recognized worldwide as a place where famous statesmen, heads of major international organizations and representatives of science and art prefer to stay. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel National <span>(Moscow, address:</span> 15/1 Mokhovaya) is located in the historical center of the capital, near the Kremlin.  Its building occupies the corner of Tverskaya and Mokhovaya streets and is one of the important components of the architectural component of <span>Manezhnaya Square.</span> </p><p>  Every Muscovite or guest in the capital, anyone who has ever visited the Kremlin walls, must have seen a six-story building, built in the Art Nouveau style, which is distinguished by its unique external decoration.  The National Hotel involuntarily stops looking at itself. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The location of the hotel was chosen very well.  You do not need to travel long to visit the Bolshoi Theater, walk around the <span>Alexander Garden</span> or walk along the embankments of the capital.  Any of these places are a five minute walk.  From the nearby metro station, you can quickly get to the Tretyakov Gallery or Chistye Prudy, Old or New Arbat, to Moscow City, many of the largest shopping centers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel National Moscow Address" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/582399.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  From the Sheremetyevo Airport, the National Hotel (Moscow) is thirty-two kilometers distant, and Vnukovo and Domodedovo are a little further.  As for <br>  railway stations, any of them can be reached by subway in a maximum of fifteen minutes. </p><h2>  Restoration </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the National Hotel was used as a hostel of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee for a long time, most of its interiors and furniture became unusable, and engineering communications also wore out.  Therefore, the building was overhauled.  The appearance of the hotel has changed: the lower floors, which were faced with granite and red brick, were repainted, aluminum frames replaced the oak frames, and instead of a majolica panel, an industrial landscape was created on the corner attic. </p><h2>  Prices </h2>

Therefore, the hotel turned into a kind of museum, and this immediately affected the cost of living.  Even foreigners could not afford to settle in hotel rooms.

    <p>  I must say that before the revolution, the cost of living in the "National" was not low.  She ranged from one and a half to twenty-five rubles per day.  For comparison, I must say that at the beginning of the last century, doctors and Zemstvo teachers received a lower salary, which, moreover, was considered a good income. </p><p>  Today, the most modest hotel room costs from five thousand rubles per night.  At the <span>same time,</span> luxury apartments with a ten percent discount and breakfast included will cost tourists twenty thousand rubles per night. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The five-star National Hotel (Moscow) overwhelmingly collects reviews on the services it offers only positive ones.
