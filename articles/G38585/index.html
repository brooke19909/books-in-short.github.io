  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The well-known Dorogomilovsky market</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Perhaps this is one of the oldest grocery markets that operate smoothly in the capital.  Older people remember that shopping malls appeared in the area around the mid-thirties of the last century.  Dorogomilovsky market, located near the Kiev railway station, has traditionally been a very convenient place for trade.  Since the time of the historical Dorogomilovskaya outpost located here.  It is no secret to anyone that precisely the point of location is one of the determining factors for the success of any commercial enterprise.  And the place here is very lively, this is a kind of intersection of many roads. </p><p>  <strong>Dorogomilovsky <span>market.</span></strong>  <strong><span>Moscow.</span></strong>  <strong>Territory of success</strong> </p><p>  Currently, it is one of the most popular trading floors.  Many people prefer to buy food here.  Some demanding Muscovites are not even stopped by the very significant distance that they have to cover in order to get to the Dorogomilovsky market.  This is despite the fact that prices here are by no means pleasing with their availability. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Doromilovsky market" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/242095.jpg" width="492"></div>  What, then, makes buyers come here from the other end of Moscow?  The answer is obvious: the quality level of the products presented here.  Almost everything that is sold here corresponds in its parameters to premium products and is located in the upper part of the price range.  For better or worse, the Dorogomilovsky market is not for the poor.  And in Moscow there are enough people for whom a similar price level is quite acceptable.  This is evidenced by the simple fact that the Dorogomilovsky market never complained about the lack of buyers. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Doromilovsky market how to get there" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/242096.jpg" width="502"></div>  If there are any problems, it‚Äôs only how to get here, overcoming endless Moscow traffic jams, and where to park the car.  The marketplace of the Dorogomilovsky market is designed for a successful middle class, for people who know how to make money, count them and spend them properly.  This is the reputation of this place.  It even manifests itself in the fact that sometimes various commercials and elements of television shows are sometimes shot here.  And politicians like Zhirinovsky like to speak here, posing against the backdrop of food stalls.  And one should pay tribute to the management of the trading company, for which status is a significant concept.  Therefore, funds in the development and reconstruction of the trading floor are invested in a sufficient amount.  And there is reason to believe that this market has good prospects. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Doromilovsky market Moscow" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/242097.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Dorogomilovsky market: how to get to it</strong> </p><p>  There are indeed certain problems with transport communications.  Getting to the market is not always easy.  But these are Moscow-wide problems - traffic jams and parking spaces, it‚Äôs not easy with them in the center of the capital.  And planning a visit to the Dorogomilovsky market, one should proceed from the general transport situation.  But it is quite possible to get here by metro.  The nearest stations are Kievskaya (ring and radial lines).  And also "Student", which is on the <span>Filevskaya line.</span>  The market operates all seven days a week, without days off, from eight in the morning to eight in the evening. </p>
