However, feminine outfits, such as dresses with a half-skirt, occupy a special place in women's wardrobes.  For more than a century, this style has not gone out of fashion, remaining in demand and loved by many fashionistas. </p><p>  Perhaps the huge popularity of this outfit is due to the fact that it looks very attractive to almost any figure, and it is also easy to sew.  The last fact is easy to verify: the article below presents a <span>dress pattern</span> with a half-sun skirt.  Skirts of this style can be completely without seams, and can be with one or two seams.  The length of the dress can be completely different: from the minimum to the <span>dress on the floor.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Half-skirt dresses: features </h2><p>  The skirt of this style is a close relative of the sun skirt.  It is no secret to anyone what the latter looks like: lush, cut in a circle from a single piece of matter.  Usually there are no cuts or side seams or fasteners on it. </p><p>  The half-skirt is very similar to her.  The only difference is that it is less magnificent, as it is cut from a semicircular piece of fabric.  From which it follows that dresses with a half-skirt have at least one seam.  The only exceptions are models with a smell: they are usually seamless.  The pattern of a detachable dress with a half-sun skirt is presented below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Outfits with a skirt of a similar style are considered quite restrained, even despite the fact that the folds on the skirt give them some coquetry.  Dresses with a half-sun skirt will be appropriate in almost any situation: you can safely put it on to work, go to study in it, visit a restaurant, theater or just friendly gatherings. </p><h2>  Who needs this outfit? </h2><p>  <span>Dresses with a half-sun skirt</span> are suitable for any girl, since the natural folds that form on the hem add to the image of grace and sophistication.  This outfit will hide extra centimeters, and also add volume to the missing places. </p><ul><li>  A dress with a detachable half-skirt will suit girls whose figure looks like a rectangle.  The length of the dress should be just above the knee.  In a dress of such a cut, the waist will look more slender, and the hips - more voluminous. </li><li>  If the figure of the fashionista looks like a triangle, then she needs to find a dress in which the skirt begins to expand from the hip line, and not from the waist.  This will add lightness to the image, while hiding the fullness. </li><li>  A girl with a figure “inverted triangle” dress, cut off at the waist, with a half-sun skirt is perfect.  It will be an excellent choice: the thigh will visually increase due to the many folds.  This will balance the silhouette. </li></ul>

The top, made of dense fabric, will not additionally encircle the bulges, and the fluffy skirt set on the yoke will distract attention from the waist. </li><li>  <em>Full legs.</em>  This flaw will hide the dress with a skirt, the length of which is not higher than the middle of the knee.  Such an outfit will balance the heavy bottom, especially if you are in high heels. </li><li>  <em>Narrow hips.</em>  Another drawback that a half-sun <span>flared skirt</span> can cope with: it will increase the difference between the volume of the hip and waist, which will bring the figure closer to the desired ideal. </li></ol><h2>  Outfit with sleeve </h2><p>  A dress with a half-sun skirt may not have a sleeve at all, however, if this detail is still available, its length may vary.  It is best to choose a similar outfit based on the season.  For example, in the summer, strapless dresses are more in demand, and models with long sleeves are more often bought for the office.  A dress pattern with a half-sun skirt with sleeves is built no more complicated than without them. </p>
