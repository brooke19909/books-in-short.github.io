    <h2>  Actor Biography </h2><p>  Tim Curry was born into the family of Methodist chaplain Navy James Curry in Cheshire, England.  He was not alone in the family, but also had an older sister (she died about fifteen years ago from a brain tumor).  Curry graduated from Cambridge University, studied drama and English.  After some time, the actor entered the University of Birmingham, who graduated with honors. </p><p>  Tim Curry first performed on stage in London in 1968 as part of the Royal Shakespeare Group.  Subsequently, he starred in many films (during his entire career as an actor, there were at least fifteen of them, which were remembered by charismatic characters). </p><p>  It should be noted that the actor has recently left work, as he suffered a severe stroke about four years ago.  Now he moves in a wheelchair, because he could not fully restore his body. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The role of Tim Curry in the movie ‚ÄúRocky Horror Horror Show‚Äù </h2><p>  Perhaps one of the most memorable roles played by Curry was Funk En Ferter from the movie ‚ÄúRocky Horror Horror Show‚Äù.  Tim Curry played here an eccentric transvestite who lives in a huge old mansion.  This is where newlyweds stop traveling around the country.  They are drawn into the cycle of events, as a result of which they are simply shocked by the recklessness of actions that are simply not acceptable in a decent society. </p><p>  The film itself was released in 1975.  Its director was Jim Sharman.  Together with Jim Curry, such actors as <span>Susan Sarandon,</span> Barry Bostwick, Richard O'Byen and others played in it.  It should be noted that in 1973 a similar musical was released with the same name (you could even say that it was a prototype of the film).  It was he who laid the foundation for paintings in this style, and he himself became a classic of films of this genre.  We can say that Curry was at the source. </p>

    <h2>  Role in the film ‚ÄúIt‚Äù </h2><p>  Another classic picture in which Tim Curry starred was the film ‚ÄúIt‚Äù based on the work of Stephen King.  The film was shot in the best horror traditions of the time (and it was released in 1990).  Let's just say that for a teenager the picture is full of impressions, but if you revise it at an older age, the film is less impressive.  However, the acting is awesome. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The terrible clown was played by Tim Curry.  Some experts believe that this is his best and most impressive role (after the Rocky Horror Horror Show).  For the first time with evil, which takes the guise of a clown, the kids faced in the fifties (according to the script) and were able to repulse him.  Thirty years later, ‚Äúit‚Äù appeared again, and adults are already opposing it. </p><p>  According to many experts, Tim Curry‚Äôs game in this film is brilliant.  He well conveyed the horror that clowns can inspire (it‚Äôs clear now why not everyone loves and does not find them funny), as well as the villainous actions with which he intimidated children.  His facial expressions, voice - all this is so creepy that it really distorts. </p>

    <h2>  Other actor films </h2><p>  It should be noted other films in which Tim Curry played.  Perhaps one of the most memorable films for children was ‚ÄúHome Alone 2: Lost in New York‚Äù.  Then he played Mr. Hector, a villain and a thief working as a receptionist at the Plaza Hotel.  It is in him that the younger McCullister gets, accidentally landing on the wrong plane.  Having fun at the hotel, Kevin did not notice how he was robbed by taking money from a credit card.  This was done by the villain clerk, played by Tim Curry.  ‚ÄúHome Alone 2‚Äù thanks to the wonderful play of actors, is still the favorite Christmas film of many families. </p><p>  And below we will list other films in which the actor starred. </p><ul><li>  The Secret of Munacra (2008). </li><li>  The Color of Magic (2008). </li><li>  "Alice in Wonderland" (2009). </li><li>  Charlie's Angels (2000). </li><li>  "The Reunion of the Adams Family" (1998). </li><li>  The Scream (1978). </li><li>  "The Worst Witch" (1986). </li><li>  "The hunt for the" Red October ". </li><li>  "The Dead" (1992). </li><li>  Lex 2: Supernova (1996). </li><li>  The Three Musketeers (1993). </li><li>  "The Pebble and the Penguin" (1995). </li><li>  Monument Valley: The Last Rainforest (1990). </li><li>  "Fly to the Moon" (2008). </li><li>  Transformers: Rescue Bots (2011). </li><li>  "Hands and feet for love" (2010). </li></ul><p>  In addition to films, Curry voiced the main character of Gabriel Knight, Gabriel Knight, a shadow hunter, as well as Dr. Frankenstein in Frankenstein: Through the Eyes of the Monster.  In Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Curry voiced Satan.  So, you can hear the characteristic villainous notes of Curry's voice in several computer games. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know in which films Tim Curry starred, whose filmography is so vast, as well as some points from his biography.  As we see, his heroes are most often villains or peculiar characters who have some oddities.  Thanks to his appearance and ability to make the desired facial expression, as well as a characteristic voice, Curry could beat his characters well so that almost everyone remembered the viewer. </p>
