  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Loan repayment</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When making a loan, the borrower should be interested not only in the interest rate, but also in the ways of paying it off.  Knowing everything on time is the only way to avoid the hustle and bustle of the future. </p><p>  In general, repaying a loan is quite simple.  As a rule, there are no pitfalls, but the methods are different.  The main thing is not to deviate from the schedule. </p><p>  Repayment of a loan is nothing but the size of payments, their terms and, of course, the form of making these payments.  In most cases, lending involves long-term repayments.  In some cases, payments are made in equal amounts, and in some cases, these amounts can be very different from each other.  Sometimes it is possible to repay a loan ahead of schedule. </p><p>  Repayment of the loan is carried out in various ways.  More frequent is the introduction of the necessary amounts through the cash desks of creditor banks.  This method is good, since the transfer of funds is made without any commission.  It is also good in that the risk of errors is minimal. </p><p>  The main disadvantages are that some banks do not have many branches, they may not work on weekends, often they have to queue.  These disadvantages are not so significant, but it was worth mentioning.  In general, we note that you can pay a loan at the bank not through the cashier, but through a special machine. </p><p>  Repayment of the loan is also possible through the mail.  In principle, this is convenient, but do not forget that you will be asked a commission.  It can reach three percent.  In addition, do not forget that money is sent by mail not instantly, but with a delay.  Incorrect calculations will cause trouble. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A loan from almost any bank can be repaid through Sberbank of Russia.  The thing is.  What its branches are all over the country.  Even in the countryside.  Interbank transfers, of course, are convenient, however, they relate to paid services.  It is worth remembering that they are not instant ones. </p><p>  Repayment of the loan is also possible through <span>wages.</span>  It‚Äôs just that a person will receive the amount from which the loan installment has already been deducted.  In principle, convenient. </p><p>  Modern people pay loans online.  This is easier than it sounds.  It is enough to create the necessary template once.  Money can be transferred from a card or through electronic payment systems (WebMoney and so on). </p><p>  Almost all modern mortgage programs make it possible to pay the entire loan ahead of schedule.  Partial repayment of the loan is also possible.  The point is that the borrower will pay not a month, but several months in advance.  Also, with partial repayment of the loan, the term and duration of the loan repayment may not change, but the amount of monthly installments will change. </p><p>  Re-lending is understood as obtaining a loan with an <span>interest rate that</span> is lower than that which a previously taken loan has.  It is used to repay this loan.  Today, financial institutions are in constant competition.  For this reason, they keep lowering interest rates all the time.  Re-lending can be an excellent move, but you should carefully draw up documents.  Since there is a likelihood that in addition to the main payments, there will be an obligation to make some additional payments. </p><p>  <span>The loan repayment methods</span> listed above are the most common.  All of them are comfortable in their own way.  Everything is done so that the borrower does not have any problems in order to transfer money in a strictly defined period.  Repayment of the loan should be timely.  If you fail to pay on time, you may lose additional funds, since various types of late fees are often provided for under a <span>loan agreement</span> . </p><p>  After repayment of the loan, it is recommended to make sure that it is really repaid. </p>
