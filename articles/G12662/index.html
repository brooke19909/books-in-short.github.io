  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lake Tahir is a great place to relax</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tahir - a lake formed in a picturesque area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Republic of Mari El.  It is located about 14 kilometers from the village of Kokshaysk, which is the center of the village council.  The reservoir is of karst origin.  The depth of individual sections reaches a 10-meter mark.  The water is clean and clear.  The total area is 45 hectares.  Lake Tahir was recognized as a natural monument of national importance and was taken under state protection in 1987. </p><p>  The pond is surrounded by rolling hills.  If you walk along the coastline, you can see how the marshy lowlands are replaced by sandy hills.  To the south, small one-story buildings are visible.  These are the homes of local residents.  Holidays on Lake Tahir have long been popular.  Back in the 70s, many organizations built <span>recreation centers</span> for their employees here.  There is also a children's camp. </p><p>  Many different birds fly to these lands.  In the afternoon they delight vacationers with their singing.  If you watch them, you can see how they fish.  Accelerating and gracefully dropping low to the water, they manage to capture the prey.  From the side it looks very beautiful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russian-tradition.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Tahir vacation" class="if uuid-2627847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2627847.jpg"></div><h2>  Legend of the island </h2><p>  The mystery of Lake Tahir gave rise to the legend of a floating island and monks.  Local historian E.L.  Kutasova confirms that the latter really lived in these parts.  They were engaged in fishing for the inhabitants of the Yezhovo-Mironositsky monastery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The head of the village administration told another legend.  She confirms that until 1917 a small chapel and a wooden monastery were built on the shores of the lake.  It also tells of a floating island.  But, despite the spectacular legends, there is no reason to believe in the plausibility of its plot from a scientific point of view.  Moreover, the old-timers claim that he has been in one place for a long time.  Indeed, the island in vestments from a cloud of clouds can mistakenly be considered mobile, but as the fog disperses and closer monitoring of the land area becomes clear that it is completely motionless. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on tair lake" class="if uuid-2627870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2627870.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  The picturesque and beauty of Lake Tahir often attracted the attention of people of art.  A huge number of landscapes were written from it.  The film "53 meters" was shot on its sandy beach.  This event occurred in the fall of 2004.  In the film, the lake itself and its coastal strip are used as scenery.  It is worth noting that this film was the best at the Yushut Film Festival. </p><h2>  Rich underwater world </h2><p>  Fishing in Mari El will appeal to many.  You can leave the lake with a big catch, but you will have to look for a good place.  After all, each type of fish has its own characteristics.  For example, a bream will have to swim in a boat.  It is caught at a depth of not less than 4 meters.  Be sure to feed the place, only then you can count on a good bite.  But there will be no such problems with perch.  They live near thickets of reeds.  Those who want to catch a pike will have to be patient.  The main thing is to choose the right gear and inspect the bottom.  Do not forget that a large predator most often hides under snags. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing in mari el" class="if uuid-2627875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2627875.jpg"></div><p>  It is important to remember that boats with a motor are not allowed on the lake.  Fishing is also prohibited.  Those who violate the conditions are fined. </p>
