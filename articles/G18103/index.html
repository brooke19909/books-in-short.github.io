And all this is contrary to common sense, since on TV they show films at a decent age, and local TV shows and TV shows can be downloaded online a maximum of a day after their release.  This article explains why it does not show TV.  100% - this is exactly the chance that you will find a solution by reading this article. </p><h2>  The main reasons why the TV began to show poorly </h2><p>  It is possible that this is an old habit of sitting on the couch, which certainly does not want to sink into the past.  Nevertheless, the unexpected appearance of a blue screen can noticeably tense the nerves of TV lovers until they find out why they are not showing the TV. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ndi-aerials.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV does not show channels" class="if uuid-2949296" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111522/2949296.jpg"></div><p>  And the reason for this may be a number of factors. </p><ol><li>  Bad weather or the absence of a wave of the required frequency (relevant if you have an analog or satellite TV and using an antenna). </li><li>  Technical obsolescence of equipment. </li><li>  Lack of necessary settings or unsupported technologies. </li></ol><h2>  Technical work on the TV channel or at the provider </h2><p>  All TV channels operate around the clock, and the answer to the question why the TV does not show, may be the implementation of both scheduled and unscheduled technical work.  These are backups, equipment firmware, and much more.  You can verify the fact of technical work by switching to other TV channels.  If everything is fine there, then it remains only to wait. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Providers work in a similar way, and they also need maintenance work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jvcsmart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ordinary tv" class="if uuid-2949290" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111522/2949290.jpg"></div><p>  Intervention by a local provider is also possible, which for various reasons could, without notice, remove this channel from the list of its services.  In such cases, it is worth asking the neighbors connected to other providers about problems and finally understanding why the TV does not show channels. </p><h2>  Problems with the antenna or signal reception </h2><p>  The home television antenna is slowly becoming the past.  More and more states are switching to digital or cable television.  These technologies do not use the outdated technology of transmitting waves of the desired frequency over a distance and exclude the need for "dancing with the antenna" in order to better catch the signal - all data is transmitted by wire with minimal loss in picture quality!  An example is Ukraine, which since September 2018 completely abandoned analog television. </p><p>  A weak signal is the reason why the <span>TV shows poorly.</span>  And this is, at least, a terrible quality picture, as well as a limited number of channels.  Whether it makes sense to replace the antenna with a more powerful one and with a small chance to increase both of these factors depends on the specific case. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For example, outside the city it is unlikely to find a provider that will stretch a cable of many kilometers length into the village due to several subscribers.  For him, this is unprofitable, and the payback will stretch for decades.  The only way out in this case is a more powerful antenna or a switch to satellite TV services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kvarta.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV setup" class="if uuid-2949302" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111522/2949302.jpg"></div><p>  Antennas called dishes are actively used in satellite TV technology.  In this case, the weak receiver problem inherent in analog antennas can be completely eliminated.  The reason why the TV does not show satellite channels may be a malfunction of the antenna itself. </p><p>  The cause of malfunctions can also be the recent wind, hurricane, snow and other natural phenomena that can damage the receiver, bend, deploy, tear off the antenna parts, and also fall asleep with snow, damping the power of the receiver.  In this case, it is necessary to inspect the device for cracks, traces of mechanical stress, to make sure that the antenna has not tilted. </p><p>  If everything is okay visually, there is no rain or fog outside the window, and it is not possible to find out why the TV does not show, then it's time to contact customer support. </p><h2>  Technical malfunction </h2><p>  The last and rarest factor can be a TV breakdown.  If the picture is bad on all channels of poor quality, the neighbors are fine, and technical support cannot help, most likely the TV has failed. </p>
