    <h2>  BASIC </h2><p>  Consider the example of the general taxation mode, how to conduct accounting IP yourself.  The step-by-step instruction contains instructions that the entrepreneur should take into account all the business operations that are carried out.  To fix them, use the book on expenses and income.  In accordance with the information that is contained there, at the end of the tax year, the businessman draws up a declaration on f.  3-PIT and deducts 13% tax.  This payment must be made before April 30th.  OSNO also involves the deduction of VAT.  For its calculation, all outgoing and incoming invoices, sales, purchases are recorded in the relevant books.  Based on the information contained in them, a quarterly declaration is formed, tax is calculated at a rate of 18%.  Payments are made until the 20th of the new quarter for the previous one.  If the entrepreneur‚Äôs activity is connected with cash, then it is necessary to keep a cash book and fill out <span>receipt and account orders.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bookkeeping un for beginners" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1007702.jpg" width="457"></div>

The entrepreneur calculates and withholds income tax from employees, pays insurance premiums to the Social Insurance Fund and the FIU.  For personnel, the IP submits reports: </p><ol><li>  In IFTS on the average number of employees and their income (f. 2-PIT).  The first document is submitted until January 20, the second - until April 1. </li><li>  In the FSS.  The annual and quarterly statements for f.

    <h2>  USN IP </h2><p>  The tasks of an entrepreneur using a simplified system include filling out the Accounting Book with <span>information about income</span> at a base of 6% and income and expenses at a tariff of 15%.  When using the simplified tax system, the individual entrepreneur must file a tax return by April 30th.  Personnel reporting and contributions under this regime are similar to those on the OSNO.  Property (for individuals) and income taxes are not paid.  A simplified taxation system is considered the most popular among entrepreneurs.  When using it, it‚Äôs very easy to figure out how to bookkeeping IP yourself.  The step-by-step instructions contain few points to follow.  A simplified system, therefore, is most suitable for small and medium-sized businesses. </p><h2>  UTII </h2><p>  This mode, together with the "simplified", is included in the category of special, preferential.  However, when using UTII accounting IP for beginners will be more difficult.  With this scheme, there is no need to take into account expenses and income.  The entrepreneur should only fix the physical characteristics of the activity.  Among them, for example, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe premises occupied by the store, the number of units in the carrier‚Äôs transport fleet, and so on.  All changes in physical indicators throughout the year must be reflected in the statements when calculating the tax from the month in which they occurred.  Calculation of the obligatory payment is carried out in accordance with the <span>basic profitability</span> for a specific type of activity.  The indicator is determined by local authorized bodies.  In addition, you need to know the deflator coefficients.  These are the main points that includes accounting IP.  There are advisory centers for beginning entrepreneurs.  You can clarify certain nuances directly in the tax service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="accounting independently" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1007704.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Important point </h2><p>  When using UTII, an entrepreneur must submit reports every quarter before the 20th day of the month from which a new reporting period begins.  Tax is payable by the 25th.  Entrepreneurs using UTII are not required to keep records.  However, this does not exempt them from compliance with cash requirements and the procedure in accordance with which cash transactions are carried out.  Thus, the entrepreneur must have a Cash Book, <span>primary documentation</span> confirming the movement of funds.  The obligation to make insurance payments and reporting on personnel remains. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Whatever tax system the businessman chooses, it will take some time to study the scheme.  It should be borne in mind that bills, recommendations, and teaching materials are periodically amended, which must be monitored.  It is advisable to install software that allows you to record automatically.  Moreover, tax authorities accept reports electronically.  It should be noted that the update of the programs takes place in accordance with the adopted legislative norms.  This allows the entrepreneur to always be aware of the changes and correctly draw up documentation.  In general, the study of taxation schemes is not particularly difficult.  Experts recommend starting with simplified, preferential regimes. </p>
