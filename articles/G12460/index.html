The main waterway is the Neman River.  Most of the country's territory is located in a lowland plain, in the west and east partly hilly terrain.  The climate is relatively mild due to humid air coming from the Atlantic. </p><p>  The main natural resource of the country is amber. </p><p>  Lithuania is a small country with just over 3 million people. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Lithuania is famous for its ancient architectural monuments.  The capital of amazing beauty is Vilnius.  An amazing city - Trakai, the former capital of the state.  There are many sandy beaches and hospitals on the territory.  Many resorts, such as Druskininkai, Birstonas and Palanga, are known throughout the world.  Lithuania is one of the oldest cultural centers in Europe. </p><p>  The country's government took care of creating interesting tourist routes throughout the country with a visit to the Baltic coast. </p><h2>  Vilnius </h2><p>  Back in 1994, the city was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.  There are a huge number of Baroque buildings, well-preserved medieval streets, castles and churches. </p><p>  The main attraction of Vilnius in Lithuania is the old city, where the history of the whole state began.  It is here that you can see the gates of Aushros or the Sharp Brahma - part of the city wall, where the image of the Virgin is stored in the chapel.  They were erected around the 16th century.  Be sure to visit the city hall of the XVI century and walk along the Piles street - the oldest in the city, whose length is only 500 meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth looking at <span>the Gediminas Tower,</span> which houses the National Museum of Lithuania, the Presidential Palace, the Radziwill Palace, built in the style of the late Renaissance, and the palace complex on Castle Hill, go to the Cathedral of St. Stanislav and the Church of St. Anne, Bernardine Church and Church of St. Peter and Paul (XVII century). </p><p>  According to the reviews of tourists, you can walk in the city for several days: in a small area there are many historical monuments and magnificent parks that will not leave a single traveler indifferent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wondermondo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="capital of Vilnius" class="if uuid-2448217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2448217.jpg"></div><h2>  Kaunas </h2><p>  The second most important city in Lithuania.  The sights of Kaunas will impress even the most experienced tourist.  The first mention of the settlement is found in historical documents from 1361, and by the middle of the 15th century the city became the most important trading center of Europe.  What is interesting about him? </p><ul><li>  <span>Kaunas Castle,</span> built around the 13th century on a strategic location for the city, at the confluence of two rivers - Neris and Nemunas.  The complex often hosts theme festivals, and a museum is located within the walls of the castle. </li><li>  Vytautas Church - a building erected in the Gothic style.  For some period of time, the church acted as an Orthodox church.  On the territory is the grave of the writer Vaizhgantas Juozas. </li><li>  The Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul, founded in 1413, is still active today. </li><li>  An ancient ancient building of the 15th century, in which a gymnasium is now located. </li></ul><p>  There are still many modern interesting places in the city: this is the Church of the Resurrection of Christ - the highest in the whole Baltic (70 meters), the funicular of alyakalnis, which used to function as public transport in the past, the Statue of Liberty, which appeared in the city in 1989, the Botanical Garden and the Devils Museum ". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.conferencelithuania.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaunas city" class="if uuid-2448218" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2448218.jpg"></div><h2>  Nida </h2><p>  This is a small resort town, characterized by aristocracy and, consequently, a high price for a vacation.  Located on the Curonian Spit, which is part of the National Park and a landmark of Nida and Lithuania.  In the village there are many hotels of different categories, apartments and cottages.  The resort's beaches were marked with the Blue Flag. </p><p>  Once Thomas Mann lived here (for 2 years), in whose house the amber museum and an exposition dedicated to the life and work of the writer now work.  It is interesting to walk around the village, on its territory there are old houses that the Curonians built - a long-lost nationality.  Be sure to climb the Parnigio dune, where there is an observation deck with a magnificent view of the coast. </p><p>  According to tourists' reviews, the great concern of local residents about the cleanliness of the village and the preservation of the surrounding nature is respectable.  There are no bottles and pieces of paper on the shore; there are not even fallen trees in the forest.  The resort is nice to relax, however, very expensive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.madeinklaipeda.lt" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.madeinklaipeda.lt/nida-896633_1280/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nida resort" class="if uuid-2448221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2448221.jpg"></div><h2>  Birstonas </h2><p>  The attraction of Lithuania is a real balneological resort, almost in the heart of the country.  This picturesque place is 90 kilometers from Vilnius.  Back in the 19th century, mineral waters and healing mud were discovered here, although once they were princely hunting grounds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This is a quiet resort, where there are only two sanatoriums and several hotels, the architecture of which resembles a palace or a castle.  Here you can go fishing, paragliding and cycling. </p><p>  You can climb Mount Vytautas, where the castle once stood out, and now an observation deck.  For lovers of winter holidays near the resort, two ski runs and a sled for children are organized. </p><p>  According <span>to tourists,</span> it‚Äôs better to guess the <span>rest</span> for any event.  Almost every month festivals and sporting events are held here: from the oldest jazz festival to rowing competitions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="birstonas.lt" data-author=": " data-source="http://birstonas.lt/en/2016/02/03/english-birstonas-lithuanias-baden-baden/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Birstonas resort" class="if uuid-2448222" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2448222.jpg"></div><h2>  Klaipeda </h2><p>  This is a real attraction of Lithuania, the photos are magnificent.  The city is the third largest in the country and at the same time the largest port.  The sea never freezes here.  Once the city was called Memel (German version), for some time it belonged to the Teutonic knights, Sweden, the Prussian kingdom, Russia. </p><p>  On the banks of the Dana River is the old part of the city, where the medieval layout and many metal sculptures, the Birzhevoy Bridge and the beautiful Dakha Fountain are preserved.  Take a walk to Klaipeda Castle, which was also erected by the knights of the Teutonic Order. </p><p>  Since this is a port city, there is a lighthouse built in 1796.  During the Second World War, it was blown up by the Germans, but after it was completely restored. </p><p>  There is an interesting maritime museum in the city - the only one in the whole country.  It is located in the defensive wall of the Kopgalis fortress, the construction of which took place in the 19th century.  The exposition includes an aquarium, fisherman's huts, a dolphinarium and ship models. </p><p>  You can look at the clock museum and the blacksmithing museum.  On the territory of the city there is a magnificent sculpture park, built on the site of a former cemetery, and an art gallery.  Be sure to admire the beautiful Finnish sailboat Meridian. </p><p>  According to tourists, in Clapade you can enjoy not only ancient monuments, but also a magnificent beach.  Unlike most cities in Latvia, the climate here is quite hot, so in Clapade you can find entertainment for every taste. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.balticsail.info" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.balticsail.info/klaipeda/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Klaipeda city" class="if uuid-2448223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2448223.jpg"></div><h2>  Palanga </h2><p>  Another attraction of Lithuania, where there is always bright sun and gentle sea, and the coastline is surrounded by a pine forest. </p><p>  Palanga used to be an ordinary fishing village, but in the XIX century Count Tyszkiewicz was here and was so impressed by the local beauties that he decided to make a resort here.  With the filing of the count, sanatoriums and hospitals appeared in the settlement.  Today it is a modern resort with a well-developed infrastructure. </p><p>  It is in this city that one of the main attractions of Lithuania is located - the <span>Curonian Spit</span> National Reserve <span>.</span>  Also in the city there is an ancient pagan temple on Mount Birutes, the estate of Orvidas and Kretingu, the temple of the Iveron Icon of the Mother of God and the Church of the Virgin Mary, the Botanical Garden. </p><p>  Only positive reviews are heard about the rest in Palanga: tourists claim that the rest here is simply magical, although the sea is not always warm, but beautiful nature and lovely locals. </p><h2>  ≈†iauliai </h2><p>  The oldest city in Lithuania, which is already more than 780 years old.  Located on the shore of the lake, where you can settle in a hotel and have a good rest. </p><p>  It is an industrial city, but factories and factories not only work, but also take tours of their workshops.  It is here that the country's oldest brewery is located - Gubernija, which is more than 350 years old. </p><p>  There are more than 20 museums in ≈†iauliai, which is why locals call the city the museum capital. </p><p>  If you love nature, then welcome to the Kaman Nature Reserve, where you can see swamps and petrified remains of dinosaurs or look into the Ventas Park. </p><p>  According to tourists, the main attraction of Lithuania and the city of ≈†iauliai is the Holy <span>Mountain of Crosses.</span>  This is a hill that is 12 kilometers from the city.  Once upon a time there was an ancient ancient settlement, according to another version - there was a monastery here, which fell underground.  Today there are more than 50 thousand crosses on the hill.  It is not known where and when, but such a belief appeared: to be successful in life, you need to leave a cross on the mountain.  Now thousands of pilgrims come here every year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ptolemybracket.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Siauliai city" class="if uuid-2448229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2448229.jpg"></div><h2>  Druskininkai </h2><p>  One of the oldest balneological resorts in Europe.  People came here to improve their health in the 17th century.  There are huge pine forests in the village, and the steep coast of the Neman protects the settlement from the north wind, therefore there is a rather mild climate, and there is not a single industrial enterprise around. </p><div class="photo" data-original="druskienniki.pl" data-author=": " data-source="http://druskienniki.pl/druskienniki/"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚ÄãDruskininkai" class="if uuid-2448230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2448230.jpg"></div><p>  Naturally, these are not the only sights and cities of Lithuania that will not leave indifferent any tourist.  It is also the city of Trakai, which was once the capital of the Principality of Lithuania, and ≈†ilutƒó, which is called the city of flowers: tulips of amazing beauty grow here, and the architecture is typically German. </p>
