Only in the books did these warlike creatures, somewhat similar to goblins, did not linger and migrated to many fantasy universes and games on them.  Dungeons and Dragons, Warcraft, Might and Magic, The Elder Scrolls ... All and not to list.  But today we will talk about that universe where there is only a place for war and where the orcs feel like fish in water.  Of course, this is Warhammer.  Probably, in a world of constant war, no one feels as confident as the orcs. </p><p>  Warhammer and his fans have expanded the green-skinned world to unthinkable sizes.  Almost everything is known about orcs: from theories of the origin of their race to what currency they pay with each other.  But first things first. </p>

    <h2>  <strong>Theories of origin</strong> <strong><br></strong> </h2><p><strong></strong><strong></strong>  There are two main theories of the origin of orcs in <span>the Warhammer universe.</span>  The first, which, incidentally, is also adhered by the greenskins themselves, is that a certain orc-like race was invented by them.  They were far from powerful warriors and needed obedient fighters to defend themselves from strangers.  With the help of changes in the genetics of their species, the wise managed to create warlike and powerful soldiers.  The second theory claims that the orcs were raised by a <span>race of the Ancients</span> - the most powerful and oldest creatures in the entire Universe.  This was done (as was the creation of other intelligent inhabitants of the galaxy) to fight the K'tans, who, together with the subordinate race of necrons, fought with the Ancients. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of Orcoid Creatures </h2><p>  Reproduction in orcs occurs through spores, as in fungi.  In addition to the greenskins themselves, they may be born: </p><ul><li>  squig (orcoid animals that have numerous applications in the life of greenskins: from food to use as weapons and even peculiar living hairpieces); </li></ul>

    <h2>  Society and customs </h2><p>  The customs of the orcs, frankly, are barbaric.  Only the Boss can choose trophies from the battlefield - the largest and most powerful orc that heads the orcish community.  But even among them there are gradations when greenskins unite in large masses for military operations, which, however, are constantly conducted.  Lower are Nobs.  They are inferior in size and strength only to the Boss himself.  When the campaign is successful, the Nobs gain strength and begin to glance at the place of the leader.  In such cases, the Bosses often give them either truly suicidal tasks, or with an ax over their heads. </p><p>  Further in the Table of Ranks are Meckboys <span>(the main mechanics of the</span> orcs), Boleboys (the doctors) and Supernatural beings (the orc sorcerers, in whom everything turns out incomprehensibly; however, like the rest of most greenskins).  The most numerous are Boyzes - ordinary soldiers who make up the core of the army. </p><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  The currency is teeth.  Orcs have a lot of them: new ones constantly grow, and old ones fall out.  To become a little richer, it is enough to hit your neighbor hard and collect the lost teeth.  But this way of earning money is a bit risky, because the offended party can simply give back.  Various orcish commanders weave themselves with whole necklaces from the teeth of enemies or obtained in drunken fights.  Due to its excellent hardness, teeth become not only the equivalent of currency, but also material for weapons and reservations.  Greenskins have a strange craving for red.  They believe that the technique painted in this color, travels much faster.  And since the orcs have a high speed causes terrible euphoria, it becomes clear their craving for red. </p><h2>  Tongue </h2><p>  The orcs in the original speak very badly distorted English with a bunch of mistakes.  This is translated into Russian accordingly.  The most famous word from the orcish lexicon is Waaagh !.  He has several meanings: from the special psychic field created by the orcs, and thanks to which even two connected sticks begin to shoot, to a military campaign and his beloved cry on the battlefield. </p>

    <h2>  Where Gork and Mork will be sent </h2><p>  And in whom, besides loved ones, do the orcs believe?  A Warhammer would not have been a Warhammer if even the aggressive greenskins were not somehow connected with Warp - hyperspace in the world of the war hammer.  The main gods of the orcs are Gork and Mork, who are also twins.  The first is cruel but tricky, and the second is tricky but cruel.  This fuzziness leads to numerous disputes between orcish theologians, who simply spill over into battle.  The twin gods are constantly fighting with the gods of other races.  It is impossible to defeat them: Gork smashes the heads of his enemies with his club, and Mork vilely hits the stealth. </p><p>  Sometimes, in myths, the twin gods are chopped up, but thanks to the unification of millions of orcs, they again rise unharmed.  In general, the greenskins do not care which of them worship.  Typically Boys pray to Gorku, and Meckboys and Supernatural pray to Mork.  In the image and likeness of the twin gods, the orcs build their most powerful fighting vehicles - gargants, which will be described a little later. </p>

    <h2>  Warhammer: Orc Technique </h2><p>  Now a little about the most interesting examples of technology.  What do orcs use?  "Warhammer" 40,000 gave birth to dreadnought, which are divided into Megadreds and Deathdreads.  They can be created by Boleboys and Meckboys.  A severely wounded orc or gretch can be used as a pilot, with which a skull is drilled to connect to the control of the machine.  The most terrifying machines are the Gargantes - analogues of human titans.  This is an amazingly tenacious and deadly machine, each system of which is duplicated.  Each gargant is individual, because it is built according to a single project.  After victory, next to this colossus are often parts of defeated enemies, which the orcs use to repair the gargant. </p><p>  Warhammer (fantasy) offers an interesting variation of the ancient catapult - the catapult of diving goblins.  Initially, it was used for reconnaissance, but then it occurred to someone to launch goblins as shells, causing considerable damage to the enemy. </p><h2>  Orcs in Warhammer Games <strong></strong></h2><p>  The most famous orcs brought the games of the Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War series, where they were available for the game.  Already in the first part of this game, based on the Warhammer universe, the Orcs will have to fight hand in hand with the Order of the Blood Ravens.  Of the latest Warhammer gaming products, the Total War Warhammer strategy stands out.  Passing beyond the orcs in it may seem a little strange: a player cannot trade with anyone, his armies can suddenly start fighting with each other, and the economy is completely imprisoned for raids on the enemy.  But it may please the start of the game for the Greenskins in Total War Warhammer: Orcs can set up large armies almost immediately. </p><h2>  Epilogue </h2><p>  So, here comes the end of a short story about what the orcs represent in the world of the war hammer.  The Warhammer, without any doubt, greatly enriched their history and image. </p>
