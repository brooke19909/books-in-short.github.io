    <h2>  Battle of Friedland </h2><p>  In 1807, a battle took place forty kilometers from Koenigsberg, which ended in the defeat of the Russian army.  This was another victory of Napoleon.

    <h2>  Tilsit world </h2><p>  Let's talk about the negotiations between Russia and France before recalling when Napoleon attacked Russia.  The start date of the negotiations is July 13, 1807.  It lasted twelve days.  As a result, a peace treaty was concluded, the terms of which the Russian aristocrats did not like so much.  Later, many legends arose that narrated the meeting of Napoleon with Alexander I. Even medallions were made, depicting emperors hugging. </p><p>  So, the rulers of the two states met.  What were they talking about?  Nobody heard their conversation.  Napoleon and Alexander I talked for more than an <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="2" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle" data-mce-mark="1">hour on a raft, which was</span> located in the middle of the river, in a covered pavilion.  They did not need a translator <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="18" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography" data-mce-mark="1">- the</span> Russian emperor spoke in French better than in his native language.  It is known that Napoleon all this time tried to persuade his opponent to conclude an alliance with him.  In exchange, he promised to help get Finland and the Balkan Peninsula.  At the same time, he decided to keep Constantinople.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="40" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography" data-mce-mark="1">In what year did Napoleon attack Russia?</span>  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="40" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography" data-mce-mark="1">The date will be announced a little later.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Bonaparte did not like the conditions offered to the Russian emperor.  He stood his ground for a long time.  After negotiations in the circle of his close associates, Napoleon called him a real "Byzantine", that is, a strong man, able to stand his ground.  Still, in some ways, Alexander lost.  I had to conclude an agreement, which for several years was discussed indignantly in Russian aristocratic circles. </p>

    <h2>  The blockade of the uk </h2><p>  Russian-French relations rapidly deteriorated.  The fact is that the continental blockade of Britain was extremely disadvantageous.  The Russian government created all sorts of ways to get around one of the points of the peace agreement.  And then there <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="28" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo" data-mce-mark="1">were</span> several more events that, it would seem, were not related to politics.  But this is only <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="43" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation" data-mce-mark="1">at first glance</span> . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The question of what year Napoleon attacked Russia would never have arisen, probably if the French emperor had not received a refusal from the sister of Alexander I. Napoleon made an offer to Grand Duchess Catherine.  She refused, citing the fact that she was already engaged.  Then he proposed another Grand Duchess - Anna.  But here, too, the Corsican expected failure.  But I really wanted to make friends with the Romanovs and strengthen their imperial status!  He had no choice but to marry the daughter of the Austrian ruler.  Relations between Russia and France have deteriorated sharply.  This happened in 1810.  Soon the war was to begin.  In what year did Napoleon attack Russia?  The answer to this question is very close. </p>

    <h2>  The impact of the contract on the economy </h2><p>  The peace agreement with Napoleon in Russia primarily affected landowners and merchants.  And this, of course, reflected negatively on the state treasury.  In 1810, Russia established trade with Great Britain through intermediaries.  This increased customs rates on products exported from France, which Napoleon could not like. </p><p>  Some researchers believe that the Russian economy is not very much affected by the so-called blockade of Britain.  On the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="44" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation" data-mce-mark="1">contrary</span> , the limited import of goods stimulated domestic production.  In addition, the UK did not ship essential goods.  So, without English coffee and sugar <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="5" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle" data-mce-mark="1">in Russia in those</span> days, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="5" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle" data-mce-mark="1">they</span> did very well.  As for salt, it was produced in excess in the territory of the Russian Empire. </p>

    <h2>  Russian-French intrigues </h2><p>  Both Napoleon and Alexander I from time to time violated some points of the peace agreement.  Distrust grew every month.  It became clear that the war would <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="30" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo" data-mce-mark="1">begin</span> very soon. </p><p>  About the enemy you need to have as much information as possible.  Napoleon knew this very well, and therefore thoroughly studied the economic and martial law of Russia.  A huge number of informants appeared in Moscow and St. Petersburg, who entered the country under the guise of travelers, monks, merchants, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="31" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo" data-mce-mark="1">tutors</span> .  Among them were not only French, but also Poles.  Russian intelligence also worked perfectly.  Twice a month, Alexander I received detailed information regarding the size of the French army and all sorts of changes that were taking place in it. </p><h2>  Opponents military forces </h2><p>  In 1811, the French army, according to official figures, numbered more than 400 thousand troops.  It was later proved that this information was exaggerated.  The size of the great army was no more than 230 thousand people.  With the armament of the French, the situation was excellent.  The weak side of Napoleon's army was a rather motley national composition.  There were Germans and Poles.  In total, representatives of 16 nationalities were present among the military personnel.  In terms of technical and material support, Russia was not inferior to France.  As for the number - exceeded.  The weaknesses were embezzlement, theft of commissary officials and various official abuses. </p>

According to the generally accepted version, his goal was Moscow.
