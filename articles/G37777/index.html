So, they try not only to get acquainted with the official information and tips of travel agents, but also read as many reviews as possible from those who have already had occasion to stay at a particular hotel.  Indeed, thanks to this, you can be aware of not only advantages, but also some disadvantages.  Therefore, we bring to your attention the generalized comments of travelers from Russia who recently stayed at the Karelta Beach Hotel (Kemer, Turkey).  Running a little ahead, we note that the vast majority of our compatriots did not regret their choice at all.  On the contrary, they assure that this hotel corresponds to the declared category and cost.  But we will understand everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="carelta beach resort spa 4 reviews" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1039918.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Judging by the comments of tourists provided to them at Carelta Beach Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (Kemer) by the rooms, they were mostly satisfied.  However, as the guests note, the hotel is already quite old, and reconstruction was not carried out in it.  Therefore, you will not find modern design and new furniture and appliances in the apartments.  However, in general, everything is quite high quality and is in working condition.  If some kind of breakdown happens, then after contacting the reception the problem will be fixed as soon as possible.  In their reviews, our compatriots also mention that Wi-Fi in the rooms practically does not catch.  In most cases, you can use it only at the reception. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel carelta beach resort spa 4" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1039917.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, according to them, the cleaning was not always carried out efficiently.  In addition, sometimes maids forgot to exchange dirty towels for clean ones, as well as replenish supplies, for example, toilet paper.  However, after reporting this at the reception, the situation improved. </p><p>  As for the settlement, then, as our compatriots note in their reviews, upon arrival at the hotel you will most likely have to wait two hours in the afternoon.  The fact is that due to its rather low price this hotel is very popular, therefore, in the midst of the holiday season, it is almost always full, as they say, to the eyeballs.  However, you do not have to wait for the keys to the room at the reception.  So, you can go for breakfast or lunch, swim in the pool or go straight to the beach. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In general, on this item the opinions of guests of the Carelta Beach Resort &amp; Spa 4 *, the photo of which can be seen in this article, agree.  So, tourists believe that the food in this hotel is organized at a very decent level.  Of course, one does not have to rely on any culinary delights and delicacies.  But a varied menu of deliciously prepared dishes will be provided to you in the hotel restaurant every day.  In addition, guests can always have a bite to eat pizza, hamburger or sandwich in the snack bar and treat themselves to delicious cakes that will be baked specially for you.  Hotel guests were satisfied with the quality of the drinks offered in the bars. </p>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Since almost all travelers come to Turkey mainly for a beach holiday, this issue is a very important factor in the process of choosing a hotel.  As for the ‚ÄúKarelta Beach Resort &amp; Spa‚Äù, it is located on the seashore.  The hotel‚Äôs own beach is large enough.  There are sun loungers, parasols and a bar.  Entry into the water from the shore, according to tourists, is quite rocky.  It is advisable to go swimming in special shoes.  In addition, you can enter the sea by going down the ladder from the pier.  So you will immediately go to the depths and you do not have to go from the shore on the rocks. </p><p>  In general, travelers were satisfied with a beach holiday at this hotel.  However, our compatriots were disappointed with the behavior of some tourists who occupied the sunbeds early in the morning and sometimes as a result did not appear on the beach, spending time by the pool or elsewhere.  As a result, other guests who came to the beach could not get a free deck chair. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  As our compatriots note, you will have no time to miss the Carelta Beach Resort &amp; Spa 4 * hotel.  So, all day animators work at the pools.  They offer everyone to play water polo, darts, boccia, do water aerobics, gymnastics, and dance a bit.  Moreover, according to tourists, the animators here are real professionals in their field and do an excellent job with their work, relentlessly giving guests an excellent mood. </p>
