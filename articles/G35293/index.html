    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Of course, talking about Aurum Moon Hotel 5 *, reviews should also be noted with attention. </p><p>  According to tourists, the rooms are small, but very comfortable and have everything you need.  The hotel is well suited for large groups with children, it is never boring and for everyone there is entertainment for everyone.  Almost round-the-clock meals allow you not to rush to the opening and closing of restaurants, because there are many alternatives to a snack in snack bars. </p><p>  Special attention deserves a clean private sandy beach, where there are many sun loungers with umbrellas and you can always find a free place.  The entrance to the sea is quite smooth, there are almost no strong waves. </p><p>  Animation offers many games, water aerobics in the pool.  Children are especially pleased with the water park and the thematic kids club, where you can do anything from painting to watching your favorite cartoons. </p><p>  Many vacationers, judging by recent reviews of Aurum Moon Hotel 5 * (Didim), strongly recommend visiting an Asian restaurant.  Unusual salads with squid, mussels and other seafood are very popular here.  If you want to see the main attractions in nearby cities, it is better not to buy excursions in the hotel itself, since it is many times more expensive than buying at a travel agency outside the territory or going to see the surroundings yourself. </p>
