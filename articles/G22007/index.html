The space adjacent to the sanatorium is completely planted with trees and shrubs, and the area covers an average of about 5 hectares.  The boarding house is buried in thickets of pines brought from the Crimea and Pitsunda.  A bay of the city of Gelendzhik was built very close.  The construction of the first hotel from this chain dates back to 2008, however, despite its relatively advanced age, the hotel can be safely classified as modern and meets all European standards of the tourism business. </p><h2>  general information </h2>
