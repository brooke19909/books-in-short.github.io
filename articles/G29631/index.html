    <h2>  History (briefly) </h2><p>  They founded the city at the end of the XIX century.  Until 1949 it was considered a village.  It arose on the banks of the Tom River.  Until 1940 there was no industry in Jurg.  At that time it was just a village at the railway station.  Yurga (Kemerovo region) began its history as a city with the construction of an engineering plant.  He began to develop rapidly.  And the plant received the proud title of a city-forming enterprise.  In the war and post-war years, the first stage of development of the engineering plant began.  So, in 1943, Yurga, together with the district, were transferred to the Kemerovo region, which had just been formed.  Prior to this, the city was part of the Novosibirsk region. </p><h2>  City development </h2><p>  The machine-building plant developed and improved, and this was the beginning of the urban biography of Yurga.  Everything in this city was built according to special projects.  According to them, it was supposed to make Yurga one of the largest industrial and cultural centers of Siberia.  By 1950, the population of the city was 22 thousand people.  By this time, eight enterprises had already worked here, but the engineering plant remained the largest and leading.  Other institutions also gradually opened up: a hospital, a nursery, a kindergarten, two schools, and a technical school. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1949, Yurga (Kemerovo region) received the status of a city.  At first he was assigned to the settlements of regional subordination.  However, in 1953 the status was changed, and Yurga became a city of regional subordination. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemerovo region city of yurga" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1269255.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The economic growth </h2><p>  Since 1950, Yurga began its rapid economic growth.  The infrastructure of the city began to develop rapidly.  This served as an impetus for the increase in residential buildings, which at that time were being built at an accelerated pace. </p><p>  The peak of development of the city fell on the 60-80s.  Sustained economic growth was observed, positive processes were observed in all cultural spheres, as well as in sports and education. </p><p>  But since the mid-eighties, alarming trends have emerged in the urban economy.  Since 1992, the population began to decline.  The main reason was migration - people moved to larger cities. </p><h2>  The city of Yurga (Kemerovo region) is currently </h2><p>  At present, the engineering <span>enterprise</span> is still the <span>city-forming enterprise</span> .  Now it produces equipment designed for mines, heating units, loaders and other equipment.
