How can you not dream of them, especially since less and less days are left until the long-awaited summer vacation?  Even covering our eyes for a moment, we begin to dream of warm sand, waves rolling on the shore and a light sea breeze. </p><p>  Very often, novice tourists ask about which resort in Turkey is better.  After all, if you take into account many areas, it is actually quite difficult to make a choice.  And professionals, thinking, answer that they are all wonderful, although each has its own characteristics and charms.  Only by visiting at least a few of them, does the traveler understand where to go next time. </p><h2>  Why Turkey </h2>

    <p>  It should be noted that Turkey, despite its rather modest territory (for example, when compared with Russia), is very, very diverse.  Here you can relax every year, and each time to discover something new and unusual. </p><p>  If any country can surprise experienced travelers, it is Turkey.  The map of the resorts of the Mediterranean Sea is literally full of various cities, towns and villages.  In them, at any time of the year, you can discover something by familiarizing yourself with an amazing country and the unique culture of the local population. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many travelers, choosing a vacation destination, resort to specialized catalogs or booklets, which have completely different names, but, nevertheless, come down to one topic, which can be easily described as follows: ‚ÄúTurkey.

    <p>  The most popular in terms of tourism are cities located on the Mediterranean coast.  Why?  Well, firstly, thanks to the superbly developed infrastructure, which meets the requirements of all, even the most capricious, tourists.  Secondly, this territory is less susceptible to temperature fluctuations, and the cold currents in the summer here almost never threaten a comfortable beach holiday. </p><h2>  <strong>Aksu - the highlight of the season</strong> </h2><p>  It should be noted that this resort is considered quite young, so it is sometimes old-fashioned included in Antalya. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, this resort area is located in the cozy Aksu River Delta, which is about 25 km south of the aforementioned Antalya and only 20 km from the international airport. </p><p>  On the territory of Aksu, ancient eucalyptus trees and fragrant cloves grow everywhere.  If vacationers get tired of relaxing on wide beaches with golden sand, they can at any moment hide in the gentle shade of pine forests. </p><p>  And for all lovers of antiquities and history, excursions to the ruins left from the city of Perge are offered. </p><p>  Affordable prices allow people of completely different material well-being to relax here.  And, probably, if in this country it was possible to hold a competition called "The Best Youth Resorts of Turkey", then Aksu would certainly be in the top five. </p><h2>  Alanya - exactly what you need for a vacation with children <strong> </strong></h2>

    <p>  Talk about the resorts of Turkey on the Mediterranean Sea, and not to mention Antalya is simply impossible.  It is she who has the glory of the Turkish Riviera, and of course, not in vain.  After all, here a traveler will discover not only the most beautiful nature, but also many historical monuments. </p><p>  The coast of the Mediterranean Sea in this area is considered the most beautiful and cleanest. </p><p>  By the way, according to legend, it was here that the gods and goddesses lived.  Once upon a time, Antalya occupied absolutely the entire territory of Pamphylia, so the locals sometimes still call it "Land of All Tribes." </p><h2>  Antalya today: the sea and not only </h2>

    <p>  Let's get acquainted with another really unique and inimitable place.  Belek is rightfully considered a young, but already incredibly successful resort in the country.  And every year this popularity continues to grow. </p><p>  It is located 30 km from the well-known Antalya, just between the beautiful Taurus Mountains and the sea.  This resort was founded taking into account the new achievements of the tourism industry, but at the same time, architects managed to preserve all the natural landscapes. </p><p>  It should be noted that in Belek they are very careful about the ecological purity of their native city.  By the way, that is why right on the shore of the resort you can so often see turtles of endangered Caretta.  They are taken care of, so the animals have become almost tame.  They can be stroked and photographed without any problems. </p><p>  However, this is not all.  Interestingly, 574 species of plants grow in the vicinity of the city, and 29 of them are found exclusively in this area.  What is not a reserve? </p><h2>  Youth resorts in Turkey are always welcome guests </h2><p>  Belek is the most suitable destination for family or youth recreation: there are safe beaches and very calm currents.  Quiet <span>beaches, the gentle</span> sun allow children to safely swim in the cleanest water.  Here you can also go in for your favorite water sports, such as skiing, or learn to ride a scooter.  There are many hotels in the city, there are entire villages built specifically for tourists.  A map of Turkish resorts with cities or a modern navigator built into a laptop or phone will help you not get lost.  Golf clubs are very popular, attracting players of all levels to their walls.  Each hotel has tennis courts, pools, and wellness centers.  Belek is full of interesting places, which means that you definitely will not be bored.  Not far from the city is the ancient Roman beautiful city of Perge, where you can see the Aspendos Amphitheater, and in small, almost tiny Belek markets, as a rule, original souvenirs are purchased. </p><h2>  Ancient kemer </h2>

    <p>  When it comes to holidays in Turkey, Turkish resorts can come up with a variety of thoughts, but it‚Äôs simply impossible not to remember Kemer.  This relatively small town has an amazing history that dates back to the Neolithic era.  That is why there are so many ongoing archaeological excavations, sometimes found even in the city center.  Now it‚Äôs hard to even imagine that in ancient times all the beaches of Kemer were a port.  By the way, the ruins along the coast have still preserved the remains of a city in which trade flourished many years ago. </p><h2>  From the past to the present </h2><p>  Turkish resorts in the Mediterranean would probably be less well-known if it were not for Kemer, which used to be considered an ordinary fishing village, and now has become a popular tourist destination.  Stunning landscapes of the city create an unusual atmosphere for relaxation, because the place is surrounded by cozy, picturesque bays, pine forests, clear waters.  Note that this resort is located on the edge of the Taurus mountain range.  In the south of the region there are bays where you can go surfing, water skiing and even <span>sailing.</span>  Kemer's beaches are marked with the blue flag of the EU, which symbolizes the purity of water and the impeccable quality of sand.  On the coast, tourists will find many restaurants serving traditional delicacies with unusual seasonings and spices.

    <p>  The city of Side occupies a small peninsula on the Mediterranean <span>coast, its</span> width is only 300 m and its length is 800 m. However, despite all its smallness, this area is literally filled with fascinating sights.  Historians say that Side was once a shopping center and port.  The architecture of the city has its own unique style: the streets are built in the form of a kind of maze, and among them there are stone houses with a standard height of two floors.  The resort has all the conditions for a pleasant stay.  Here you can see the amphitheater of Ancient Greece with a capacity of 15 thousand people, the famous ancient Roman Temples of Apollo and Artemis, the chic City Gate and the museum.  And the most pleasant and indelible impression of Side is made by a usual walk in the evening city, when architectural monuments and ruins are illuminated by bright lights.  In general, talking about holidays in Turkey (Turkish resorts, in particular), one cannot but mention Side beaches.  Once on the coast, you can find rest to your taste.  For example, lovers of noisy relaxation will gladly stay in the center, visiting bars, restaurants, shops and discos, and lovers of silence, as a rule, rush away, enjoying the silence and desert of the landscapes that open. </p>
