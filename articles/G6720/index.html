Decorate the interior</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Typical space, standard furniture, boring interior.  Which of us does not want to break beyond the bounds of routine and boredom and create a different home environment, original, dynamic, creating a mood.  One of the techniques that miraculously transforms space is the painting of walls with your own hands.  <span>Decorating the walls with</span> paintings you can create a very original, unique interior.  In the children's room ‚Äúopen the door to the fairy-tale world‚Äù, in the bedroom, using symbolic images to create an atmosphere conducive to good rest and relaxation, in the living room there is an exquisite sophisticated interior.  For those who are not good at painting, ready-made stencils that can be bought in stores or ordered on the Internet will help to create wall paintings with their own hands in the interior of the apartment. </p><p>  One of the most interesting techniques creating a unique interior is fake painting, when the effect of volume and reality of an image is created using chiaroscuro and perspective.  Such a painting is done with acrylic paints, which are odorless, dry quickly, lie flat, steady and durable.  If you know how to draw, then painting the walls with your own hands is an opportunity for creative expression and creating a unique interior.  So where to start? </p><p>  Preparation for work </p><p>  Before starting the painting, you need to prepare a wall - the base, the "canvas" on which the painting will appear.  The wall should be very flat and smooth, without cracks and minor flaws.  We briefly describe the sequence of preparation of the wall.  First, the old coating, paint, plaster or lime is cleaned from it.  After that, all cracks are filled with gypsum-based putty.  All irregularities are sanded with <span>sandpaper.</span>  Then a layer of leveling putty is applied, after drying of which, the wall is again sanded, and then a layer of finish putty is applied.  Before applying each layer, the wall is treated with a primer for better adhesion of the layers.  After the wall becomes perfectly smooth, apply a layer of <span>acrylic primer,</span> which will become the basis for painting.  So, a completely flat, snow-white wall is prepared for further work. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Drawing the image on the wall </p><p>  The drawing must first be drawn on paper.  Then transfer it to the wall, enlarging the image to the desired size.  There is another, easier way.  Find a slide with your favorite plot.  Project it onto the wall using a slide projector and circle the outline of the drawing with pencil or charcoal.  Now you can start working with paints.  Paints are applied with natural bristle brushes.  Large volumes can be painted using a sponge or just a clean rag.  First draw the background and large shapes.  Paints are mixed on a palette, achieving the necessary shades and density of color.  To give the picture a realistic and volume create chiaroscuro using smooth transitions of shades of color.  After working out the main details, proceed to smaller ones, carefully drawing all the elements. </p><p>  The finished drawing is covered with a protective acrylic varnish, which will protect the image from various damage and moisture.  The varnish is applied with a soft brush in one direction.  After varnishing the entire wall, it is polished with a dry brush. </p><p>  Doing wall painting yourself using acrylic paints is not very difficult, especially for those who have artistic abilities and can draw.  You can use ready-made stencils for wall painting, complementing the drawing with small elements as you wish. </p><p>  Do-it-yourself wall painting is a monumental art form that requires quite a lot of physical and time costs.  If the soul asks for inspiration, I want to do some original work and introduce children to this, then you can recommend stone painting. </p><p>  Stone painting </p><p>  When resting on the sea or near the river, pay attention to the large, even and ‚Äúnaked‚Äù nudity lying along the coast and now and then falling under your feet.  This is great material for creativity. </p><p>  We take such an even and smooth pebble.  Degrease its surface with alcohol or acetone and primed with an acrylic primer, or PVA glue diluted with water.  Then we apply any drawing with a pencil, draw all the details with acrylic paints and varnish.  The work is ready.  Painted stones of sufficiently large sizes can decorate the interior.  Subjects for painting can be very different.  You can turn for inspiration to traditional folk crafts, the amazing fantastic plots of which attract with their brightness, originality and ease of execution.  For example, Severodvinsk painting uses traditional folk symbols - the bird Sirin, the tree of life, the mermaid, the fiery red lion.  Selecting and depicting a separate element of the painting, you can create a very original creation. </p>
