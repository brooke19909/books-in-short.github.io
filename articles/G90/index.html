Voikova, who is nearby. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The construction plan of the Voikovskaya station in the Moscow metro appeared back in 1938. Then it was mentioned in the 1957 scheme, but at that time the subway development program was often adjusted, so the construction began only in 1959.  Built in an open way according to a standard project. </p><p>  The station is a columned three-span structure with shallow laying.  The commissioning of Voykovskaya as part of the River Station - Sokol section took place on 12/31/1964.

Many Muscovites demand to rename it because of the criminal acts of Pyotr Voikov, who is considered involved in the murder of the family of Nicholas II. </p><p>  The question of renaming the station in November 2015 was even raised at the ‚ÄúActive Citizen‚Äù electronic referendum.  According to the results of the vote, 53 percent of the participants opposed the name change. </p><p>  Despite the completion of the survey, public debate continues to this day.
