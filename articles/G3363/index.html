During its development, the author must describe in detail such mandatory structural elements as the relevance of the presented topic, goals and objectives, as well as the object, subject of research. </p><p>  Many students, especially in the first and second year, have difficulties with the definition of these concepts.  Without them, structuring your knowledge, as well as writing quality work, will not work.  They will make it possible to understand what the object and <span>subject of research are,</span> examples and <span>definition of these</span> elements of any scientific work. </p><h2>  General definition </h2><p>  In dictionaries, there is a clear definition of what an <span>object and subject of research is.</span>  <span>Examples</span> of freshmen 's scientific work prove that the dry lines presented in official handbooks are not enough to clarify the understanding of these structural elements.  However, it should begin with definitions.  This will allow you to combine your knowledge with specific examples and understand the essence of things. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Object and subject of research examples" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1517266.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For example, if during the disclosure of information the object was chosen to implement the project, then its subject may be key points leading to the success of the presented enterprise. </p><p>  It should be remembered that those categories that are an object when revealing one topic may turn out to be a subject in the study of other problems.  It all depends on the point of view and approach to the study of information. </p><h2>  An object </h2><p>  In the process of writing the topic, the author must clearly indicate the object, subject, purpose of the study.  Examples allow you to understand what applies to each category.  An object usually implies some part of the intangible or material world that surrounds us.  This reality exists no matter what we know about it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Objective Object Object Research Object Examples" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1517259.jpg" width="484"></div>

    <p>  To obtain certain new knowledge, it is necessary to highlight a key point in the field of activity in which the research takes place.  The problem raised in a specific topic should be transformed into a specific formulation of one of the sides of the object. </p><p>  The subject of scientific work exists only in the mind of the author.  It completely depends on the knowledge of the researcher.  It is possible to select one or several sides of an object purely abstractly.  Moreover, the remaining processes characterizing the existence of an object can be taken into account or not taken into account. </p><h2>  Figurative example </h2><p>  Students, even after reading the definitions, may have a question about <span>how to determine the object and subject of research.</span>  <span>The examples</span> presented figuratively can contribute to the awareness of the categories presented. </p><p>  Suppose a researcher is a student.  He studies, walks, lives in a dormitory, eats every day in the dining room.  This is a figurative model of his life today.  Everything that is happening with the student is an object of research. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to determine the object and subject of research examples" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1517263.jpg" width="463"></div>

    <p>  Over time, his life may change.  Suppose a student moved to another city.  There is also a university that he attends, other housing and socializing.  But, nevertheless, he leads the same life as before.  The object of study has not changed, but only adjusted to today's realities. </p><p>  The subject in the presented example may be the student‚Äôs movement in transport, his meals in a cafe, or attending lectures.  This is one component of his life. </p><h2>  Choice of categories of economic theme </h2><p>  To transfer the presented example to the plane of writing a scientific work, it is necessary to consider the <span>object and subject of research</span> on a specific topic <span>.</span>  <span>Economic examples</span> will be one of the best ways to learn new knowledge. </p><p>  For example, the student received the topic "The system of managing the currency resources of the state."  At the same time, the choice of an object and an object does not have clearly defined boundaries.  Therefore, each researcher has the right to choose when stating the categories presented.  The teacher can advise on which side it is better to consider the topic presented, but the student must decide for himself from what point of view to study the problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Object and subject of study economic examples" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1517262.jpg" width="538"></div>

    <p>  As an object of the presented topic, for example, financial relations in the state can serve.  This is something massive.  But setting the topic will nevertheless indicate the boundaries of future research. </p><p>  Any part of the found object can be the subject of research.  For example, this may be the role of the Central Bank in the implementation of financial relations between entities. </p><h2>  Some more examples </h2><p>  For almost any topic, it will be easy to choose the <span>object and subject of research.</span>  <span>The examples are</span> also quite informative.  The topic could be Family and Marriage.  The object of research in this case may be the rights and obligations of members of family relationships.  The subject of the study is the rights and obligations of children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The object and subject of research are examples of law" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1517264.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If, for example, the topic on computer science is given ‚ÄúFeatures and Principles of E-mail Operation‚Äù, then the object will be e-mail, and the subject will be the basic principles of its functioning. </p><h2>  Mistakes </h2><p>  The leaders of <span>scientific research work</span> highlight the main mistakes that students make.  Moreover, typical discrepancies can occur when the author determines the <span>object and subject of research.</span>  <span>Examples of</span> errors will help to prevent them in their work. </p><p>  When designating an object of research, according to the opinion of teachers of various educational and scientific institutions, some deviations are possible.  Typical errors are the category inconsistency with the topic, as well as too narrow boundaries.  This does not allow a full study. </p><p>  In determining the subject of the study, the authors also make typical mistakes.  Among the most common named inconsistency with his chosen object.  Sometimes an item goes beyond its borders.  It may also be a mistake to identify too broad a research boundary.  A full scientific team is required to fully cover such research. </p><p>  <span>Having studied the object and subject of the study, examples of the</span> designation of which were examined in detail, each author will be able to correctly identify these categories.  This makes it possible to structure student knowledge.  When reading his work, it is much easier to understand what is at stake. </p>
