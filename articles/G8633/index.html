There are several types of it.  Here are the simplest ones.  All of them are performed using a needle with a thread on a prepared area of ‚Äã‚Äãtissue, where the transverse threads are removed. </p><ul><li>  Tassels.  We extend the needle with the working thread through 3-5 main threads and tighten them with a loop.  Similarly, we sew stitches to the end of the row. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  Columns.  These are the same brushes, only they are made on both sides of the fabric.  An elegant lace can be stretched between them. </li><li>  Merezhka splinter.  Consists of their brushes, made in a checkerboard pattern. </li><li>  Goat.  Joins the columns, each time the junction is shifted, and a cross is obtained. </li><li>  Flooring.  The working thread is pulled together in a fairly dense surface, which is similar to smooth embroidery. </li></ul><p>  This is only part of the patterns that make up the hem.  How to make them?  First you need to practice on a small piece of fabric, and only then you can start embroidering.  If you do the work slowly and carefully, you will get a beautiful pattern, because the hemming is done as evenly as possible, and the work turns out to be even and smooth. </p><p>  Skilled embroiderers add beads to the patterns, and several more variations are obtained.  It is also possible to tape with ribbons.  This pattern turns out to be voluminous, and if you choose the right color for the <span>ribbon, the embroidery</span> will look very impressive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Simple step </h2><p>  Step by step, we‚Äôll look at how to do a filing.  For beginners, acquaintance with this type of needlework is best done with embroidery on cotton or linen.  It holds its shape well, does not slip, and threads are clearly visible on it. </p><p>  We make an incision along the edge of the cotton fabric and pull out several transverse threads with tweezers.  First we process the edges so that they do not crumble.  Then we pull together the prepared needle with a white thread together with a loop of 5-10 threads.  Each loop is fixed on the canvas.  Thus we pass both edges.  Now we cross adjacent beams in pairs, fixing them in the center with an additional thread.  This is a very simple way to knit fabric.  Such simple embroidery will be an elegant element of any thing, in addition, the funds used to complete the work are minimal, which saves the budget. </p><p>  If you choose the right combination of fabric and thread colors, you can get a very beautiful pattern that will be a vivid example of how to make a hemstitch.  For beginners in this type of needlework, such embroidery will allow you to master the methods and techniques of work.  Such a pattern can decorate a kitchen towel, a pocket on a blouse, a pillowcase. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a stretch on the fabric" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1098074.jpg" width="468"></div>

    <h2>  Merezhka on the canvas </h2><p>  Now let‚Äôs look at how to draw a canvas on a canvas with a ‚Äúsplit‚Äù pattern. </p><p>  The canvas is quite loose, so you need to work with it carefully, otherwise the embroidery can be ruined.  But at the same time, such a rare weaving will help to complete the drawing correctly, especially for a beginner needlewoman. </p><p>  First you need to learn how to pull the strings.  This is done with a blade that cuts about six strings.  You shouldn‚Äôt do a wide step, as the pattern in this case will be lost. </p><p>  First we go through one edge.  It is better to process it immediately so that it does not dissolve further.  Then, in the same way, we draw up the second edge. </p><p>  When the canvas is prepared, we proceed to the drawing.  Consider how you can make a phased step by step.  For beginners, the ‚Äúsplit‚Äù pattern will be uncomplicated.  On one side of the embroidery we carry out a brush of two threads.  We carefully pass the seam so that the loops are clearly visible.  On the other side, we connect the threads of different columns into one brush. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to do a canvas" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1098030.jpg" width="504"></div>

    <p>  You can combine several strips of embroidery made with a different pattern, and if you add colored threads, the pattern will turn out bright. </p><h2>  On a napkin </h2><p>  At the next stage of acquaintance with this type of embroidery, we will consider how to make a hem on a napkin. </p><p>  Along the edge of the napkin, leaving room for a hem, pull out eight to ten threads from the fabric.  Let‚Äôs go through all the edges in this way.  Now do the hem.  Next, you can begin to embroider.  Sew always from left to right. </p><p>  We fasten the thread by making several stitches.  We collect from 4 to 8 threads on the needle (optional).  The needle goes from right to left horizontally.  Then we stick the needle from the wrong side and tighten the working thread to form a brush.  Thus, go along the entire length of the napkin.  It must be remembered that the brushes should be the same thickness, so you need to carefully consider the number of threads.  Also pay attention to the passage of the corners so that they are neat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a napkin" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1098059.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This work clearly shows how to do a simple paper towel. </p><h2>  Interesting hobby </h2><p>  This type of needlework can be a fascinating hobby.  Decorate clothes and home decoration - what could be more fun! </p><p>  Depending on the state of acquaintance with this technique, needlewomen can embroider work in a different range: from a small thin embroidery, which acts as a decorative element, to complex flat patterns.  The same applies to the color scheme: white sewing can be replaced by colorful stitches. </p><p>  You can decorate a tablecloth or bedding, a festive blouse or a ribbon on a hat with a cordon.  In any case, using the basic techniques, you can experiment and apply different combinations of colors and patterns. </p><p>  Slow painstaking work will allow you to relax, and the end result will leave a feeling of satisfaction in the soul. </p>
