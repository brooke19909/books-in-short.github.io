Leading universities of this wonderful city make it possible to become certified specialists.  The inter-university campus (MSG) is becoming the second home for students. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  MSH in St. Petersburg began to be built in 1964 in a wasteland, among the marshy soils of the city of Leningrad.  On March 5, 1966, the grand opening of the long-awaited complex took place. </p><p>  Time flew and the town developed rapidly.  A cultural and leisure and sports center has opened, construction of new houses for more than 3,500 places has continued. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gov.spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="MSG students" class="if uuid-2697692" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98439/2697692.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  MSG of St. Petersburg is located in the green zone.  It is surrounded by two parks - "Victory" and "Aviators" at Novoizmalovsky Prospekt 16, building 1. From the metro station "Victory Park" walk only 10 minutes. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The interuniversity campus is not an ordinary dormitory.  It accommodates more than 9,000 students from 34 <span>universities in St. Petersburg.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="unecon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="MSH infrastructure" class="if uuid-2697705" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98439/2697705.jpg"></div><p>  Student buildings here are called houses.  These are ten equipped 10-story buildings and two administration buildings.  In the last three buildings of the town are a student clinic, two laundries with a self-service system and a library.  MSG management, as well as the institution of continuing education, are provided with computer rooms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Security </h2><p>  MSH is the safest place to stay for both local and nonresident students.  Along the perimeter of the building, they are protected by metal fences, and 120 video surveillance cameras allow you to monitor the safety of the town as much as possible.  Entrance is through checkpoints only with special electronic cards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourniquet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="MSG Turnstiles" class="if uuid-2697648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98439/2697648.jpg"></div><p>  MSG in St. Petersburg is equipped with a modern fire safety system, an alarm system and <span>smoke</span> and heat <span>sensors</span> .

Each floor is equipped with its own toilet and shower stalls.  Also for convenience, at the other end of the corridors is a kitchen with tables, sinks and stoves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="old.petersburgcup.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dorm rooms" class="if uuid-2697644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98439/2697644.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes in the newspapers and social networks there are not quite positive reviews about the hostel of the MSG of St. Petersburg.  A common cause of conflicts and misunderstandings is very strict control at checkpoints and malfunctioning key cards. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Nuances of student service </h2><p>  On the territory of the MSG of St. Petersburg there are 3 laundries.  One is located in the first economic building, and the other on the second.  Each laundry room is equipped with over 80 washing machines.

These establishments operate from 8:00 to 21:00. </p><h2>  About sport </h2><p>  A complex of 15 gyms has been built on the territory of MSG in St. Petersburg, the total area of ​​which is 22,000 m <sup>2</sup> .  It is designed to engage in various sports: football, basketball, volleyball, handball and even tennis.
