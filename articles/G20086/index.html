  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Xenon lamp Philips D4S: description, technical parameters</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, many people have cars.  Due to the large number of vehicles and poor lighting, accidents have become more frequent.  For this reason, it is worth very carefully approaching the choice of lamps for your car.  <span>The</span> Philips D4S <span>Xenon Lamp</span> is a great choice for several reasons. </p><h2>  Xenon lamp description </h2><p>  Here it is worth starting with the fact that xenon lamps are very different from ordinary ones.  The main difference lies in their work.  The <span>Philips</span> D4S xenon <span>lamp</span> , like any other, does not work by heating the filament, but by passing an electric discharge between the electrodes.  Because of this, an electric arc arises.  It is even more appropriate to note here that in this case it is not an arc, but a plasma.  Explain the appearance of the glow is quite simple. </p><p>  It has a conical shape formed near the cathode.  The strength of the luminescence depends on the proximity to the cathode and decreases with distance from it.  The glow of the Philips D4S xenon lamp is very similar to daylight, as the light emits evenly and travels across the entire spectrum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="factoryxenon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips xenon lamp" class="if uuid-3112495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/3112495.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of lamp D4S </h2><p>  A distinctive feature of lamps from this manufacturer is their complete environmental friendliness, since they do not contain mercury.  There is a certain distinguishing feature that helps to determine the original model - the presence of a green electrode on such a lamp.  On cars such as Lexus and Toyota, such lamps are installed at the factory.  As for the color temperature for the Philips D4S xenon lamp, it‚Äôs 4,300 K. The luminous flux of the device is 3,200 lumens, and the lamp power is 35 watts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of the pluses of Philips lamps is its high level of protection against accidents.  This is because the overall visibility has been greatly improved and the coverage of the roadway has also been improved.  Xenon lamp Philips D4S 42402 original is one of the best representatives of lighting products from this manufacturer.  The company is considered a leader in this field, as its lamps have the highest brightness. </p><p>  Korean or Chinese manufacturers produce lamps with a brightness of no more than 2,700 lumens, and therefore Philips lamps with a brightness of 3,200 lumens exceed them quite strongly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.auto-led-shop.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xenon lamp" class="if uuid-3112497" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/3112497.jpg"></div><h2>  Lamp Features and Specifications </h2><p>  One of the features of the lamp is an increase in the reflectivity of both road markings and road signs.  This greatly facilitates night trips, as the driver is less tired of the constant search for signs and markings in low light.  The same has a positive effect on the prevention of accidents. </p><p>  As for the technical characteristics, they are as follows: </p><ul><li>  the base of this lamp, as the name implies, is D4S; </li><li>  color temperature, as previously mentioned, 4,300 K; </li><li>  Xenon lamp power consumption 35 W; </li><li>  the life of one lamp is about 4,000 hours; </li><li>  The country of origin of this product is Germany; </li><li>  brightness is 3,200 lumens; </li><li>  42402 is the manufacturer code, which is indicated in the name of the product. </li></ul><p>  Since the products are very famous, many try to fake them.  For this reason, the manufacturer made one significant difference.  You must ask for two xenon lamps at the store or from the seller.  They have a marking, and for fakes it will be the same on all copies.  For original lamps, the manufacturer's code consists of 4-6 characters, constantly changing on each lamp. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.clublexus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lamp marking" class="if uuid-3112498" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/3112498.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about the Philips D4S xenon lamp are pretty good.  Buyers note the excellent brightness of these lamps, as well as their long life.  The owners of such devices also note that the high cost is justified by the quality of the products and warn against buying a fake.  In addition to labeling, you should pay attention to the price tag.  Original lamps cost from 3,000 rubles.  As for the disadvantages, it is the need to replace both light sources when only one burns out. </p>
