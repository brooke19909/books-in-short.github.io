  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holiday pay</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every working citizen knows that once a year the employer is obliged to give him leave, while retaining his <span>job.</span>  The payment of vacation pay should be made on time and in full. </p><p>  Six months after applying for a job, an employee has the right to go on paid leave.  This vacation is usually 28 days.  However, depending on where a person works, he may be more.  And people who work at hazardous facilities and work in harmful conditions, as well as those who have irregular working hours, are granted additional holidays during the year.  An example of such work is labor in a mine or on a shift basis, for example, in areas belonging to the territories of the <span>Far North</span> (here workers are provided with an additional 24 days of vacation).  And in areas equated to the northern regions, additional leave is 16 days.  In order to avoid confusion, the company maintains a vacation schedule, which usually amounts to before the new year. </p><p>  Since the vacation is called paid, it would be logical to consider the procedure for paying vacation pay.  Firstly, the employee that he is sent on vacation should be warned in two weeks.  And secondly, strictly three days before the holidays, vacation pay is made.  These deadlines are final and not subject to change, otherwise, if the employer has violated at least one of these conditions, the employee may demand that the leave be transferred to another time convenient for him. </p><p>  Holiday pay is calculated based on several indicators.  It should be noted that the vacation includes the number of calendar days minus the holidays that fall during this period.  That is, holidays are not paid, but affect the <span>duration of the vacation,</span> increasing it.  Another component for calculating vacation pay is the average salary calculated over the 12 previous months.  If the leave is granted after six months of work, then, accordingly, the estimated period must be taken from the moment the employee begins to work in the organization.  When the billing period is determined, the employee‚Äôs earnings are calculated, which will be the average for the above period.  Please note that the total amount is affected by some allowances, such as a general increase in salaries, monthly bonuses.  According to the law, sick days, business trips, forced leave, etc. are deducted from the billing period.  The payment of vacation pay, or rather the amount assigned to the issue, is calculated by a special formula.  Usually for this they take the average indicator of days in one month - exactly 29.4. </p><p>  If the billing period has been completely worked out, then to determine the vacation pay it is necessary to divide the amount of accruals of this period by 12 months, then divide it again by 29.4.  Multiply the result by the number of vacation days (calendar).  However, when calculating the average salary, sick days are deducted from 12 months and the time when the employee took <span>leave without maintenance.</span>  To calculate the average income of an employee per day, you need to divide the amount of earnings received during the billing period by the number of days that a person worked.  The amount payable is calculated as follows: the average number obtained in calculating the daily earnings must be multiplied by the number of days on vacation. </p><p>  This is the standard scheme for calculating and paying vacation pay.  However, the law provides for cases when vacation is calculated specifically on working days.  This rule applies to those who are engaged in seasonal work.  These categories of workers are granted leave in a different way, namely: for each month of work - two days.  At the same time, the <span>average</span> daily <span>earnings are</span> also calculated by dividing the amount accrued for payment at the end of the month by the number of working days.  The default calculations are for a six-day work week. </p>
