    <p>  Back in early November 1962, Soviet testers E. Andreev and P. Dolgov received a task from the leadership of the Air Force to rise to a height of over 25 kilometers and make a jump from the stratosphere.  In this case, the goal was quite specific: to test how parachutes will behave when opened at different heights.  If E. Andreev‚Äôs experience as a whole was a success, then for P. Dolgov this jump ended tragically: at the time of the jump from the gondola the helmet was damaged, and the officer simply suffocated due to a lack of oxygen.  Andreev‚Äôs indicators for the speed and height of free fall have long been considered record-breaking and have been recorded in the Guinness Book of Records. </p><p>  Another notable jump from the stratosphere was made in mid-August 1960 by the American D. Kittinger.  The indicators here were even more impressive: the height of the stratospheric balloon exceeded 31 thousand meters.  However, this jump was not recorded as a record for the reason that a stabilizing parachute was used during the descent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Felix Baumgartner Stratosphere Jump" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8880/218913.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, we can conclude that the parachute jump from the stratosphere by itself was not something out of the ordinary, mankind had mastered all the stages of its implementation quite a long time ago.  However, this does not detract from the merits of Felix Baumgartner, who on October 14, 2012 showed an outstanding result, having closed several records at once. </p><p>  Firstly, the jump from the stratosphere itself was carried out from a height of just over 39 kilometers.  A record is the indicator of the rise of the stratospheric balloon, which had never before exceeded the "modest" 35 kilometers.  Secondly, for the first time in a <span>free fall, a</span> person overcame a <span>sound barrier,</span> and the maximum speed reached 1342 kilometers per hour.  Finally, thirdly, F. Baumgartner made a real show of this event, and the number of views of this historical event on the Internet exceeded all conceivable and unimaginable indicators. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Stratosphere Parachute Jump" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8880/218964.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Actually, the jump from the stratosphere, carried out on October 14, 2012 was the result of a long and painstaking work, which took more than seven years, and several tens of millions of dollars were spent.  These funds were spent on designing and creating a special capsule for a stratospheric balloon, as well as on tailoring a special suit.  In addition, F. Baumgartner made hundreds of jumps from various positions, checking how enormous overloads are perceived by his body. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the jump from the stratosphere was accompanied by a number of problems (for example, such that the fall was originally planned from a much lower altitude, but the stratostat behaved unpredictably and rose higher), in general, he demonstrated the enormous opportunities that mankind has for implementing the most daring plans. </p>
