    <p>  It is not known who was the author of the stele of Naramsin.  It was created from sandstone.  Its height is approximately two meters.  The stela is still considered a masterpiece of Mesopotamian art. </p><h2>  Reason for creating </h2><p>  <span>The stele of Naramsin was made in the years 2300-2100 BC.</span>  <span>It is dedicated to the campaign of the Akkadian king against the powerful Lullubeys.</span>  <span>That was the name of the ancient people who lived in the upper reaches of the Diyala River.</span>  <span>The name of the tribe translates as ‚Äústrangers,‚Äù although this information is not accurate.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>The people were distinguished by their militancy, but Naramsin managed to subjugate the Lullubeys.</span>  <span>It was this event that was immortalized on the stele.</span>  <span>However, Akkad could not long keep the warlike tribe in subjection.</span>  <span>Soon they again became independent and were able to continue attacks on the territory of the southern Mesopotamia.</span> </p><h2>  Artifact moving </h2><p>  <span>Originally, the Stela of King Naramsin was established in Sippar.</span>  <span>Translated from the Sumerian language, this name means "city of birds."</span>  <span>The state existed on the territory of modern Iraq, where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers are closest to each other.</span>  <span>The city was engaged in trade and did not seek to strengthen its political power.</span>  <span>There, the stele stood for a thousand years.</span> </p><p>  <span>After she was moved to Susa.</span>  <span>This was done after a successful campaign on the Babylonia of the Elamite king Jutruk-Nahhunte I.</span>  <span>Susa were located on the territory of modern Iran (Khuzestan province).</span>  <span>During the existence of the kingdom, Elam Susa was its capital.</span>  <span>It was in this city that the researchers discovered the Naramsin stela.</span>  <span>Photos of this masterpiece can now be made not in Susa.</span>  <span>Then where?</span> </p><p>  <span>Today, the stele is one of the most valuable exhibits of the Louvre.</span>  <span>As you know, the museum is located in the capital of France.</span>  <span>What is a masterpiece of ancient art?</span> </p><h2>  Description of the historical monument </h2><p>  <span>The victorious stele of Tsar Naramsin has a spiral-like construction of figures on a plane.</span>  <span>In this, it differs significantly from the Sumerian composition creation technique.</span>  <span>For the plot, military actions in the mountains were chosen.</span>  <span>The stele itself resembles the top of a mountain, tapering to the top.</span> </p>

    <p>  Creation consists of three compositional lines.  They go almost parallel from the bottom up.  This made it possible to show the path of Naramsin‚Äôs troops, his ascent to the top of the mountain.  Warriors of the king ascend the parallel slopes.  This practically does not happen in life, usually people climb the winding spiral roads. </p><p>  Also, the place of transition from the slope to the slope is not indicated.  Spectators can only guess how the king was on top.  There are also violations in proportions in the image.  For example, the warriors who climb the hillside look smaller than the figure of Naramsin, who stands on top. </p><h2>  Description of the figure of Naramsin </h2>
