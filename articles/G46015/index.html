This system in the car is characterized by a huge number of instruments and devices.  When it comes to joining the two systems, even experienced auto electricians can remember all the curses and have more gray hair.  This is especially true for issues when you need to integrate an alarm into a regular electrical system.  Let's see how to connect the alarm to the central lock quickly and without stress. </p><h2>  Central locking device </h2><p>  The central lock is a rather complex system, which includes electrical as well as mechanical components.  This system makes it possible to carry out various manipulations with all the locks of the car at the same time.  To do this, the driver just needs to turn the key or press the small button on the remote control.  The system is able to control not only door locks, but also the gas tank hatch lock and the boot lid.  The design of the system can be quite complicated, and the process of connecting the security system to the central lock without any knowledge of its structure is impossible. </p><p>  The central lock consists of several connected elements.  This control unit, sensors on the doors, buttons, as well as activators. </p><h2>  Control block </h2><p>  This is nothing but the brain of a central lock.  Several years ago, this unit was placed in a single housing with a connector, and no one had any problems with such a task as connecting the alarm to a standard central lock. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="efcaviation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connect the alarm to the standard central lock" class="if uuid-2254560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2254560.jpg"></div><p>  In more recent auto models, this block can be branched into separate elements.  These parts can be located in different places of the cabin and the engine compartment.  The function of this unit is to monitor the status of limit switches, as well as buttons and contacts.  In some models, the unit is additionally equipped with a remote control radio signal receiver.  The most difficult part in the process of connecting an alarm is to find this unit. </p><h2>  Sensors and Buttons </h2><p>  These devices may include door limit switches.  Some alarms have pins to connect to them.  Also included is a button for opening and closing doors. </p><h2>  Actuators </h2><p>  These elements directly affect the lock mechanism.  They are of two types - electric or pneumatic.  On VAZ cars, electric actuators. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.minitrailers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect an alarm to a central lock?" class="if uuid-2254576" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2254576.jpg"></div><p>  Pneumatics is now a rarity.  The electric actuator is a small electric motor with a gearbox, which converts the rotational movements of the motor into reciprocating - the actuator rod moves.  There are two types of systems - with one motor and with two.  The latter is more popular.  In such an activator, one motor serves to close, the second to open.  The electric drive is powered by a pulsed current source - the signal comes from the control unit, and it is short-term.  If a current of more than one second is applied to the actuators, the device simply burns out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Types of central locks </h2><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter which alarm system - Sheriff, Lopard or Starline.  Before connecting the alarm to the central lock, you need to find the central locking control unit.  And here the owner faces a very interesting task.  After all, different types of central locks differ in various schemes for connecting.  The fact is that in certain models and brands of cars their central locks can be used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fordtransit.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect the alarm to the central lock on the &quot;Prior&quot;?" class="if uuid-2254559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2254559.jpg"></div><p>  For example, when connecting the <span>Tomahawk alarm</span> to the Golf 4 car, there will be one algorithm - with a positive impulse.  If you need to connect the alarm to the central lock on the "Grant", then everything will be completely different - with a negative.  Consider each connection method in detail. </p><h2>  Positive pulse center </h2><p>  In this case, the actuators are controlled by a positive pulse.  Such central locks can most often be found on models from Volkswagen and General Motors.  The connection diagram will be as follows.  They take an ordinary probe with a lamp and look for a wire, when applying +12 V, the door will open.  Then, when it was possible to find the right wire, they find out what conclusions the alarm has.  These can be low-current conclusions or power ones.  In the case of the former, the alarm is connected to the wires through diodes for the corresponding voltage.  In the case of power, a normally open contact is connected to the plus.  At the same time, closed ones do not connect.  General - to those contacts that were found during the search. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Negative pulse center </h2><p>  This scheme is used at Opel, Grant, Priore and all other VAZs, where the central lock is standard.  As for the connection instructions, it is similar to the above, but the opposite is true.  A negative control wire is found and then -12 V is applied to it. For low-current outputs, they are connected to the wires through diodes.  A negative wire will be connected to the power terminals on a normally open contact.  To the general conclusions are all the wires found. </p><h2>  How to connect to the VAZ? </h2><p>  Such a problem as connecting an alarm to a central lock faced AvtoVAZ car owners after 2000.  Previously in the trim levels, this option was absent.  VAZ castle has its own characteristics, which must be taken into account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="efcaviation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connect the alarm to the central lock VAZ-2114" class="if uuid-2254563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2254563.jpg"></div><p>  Before you start connecting, you need to understand these features.  Actuators based on electric motors are installed as actuators in each door.  <span>Central</span> locking <span>control is</span> provided in any alarm. </p><p>  Without exception, all standard central locking systems that are installed at the plant, as already noted above, are controlled from a negative impulse.  How to connect the alarm to the central lock, we briefly examined.  But nothing can be added about this.  To connect the alarm to the central locking control unit, you should find the negative control wire and apply -12 V from the alarm unit to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.minitrailers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect an alarm to a central lock?" class="if uuid-2254567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2254567.jpg"></div><p>  If an imported lock from a foreign car is installed on the car, then most often the central locking with positive control is in them.  How to connect the alarm to the central lock on the "Prior", if the central locking with "Opel"?  We need a positive control wire, which should be connected to the corresponding pin on the alarm unit. </p><h2>  Practice connection </h2><p>  Let's see how to connect an alarm to a central lock in practice.  To install it, you will need a set of screwdrivers, a set of wrenches, a soldering iron and soldering accessories.  You will also need a multi-colored single-core wire, a multimeter, insulation and fasteners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.minitrailers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connect the alarm to the central lock &quot;Grant&quot;" class="if uuid-2254566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2254566.jpg"></div><p>  The first step is to find the unit that controls the operation of the central castle.  VAZ cars will have to tinker with the search for a long time.  The central locking unit is located near the stove in the passenger front seat area behind the plastic plug.  I must say that its location is extremely inconvenient.  To work as convenient as possible, you need to disassemble the car interior. </p><p>  When connecting, it is better to select a wire of the same colors as the wires from the central locking control unit.  It depends on which alarm model whether additional relays are needed.  In some cases, fuses and power switches may not cope with the load. </p><p>  The easiest way to connect the alarm to the central lock of the VAZ-2114 and other similar models is to solder the control wires into a gap.  In most models, you should look for a wire of white and brown color.  You will need a four-wire cable, which is laid from the relay in the alarm unit to the door actuator control connector. </p><div class="photo" data-original="efcaviation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect the alarm to the central lock?" class="if uuid-2254562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2254562.jpg"></div><p>  To avoid problems when operating the central lock in a car, it is necessary to carry out work with the battery disconnected.  Any wiring should be connected only by soldering or using terminals (insulation is required).  A cable or wire is taken with a margin.  Then the cords are laid in bundles and fixed on the body elements.  Compliance with the color of the cable will help in the case when you need to quickly find the right cord. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Here's how to connect the alarm to the central lock.  As you can see, this work can be done with your own hands.  However, after completing the installation, do not rush to collect the car interior.  It is necessary to carefully check the system in all operating modes.  Sometimes during the installation process small problems may come to light - something does not work that way, or one of the locks does not open from the button.  If the interior has already been assembled, you have to do a reassembly.  But if the connection was performed according to the scheme, then everything will work the first time. </p>
