The fortress that stands there has preserved a medieval atmosphere.  Moreover, to see her, you do not need to leave the borders of the country.  Many travelers like the historical places that St. Petersburg offers.  Vyborg can also be a place of wonderful relaxation, which can be combined with educational excursions.  The fortress was in the possession of the Swedes until the 18th century, after which it was controlled by Russia until the beginning of revolutionary times.  In fact, the fortress is relatively small, but it is well built and for many centuries was used to defend the city and the entire direction.  The castle is a popular destination for tourists.  But do not confuse this fortress with a theater called Holy Fortress (Vyborg) in the guidebooks.  This attraction, by the way, is also worth a visit during your stay in the city. </p><h2>  Fortress history </h2><p>  The construction of this castle at the end of the 13th century was undertaken by the Swedes after the Karelian settlement located in this territory was devastated.  It was this place that was not chosen by chance, since it makes it possible to control the river.  At the end of the XIII - the beginning of the XVI century, Novgorodians made unsuccessful attempts to capture the fortress. </p>

    <p>  Due to the fact that there was a constant external threat, the building was periodically improved.  So, over time, the Olaf tower was erected, and already in the 15th century, magnificent interior decoration was provided and additional fortifications were built.  In 1710, the troops commanded by Peter the Great took the castle (as well as the whole of Vyborg).  The fortress suffered destruction during the siege, and when it began to be restored, the interior was changed.  Two centuries later, the building was again tried to be improved, but then the changes affected internal planning.  There were no arched vaults that replaced the beams.  In addition, a number of new windows have been added.  After the revolutionary events, the fortress was lost, and it was returned only after the Second World War. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Castle structure </h2><p>  It should be noted that the territory on the island where the fortress is located is small, but nevertheless there are a large number of buildings on it.  The wall that strengthens the coast meets on the way to the castle.  Further, when a series of gates will be passed, the visitor gets to the first courtyard.  If you fall into the ranks of internal fortifications, you can find a passageway that allows you to go around the castle around.  Some buildings were built relatively recently, apparently when the fortress was already captured. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment inside the castle </h2><p>  In the upper courtyard, as a rule, there are children's attractions.  For example, the guys here can go in for archery, participate in driving round dances.  There is also a small shop selling armor and weapons.  At first glance, it is not so easy to engage in reconstruction of medieval European events in the castle, because at that time the building was not captured, like Vyborg.  The fortress nonetheless gathers lovers of such entertainments that hold grand tournaments.  And if we talk about the activities of those who are fond of historical reconstruction, then they are gathered here by individual clubs and organizations.  Participants compete in armor in the fight with swords, experienced riders participate in fights.  Entertainment in Vyborg is good in the spring, when the weather is not so disturbed by bad weather. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Olaf Tower </h2><p>  This building is the heart of the fortress, and the whole city.  This place is proud of Vyborg.  The fortress is also known for photographs of the Olaf tower, which rises over the city by as much as forty-eight meters.  A special atmosphere is present in this place due to the fact that the fire destroyed the internal structures, because the climb up is carried out using wooden scaffolding.  The passage is often narrow and sometimes hangs over an empty place.  If it‚Äôs difficult for you to climb, you can sit on a bench halfway.  When staying in Vyborg, be sure to visit the Olaf Tower, because it offers a unique view of Vyborg. </p>

    <h2>  Museums </h2><p>  Among other things, on the territory of the castle you can see the exposition of two museums - local history and the history of the fortress.  Each of them is interesting in its own way.  In the museum of the fortress you will learn a lot about the Russian-Swedish confrontation and the historical periods in which this region developed.  In local history you will find a simple and concise exposition with a good design.  The second museum will be interesting for those who want to learn more about the nature of the Karelian Isthmus. </p><h2>  How to get there and what to bring with you? </h2><p>  Food is not sold on the castle‚Äôs territory, but it is located in the central part of the city, so it‚Äôs easy to find a place to eat here.  There is a restaurant not far from the site on which the fortress in Vyborg stands.  The name of the institution is ‚ÄúRound Tower‚Äù.  Here you will enjoy delicious food and interesting entertainments. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the cost of entrance tickets to the tower and museums is 100 rubles. </p>
