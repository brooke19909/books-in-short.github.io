  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top Android apps from coandroid.ru</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many people can not choose which game to put on their smartphone to play in transport or free time.  To help in this matter, the arrival of the site <noindex>  <span>http://coandroid.ru</span> </noindex>  on which everyone can find something for themselves. </p><p>  We present the list of the best games for Android: </p><p>  1st place is occupied by the game "2048" <br><br>  This game is available on both Android and iOS.  Even if you are a person who does not like puzzles and generally does not like to think again, this game will still catch you.  She is cheerful, interesting, but at the same time, to go through it, you will have to think a little.  The meaning of the game is to make the number 2048, by adding the same numbers (2 + 2, 4 + 4, 8 + 8, 16 + 16, 32 + 32, 64 + 64 .... And so on).  The game is very addictive, starting to play, you just can not stop. <br><br>  2nd place game called "My Tom" <br><br>  This game is also available on Android and iOS.  In this game you need to take care of the cat.  Namely, you need to feed him, put him to bed, drive to the toilet and, of course, play with him.  In the game you can change the interior of the apartment, buy clothes and accessories for your cat, food and drinks.  Your pet is growing, before your eyes it turns from a small, pretty kitten into an adult cat.  This game especially hooks kids. <br><br>  I give the 3rd place to the game ‚ÄúPlague Inc.‚Äù <br><br>  The game is free on Android, but on iOS paid.  But having bought this game you will not regret it, you can be sure.  The goal of the game is to infect the whole world with the disease you invented, while you can think over everything: the pathways of the spread of the disease, symptoms and skills.  I want to give you not a great hint on the passage of the game.  It is better to start infection from more developed countries, for example from Russia, China or the USA. <br><br>  4th place application "Magisto" <br><br>  This is a video editor that will do all the work for you.  In this application, you can overlay any music, and by choosing a video theme, you will get certain effects.  In the application you can upload several videos and photos for one project at once.  Video is mounted quickly and efficiently.  As a result, you will get the clip right exactly to the music that you selected earlier.  After creating the clip, you can immediately download it directly from the application to your device or put it on the Internet. <br><br>  5th place application "Music fan" <br><br>  This is a very famous iOS app, but the time has come when it appeared on the Play Market.  This application allows you to listen to music from the social network "VKontakte".  You can add your favorite music to your favorite songs and listen to them with ease.  You no longer have to look for your favorite song, it will always be at hand. </p></div></article>
