  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Renting an apartment: what, why and how</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Renting an apartment is a normal everyday alternative to its full purchase or, for example, staying at a hotel.  Renting an apartment is of two main types: long-term and short-term (that is, renting an apartment for rent, for several days or for a night).  In life, there is everything and not always enough money to buy a house or pay for a hotel.  A considerable percentage of people live like that, renting an apartment for a long time and moving from one to another.  There is nothing to shut up like nomads and change neighborhoods, streets or even cities </p><p>  It‚Äôs good that there are people who have at their disposal free living space.  Such owners act very entrepreneurially, providing an opportunity for people without their own housing to find a place for existence.  At any point, from a tiny little town to a multi-million megalopolis, apartments are rented, and <noindex>  <span>apartments for rent Ekaterinburg</span> </noindex>  also not a problem. </p><p>  Special attention is required to the issue of renting apartments for rent.  This is very convenient, especially for nonresident or foreign guests who do not want to splurge on a hotel room, but want to live a couple of days at home.  At the moment, it is difficult to find an apartment from the owner on the real estate market, since only ads from agencies specializing in the sale of real estate flash across.  The agency assumes the role of intermediary between the landlord and the tenant.  It is important to note that real estate agencies charge a fee for their services (that is, search for housing on request).  A good agency is the one that works, as they say, on the fact of removal, but the one that takes an advance payment is better to bypass. </p><p>  When the apartment is found and there is a meeting with the owner, if the check-in will not take place immediately, but later, then it is better not to leave money on hand.  Who knows if the fraudster is caught, and then it turns out that another 5 people will come to this apartment.  Having agreed all the details with the owner of the apartment, you can leave a deposit, be sure to (!) Take the keys, and after the end of your stay in the apartment, pay the rest of the money (this is especially important when renting a house for a day). </p><p>  Long-term rental housing is a completely different matter.  It is important to pre-examine the housing, weigh all the pros and cons, down to the smallest detail.  For example, the presence of one or another household appliance, speakers for hot water, furniture, and so on.  Now, it is customary among apartment owners to take payment from tenants two months in advance, and in some cases there is a separate payment for utilities.  Although it all depends on how much the person managing the provided housing is ready to agree and make some concessions.  As the saying goes, everyday life.  Perhaps it‚Äôs not important for someone to take payment a month in advance.  Or, for tenants, the issue of money is not sharply stated, and they can fully cover future and current expenses.  In general, it is really convenient that in our time there is such a service on the real estate market as rent. </p></div></article>
