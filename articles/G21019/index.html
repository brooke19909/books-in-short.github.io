  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose an iron</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This short article will provide some recommendations regarding <span>how to choose an iron,</span> which characteristics are important, and which are not.  To begin with, we can say that these devices can be simple, steam and with a steam generator.  The first type of irons is almost not produced, since there is no demand for them.  The main series of models of most manufacturers is represented by steam models used in everyday life.  The cost of <span>irons with a steam generator</span> usually exceeds the cost of steam <span>irons by</span> five times.  They are advantageous to use only for large volumes of work.  Next, we will talk about ordinary steam models that we demand in everyday life. </p><p>  Before choosing an iron, you should find out what its sole is.  This factor is very important.  Many scientific studies are carried out in order to reduce friction during the ironing process, to protect the sole itself from damage, since they are inevitable during ironing things with buttons, buttons, zippers and more.  In addition, it should distribute heat as evenly as possible.  Different materials can be used by the manufacturer to cover the sole of the iron: chrome or stainless steel, cermets, aluminum.  The <span>stainless steel</span> sole cover is strong enough; it heats and cools well, does not scratch, is easy to clean and glides well on the fabric.  But such irons are sometimes slightly heavy, and heating and cooling are longer than those of models with aluminum soles.  Irons with aluminum soles are often cheaper than steel counterparts; they heat up and cool down faster, but are easily damaged.  Advantages of ceramics are that the iron glides easily enough, is cleaned with a damp cloth, the laundry does not jam during ironing. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we talk further about how to choose an iron, then it is worth talking about power, since the efficiency of ironing depends to a large extent on it.  The optimal power for the normal operation of the iron is considered to be 1600 watts.  If your life is rich and active enough and you feel sorry for ironing, you may need a more powerful model. </p><p>  When deciding which <span>iron is best</span> to choose, it is worthwhile to pay attention to <span>temperature conditions.</span>  A quality model must maintain a given temperature.  This is especially important in the ironing modes of silk and <span>synthetic fabrics,</span> since they are very sensitive to temperature extremes. </p><p>  You can not choose an iron with the possibility of steaming, without considering its characteristics in this regard.  Here you can distinguish steam boost, vertical steam and spraying.  Steam boost is understood as a one-time supply of a powerful jet of steam, which is very convenient for smoothing coarse or overdried fabrics.  By vertical steaming is meant the possibility of supplying steam in an upright position, so you can iron coats, jackets and much more, for which they do not need to be removed from the hanger.  Spraying refers to the ejection of water in front of the iron during ironing.  It is very convenient for smoothing various folds.  Here, indicators such as the size of the <span>water tank</span> and the presence of an anti-drip system are still important.  The larger the tank is installed, the longer the iron is able to work without adding water.  The anti-drop system is designed to prevent those cases when at low temperature the steam simply does not have time to form, which is why drops of water fly out. </p><p>  If we choose an iron, we should pay attention to such an important parameter as the length of the cord, as this affects the usability.  The maneuverability of the iron is very important.  If it can rotate 360 ‚Äã‚Äãdegrees, then this is the best option.  At the moment, the most popular irons are brands Philips and Vitek due to the wide range of models and value for money.  But this does not oblige you to buy them. </p><p>  Of course, an important factor when choosing is the cost.  However, you should use the suggested recommendations, even if you are limited to a specific price range. </p>
