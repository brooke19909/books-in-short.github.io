Town-planning project "A101" LCD "Spanish Quarters", New Moscow</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A great option for Muscovites is to buy a new apartment not very far from the center of the capital and at the same time in an ecologically clean area, next to a river and a forest park.  It is in such a place that large-scale construction of the entire development company A101 is underway.  "Spanish Quarters" - so they called their brainchild.  The reason why a piece of southern Spain suddenly appears near Moscow is that the Spanish specialists designed the complex.  They proposed a layout of the neighborhood identical to that in Barcelona, ​​which will be implemented. </p><h2>  Project A101 </h2><p>  In 2012, 148 thousand hectares of land located in the South-West direction were annexed to the capital.  They were called New Moscow.  Now in this area several modern <span>residential complexes are</span> being massively erected at once <span>,</span> one of which will be the “Spanish Quarter”.  New Moscow is currently a very promising area, attracting the attention of many developers.  “A101 Development” holding joined the urban development project.  On the site from the Moscow Ring Road, Kaluga and Kiev Highways to the village of Salaryevo, he is building three large residential complexes, including Moscow 101, Green Line, Spanish Quarters, as well as two townhouses Kronburg and Vyazemskoye.  All of them are designed to be closed to outsiders, with a rich infrastructure that fully meets the needs of apartment owners.  The houses in the complexes are built relatively low, the maximum number of floors is 17. Townhouses are created according to the type of modern foreign villages.  We offer detailed information about the residential complex "Spanish Quarters". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spanish quarter reviews" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1596643.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Perhaps the most successful company “A101” chose a place for the residential complex “Spanish Quarter”.  The reviews of those who have already purchased housing there or are still eyeing, note the proximity to the capital, which is important for all working citizens.  A complex is being built on the territory of the Sosensky settlement of New Moscow.  Five hundred meters from it lies the village of Nikolo-Khovanskoye, a few tens of meters - a new residential complex called "Nikolin Park".  Regarding the highways, the complex is located remarkably.  Immediately at its borders is Nikolo-Khovanskaya street, along which you can go to the Kaluga highway.  It is only 1300 meters away.  About 3.7 km from this fork in the Moscow Ring Road.  Now the Kaluga highway is being made wider (there will be 8 lanes), so soon problems with traffic jams should be resolved here.  Quite close to the "Spanish Quarters" and the Kiev highway, to which in a straight line a little less than 5 km. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  At the moment, transport hubs are not very close to the residential complex “Spanish Quarter”.  Feedback from equity holders notes that it will be difficult to get home from Moscow without a car, since the two existing metro stations Salaryevskaya and Teply Stan are more than 5 kilometers from the complex.  You are not on foot there, only on the bus (No. 882).  While its nearest stop from the complex is a 10 minute walk.  Perhaps in the future it will be moved closer and several more buses or minibuses will be allowed.  There is also hope that in the not very distant future, new stations will appear.  The opening of Prokshino is planned in 2019, and the Mamyri station, which will be built by Chinese experts, in 2020. They plan to build this station from another, previously called Novatorov Street, but it is also in the project. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Owners of cars get to Moscow a little more convenient, as large highways are located very close to the complex.  Difficulties are caused only by constant traffic jams, which will disappear with the completion of the reconstruction of the Kaluga highway. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  Regarding the ecological cleanliness of the area where the “Spanish Quarter” is being built, the feedback from equity holders was divided.  The bone of contention was the Khovanskoe cemetery, to which from the complex in a straight line 1700 meters.  This cemetery in the Moscow region is the largest, plus it’s expanding every year.  The crematorium also works here.  And in the spring of 2016, a major massacre between Asian groups took place on its territory.  Even Kalashnikovs were used.  Of course, such a neighborhood is unpleasant for future residents of the Spanish Quarters, but the distance to this object is still decent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="A 101 Spanish Quarter" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1596633.jpg" width="503"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The second question that concerns equity holders is the largest landfill in the region of Salaryevskaya, but it is located even further from the complex from the cemetery.  This landfill was closed ten years ago, covered with earth, but still rotting products poison the air in the area and the water in the Sosenka River, which flows from the complex for about 10 minutes.  So about the landfill, the fears of interest holders of the residential complex “Spanish Quarters” are not unfounded.  It is encouraging that, according to the plan for the development of the capital in 2017, they plan to rehabilitate the landfill and build either ski slopes or a park on that site.  So with this issue everything should be settled before the surrender of the Spanish Quarters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The positive aspects with regard to the environment are the nearby forest park, where you can walk and breathe plenty of clean air, as well as the absence of industrial facilities near the complex. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  The building "Spanish Quarters" the developer used to be called "Augur".  The company was founded in 1992, but then it was not in charge of building objects, but mediating in real estate transactions.  At present, the company is called “A101 Development” and provides a full range of services from the creation of an architectural design of a residential complex to its implementation to consumers.  In the piggy bank “A101 Development” there are well-known and already commissioned LCDs “Smolenskaya Zastava”, “Three Poplars”, “Nadezhda”, “La Defense”.  With regard to the new large-scale project “A101”, there are also successes.  So, townhouses and LCD “Green Line” have already been commissioned, and LCD “Spanish Quarters” and “Moscow 101” are being built rapidly.  In 2015, A101 merged with the prestigious Bin holding, whose assets extend to the oil and coal industries, pension funds, hotel and construction businesses. </p><h2>  Infrastructure of the future complex </h2><p>  According to the ideas of Spanish architects, the Spanish Quarter should become a separate small town.  Customer reviews emphasize that LCD infrastructure will be rich and diverse.  In total, it is planned to build 40 houses in height from 6 to 15 floors.  They will be located in small blocks with cozy courtyards.  A pedestrian boulevard will be built between the blocks, on both sides of which cafes, restaurants, various offices and shops will open.  For children in the "Spanish Quarters" it is planned to build two kindergartens and a school for 1200 places, and the distance from them to all buildings will be approximately the same.  For lovers of outdoor activities in the complex will build a fitness club, swimming pool, ice rink, jogging and cycling paths, tennis court, multiple sports grounds. </p><p>  The infrastructure will also include shops, a clinic, an entertainment center. </p><p>  The design of the territory of the residential complex “Spanish Quarters” is planned to be made beautiful and enjoyable for residents.  Here trees, flowering shrubs will be planted, palisades and flowerbeds will be smashed, benches, small architectural forms will be set up, and colorful playgrounds will be created for kids. </p><p>  Many interest holders are interested in parking.  They are going to make it underground in several levels.  It is planned that 2500 cars will be found here.  In addition, business class houses will also have small underground parking lots. </p><p>  Ground parking in the complex is not provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Spanish quarters" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1596613.jpg" width="502"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure nearby </h2><p>  According to the A101 plan, the Spanish Quarters are being built where previously there were almost no <span>social facilities.</span>  Now several townhouses have appeared near the complex, the closest of which are Forest Glades and Vyazemskoye.  Their territory is fenced, so it will be difficult for residents of the Spanish Quarters to use "alien" infrastructure.  The same can be said about the LCD neighbor Nikolin Park, where it is planned to build a shopping center. </p><p>  When the complex "Spanish Quarters" will be completely commissioned, and "A 101" will build all the promised facilities - shops, schools, kindergartens, sports centers - for residents of "Quarters" the inconvenience will end.  Those who move into houses of the first stage can be advised of several nearest retail outlets in Nikolo-Khovansky, the Food City market, the Kholod store one and a half kilometers, social facilities in the Gas Pipeline village, about 2,000 meters away. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Architects have proposed building in a complex of 40 buildings of average number of storeys, at least 6, at most 15 floors.  All houses and apartments in the Spanish Quarters will be of two classes - “business” and “comfort”.  The difference is the internal layout, the height of the ceilings, the price, the design of the MOS finishes.  In addition, underground parking is provided in business class homes.  In buildings of any class, it is planned to make spacious halls with a height of 4.5 meters and a concierge room, install elevators (OTIS company), one each in six-story buildings and two (passenger and cargo) in fifteen-story buildings.  All buildings are erected in a monolithic way, but the bearing walls in them will not be supports.  Pylons will take on this role, which will make it possible to create individual layouts in the apartment.  Only kitchens, baths and bathrooms (places where water is supplied) will be delivered ready-made, that is, without subsequent redevelopment.  The external walls are planned to be installed in cellular concrete, which is distinguished by good vapor permeability, high thermal insulation, and ease of installation.  Unfortunately, one of the disadvantages of such a material is its high sound permeability and moisture capacity, but builders will cover these blocks with porcelain stoneware, clinker tiles, textured plaster. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spanish quarters planning" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1596610.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <h2>  "Spanish quarters" floor plans </h2><p>  Since in the general plan of the developer most of the apartments are built without interior partitions, it is difficult to say how everything will look in the end.  The complex offers: </p><p>  - one-room apartments with a total area (S) of 22 m <sup>2</sup> to 51 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - two-room S - from 31 m <sup>2</sup> to 59 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - three-room S - from 71 m <sup>2</sup> to 73 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - four-room S - 101 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  It is planned to make combined bathrooms, kitchens from 8 m <sup>2</sup> to 19 m <sup>2</sup> (they can be narrow and long in shape or more or less square), to install panoramic windows on the loggias and rooms.  The ceiling height in the housing of the comfort class is up to 2.8 meters, and the class of business class is 3 meters.  Windows can go both on different sides of the house, and on one. </p><h2>  Finish options </h2><p>  In addition, those who wish can buy finished apartments in the Spanish Quarters.  The company has equipped showrooms with a show room, where you can see and feel how the finished apartment will look like.  Three options are available: </p><p>  1. "Barcelona".  The emphasis is on bright, mainly turquoise tones with contrasting decor elements, the walls are “brick-like”, also matching the design with turquoise, in the <span>bathroom there is a colored</span> tile. </p><p>  2. "Madrid".  Here the main theme is contrast.  The floors in the kitchen, like a chessboard, will combine white and dark tiles, walls, doors, floors in dark colors with contrasting decor. </p><p>  3. Valencia.  This option was invented in light pastel colors, everything is simple and tasteful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spanish quarters builder" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1596607.jpg" width="502"></div>
