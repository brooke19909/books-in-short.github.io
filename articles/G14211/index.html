    <p>  How to get the "Promised payment" on the phone or the Internet from the company "Rostelecom"?  The operator will answer you.  You must say that you want to connect this service to yourself.  Next, announce the number for the "loan" and the amount of money (but not more than 200 rubles for individuals).  The operator will fill out an application for connection and send it for processing.  A few minutes of waiting - and you will need to receive a response in the form of a message about a successful connection.  That's all, you can use all communication services for another 5 days.  It is advisable to pay the phone / Internet along with the debt in advance. </p><h2>  We send commands </h2><p>  How to get the <span>Promised Payment (Rostelecom,</span> Russia) yourself?  In this case, the option using USSD commands is suitable for you.  They help to disable and connect certain functions at any time of the day or night.  Perhaps this method pleases most customers. </p><p>  To connect a "loan" to yourself, dial * 100 * 17 * amount # from the phone.  Next, click on the "Call" button and wait for an answer with the result of processing the operation.  Usually this process takes no more than 5 minutes.  In principle, that‚Äôs all.  No additional manipulations are needed.  Easy and simple.  True, forget about the restrictions on the amount of "loan" is not worth it.  Otherwise, the request will not be processed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Interactive menu </h2><p>  Another very interesting and no less popular way to help answer how to get the Promised Payment to Rostelecom is to use the interactive menu to implement the task. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to take the promised payment in Rostelecom" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139957.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What exactly should a subscriber do?  Dial * 111 * 23 #.  After that, a small menu will appear on your phone screen.  In it you should study all the points and select the connection function "Promised payment".  Next, enter the loan amount and send a request.  You can wait for the result.  Unfortunately, the interactive menu, despite its popularity, is not particularly convenient.  After all, it will take a long time to study it.  And sometimes it‚Äôs difficult to find ‚ÄúPromised payment‚Äù among all the proposed options.  Do not despair.  Rostelecom offers at least two more methods to enable this option.  Even a novice subscriber can handle them. </p><h2>  Robot </h2><p>  How to take the Promised Payment to Rostelecom differently?  Say, you can call the support service and fill out an application by communicating with a voice robot.  Often, when trying to reach a live operator, this particular method is activated.  You are redirected to an answering machine. </p>
