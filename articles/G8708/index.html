  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sartlan Lake, Novosibirsk Region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Lake Sartlan in the Novosibirsk region belongs to the category of closed lakes of the Baraba group.  It is a relatively shallow body of water with an average depth of 2-3 meters.  Due to the characteristics of the food supply, the diversity of bottom and coastal vegetation, the waters are rich in fish. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Sartlan Lake with an average water surface area of ‚Äã‚Äã238 km <sup>2</sup> is the third largest body of water in the Novosibirsk Region.  Until the beginning of the XIX century, it was part of the huge <span>Lake Chany,</span> whose area in those years reached tens of thousands of square kilometers (today - about 1,500 km <sup>2</sup> ).  Therefore, water bodies are in many respects similar in physical, chemical and biological characteristics. </p><p>  Among the Baraba Lakes, Sartlan is one of the deepest.  The average water thickness is about 2.5-3.5 meters, depending on the season, in some areas exceeding 6 meters.  The shape of the water mirror is oval, slightly elongated from northeast to southwest, the largest length is 25.5 km, width - 16 km.  Due to the fact that the banks are low and the slope is gentle, large areas are overgrown with reeds and other water-coastal vegetation.  The bottom is muddy, there are a lot of algae in the thickness. </p><p>  The surrounding area has been inhabited since time immemorial.  For the last centuries, Bashkirs and related peoples lived here.  The name of the lake Sartlan, according to linguists, is derived from the Bashkir word "Surtan", which translates as "pike."  You won‚Äôt give a more accurate name for the reservoir - there are a lot of toothy predators in the water area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="water-rf.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Problems of Sartlan Lake" class="if uuid-2483209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2483209.jpg"></div><h2>  Hydrology </h2><p>  Lake Sartlan is a closed, flat, slightly brackish reservoir.  The composition of water refers to the sodium bicarbonate-chloride-sulfate group.  The influx of moisture is carried out mainly due to melting of snow.  Several streams and rivers flow, the largest of which is p.  Peanut.  During a particularly heavy flood, the bowl overflows, and the Sarayka River flows from the lake. </p><p>  Unfortunately, most local water bodies are subject to fish kills due to shallow depths in winter.  Sartlan, being deeper, was a pleasant exception, therefore the ichthyofauna is richer here.  The ice cover is established by the end of October, at the peak of frosts reaching a thickness of 1.2 m. The autopsy begins in April and continues until mid-May. </p><p>  Interesting from a scientific point of view is an unstable water regime, subject to long-term watering cycles.  There are intra-annual cycles with a frequency of 2-22 years, and intra-century with a duration of 30-50 years.  These factors depend on these factors, such as: </p><ul><li>  mineralization; </li><li>  surface area; </li><li>  depth; </li><li>  species change and the number of aquatic organisms. </li></ul><p>  The minimum water level was recorded in 1969 (109.63 m above sea level), the maximum was observed in 1947 (110.86 m above sea level). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="finkreg.ucoz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sartlan Lake, Novosibirsk Region" class="if uuid-2483194" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2483194.jpg"></div><h2>  Fish farming </h2><p>  In the Novosibirsk region, Sartlan Lake is considered one of the most productive.  It is no accident that since the 1970s regular work has been carried out on its stocking with valuable commodity types.  In the vicinity of the village of Krasny Yar there is a fish complex connected to the lake by a canal.  During the Soviet Union, fishing was carried out on an industrial scale.  Today, due to a decrease in catch volumes, limitation of stocking and difficulties of an economic nature, a decrease in the average size of fish and the dominance of unproductive species are observed. </p><p>  The main objects of fishing are induced carp and representatives of the local ichthyofauna: </p><ul><li>  <span>silver crucian</span> ; </li><li>  bream; </li><li>  roach; </li><li>  pike; </li><li>  perch; </li><li>  ide. </li></ul><p>  In 1971-1977, for commercial cultivation, nelma was transported from the Ob River basin to Lake Sartlan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fion.ru" data-author=": Antaleks, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fishing on Lake Sartlan" class="if uuid-2483217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2483217.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The easiest way to get there is by car.  It is necessary to move from the direction of Novosibirsk, Kuzbass or Omsk along the Baikal highway to the junction of the city of Barabinsk.  Then the path lies south in the direction of Taskaevo to the village of Krasny Yar.  On average, the distance from Omsk will be 390 km, from Kemerovo 630 km, from the capital of the region - 395 km.  There are two roads leading to the western and eastern parts of the lake.  They are connected by a primer stretching along the southern coast of Sartlan. </p><p>  You can stay in the settlements of Malyshevo, Petropavlovsky, Alekseevka, Karmakla.  The best fishing spots are located near the village of Krasny Yar, at the mouth of the Karapuz River.  There are a recreation center, fishing and hunting lodges, a tent city and other tourist facilities on the lake. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.klevoemesto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to Sartlan Lake" class="if uuid-2483181" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2483181.jpg"></div><h2>  Problems of Sartlan Lake </h2><p>  Such a mysterious phenomenon as an unknown disease is associated with the reservoir, periodically manifesting for unknown reasons.  Local residents have long noticed that at certain times, people and animals who ate caught fish fell ill and sometimes died.  Since the 1940s, scientists have been studying the problem, but have not solved the mystery of Lake Sartlan. </p><p>  It is known that an outbreak of Sartlan's disease manifests itself in a period of high water, observed with a 20-year cycle.  Symptoms are comparable to food poisoning, for 3-4 days accompanied by severe convulsions.  At the same time, several people out of a hundred patients die from liver and kidney failure. </p><p>  The source of the problem is mostly perch.  At the same time, no special pathogens, parasites or poisons were detected in the studied samples.  If you consider that heat treatment does not save you from a disease, it is highly likely that some toxin that comes from food into the body of fish is the cause of the trouble. </p>
