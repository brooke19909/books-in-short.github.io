    <h2>  Hotel Nerton 4 *: guest reviews on food </h2><p>  As for the food at Nerton, most of the guests liked it.  According to them, there are always meat, chicken, turkey, snacks, salads, fresh vegetables and fruits.  Grill dishes are prepared in the evenings.  According to our compatriots, everything is cooked very high quality and delicious.  During the day, guests can have a meal in the bar with burgers, french fries, etc. The guests were also satisfied with the quality of drinks offered at the hotel.  They especially recommend trying local coffee. </p><h2>  The opinion of tourists about the hotel staff </h2><p>  According to travelers, Nerton 4 * employees are polite and pleasant.  However, almost none of the staff understands the Russian language.  Having in your arsenal at least basic knowledge of English or German, you can explain yourself here without any problems.  This situation, according to our compatriots, has developed due to the fact that the main contingent of holidaymakers at the hotel is represented by tourists from Germany.  There are also travelers from the Czech Republic and other European countries.  Russians here have a little rest. </p><p>  If you arrive before two o‚Äôclock and the hotel has free rooms, then the reception administrators will try to check you in immediately, without condemning you to waiting for the check-out time. </p>

Sun loungers and parasols are always enough for everyone.  So you won‚Äôt have to come to the beach early in the morning and take a deck chair.  The sand here is shallow and clean.  Entering the water gently, without stones.  According to tourists, relaxing with children here is a pleasure.  Please note that <span>beach towels</span> at the hotel are paid for (about two dollars a day).  Therefore, it makes sense to bring them with you or buy in one of the many shops in Side. </p><p>  As for entertainment at the Nerton 4 * hotel, there are two pools.  One of them is deep, and the second has water slides.  Each pool has a children's section.  There is animation in the hotel: both daytime and evening.  It is held every day except Sunday.  There is also a mini club for children.  Please note that hotel animation is only available during high season.  The rest of the time, a Turkish night is arranged once a week, and every day in the evening the bar just includes music. </p>
