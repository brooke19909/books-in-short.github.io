    <p>  The calm and modest Ajman is located 10 km from Sharjah.  It is known as the capital of one of the poorest emirates in the UAE, which is also distinguished by its size: the territory of the region is considered the smallest in the country.  But this is more than compensated by the beautiful nature: tourists enjoy the local palms and picturesque views with pleasure, relax on the white beaches, enjoy the atmosphere of friendliness and comfort.  During the hours when dusk descends to the city, bringing a coolness of salvation, locals with their whole families go to the promenade and here, in the clean, gentle sand, at the special white tables with blue umbrellas for a picnic or just under palm trees prepare a barbecue. </p><p>  Tourists here like to just walk around the city: The Corniche Street (also known as Al Khaleej Rd or Arabian Gulf St) is a favorite place for evening promenades not only for visitors but also for indigenous people.  Ajman does not have a dry law.  On the contrary, the Hole in the wall store (located at the Ajman Beach Hotel) sells imported alcoholic beverages without any restrictions.  But, for tourists, they are strictly forbidden to export from the territory of the principality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ajman belongs to the relatively poor emirates (still no oil has been found here), the construction of hotels in the country is quite slow.  However, it should be borne in mind that it is in Ajman that Kempinski is located - one of the best hotels in the country, which has its own cozy secluded beach, sheltered several charming cafes with sea views, a museum and the pier of the legendary dhow boats.  All this is part of the UAE's historical heritage, with which tourists recommend future guests of the resort to get acquainted. </p>
