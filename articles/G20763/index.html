Some people call this organization the Third International, or the Comintern. </p><p>  This formation was founded in 1919, <span>March 4,</span> at the request of the RCP (b) and its leader V.I. Lenin for the dissemination and development of the ideas of international revolutionary socialism, which in comparison with the reformist socialism of the Second International was the exact opposite.  The gap between the two coalitions occurred due to differences in positions regarding the First World War and the October Revolution. </p>

    <h2>  Congresses of the Comintern </h2><p>  Congresses of the Comintern were not held so often.  Let's consider them in order: </p><ul><li>  The first (Constituent).  Organized in 1919 (in March) in Moscow.  It was attended by 52 delegates from 35 groups and parties from 21 countries of the world. </li><li>  The second congress.  It was held July 19 ‚Äì August 7 in Petrograd.  At this event, a number of decisions were made on the tactics and strategies of communist activity, such as models for participation in the national liberation movement of the Communist Parties, on the rules for the party to join the 3rd International, the Charter of the Comintern, and so on.  At that moment, the Department for International Cooperation of the Comintern was created. </li><li>  Third Congress.  It was held in Moscow in 1921, from June 22 to July 12.  605 delegates from 103 parties and structures came to this event. </li><li>  Fourth Congress.  The event was held from November to December 1922.  It was attended by 408 delegates, who were seconded by 66 parties and enterprises from 58 countries.  By the decision of the congress, the International Enterprise for Assisting the Fighters of the Revolution was organized. </li><li>  The fifth meeting of the Communist International was held from June to July 1924.  The participants decided to turn the national communist parties into Bolshevik ones: to change their tactics in the light of the defeat of revolutionary actions in Europe. </li><li>  The Sixth Congress was held from July to September 1928.  At this meeting, participants evaluated the political world situation as a transition to the latest stage.  It was characterized by an economic crisis that spread throughout the planet and an intensification of the class struggle.  The members of the congress succeeded in developing the thesis of social fascism.  They made a statement that the political cooperation of the Communists with both the right and left social democrats is impossible.  In addition, the Charter and the Program of the Communist International were adopted during this conference. </li><li>  The seventh conference was held in 1935, from July 25 to August 20.  The basic theme of the meeting was the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãconsolidating forces and combating the growing fascist threat.  During this period, the Workers United Front was created, which was a body for coordinating the activity of workers of various political interests. </li></ul><h2>  History </h2><p>  In general, the study of communist internationals is very interesting.  So, it is known that the Trotskyists approved the first four congresses, the supporters of left communism - only the first two.  As a result of the campaigns of 1937-1938, most sections of the Comintern were liquidated.  The Polish section of the Comintern was eventually officially dismissed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, political parties of the 20th century underwent a lot of changes.  Repressions against the leaders of the communist international movement, who found themselves in the USSR for one reason or another, appeared even before Germany and the USSR concluded a non-aggression pact in 1939. </p>

    <p>  Marxism-Leninism was very popular among the people.  And already at the beginning of 1937, members of the directorate of the German Communist Party G. Remmele, H. Eberlein, F. Schulte, G. Neumann, G. Kippenberger, leaders of the Yugoslav Communist Party M. Filipovich, M. Gorkich were arrested.  V. Chopich commanded the Fifteenth Lincoln Inter-Brigade in Spain, but when he returned he was also arrested. </p><p>  As you can see, a large number of people created the communist internationals.  Also, a prominent figure in the communist international movement Hungarian Bela Kun, many leaders of the Polish Communist Party ‚Äî Y. Pashin, E. Pruhniak, M. Koshutskaya, Y. Lensky and many others were repressed.  Former <span>Secretary General of the</span> Greek Communist Party A. Kaitas was arrested and executed.  The same fate was awarded to one of the leaders of the Communist Party of Iran A. Sultan-Zade: he was a member of the Executive Committee of the Comintern, a delegate to the II, III, IV and VI congresses. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It should be noted that political parties of the 20th century were distinguished by a large number of intrigues.  Stalin accused the leaders of the Communist Party of Poland of anti-Bolshevism, Trotskyism, and anti-Soviet positions.  His speeches were the cause of physical reprisals against Jerzy Cheszeko-Sokhacki and other leaders of the Polish Communists (1933).  Some repression overtook in 1937. </p><p>  Marxism-Leninism, in fact, was a good teaching.  But in 1938, the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Comintern decided to dissolve the Polish Communist Party.  The creators of the Communist Party of Hungary and the leaders of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, F. Bayaki, D. Bokany, Bela Kun, I. Rabinovich, J. Kelen, L. Gavro, S. Sabadosh, F. Karikash, were under a wave of repression.  Bulgarian communists who moved to the USSR were repressed: H. Rakovsky, R. Avramov, B. Stomonyakov. </p><p>  The Communists of Romania also began to destroy.  In Finland, the founders of the Communist Party, G. Rovio and A. Shotman, General Secretary General K. Manner and many of their associates were repressed. </p><p>  It is known that the communist internationals did not appear from scratch.  For their sake, more than a hundred Communist-Italians who lived in the Soviet Union in the 1930s suffered.  They were all arrested and sent to camps.  Mass repressions did not pass by the leaders and activists of the communist parties of Lithuania, Latvia, Western Ukraine, Estonia and Western Belarus (before they joined the USSR). </p><h2>  The structure of the Comintern </h2><p>  So, we examined the congresses of the Comintern, and now we will consider the structure of this organization.  Its charter was adopted in August 1920.  It was written in it: "In fact, the Communist International is obliged, in fact and indeed, to represent a world united communist party, whose individual branches operate in each state." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is known that the leadership of the Comintern was carried out through the Executive Committee (ECCI).  Until 1922, it consisted of representatives delegated by the communist parties.  And since 1922 he was elected by the Congress of the Comintern.  The ECCI Small Bureau appeared in July 1919.  In September 1921, it was renamed the Presidency of the ECCI.  The Secretariat of the ECCI was created in 1919; it dealt with personnel and organizational issues.  This organization existed until 1926.  And the Organizing Bureau (Organizing Bureau) of the ECCI was created in 1921 and lasted until 1926. </p>

    <p>  Interestingly, from 1919 to 1926, the Chairman of the ECCI was Grigory Zinoviev.  In 1926, the post of chairman of the ECCI was abolished.  Instead, the Political Secretariat of the ECCI of nine people appeared.  In August 1929, the Political Commission of the Political Secretariat of the ECCI was allocated from the composition of this new formation.  She had to prepare various issues, which were subsequently considered by the Political Secretariat.  It included D. Manuilsky, O. Kuusinen, a representative of the Communist Party of Germany (agreed with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Lithuania) and O. Pyatnitsky (candidate). </p><p>  In 1935, a new position appeared - Secretary General of the ECCI.  It was occupied by G. Dimitrov.  The Political Commission and the Political Secretariat were abolished.  The ECCI Secretariat was re-organized. </p><p>  The control international commission was created in 1921.  She checked the work of the apparatus of the ECCI, individual sections (parties) and was engaged in the audit of finances. </p><h2>  What organizations did the Comintern consist of? </h2><ul><li>  Profintern. </li><li>  Mezhrabpom. </li><li>  SportIntern. </li><li>  Communist Youth International (KIM). </li><li>  Crestintern. </li><li>  Women's International Secretariat. </li><li>  Association of rebellious theaters (international). </li><li>  Association of Rebellious Writers (International). </li><li>  International proletarians of the free-thinking. </li><li>  World Committee of Comrades of the USSR. </li><li>  Tenants International. </li><li>  The International Organization for Assistance to the Revolutionaries was called the IDLO or ‚ÄúRed Aid‚Äù. </li><li>  Anti-imperialist League. </li></ul><h2>  The dissolution of the Comintern </h2><p>  When did the dissolution of the Communist International take place?  The official liquidation date of this famous organization falls on May 15, 1943.  Stalin announced the dissolution of the Comintern: he wanted to impress the Western allies, convincing them that plans to establish communist and pro-Soviet regimes on the lands of European states had collapsed.  It is known that the reputation of the 3rd International by the beginning of the 1940s was very bad.  In addition, in continental Europe, almost all cells were suppressed and destroyed by the Nazis. </p>

    <p>  Since the mid-1920s, personally, Stalin and the CPSU (b) sought to dominate the Third International.  This nuance played a role in the events of that time.  The liquidation of almost all branches of the Comintern (except the International of Youth and the Executive Committee) during the years of <span>Stalin's repressions</span> (mid-1930s) also influenced.  However, the Executive Committee was able to keep the 3rd International: it was only renamed the World Department of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks. </p><p>  In June 1947, a Paris conference on Marshall's assistance was held.  And in September 1947, Stalin from the socialist parties created the Cominform - the Communist Information Bureau.  It replaced the Comintern.  In fact, it was a network formed from the communist parties of Bulgaria, Albania, Hungary, France, Italy, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, Romania and Yugoslavia (because of the differences of Tito and Stalin, it was deleted from the lists in 1948). </p><p>  Kominform was liquidated in 1956, after the completion of the Twentieth Congress of the CPSU.  This organization did not have a formal successor, however, these were the ATS and CMEA, as well as regularly held meetings of USSR-friendly workers and communist parties. </p><h2>  Archive of the Third International </h2><p>  The archive of the Comintern is stored in the State Archive of Political and Social History in Moscow.  Documents are available in 90 languages: German is the base working language.  There are reports of more than 80 parties. </p><h2>  Schools </h2><p>  The Third International owned: </p><ol><li>  Communist University of Chinese Workers (KUTK) - Until September 17, 1928 it was called Sun Yat-sen University of Chinese Workers (UTK). </li><li>  Communist University of the Workers of the East (KUTW). </li><li>  Communist University of National Minorities of the West (KUMNZ). </li><li>  International Leninist School (LLS) (1925‚Äì1938). </li></ol><h2>  Institutions </h2><p>  The Third International disposed of: </p><ol><li>  Institute of Statistics and Information, ECCI (Bureau of Varga) (1921‚Äì1928). </li><li>  Agrarian International Institute (1925-1940). </li></ol><h2>  Historical facts </h2><p>  The creation of the Communist International was accompanied by various interesting events.  So, in 1928, for him, Hans Eisler wrote a great anthem in German.  It was translated into Russian by I. L. Frenkel in 1929.  In the chorus of the work, the words repeatedly sounded: ‚ÄúOur slogan is the World Soviet Union!‚Äù </p>

    <p>  In general, when the Communist International was created, we already know that it was not an easy time.  It is known that the command of the Red Army, together with the propaganda and agitation bureau of the Third International, prepared and published the book Armed Uprising.  In 1928, this work was published in German, and in 1931 in French.  The work was written in the form of a training manual on the theory of the organization of armed uprisings. </p><p>  The book was created under the pseudonym A. Neuberg, its real authors were popular figures of the revolutionary world movement. </p><h2>  Marxism-Leninism </h2><p>  What is Marxism-Leninism?  This is a philosophical and socio-political doctrine of the laws of the struggle for the elimination of the capitalist system and the construction of communism.  It was developed by V.I. Lenin, who developed the teachings of Marx and put it into practice.  The advent of Marxism-Leninism confirmed the significance of Lenin's contribution to Marxism. </p><p>  V. I. Lenin created such a magnificent doctrine that in socialist countries it turned into the official "ideology of the working class."  Ideology was not static; it was changing, adapting to the needs of the elite.  Incidentally, it included the teachings of the regional communist leaders, which are important for the socialist powers they lead. </p>

    <p>  In the Soviet paradigm, the teachings of V.I. Lenin are the only true scientific system of economic, philosophical and political-social views.  Marxist-Leninist doctrine is able to integrate conceptual views regarding research and revolutionary changes in the earth's space.  It reveals the laws of the development of society, human thinking and nature, explains the class struggle and the forms of transition to socialism (including the elimination of capitalism), talks about the creative activities of workers engaged in the construction of both a communist and socialist society. </p><p>  The largest party in the world is the Communist Party of China.  She follows in her endeavors the teachings of V.I. Lenin.  Its charter contains the following words: ‚ÄúMarxism-Leninism has found the laws of the historical evolution of mankind.  His basic principles are always true and have a powerful vitality. ‚Äù </p><h2>  First International </h2><p>  It is known that the Communist Internationals played a paramount role in the struggle of the working people for a better life.  The International Workers' Partnership was officially named the First International.  This is the first international formation of the working class, which was established on September 28, 1864 in London. </p><p>  This organization was liquidated after a split in 1872. </p><h2>  2nd International </h2><p>  The 2nd International (Worker or Socialist) was an international association of workers' socialist parties, created in 1889.  He inherited the traditions of his predecessor, but since 1893 there were no anarchists in his composition.  For uninterrupted communication between party members, the Socialist International Bureau, located in Brussels, was registered in 1900.  The International has made decisions that are not binding on the parties that comprise it. </p><h2>  Fourth International </h2><p>  The Fourth International is called the international communist organization, an alternative to Stalinism.  It is based on the theoretical heritage of Leon Trotsky.  The tasks of this formation were the implementation of the world revolution, the victory of the working class and the building of socialism. </p><p>  This International was established in 1938 by Trotsky and his associates in France.  These people believed that the Comintern was completely controlled by the Stalinists, that it was not able to bring the working class of the entire planet to the full conquest of political power.  That is why, in contrast, they created their own "Fourth International", whose members at that time were pursued by agents of the NKVD.  In addition, they were accused by supporters of the USSR and late Maoism of illegitimacy, crushed the bourgeoisie (France and the United States). </p><p>  This organization first suffered from a split in 1940, as well as from a more powerful split in 1953.  Partial reunification took place in 1963, but many groups claim that they are the political successors to the Fourth International. </p><h2>  Fifth International </h2><p>  What is the Fifth International?  This is the term used to designate left-wing radicals who want to create a new international workers' organization based on the ideology of Marxist-Leninist teaching and Trotskyism.  The members of this group consider themselves ascetics of the First International, the Communist Third, Trotskyite Fourth and Second. </p><h2>  Communism </h2><p>  And finally, let's figure out what the Russian Communist Party is?  It is based on communism.  In Marxism, this is a hypothetical economic and social system based on social equality, public property created from the means of production. </p>

    <p>  One of the most famous internationalist communist slogans is the dictum: "Workers of all countries, unite!"  Who said these famous words for the first time is known to few.  But we will reveal the secret: for the first time this slogan was voiced by Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx in the ‚ÄúManifesto of the Communist Party‚Äù. </p><p>  XIX   ¬´¬ª      - ,       .     ,    .    ,      ¬´ ‚Äì  ,  ‚Äì  !¬ª. </p><p> ,            . </p>
