Insured individuals who engage in professional sports are at greater risk of personal injury.

    <h2>  Auto Insurance Issues </h2><p>  <span>The Union of Auto Insurers (RSA)</span> has initiated a new bill, according to which compensation for compulsory motor liability insurance will be made in kind, that is, covering the cost of repairs.  This scheme will completely displace all cash from the market.  There will also be no need for the services of "auto lawyers".  They through the court seek to increase insurance payments, and for their services they take a percentage of the insurance premium received.  "Auto Lawyers" are deceiving citizens and insurers.  In 2015, they collected about 12 billion rubles. </p><p>  The introduction of compulsory registration of CTP insurance policies is the first step towards the appearance of in-kind reimbursement.  A single agent is a temporary measure, but in problem regions it will make it possible to switch to a direct choice of an insurer by a consumer.  One can talk about the complete curtailment of agent activity after the introduction of in-kind compensation. </p><h2>  CTP insurance policy </h2><p>  One of the promising areas of the company is car insurance.  But in order to draw up a policy, it is not at all necessary to apply to offices (RESO-Garantia in Moscow is one of the most popular insurers).  You can directly obtain a CTPL insurance policy directly through the company's website.  Let us consider in more detail how to do this. </p><p>  For the initial and repeated submission of an application for an insurance policy, you need to go to the section "Extend the insurance policy on the Internet."  Then you should register in your personal account, indicating your full name, phone number (aka login).  Be sure to give consent to the processing of personal data and click on the "Register" button.  After the "Data Check" you need to come up with a password and confirm it with a code from SMS.  The notification is also duplicated to the specified email address.  After clicking on the ‚ÄúRegister‚Äù button, an error pops up for many users. </p>

    <p>  Despite the notification, the user is already registered in the system.  This is indicated by the receipt of SMS with codes.  You need to enter your personal account, indicating the phone number and password.  In the menu on the left, select the "Apply for a policy" item.  Customers who have already issued policies through offices in Moscow (RESO-Garantia - the insurer we are considering) will be able to see their list in the "List of policies" section.  Right through the site, existing contracts can be rolled over.  If the policy expires, you will have to create a new one. </p><p>  In the application form, you must enter data about the car and driver.  The company requests both standard parameters and additional ones.  For example, full name  driver‚Äôs date of birth, a series of driver‚Äôs licenses are mandatory details for filling out any policy.  But why the company needs to know the location of the steering wheel, the number of passenger seats, the permitted mass when applying for motor third party liability insurance for a passenger car is unclear.  When filling out the form, you need to pay attention to the following fields: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúVU Date‚Äù - the date of issue of the first rights (if there was a replacement certificate). </li><li>  The card number is a 21-character number indicated in the notes.  You can check the data in a recreation center on EAISTO. </li></ul><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter if you decide to visit the RESO-Garantia company head office (Moscow) or any other branch, employees immediately enter data from the insurers database.  If the client draws up a policy through the site, then first of all it is necessary to focus on the information of the old contract.

    <h2>  Caution!  Clones </h2><p>  From January 1, 2017, insurance companies are obliged to sell CTP insurance policies.  In case of failure to comply with this requirement or the presence of permanent technical failures, the insurer may be fined. </p><p>  Such innovations immediately spurred fraudsters to create ‚Äúclone‚Äù sites selling electronic CTP.  Among the first on the market appeared visual copies of Rosgosstrakh, VSK and RESO.  The addresses of these sites are similar to real ones, but they are framed by anonymous persons.  There are also many sites of "intermediaries", which are generally prohibited by law in electronic OSAGO.  Already even received the first complaints from affected customers.  In case of purchase of the policy from scammers, funds are debited from the account, but the contract for e-mail is not received.  Or, conversely, a letter arrives in the mail with redrawn PDF files of these forms, but with fake stamps and signatures.  Such policies are not registered in any database, insurers for them are not responsible. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The described company has been on the market for more than 25 years.  To survive so long afloat, you need to have a streamlined system of work and quality management.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the person selection process is put on stream.  This is evidenced by the reviews of employees.  The positions of agents recruit students and young people with no work experience.  New applicants are invited to undergo free training lasting approximately two weeks, after which testing is conducted. </p><p>  The first year the employee works on a salary of 30 thousand rubles.  (before tax).  Only after this period does career growth become available.  Another drawback is that for the sale of the most popular product (insurance policy) premium is not charged.  Such a rhythm of work withstands for everyone, as evidenced by the large staff turnover. </p><h2>  25th anniversary </h2><p>  In 2016 IC RESO-Garantia will be 25 years old.  Over the years, the company has risen to third place in the list of market leaders.  The organization employs 20 thousand agents, opened 850 branches and points of sale.  Of the more than 100 types of services, the highest priorities are: car insurance, VHI, property protection, mortgage insurance, protection of life and health of tourists.  The competitiveness of the organization in the market is determined by the professionalism of the employees for whose training a special ‚ÄúInsurance School‚Äù was opened.  Those who pass it remain in the company. </p><h2>  2016 Results </h2><p>  The authorized capital of RESO-Garantia is 3.1 billion rubles.  In 2016, she earned 100 billion rubles.  For the first quarter of 2016 alone, the company took 1st place in terms of the number of CASCO policies sold, 2nd in OSAGO and VHI.  The accumulated funds are planned to be used to purchase insurance companies specializing in compulsory medical insurance and voluntary medical insurance. </p><p>  Over the past two years, more than 90% of electronic insurance policies issued by residents of the Crimea.  The main reason is that the regional coefficient is 0.6.  If it is canceled, then it will be easier to consider the cost of policies. </p><h2>  Reforms of e-CTP </h2><p>  In January 2017, 190 thousand electronic CTPs were signed - this is 60% of all policies sold in 2016.  On average, companies sell 9-10 thousand policies per day.  Most of the contracts were sold in the Krasnodar Territory (20.7 thousand contracts), Volgograd (9.7 thousand) and Rostov (9.5 thousand) regions, </p><p>  During the same time, the PCA received many complaints from users who could not issue an electronic policy.  An error occurred while redirecting from one site to another.  In 50% of cases, the reason for the failure was that the client incorrectly entered the date of receipt of the first certificate.  Another 30% of failures occurred after checking the region and the car.  Inconsistency of the data in the PCA database, the difficulty of filling out the questionnaire and technical failures are the most common problems that clients encountered when applying for policies. </p>
