    <p>  Let's start with general information about what the specified trademark is.  It has been present on the market since 2004, however, the launch of mobile devices began only in 2010. Prior to that, the developer specialized in the production of various media players, players and other equipment. </p><p>  The teXet tablet belongs to the category of budget gadgets for the reason that the cost of the most expensive of them reaches only 10 thousand rubles.  This means that many residents of the CIS countries can afford such a device, as the manufacturer expects.  Due to the low cost and easy to manage Android operating system, devices have truly become popular. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  You may ask - what hardware does the teXet tablet run on if its cost is so low?  We answer - the assembly of devices is carried out, traditionally for similar technology companies, in China.  The processors installed here are far from the most innovative;  the same goes for other modules.  It turns out that due to lower productivity and less expensive assembly materials, the price of the gadget is reduced, which is what buyers from the post-Soviet space are looking for.  In addition, device prices are reduced due to affiliate software released by Yandex, Mail.ru, RIA Novosti, Kommersant and others.  Since this software is bundled with a tablet computer, deductions for its placement from publishers can reduce the final price of the tablet.  Another plus is that users do not need to download all this again, because their favorite programs are already available on the tablet screen. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Reading such articles, an involuntary question arises - why did you choose the teXet tablet?  After all, there are many other manufacturers (including from China) that may offer more productive models of devices at affordable prices.  What are the advantages teXet has over them? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  There are several of them.  Firstly, it is a domestic company representing the country in the market of advanced technologies.  Of course, Chinese developers can offer customers more - but by purchasing these devices, we support the Russian electronics manufacturer.  Secondly, it is the availability of devices from teXet.  Tablets, prices for which are in the lower price range, are usually unable to perform some complex tasks and processes due to their poor technical equipment.  In principle, the same applies to teXet, only the set of functions that the average user needs is available here.  In particular, it can be a convenient ‚Äúreader‚Äù of books, a device for surfing the Internet, games, watching movies and the like.  If the owner is not going to play colorful races or ‚Äúshooters‚Äù with the maximum requirements - for everything else, the teXet tablet is the perfect solution.  Thirdly, it is the compactness and comfort that the device can boast of.  The features described above are available in a small 7-inch case, which can be carried in the jacket pocket and thus stay in touch at any time.  Here, as an advantage, you can include a nice design and a colorful tablet screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Of course, the negative side of the teXet tablet (reviews confirm this) also have.  Their first category is in poor equipment, both hardware and technical.  Some users do not have enough tablet power, say, when playing a widescreen movie or launching a ‚Äúcumbersome‚Äù, in terms of requirements, game.  For others, the device is not reliable enough, since it can fail with any shock.  As you know, working with such a device is not easy - you have to treat it more carefully. </p><p>  The second category of shortcomings that can be found in teXet products is the negligent attitude of manufacturers.  It is expressed in a variety of ways - starting from a factory defect, the consequence of which is that the battery runs out too quickly for unknown reasons, and ending with a lack of spare parts for a device that is out of order.  Such situations also happen and, unfortunately, no buyer is safe from them. </p><h2>  How to choose a tablet? </h2>

    <p>  However, if you are interested in any of the teXet tablets, and you would even like to purchase it, you need to remember a few criteria that allow you to choose the device that suits you the most.  In the following sections, we give them and describe which tablet computers have these or those features. </p><h2>  Display and processor </h2><p>  For most users, the screen (its image quality and size) is the determining factor when choosing.  If we are talking about teXet products, it has several tablet formats.  In particular, here is a tablet with a screen whose diagonal is 10.1 inches (teXet X Pad Navi tablet), which has a resolution of 1024 by 600 pixels and a processor frequency of 1.3 GHz;  2 cameras (2 and 0.3 megapixels each).  To reduce, it should be mentioned a device with a display diagonal of 9.7 inches (TM-9777) with the same processor clock speed, running on 4 cores.  Display resolution - 1024 by 768 pixels.  In the line of tablets there is also an eight-inch representative - X-pad Rapid 8 4G (model code is TM-8069).  A processor with similar characteristics is also installed here, but, in addition, the manufacturer equipped the device with a module for working in 4G high-speed mobile Internet networks. </p>

      <p></p>
    <p>  There are also several 7-inch devices in the company's lineup.  For example, X-Pad Hit.  They installed the 7-inch screen on this teXet tablet for a reason - the concept of the model is such that it has mediocre technical specifications (for example, 512 MB RAM).  However, due to its compact size and mobile nature, the tablet is easy to use.  say for reading books or surfing. </p><h2>  Additional modules </h2><p>  Of course, in addition to the image quality on the device and its reaction speed, various additional modules also play an important role.  It could be, for example, a camera.  Most tablets are equipped with a set of two cameras - the front and the main, the resolution of which is 0.3 and 2 megapixels, respectively.  There are, however, special models.  For example, in teXet 8 (the tablet is completely called X_force 8), the main camera has a 5-megapixel matrix;  while another product from the company - Hit (it was already mentioned) is equipped only with a front camera for Skype-talks or ‚Äúselfies‚Äù. </p>

      <p></p>
    <p>  You can also pay attention to the number of supported SIM-cards and the presence of the 3G / LTE module.  Regarding the first one, it can be noted that some devices come with two SIM cards (NaviPad TM-7049 3G).  This allows you to save on traffic through various promotions that can be used by both operators.  Moreover, teXet has a module for receiving and transmitting calls.  This allows you to use the computer as a telephone. </p><p>  As for support for working in wireless mobile networks, the name of the tablet may indicate this.  For example, the TM-1058 X-force 10 (3G) operates in the format of third-generation networks, while the more expensive model, the X-pad Rapid 8 4G TM-8069, also boasts high-speed LTE networks. </p><h2>  Appearance and price </h2><p>  Of course, in addition to the technical features (3G support, RAM, processor clock speed and device screen resolution), it is also necessary to take into account the appearance of the device, its design.  To do this, it is recommended to work with the tablet live: hold it in your hands, feel the texture of the case, its lines, bends.  Since you will contact the device often enough, it is necessary that this work be as comfortable as possible. </p>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Also, do not forget about the price of the device.  For example, if you want the most productive teXet tablet (3G, GSM-module, 2 SIM should be included there), then you can safely buy the most expensive of the devices, which in terms of functionality is clearly ahead of others.  And, on the contrary, if you need a device with a minimum set of functions, you can save on it by buying some X-Pad Hit for 3 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  When choosing any device, important attention should be paid to the reviews that other customers left about it.  So you can in a simplified form and without unnecessary efforts to find out what the device is, what kind of problems it may arise and how to avoid them.  Regarding teXet products from customers, reviews come in different ways - and that's normal.  Someone claims that the devices are buggy, someone is not happy with the released new firmware of the teXet tablet, others note excessive heating and quick discharge of the model.  People who encounter problems describe them in full detail in order to prevent other people from repeating them in the future.  And your task is to find out everything to the maximum extent. </p>
