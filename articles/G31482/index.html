  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ferries from Klaipeda: main destinations for traveling by sea from Lithuania</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Lithuania is a small and beautiful state that must be visited for the sake of majestic historical sights, unique nature and beautiful sea.  By the way, the latter may turn out to be not only a place of leisure, but also a further trip.  Klaipeda ferries operate with special regularity and operate flights to Germany and Sweden.  We will talk about some of them later in the article. </p><h2>  Destination in Kiel (Germany) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": Alfred Henz, " data-source="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/354095589424011895/?lp=true"><img itemprop="image" alt="Port city of Kiel (Germany)" class="if uuid-2855407" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103961/2855407.jpg"></div><p>  The passenger ferry from Klaipeda to Kiel connects Lithuania and Germany.  The destination is considered popular, trips are performed with special regularity 7 days a week.  The average travel time is 20 hours.  Departure from Lithuania is carried out at 22-00, arrival at the place - at 17-00.  It should be noted that the frequency and duration of the route may be adjusted depending on the season and season. </p><p>  DFDS Seaways, where you can book tickets online, can help arrange your departure.  The latter can easily be done on specialized aggregator sites, for example, Ferries.ru.  The cost of such a trip is from 260 euros.  Special offers are subject to the conditions: 2 people and 1 car. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Flight to Travemuende (Germany) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Port city of Travemunde (Germany)" class="if uuid-2855415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103961/2855415.jpg"></div><p>  Another ferry from Klaipeda to Germany is organized to the city of Travemunde.  This direction is less popular in comparison with Kiel, so finding and booking a ticket is not always possible.  Basically, the trip is available in the summer season, and TT Line is considered the service operator.  Buying a ticket is better through Direct Ferries, there is a decent choice based on various transportation offers. </p><p>  The cost of such a trip is much lower than in Kiel, and the geographical remoteness allows you to quickly get to the German city.  As some travelers note, the ferry is considered ideal in terms of the absence of traffic jams in Poland.  Such actions provide truckers a great way to transport goods. </p><h2>  Destination in Karlshamn (Sweden) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="marinas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Port city Karlshamn (Sweden)" class="if uuid-2855421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103961/2855421.jpg"></div><p>  The popular Karlshamn ferry service connects Lithuania and Southern Sweden with a single transport link.  The presented direction is served by several operators at once, in particular, Optima Seaways, Patria Seaways and Athena Seaways.  The route is laid in both directions and is carried out with a frequency of up to 10 flights a week, travel time on average 13 hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The cost of transportation depends on the season and the load of the ferry, the price from Klaipeda varies from 260 to 380 euros per person.  This provides the opportunity to travel by car.  Additional documents, with the exception of a visa, are not required.  For freight transport owners, such a route will also become a quick and convenient transportation, ideal in every sense of the word. </p><h2>  Klaipeda to Trelleborg (Sweden) Ferry </h2><div class="photo" data-original="lavagra.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The port city of Trelleborg" class="if uuid-2855424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103961/2855424.jpg"></div><p>  Flights to Sweden are carried out in the port city of Trelleborg.  Currently, only one operator is ready to provide travel on the specified route - TT Line.  Klaipeda ferry operates only 1 flight per week during the summer.  The duration of the trip is about 17 hours, but the cost is much lower in comparison with Karlshamn - 180-220 euros. </p><p>  Sometimes there are difficulties booking in the direction presented.  Therefore, we recommend reserving tickets for at least 3 weeks.  To do this, use special aggregators or the official website of the carrier.  Please note that the urgent purchase of ferry tickets is carried out directly at the box office.  It is necessary to specify the time of work on specialized sites of the city administration. </p><h2>  A few words about domestic ferries </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.artmajeur.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Curonian Spit" class="if uuid-2855436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103961/2855436.jpg"></div><p>  Domestic passenger flights are also carried out from the port city.  The most popular of them is considered to be the ferry from Klaipeda to the Curonian Spit.  The routes are carried out with special constancy with the new and old <span>ferry services.</span>  The first flight leaves at 5:40, and the last at 00:30.  There are trips sooner and later, but only for local residents.  The fare on a regular route for 1 person with a bike is 0.8 euros.  It is cheaper than a city bus, although the average transportation time is the same - 20 minutes. </p><p>  Klaipeda ferries are an amazing way to travel around Europe, enjoy the picturesque nature of the cold Baltic Sea.  Less than a day will pass, and you will find yourself in Germany or Sweden on your own car.  Unless, of course, you have seasickness ... </p>
