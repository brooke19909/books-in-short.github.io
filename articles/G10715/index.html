Quite the contrary, quite wealthy, wealthy people are currently engaged in such creativity.  Why do they do it?  The answer is simple - refinement of the details allows you to create a unique, fashionable and, of course, original thing. </p><p>  How to make old things new?  Is it important to be a seamstress or designer to please yourself with a new thing?  What methods and techniques of transformation are the most popular?  This will be discussed in the article. </p><h2>  Jacket with a hole </h2><div class="photo" data-original="frankielauren.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transform a t-shirt" class="if uuid-3074787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3074787.jpg"></div><p>  Each person has at least one favorite knitted T-shirt, T-shirt, turtleneck.  However, over time, after an unsuccessful wash or a sloppy sock, it may break.  And then it must either be sewn up or thrown away.  But the first option will be too noticeable, and the second will force you to part with your favorite clothes.  How to be </p><p>  Many designers propose to make a new thing out of an old thing - fashionable and spectacular.  This will require scissors.  We cut out circles, triangles, squares or other shapes, thereby masking the problem and giving things originality. </p><h2>  Blouse with a butterfly </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ph.priceprice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new thing from old" class="if uuid-3074841" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3074841.jpg"></div><p>  Experienced craftswomen note that it is not necessary to cut holes thoughtlessly.  In addition, you can not save torn clothes, but transform boring ones.  Talking about how to make new things out of old things, designers say that any silhouette should be cut out of paper.  For example, butterflies.  Transfer it to the fabric, and then cut a lot of holes within it.  The result is a very bright and unusual blouse.  Wearing such a model is better with a contrasting shirt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Jeans with hearts </h2><p>  Even very beautiful, comfortable and stylish clothes can someday get bored.  This is especially true of jeans trousers that we wear almost every day.  However, if desired, they can also be diversified!  How to make a new thing from an old one? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.babyshop.no" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to decorate jeans" class="if uuid-3074776" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3074776.jpg"></div><p>  Really easy!  We prepare jeans for remaking, a simple pencil, multi-colored sewing threads and a needle.  After handwriting or using a template, draw hearts.  Then embroider them with thread. </p><p>  An alternative transformation requires preparation of the paint.  It is possible to use intended for fabrics.  Color can be any.  We cut out the hearts, remove the parts, and use the sheet as a stencil.  We apply to jeans and paint the hole with paint. </p><h2>  Jacket with cilia </h2><p>  Do it yourself with your own hands from old things rather quickly and easily.  Therefore, many people specifically buy regular clothes or second-hand goods.  For example, a plain black t-shirt with a simple cut can be complemented with cilia cut out of white leather and bright pink knitted lips.  The product will look very impressive, stylish and original.  In addition, it is suitable for both a casual bow and a rock-style party. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Gradient t-shirt </h2><p>  The ombre technique barely appeared, immediately won the hearts of fashionistas and quickly became popular.  However, it is not necessary to look for such a thing in a store.  After all, you can always make a new thing from the old.  How? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rosegal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new thing from old do it yourself" class="if uuid-3074861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3074861.jpg"></div><p>  Very simple!  We take a white T-shirt, 9% vinegar, a basin with warm water (so much as to immerse the necessary part of the thing) and ordinary green.  If desired (to obtain a different color), you can use beetroot juice, turmeric, onion broth, cinnamon or special paints for the fabric.  After that we pour the dye into the water, mix (most importantly, not by hand!).  Then we lower part of the shirt and leave for 3-4 hours.  We get it. </p><p>  We dilute the coloring composition in half with water.  And again we lower the thing into it, but we lower it below the previous result.  Also hold 3-4 hours. </p><p>  After that, in clean water, do not rinse, but lower it into another bowl filled with vinegar (undiluted).  Leave for an hour and a half.  We get out and only then rinse in clean water (without powder!).  Dry, and then wear with pleasure! </p><h2>  Jacket with a silhouette of the city </h2><p>  The following alteration can be called a real work of art.  How to make a new thing out of an old one, so beautiful and unusual? </p><div class="photo" data-original="a1glasswindows.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new thing from old step by step" class="if uuid-3074868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3074868.jpg"></div><p>  Need a spray of black acrylic paint, a sheet of paper, scissors and a simple pencil.  We draw a silhouette of city roofs.  Or you can print the desired picture in advance on a printer.  Then cut out.  We will need the top. </p><p>  We apply it to the T-shirt and paint the bottom of the thing well with black.  We remove the stencil.  After we decorate the top of the T-shirt, spraying the paint from a short distance.  First, it is recommended to decorate the back to practice, and then dry and arrange before. </p><h2>  Sweatshirt with colored splashes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="fr.dresslily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a new thing from an old idea for creativity" class="if uuid-3074895" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3074895.jpg"></div><p>  Another interesting idea that will allow you to make a new thing out of an old thing involves very simple and even funny actions.  It is only necessary to prepare a jacket, acrylic paints of different colors, a brush and a large oilcloth.  Then we spread it.  Put the selected item on top.  Dip a brush in the paint, and then just spray on the fabric.  You can also put large blots. </p><p>  When the creative process is completed, the decorated jacket must be thoroughly dried.  That's all! </p><h2>  Patterned clothes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new thing from an old idea" class="if uuid-3074886" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3074886.jpg"></div><p>  On the shelves of stores there are a huge number of sweaters, T-shirts, T-shirts, even trousers and shorts, which are decorated with real paintings.  Such a thing is quite expensive.  However, if you have an inkjet printer, you can make the necessary option yourself.  To do this, you just need to purchase special paper.  After that, we prepare the wardrobe item for the decor, print out the selected pattern, apply it to the fabric and warm it with an iron.  After a while, carefully remove!  And voila, the fashionable blouse is ready! </p><h2>  Interesting bag </h2><p>  When wondering how to make new things out of old things, it is important to consider that not only clothes, but also accessories will be able to transform or transform.  There can be a ton of creativity.  However, the most popular, original and simple is a bag made from old denim trousers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="furniture.digitalassetmanagement.site" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bag of old jeans" class="if uuid-3074749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3074749.jpg"></div><p>  In order to fulfill it, it is necessary to prepare a worn item, scissors, a needle or a sewing machine and threads that have expired.  After that, cut off the top of the jeans (to the fly).  This is the main part of the idea.  Now you should prepare the bottom.  Cut the rectangle of the desired size from the leg.  Its perimeter should be equal to the circumference of the bag.  We turn the parts to the wrong side and sew.  Stronger preferably so that the bottom does not fall off.  Then we cut out the pens and also sew to the base.  Finally, we decorate the new thing at our discretion.  The only thing that a homemade bag was as similar to a factory bag as possible is that it needs to be complemented with a lining. </p><p>  On this our article comes to an end.  We can only wish readers creative success and an unlimited number of new ideas.  And if you want to share your fiction, we will only be happy!  Leave it with a comment at the end of the article. </p>
