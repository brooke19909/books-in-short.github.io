  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crocheted handbags. Beautiful unique accessories to complete the look</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Additional accessories for women‚Äôs outfits, such as a bag, shoes, gloves, scarves, ties, etc.  not only complete the image, making it holistic and complete, but also give a special chic, individuality and originality to each woman.  And, if, at times, it is difficult to express oneself with the help of clothes, then with the help of additions, especially made with your own hands, the desired effect is easier to achieve.  A bag is one of the most important women's accessories.  The famous fashion designer Vyacheslav Zaitsev once urged women to abandon standard, faceless bags bought in a store and create something original, embodying their own ideas about the ideal thing in design. </p><p>  For women who know how to knit, this is one of the ways to create an exclusive, especially since crocheted and knitted bags are very fashionable.  The versatility of this type of needlework allows you to realize any fantasies and make of threads a classic elegant ladies' reticule or a modern <span>sports backpack, a</span> bright roomy <span>beach bag,</span> or a comfortable everyday one.  And it‚Äôs not necessary to wait for the summer.  Depending on the style, color and material, <span>crocheted</span> or <span>knitted bags</span> can be worn all year round.  For example, a bag made with a ‚Äúfur‚Äù pattern from <span>melange yarn</span> will be a great addition to a fur jacket or down jacket, and knitting with a relief pattern with leather or felt trim will effectively complement an elegant autumn outfit. </p><p>  <strong>Knitted backpack</strong> </p><p>  Original crochet handbags are very easy to carry out.  Perhaps the simplest and most democratic model is a backpack for a young girl from bright yarn with a large comfortable pocket.  It will require approximately 200 grams of thick twisted yarn.  For example, 100 grams of saturated brown and 50 grams of light beige and green.  For a backpack, you need to tie a rectangular canvas with single crochet columns, 25x60 cm in size, which is then sewn together on the sides into a rectangular bag.  Then, the upper edge of the bag is tied in a circle first with a strip of beige yarn, then of green.  The work ends with a wide strip of brown yarn, on which, departing from the edge by 5 cm, holes are made for the cord.  Before stitching a backpack, a large pocket of beige and green stripes about 15x15 cm in size is knitted on its front side, in the center. The pocket can be tied separately as a square, starting from the center or from the bottom, or tied directly onto the fabric by inserting a hook into the central columns and pulling successively loops that are knit with crochets.  After the desired pocket size is connected, it is sewn on the sides to the main part of the backpack. </p><p>  Then twist two cords with a length of 120 cm. For each take 2 strands of beige and two green 300 cm each. Connect their ends with knots.  Tie one end of the threads to the <span>doorknob</span> and begin to twist them in one direction rather tightly until they are twisted along the entire length.  Remove the end attached to the handle, the cord is bent in half.  He immediately twists into a tight tourniquet.  Swipe it up and down to level it.  Similarly, you need to make a second lace.  Ready twisted harnesses are inserted into the holes at the top edge of the backpack.  One on the front side, the other on the back.  At the bottom, the ends of the cords are connected together and decorated with a brush. </p><p>  Crocheted <span>bags</span> complement well with leather details.  For this, straps, valves, side walls of old, already fed up models are suitable.  They are carefully evaporated and used in a new design.  Crocheted handbags in combination with leather should be tight enough and keep their shape well.  Therefore, the knitted fabric should be duplicated with a special dense material, and the entire product "put" on the lining. </p><p>  A beautiful crocheted bag is obtained from individual motifs (circles or squares), which are then collected in a single piece.  An elegant bag is obtained from openwork elements, from simpler and smoother ones - everyday. </p>
