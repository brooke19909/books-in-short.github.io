    <h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  The Oktyabrsky district, where the facility is being built, is one of the most prestigious in the metropolis.  LCD Liverpool (Samara) is located right in the city center, on Nikolay Panov Street.  Nearby is a large transport artery - the Moscow highway.  All city transport is available to residents of the complex. </p><p>  Since Samara is a city with a population of over a million inhabitants, it has a subway, near which Liverpool residential complex (Samara) is located.  The developer deliberately chose a plot of land located in the immediate vicinity of the Rossiyskaya and Moskovskaya metro stations.  The distance to them is less than a kilometer, that is, you can even get there on foot, and it will take no more than fifteen to twenty minutes. </p>

    <h2>  Description of the residential complex "Liverpool" </h2><p>  LCD "Liverpool" (Samara) was conceived and designed by the developer as a <span>residential complex of</span> business class.  In total, four multi-sectional residential buildings of different floors will be erected on the territory.  The construction is made of bricks, which will allow residents to significantly save heat in the cold season and not freeze in the off-season. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Elite real estate in Samara, including new buildings, has a developed infrastructure.  All the first floors of the complex will be non-residential.  It will house offices, beauty salons, pharmacies and many other organizations that provide various services to the population. </p>

    <p>  One of the main advantages of the LCD is not only its location near the main transport artery of the city, but also that the view from the window will be beautiful: on the one hand - a landscaped courtyard area, on the other - the streets adjacent to the complex, surrounded by greenery. </p><h2>  Affordable Infrastructure </h2><p>  Thanks to such a good choice by the developer of the land plot, the Liverpool residential complex (Samara) is located near important objects: schools, lyceums, a gymnasium, kindergartens, a hypermarket and convenience stores.  There is no shortage of polyclinics, or pools, or sports complexes.  All the institutions without which the modern resident of the metropolis does not imagine its existence are accessible to future residents of the complex. </p><p>  The Oktyabrsky district, where the Liverpool residential complex (Samara) is located, is located in the immediate vicinity of the Volga, where everything is buried in verdure.  This residential complex was no exception.  A hundred meters from it there is a botanical garden where it is good to stroll in the evening before going to bed or come to rest with the whole family.  On the other side of the complex, a new recreation area called Peace Park has appeared, ready to hospitably welcome lovers of leisurely walks and fresh air into their arms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Thus, despite the location in the center of the metropolis, Liverpool residential complex (Samara) can offer its residents a favorable ecological environment created by these parks and green spaces near the houses </p><h2>  Layout of apartments </h2><p>  What does the future residents of LCD Liverpool (Samara) offer?  Layouts of apartments are supposed to be very different.  In this complex, everyone will find housing that he needs.  Both single citizens and large families will be able to settle here.  The project provides for one-room, two-room and three-room apartments with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 85 square meters.  m </p><p>  The rooms are divided by partitions.  But the builder does not produce interior decoration, allowing future property owners to do everything to their liking and in accordance with their desires.  Metal doors are installed in the apartments, window openings are glazed with plastic windows, electrical wiring is carried out.  In addition, a heating system is installed with metering devices, risers.  The houses will be connected to central water supply and sewage systems. </p><h2>  Square meters and the cost of apartments </h2><p>  What are the prices for real estate in Samara?  And how does this compare with the cost of housing in the new complex, which will be commissioned in the first half of 2017?  LCD "Liverpool" (Samara), reviews of which are mostly positive, are not striking for the sky-high prices.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãone-room apartments reaches forty or more square meters.  The price starts at thirty-nine thousand per square meter.  Thus, you can move into a one-room apartment, having paid for it a little pain of one million six hundred thousand rubles.  A three-room apartment will cost about three million four hundred thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  The benefits of living in a complex </h2><p>  First of all, new buildings will always be appreciated by buyers.  Brand new buildings and communications are not yet dilapidated.  In addition, the location of the complex in the city center gives a lot of advantages to its residents.  If one of them improves their living conditions, then he will not need to change his usual way of life, work.  From the complex you can get to any end of the city equally quickly, both by your own car and by public transport. </p><p>  But living in Liverpool, you can enjoy the fresh air provided by two parks, one of which is the Botanical Garden.  The yard territory itself will also not be left without attention of the developer and will be ennobled by green spaces, lawns, flower beds. </p><p>  The lack of interior decoration will allow residents of the complex to realize their dreams and ideas in the design of the room.  They will not have to redo the typical repair of the builder, to spend on this effort and money. </p>
