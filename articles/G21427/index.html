  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Basics of Research</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Scientific research</span> is a form of existence and development of any science.  Research activity is an activity that is aimed at obtaining new knowledge and their practical application.  Despite the fact that sciences are classified depending on the field of knowledge, subject and <span>method of knowledge, the</span> foundations of scientific research are an integral part of any science. </p><p>  The concept of ‚Äúscientific research‚Äù defines an activity that is aimed at a comprehensive study of the investigated object, phenomenon or process, their internal structure and relationships, obtaining on this basis and putting into practice useful results for human existence.  In order for scientific specialists to correctly conduct the necessary scientific research in the study of science, the discipline of the basis of scientific research is studied in almost all higher educational institutions. </p><p>  This discipline is an integral part of the training of a <span>highly qualified specialist</span> and is an important stage in the preparation of a scientist for independent research activities.  The course of the discipline "foundations of scientific research" is aimed at the formation of knowledge that helps to solve the following typical problems: </p><p>  mathematical modeling of objects and processes;  <span>definition of a method for</span> their research and development of an algorithm for implementing this method; </p><p>  -building models of processes and objects in order to analyze them and obtain the most optimal parameters; </p><p>  - compilation of experimental research programs, the implementation of these programs, including the selection of the necessary technical means, obtaining and processing the results; </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - compilation of reports on the results obtained in the course of ongoing research. </p><p>  The process of studying the discipline "foundations of scientific research" consists of the following main sections: </p><p>  1. Methods of scientific knowledge. </p><p>  2. Methods of theoretical and empirical research. </p><p>  <span>3. Organization of scientific research</span> and their stages. </p><p>  4. Procedures for the development and design of new technical objects. </p><p>  5. Theoretical studies. </p><p>  6. Construction of models of physical processes and objects. </p><p>  7. Conducting experimental studies and processing their results. </p><p>  To conduct research in various fields of science, both general and specific methods are used, which are possible only in specific specific sciences.  For example, the fundamentals of scientific research in agronomy will fundamentally differ from the methods by which such research is carried out in the <span>exact sciences.</span>  However, existing research methods can be classified according to a single general classification: </p><p>  1. Philosophical <span>research methods</span> that can be determined by subsections: </p><p>  -objectivity; </p><p>  - comprehensiveness; </p><p>  specificity; </p><p>  -historism; </p><p>  - the dialectical principle of contradiction; </p><p>  2. Generalized scientific methods and approaches. </p><p>  3. Private scientific methods. </p><p>  4. Disciplinary methods. </p><p>  5. Methods of interdisciplinary research. </p><p>  Thus, the whole methodology cannot be reduced to any one method, even if it is most important.  A true scientist and researcher cannot rely on only one single doctrine and cannot limit himself in his thinking to only a single philosophy.  Therefore, the entire <span>methodology of scientific research is</span> not simply composed of individual possible methods, but constitutes their ‚Äúmechanical unity‚Äù. </p><p>  The methodology that is the basis of scientific knowledge is a dynamic, integral, complex subordinated system of techniques, methods and principles of different levels, different scope and focus, contents and structures.  In addition to conducting the research itself, it is important to patent the results.  Therefore, such disciplines as patent science and the fundamentals of scientific research are extremely important for the training of modern highly qualified specialists. </p>
