Today everything has changed.  Thailand, in particular the island of Phuket, is one of the most popular tourist destinations.  Charters annually bring a large number of guests from cold Russia to this heavenly place. </p><h2>  What is Thailand attractive for? </h2><p>  Southeast Asia is an exotic destination that beckons with its culture, gorgeous beaches and lush vegetation.  Pictures of islands from coconut chocolate advertising are a well-known commercial trick, but here this dream can come true. </p>

    <p>  Thailand is attractive not only due to the diversity of flora and fauna, but also due to the hospitality of the country's inhabitants.  Thais are nice people, it is very interesting to immerse themselves in their culture and life, to see the sights, to taste the local cuisine.  All this deserves our attention. </p><h2>  Phuket - the island of dreams come true </h2><p>  Phuket Island - one of the <span>resorts of Thailand,</span> where life is in full swing all year round.  In the summer, it is somewhat windy here, so this place becomes a pilgrimage for surfers.  From the window of the 4 * Sunset Beach Resort hotel you can enjoy beautiful views of the bay at such a time.  You can admire not only the sunsets, but also those who decided to conquer the wave. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Phuket is a large island with a developed infrastructure.  It will appeal to adults and children, and families, and young couples.  The climatic zone of the island implies rest all year round, but due to winds in the summer, trips to sea excursions are limited.  For some vacationers, this information is very important when choosing a destination for tourism. </p>

    <p>  The beach of the hotel is the northern part of Patong.  This place is not as crowded as the main section of the coast, but it is quite cozy.  Boulders separate it from the main beach of the island.  There are umbrellas and sunbeds from the hotel where you can enjoy sunbathing. </p><p>  Also on the territory there is everything that a traveler needs: a shop, a restaurant, a bar, a tour desk.  For those who decided to go to the center of Patong, to the Jangzeilon store or to Bangla Road, where there are bars and discos, as well as tents for selling all kinds of things, a round-trip transfer is organized from 4 * Sunset Beach Resort.  Taxi in Phuket, as well as on other islands, is quite expensive, so this additional service attracts many tourists. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel complex operates according to the "Breakfast" system.  This system is widespread throughout the country; rare hotels offer Half Board or All Inclusive.  This feature is not accidental.  Food in Thailand is affordable, cheap, and cafes and restaurants in tourist spots can be found at every turn.  You can even eat from the macaques (mobile kitchens).  In general, it is safe, but Phuket is especially famous for its delicious fruits. </p><p>  <span>Hotel Sunset Beach Resort</span> 4 * is proud of its restaurant.  It serves Thai, European, and fresh seafood.  The food is always fresh and very tasty.  This is confirmed by guest reviews. </p>

This feature also works during the day and during dinner. </p><h2>  Guest reviews, pros and cons of the complex </h2><p>  In order to determine how good Sunset Beach Resort is, reviews are reviewed both positive and negative, and only from reliable sources. </p><p>  <em>Hotel Pros</em> </p><p>  Among the advantages, guests note the convenient location of the complex.  On the one hand, this is the central part of the tourist center of Phuket, on the other - a cozy quiet corner away from the noisy nightlife. </p><p>  Another plus, as guests note, is the restaurant.  Masterpieces of the local chef attract not only vacationers of this hotel, but also tourists from all over Patong.  Food prices do not bite. </p>

    <p>  Room service and cleanliness deserve a solid four.  This is a worthy mark.  They also praise the large swimming pool, made in an interesting style and creating an atmosphere of intimacy with nature. </p><p>  <em>Cons of the hotel</em> </p><p>  In 2003, Sunset Beach Resort 4 * complex was built in the north of Patong.  The reviews of 2015 indicate that today the question has ripened that it is time to carry out cosmetic repairs in the rooms.  This is logical, because tourists want to come to the best apartments. </p><p>  Another problem of the hotel is the small beach.  It is called the place where it is better to relax without small children.  The problem of the beach also lies in the fact that the main Patong is not as close as it might seem from the very beginning.  As a result, a truly beach hotel cannot be called. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the hotel is somewhat less than the 4 * mark, but you cannot call it bad either.  This is a cozy place worthy of the attention of tourists. </p><h2>  Hotel group Sunset </h2><p>  The hotel belongs to the Sunset hotel group, which operates in many countries of the world, having earned a reputation as a resort complex of a good standard. </p>

    <p>  Speaking about one hotel, one cannot but mention the other two, which are also located in Thailand.  One of them is The Sunset Village Beach Resort 4 * (Pattaya).  This hotel is located in a cozy bay at the entrance to Pattaya.  Here tourists are waiting for their own beach and tropical bungalows. </p><p>  Next to this hotel is the second complex of this group - Sunset Park Beach Resort &amp; Spa 4 *.  The concept of rest in it is also aimed at full unity with nature. </p><p>  Pattaya and Phuket are the two most popular destinations of Thailand for the domestic tourist flow.  Vacationers should pay attention to the resort complexes of the Sunset group. </p>
