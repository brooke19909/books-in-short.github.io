Sights, weather, reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Republic of Malta (Repubblika ta 'Malta) is an <span>island nation</span> in the Mediterranean Sea.  Since the archipelago lies at the crossroads of routes leading from Europe to Africa and the Middle East, it has been inhabited for a long time and has long been the subject of territorial disputes and wars.  It can be said that Malta became the penultimate colony in Europe.  She gained independence from Britain only in 1964, but until 1979 the Queen of England was considered the head of the islands (albeit nominally).  The Republic of Malta became in 1974.  What attracts tourists to a small island state?  Yes, almost everyone.  Tourists claim that here is the most comfortable climate.  On the territory, which is smaller than the Moscow bypass automobile ring, a huge amount of historical and natural attractions fit in.  In addition, Malta is known as a business travel destination.  Judging by the reviews, people come here mainly to pull up the English language.  After all, such courses are much cheaper than in mainland Europe.  The Republic of Malta is also known for its thalassotherapy centers.  The Mediterranean Sea does not compare with the Red in magnificence of its inhabitants.  However, so many medieval ships, Turkish galleys and other ships sank off the coast of Malta that divers from all over the world come here to dive into the local depths and look into the underwater grottoes.  But for those who do not know how to handle scuba diving, an unforgettable beach vacation awaits in Malta.  In a word, a tiny state requires the most detailed study.  What will be done in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Republic of Malta" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1050140.jpg" width="600"></div>

A small spot on the surface of the Mediterranean Sea on closer inspection turns into a small archipelago.  The largest island in it is Malta.  Its size is twenty-seven by fifteen kilometers.  Next is the island of Gozo - it is half the size.  On Comino, two kilometers long, several dozen people live.  And the tiny islands of Filfla, Filfoletta, Cominotto and St. Paul are completely uninhabited.  There are no permanent rivers and natural lakes in Malta.  All fresh water is extracted from underground.  The highest point of the archipelago is the low Ta-Dmeirek hill (two hundred and fifty-three meters above sea level).  This mountain is located on the southwestern tip of the <span>island of Malta.</span>  The country appeared on the map of the European Union in 2004, and the Schengen area at the end of 2007.  The euro replaced the local lira in January 2008.  The capital of the state is Valletta, located on the island of Malta.  Tourists speak of it as a city full of various attractions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malta on the map" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1050143.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The small archipelago, located at the center of the intersection of sea routes from Africa to Europe and Asia, has long attracted various kinds of conquerors.  The very name of the island and state comes from the ancient Phoenician word malat, which means "refuge", "quiet haven."  And the truth: two vast and cozy bays in the northeast gave shelter to mariners during protracted Mediterranean storms.  But even before the arrival of the Phoenicians (in the eighth century BC), the archipelago was inhabited.  Mysterious tribes of the Neolithic era built megalithic temples and fortified villages here.  For the Phoenicians came the Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Normans, Arabs and Spaniards.  Charles V transferred the island in 1530 to the monks of the Johannites.  By its ‚Äúheadquarters‚Äù this warlike <span>monastic order</span> became known as the Maltese.  In those days, not without the assistance of one of the commanders of the Johannite monks, the current capital of the island appeared - Valletta.  Malta remained under the order until the conquests of Napoleon.  The Little Corsican abolished monastic authority, expropriated the treasures of the churches, and at the same time abolished slavery.  The culturally shocked Maltese did not appreciate Napoleon's reforms and called for help from Britain.  The British occupied Valletta in 1800.  But legally the archipelago became <span>part of Britain</span> only in 1814, according to the clauses of the Paris Peace Treaty.  Traveler reviews say that at every step on the islands you can find ancient buildings.  In the modern world, the Republic of Malta, ceasing to be the naval base of Great Britain, immediately reoriented to tourism.  Now this is the main backbone of its economy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather in Malta" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1050142.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, the sultry breath of Africa is softened by sea winds.  The authoritative publication International Living recognized the climate of the Maltese archipelago as the best in the world.  According to the scientific classification of K√∂ppen, it is typically Mediterranean.  This means that the weather in Malta is always comfortable for humans.  The average temperature in the year is + 23 ¬∞ C.  Even in the coldest month (January), the thermometer column in the afternoon fluctuates in the range +12 ... +20 ¬∞ .  The greatest ‚Äúfrost‚Äù in the entire history of observing the climate reached ... +2.6 ¬∞ .  Precipitation on the islands is not very much - 550 millimeters per year.  It rains mostly in winter.  But this is not a "wet season" at all - say reviews.  Partly cloudy rains.  In summer, the weather in Malta is moderately hot.  The average temperatures at this time of year are +26 ... +28 degrees Celsius.  The hottest month of the year is August.  Then the thermometer column fluctuates between +20 ... +24 ¬∞  at night and +28 ... +34 ¬∞  in the afternoon.  The record maximum was +43.1 ¬∞ .  As for a beach holiday in Malta, it has its own characteristics.  The deep Mediterranean Sea warms up slowly.  Therefore, in May it will be a bit cold.  And in June, water is suitable only for seasoned natures.  But autumn in Malta is a blessed season.  Deep sea and cools slowly.  Even in October, it pleases with warm water (within 25 ¬∞ C).  Humidity ranges from 65 percent in the summer to 80 percent in the winter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  The Republic of Malta is a multinational state.  Most residents (more than ninety-five percent) are local natives.  But recently, the number of immigrants, mainly of Libyan, Egyptian, Moroccan origin, has been growing.  Marriages with foreigners contribute to the multinational composition.  This is every fifth union.  Moreover, there is a significant number of such marriages between indigenous people and girls from Russia.  Recently, Malta has been selected as a country for a quiet old age by retirees from the UK.  According to the last census (for a period of two thousand and six years), the population of the island republic was four hundred and five and a half thousand people.  According to this indicator, Malta is one of the most sparsely populated countries of the European Union.  But population density - in view of the small territory - is significant.  The indicator is 1283 people per square kilometer.  He brings to the fourth position in the world such a republic as Malta. </p><p>  The language of the former colonialists is not forgotten.  English is considered the third state.  Along with Maltese, due to its proximity to Sicily, Italian is used.  So, as the reviews say, you can study it.  More than ninety-seven percent of the population profess Roman Catholic Christianity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Valletta Malta" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1050638.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ancient and modern capital </h2><p>  Not always the main city of the island state was Valletta.  Malta is a land with a rather ancient history.  And the first stone of the capital was laid on March 28, 1566.  True, not from scratch.  But let's get it in order.  First, the ancient Romans founded a military fort, which already in ancient times grew to the size of a big city.  When the Arabs captured the island, they divided this settlement into two fortified fortified villages: Rabat and Mdina.  Their names themselves speak for themselves.  After all, Rabat is also the capital of Morocco, and Medina is present in every ancient Arab city.  It was in the Palazzo Falzon in Mdina that the first Grand Master of the Order of the Johannites, Philippe Villiers del Ile Adam, took over the management of the archipelago.  When the tenth sultan of <span>the Ottoman dynasty</span> Suleiman Kanuni attacked Malta, the monastic knights forcibly kept the island behind them.  The then Grand Master Jean Parisot de la Valletta decided to fortify the shore and laid the fortress, which he gave his last name.  Now the historical part of the capital of Malta is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.  The city houses the Palace of the Grand Masters, as well as the Cathedral, in which the remains of the rulers and the most prominent monastic knights found peace.  But not only Valletta and Mdina with Rabat are notable for Malta.  The cities of Birgu (aka Vittorioza) and Victoria (the capital of the island of Gozo) also attract tourists.  The first is famous for the Inquisitor‚Äôs palace, the Maritime Museum and the Cathedral of St.  Lawrence.  Victoria is interesting for the citadel and the Church of the Assumption of Our Lady. </p>

    <h2>  How to get to Malta </h2><p>  Regular flights operated by the local airline AirMalta depart from Moscow all year round on Saturdays and Tuesdays for the Mediterranean archipelago.  The purpose of visiting the majority of tourists on the island of Malta is to relax on the excellent beaches of the archipelago.  Therefore, in the summer months, AirMalta aircraft also depart on Wednesdays, Sundays and Mondays.  From large cities of Russia to Malta in the tourist season, numerous charters start.  Sometimes, as the reviews claim, it is more expedient to fly by connecting flights.  Tourists recommend the company KLM (with a transfer in Amsterdam) and Lufthansa (in Frankfurt).  Direct flight Russia - Malta lasts approximately four and a half hours.  The country's only international airport is located six kilometers south of Valletta, between the villages of Gudia and Luka.  By sea, Malta can be reached from the island of Sicily (from Syracuse and Pozzallo) and Libya (Tripoli).  Travel time on the Jean de La Valetta high-speed catamaran will take about two hours.  Ferries run between the islands of Malta.  To get from Valletta to other cities or resort villages, it is best to use the bus service.  These cars are very comfortable and go on schedule.  You can rent a car in Malta if you are between twenty-five and seventy years old and you have a valid driver‚Äôs license.  But remember: the movement in the former British colony is left-hand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malta in October" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1050153.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tours to Malta </h2><p>  The island nation boasts an excellent Mediterranean climate, wonderful beaches and crystal clear waters.  But not only this attracts tourists to Malta.  Holidays on the coast can be combined with the study of English.  Malta has world-class centers that offer you various courses.  Why exactly English?  <span>The inhabitants of Malta</span> received an invaluable legacy from the period of British colonization - the language of Shakespeare and Dickens, undistorted by local dialectics.  English did not become rudimentary.  It is owned by all the inhabitants of the country, from small to large.  Thus, school activities can be supplemented by lively communication with the Maltese.  And the prices in this Mediterranean country are much lower than in the UK itself.  And, according to reviews, it is much more pleasant to study the language surrounded by sun-drenched beaches and lush, southern landscapes.  Malta in October is the best place and time to pull up your English and have a great rest.  Moreover, mid-autumn pleases with comfortable weather, suitable for various educational excursions to the sights of the country.  Beach tours last mostly one or two weeks.  Linguistic usually longer.  Russian citizens need a Schengen visa to enter the country. </p><h2>  Malta beaches </h2><p>  For most Russians, this island country is associated exclusively with summer vacations by the sea.  And this is logical, because such a wealth of beaches is rarely found.  Unfortunately, the most popular sandy coasts intended for relaxation lie away from the resorts.  The most fashionable area tourists call the chain of villages from Sliema to St. Julian's, as well as from Aura to Bugibba.  But there the cliffs of a honey hue come to the surface.  They bathe, going down the stairs to the water.  The sandy beaches of Malta come in many colors.  So, for example, on Melieha Bay it is snow-white, like milk.  On Ramla, on the island of Gozo, he is red as purple.  And on Perched Beach - pale pink.  However, many tourists appreciate the pebble beaches.  They are usually located in very picturesque bays.  This is Fomm Ir-Rich, Mystra Bay, on the islands of Comino and Gozo.  At the last, Mjar Ish-Shini is considered especially beautiful.  Tourists warn that not all hotels have their own beach.  Within the city limits of the resort villages of the coast are equipped with umbrellas and sunbeds.  They have showers, toilets, cafes, and you can do water activities.  But for solitude lovers, there is a wide selection of wild beaches.  Among these stands Paradise Bay, located near the resort of Chirkevva.  Endless streaks of sand stretched near the villages of Mellieha and Marsaskala.  A budget vacation awaits you in the resort of Birzebbuja. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malta beaches" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1050155.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  When to go to Malta </h2><p>  We will not dissemble.  Malta is neither Thailand nor the Maldives.  Winter here is mild, but still does not have a beach holiday.  It becomes very warm in spring, and even hot in May.  But the water is still cool.  Summer in Malta is sultry and arid.  Many tourists go to the archipelago from July to September.  But the abundance of people contributes to higher prices, and the heat makes excursions undesirable.  Malta is another matter in October.  At this time, the heat is already subsiding, but the sea remains very warm.  The weather is set, comfortable for excursions.  Prices are starting to creep down a bit.  Another tourist destination (except beaches and learning English) is thalassotherapy.  Sea treatment centers offer various programs.  This is ‚Äúanti-stress‚Äù at Fortina Spa Resort 5 *, general health tours at the Thalgo Marine Cure Center at the Kempinski Hotel, cosmetology at the Appolo Club at the Corinthia San Georges 5 * Hotel.  Thalasso centers are even in some of the Maltese Quartet.  As an example, tourists cite the Barcelo Riviera Resort &amp; SPA in Marfa and Maritim Antonin in Mellieha.  According to some foreign students, language tours to Malta are best done in the winter months.  Then the prices are the lowest, and nothing distracts from study. </p><h2>  Malta Attractions </h2><p> Once on the ancient land of the archipelago, it will be an unforgivable crime to spend the whole vacation on the beach, in the thalasso centers or for cramming English.  Malta in January (with the exception of a short period from the 1st to the 6th day) is an opportunity for a budget cognitive vacation.  Then winter rates apply, there are few tourists, and you can view the best sights of the island without a crush.  What is included in the list of "Mast si" in Malta?  Tourists who have visited the archipelago have already compiled a list.  First of all, it is the ancient and modern capital, Mdina and Valletta.  We will not list the cultural and historical sights of these cities - it will take a lot of time and place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malta prices" class="if" height="446" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1050628.jpg" width="600"></div>  Another must visit are the caves of Calypso and Ar-Dalam (or Ghardalam).  This latest natural attraction is located in the south of the island of Malta.  Ghardalam is translated as "Cave of Darkness."  It attracts not only cavers.  Under its arches, many animal bones were found to have died out during the last ice age.  For connoisseurs of the most ancient civilizations, it will be interesting to visit the underground complex Hypogee and the megalithic temples of Hajar and Mnaidra.  Prices in Malta may seem odd to the average European.  According to reviews, a bottle of wine is cheaper than a similar container with drinking water.
