    <p>  Car radio has won many positive reviews.  Consumers note good sound quality and fast reproduction of even the most voluminous works.  Many people like the stylish design, classic black color, green backlight, as well as the presence of a remote control, clock, equalizer and a removable panel.  People claim that the device quickly picks up a radio signal and reminds of the place where the track stopped.  The convenient navigation system, which allows you to instantly find the desired track, reading Russian letters, is also pleasing.  The owners note that it costs much cheaper compared to peers. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, users noted the lack of a slot for headphones and memory cards, small letters on the display that are difficult to read, the lack of a cover for the panel, and a small number of buttons for radio channels.  They say that with prolonged use, the radio is very hot.  Many lack a CD player and a mute button (‚ÄúATT‚Äù) on the panel itself.  Some say that for such a price you can find a better device. </p><p>  In general, users were satisfied with this device.  It has been working properly for many years and does not cease to delight motorists with its acoustics. </p>
