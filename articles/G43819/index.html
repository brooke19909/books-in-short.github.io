Two reservoirs of beautiful color - Burlinskoe and Raspberry Lakes.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the media you can find many photos with fantastic pink lakes.  They are located in Australia, Spain and in many other countries.  But few people know that such lakes exist in Russia.  For example, in the Altai Territory. </p><h2>  Pink lakes in Altai </h2><p>  Two pink lakes spread in the Kulundinskaya steppe.  One of them bears the romantic name Raspberry, and the other is called Bursol or Burlinskoe.  This is another salty <span>pink lake</span> in Altai.  Photos of these reservoirs are not fooled, the water here has a pink color and in reality.  The saturation of its color and shade depend on the season and air temperature. </p><p>  A pine forest grows on the shore of Raspberry Lake, complementing the aesthetic and therapeutic effect.  And the pink lake in Altai called Bursol is spread in the steppe region.  The banks of both reservoirs are overgrown with unusual beautiful flowers - halophytes.  These plants are able to grow on salty soils. </p><h2>  The healing properties of the water of the Pink Lakes </h2><p>  Going on a trip to any pink lake in Altai is worth contemplating this unusual phenomenon.  The secret of an unusual pinkish color lies in the small crustaceans living in the pond. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pink lake in Altai" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1137837.jpg" width="588"></div>  The water in the lake is salty and has healing properties.  Here you can sunbathe on the beach, smeared with healing mud.  All these measures have a beneficial effect on the whole body.  Water gives a healing effect.  Blood circulation of subcutaneous tissues is activated, the surface of the skin is leveled.  Also, the properties of <span>rose water</span> contribute to the elimination of problems with the musculoskeletal system.  There is still some evidence that brine also heals the female reproductive system.  Is it worth talking about the benefits of fresh air and possible solitude in nature?

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Recommendations for vacationers </h2><p>  But on vacation, it is recommended to observe some precautions. </p><ul><li>  The sandy beach is mixed with salt, forming a crust that covers the entire bottom of the lake.  Here you can injure your legs, so it‚Äôs better to walk in shoes. </li><li>  Also, do not swim for more than 20-25 minutes in one go. </li><li>  In addition, it is necessary to stock up on fresh water to wash off salt from the skin.  Or, in case of rest on the Raspberry Lake, take a walk to the nearby fresh water reservoir, located 1-2 kilometers away. </li></ul><p>  The average depth that the pink lake in Altai has is less than a meter, the bottom is very shallow.  And the water has such a density that it can be compared with the water of the Dead Sea.  This feature makes it a wonderful vacation spot for the whole family. </p><h2>  Burlin lake </h2><p>  The region where Lake Burlin is located is Altai Territory, but not Mountain Altai.  Pink Lake is located in the Slavgorod district, 18 km from the district center or about 500 kilometers from Barnaul.  There is also the opportunity to get to the lake and from Yarovoy. </p><p>  Burlinskoe pink lake in Altai has the village of Bursol next to it.  The main specialization of this locality is Burlin salt mining.  This is the largest rich salt field.  By the way, salt production here is carried out according to the original technology - salt harvesters on rails call in to the very center of the lake. </p><p>  The tourist destination in the village is not developed, so those who wish to relax can be accommodated in a tent camp, as there is a lake to be admired. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pink lake in Altai photo" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1137838.jpg" width="489"></div>

Its uniform oval shape slightly distorts the bay in the southwest.  The salt crust on the shore is so dense that the machine can easily drive up close to the water. </p><p>  The maximum rise of water in the lake occurs in winter.  During this period, there is no evaporation, an influx of groundwater is sufficient, and solid precipitations, in contact with salt, melt. </p><p>  The pink salt lake in Altai has a minimum water level in summer.  Since evaporation exceeds precipitation. </p><h2>  Raspberry Lake </h2><p>  Location of Raspberry <span>Lake: Altai Territory,</span> Mikhailovsky District, 1-2 kilometers from the village of the same name Raspberry Lake.  Previously, a local brewery worked in the village, whether it works now is not known for certain.  Residents of the village willingly rent rooms, apartments or houses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mountain Altai pink lake" class="if" height="454" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1137840.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The tourism business has been developing here only since 2013, so lovers of leisure "savages" will not encounter the corresponding difficulties and serious costs. </p><p>  You can get here by bus from Barnaul to Mikhailovsky (400 kilometers).  Or by train to Kulunda, and from it another 100 km to overcome the bus to Mikhailovsky.  In both cases, from Mikhailovsky you need to get on a minibus towards the lake.  The surroundings of Raspberry Lake are swampy, in any case you have to overcome the distance of about a kilometer to the water on foot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pink salt lake in Altai" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1137839.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The reservoir is part of the Tanatar lakes chain, from which the Mikhailovsky Chemical Reagents Plant produces raw materials - soda for the production of pharmacopoeial magnesium carbonate and copper acetate. </p><p>  The surface of the lake is 11.4 square kilometers. </p><p>  See for yourself that pink lakes are a great place to relax, here you can not only spend time in nature, but also strengthen your health. </p>
