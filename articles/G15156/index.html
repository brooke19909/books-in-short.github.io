    <p>  Until 1918, the valley was attributed to Austrian possessions, however, at the end of World War I, it became Italian property.  Despite this, local traditions have survived to this day, and the local population is difficult to strictly attribute to Austria or Italy. </p><p>  Val Gardena ski resort is located in the ethnographic region of Tyrol, and the culture of the locals is quite different from both Italian and Austrian.  Since the city traditionally belongs to one of the oldest and most famous resorts in the Dolomites, the locals have long adapted to the constant neighborhood of tourists.  Due to this, local residents have long developed a unique hospitality and cordiality.  They speak here in the Tyrolean dialect, which can be described as a mixture of Italian and German.  All signs and signs in the towns of Selva Garden, Santa Cristina and Ortisei are made simultaneously in two languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Italian, the official state language, and German, the use of which has long been fixed since Austrian times. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What to do in Val Gardena Valley? </h2><p>  What about the Val Gardena Valley itself?

    <h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  If you are interested in hotels located in a place such as Val Gardena (Val Gardena, Italy, a ski resort), we will try to say a few words about them.  And in a little more detail, let's talk about hotels in the valley.  This will help you decide where to stop.  As already noted, in the valley there are three small towns - Selva Gardena, Santa Cristina and Ortisei.  Each of them has several hotels, and they differ from each other.  Hotel in Ortisei Panorama Residence Gran Tubl√† is the perfect place to relax with your children.  It is specially equipped for a family resort, there are several special programs for children, they are where and for whom to leave and so on.  Selva Gardena, the largest and busiest town in the valley, has several hotels.  At the same time, the choice is wide enough and depends only on your pocket - whether you stay in a two-star hotel (for example, Villa Seceda), or prefer a five-star hotel (Hotel Adler Dolomiti Spa &amp; Sport Resort).  The latter has been recognized as the best hotel in all the Italian Alps more than once over the past decades.  Santa Cristina is the smallest of the villages, but also the most comfortable.  You should stay here if you want to fully enjoy the atmosphere of alpine silence and Tyrolean hospitality.  And many tourists recommend first of all to pay attention to a good budget option - Bed and Breakfast Iman mini-hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Ski schools </h2><p>  A few words should be said about ski schools.  There are five ski schools in all three towns of the valley, in which professionals will teach both adults and children the basics of skiing.  If you didn‚Äôt like this business before, now is the time to change your mind! </p><h2>  Ski slopes </h2><p>  In principle, this is the basic information that should be known to the average vacationer traveling to Val Gardena.  An overview of the ski resort in Italy, however, cannot do without a more professional consideration of the characteristics of the ski slopes, which is necessary for people who are not only involved in skiing at a professional level. </p><p>  What is better for athletes than a professional track for the world ski championship?  She descends from Mount Chiampioni (more than two kilometers) and reaches for Selva.  Skiers with an average level have the opportunity to try out a large number of pistes.  Some lead from Ciampioni, some from the top of Danterchepies.  At the same time, they pass from Chiampioni mainly through the forest territory, they are very winding and dangerous for beginners.  The route from the second mountain, also leading to Selva, is simpler - both the slope is less and the space is cleaner.  Plots for beginners are located on the slopes of the entire valley.  Of particular interest to beginner skiers is, of course, the Seched Col-Raiser circus.  This unusual skiing space attracts even professionals, although it is intended primarily for beginners. </p>

    <h2>  What else do tourists do in Val Gardena? </h2><p>  With skiing now everything is also clear.  But what else can you do in winter in the Val Gardena Valley?  At your service - an ice rink, a track for sledding, and in the summer - all the possibilities of hanging out in the mountains, from climbing to cycling and sports walking.  In Val Gardena you will definitely find something to your liking at any time of the year! </p>
