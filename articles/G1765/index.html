This is a miracle of miracles that can only exist.  The cities of Western Ukraine are of a special character.  There are legends and riddles everywhere.  Residents of these places tremulously keep traditions, and communicating with them, you will certainly expand your horizons, be surprised at their cordiality and hospitality.  Western Ukrainian cities include architectural Lviv, inspired Ivano-Frankivsk, quiet Ternopil, historical Chernivtsi and many other settlements.  But today we‚Äôll talk about Chernivtsi, a city that is interesting for its centuries-old history and is the heart of Bukovina. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chernivtsi sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/469565.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Some historical facts </h2><p>  Ancient Chernivtsi has long taken its rightful place in the list of Eastern European and Ukrainian cities.  Sights of the city, its history, natural beauty, unique architecture, open soul of the local population attract many guests.  Historians have put forward the theory that the name of the settlement relates to the populated city of the fortress, which was located on the southern borders of the Galician state.  It was called the ‚Äúmob,‚Äù or ‚Äúblack city,‚Äù and was built on the left side <span>of the Prut River.</span>  It may be that this name came from the oak walls laid by chernozem of the fortress walls.  The fortress itself came under the destructive influence of the troops of Burundai, the Mongol conqueror.  Therefore, since 1259, the population migrated to the right bank of the river.  And exactly a century later the city became part of the Moldavian state. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first written references to Chernivtsi are found in manuscripts belonging to the Moldovan owner Alexander Dobrom.  He issued them in the autumn of 1408 to Lviv merchants.  Therefore, the eighth of October is considered the official date of birth of the city.  The city of Chernivtsi at that time was located at the intersection of the route from southwestern Europe to the Balkans and Turkey. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ukraine Chernivtsi" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/469570.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Anton - knight Kokhanovsky von Stavchan </h2><p>  This man served as the second autonomous burgomaster of Chernivtsi.  He left an extraordinary mark in the history of the city.  It is with the surname of this figure that Chernivtsi's assertion as a European-style city is associated.  During the reign of Anton, the <span>business activity of the</span> village increased, trade and production began to develop.  Chernivtsi won the title of international transport center.  A food exchange also opened and the construction of a sewer system was completed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cities of western Ukraine" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/469567.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  First attractions </h2><p>  In 1774, approximately 290 families lived in Chernivtsi, and there were only three wooden churches.  Only in 1778 the city began to flourish.  Just at that time, the Duke Karl von Enzenberg had the chance to lead the military administration.  At his invitation, merchants, artisans and industrialists came here.  They were supposed to help in the development of trade and production. </p><p>  Unique city of Chernivtsi!  Sightseeing is his calling card.  From the mid-19th century until the beginning of the 20th century, many architectural monuments were erected that brought fame to the city.  Among them are the town hall, which was created in 1848, the post office dating back to 1855, the <span>Armenian Church,</span> built in 1875.  Also in 1877, a Jewish synagogue appeared in the city, and in 1905 a drama theater.  Of particular historical importance is the Palace of Justice in 1906 and the premises of the 1908 railway station. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chernivtsi city" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/469569.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Attractions in detail </h2><p>  First of all, I would like to say a few words about the Chernivtsi Town Hall, which is located on Rynok Square.  As soon as she appeared here, she immediately gained the status of the main building of the city.  Its construction was led by A. Mikulich, a well-known architect at that time.  Active participation in the creation of attractions took regional engineer Marine.  The architecture of the house is a departure from the principles of classicism and a direct appeal to the Italian Renaissance.  Today, the coat of arms of Chernivtsi flaunts on the facade of the town hall.  And the building itself today fulfills its original role - this is the meeting place of the city council. </p><p>  You should definitely visit the city of Chernivtsi.  Its sights are like a part of the city, which seems to live on its own, and cannot exist separately.  One of the local advantages is the railway station, built in the Art Nouveau style.  O. Wagner was involved in the architectural project.  The portal is considered the main element of the decor, the stained-glass window of which is made of a steel frame.  He became a symbol of the city gate.  At the time when the station opened, its building was in no way inferior to the best analogues of Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chernivtsi airport" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/469566.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Some more sights </h2><p>  To tell about the most beautiful places in Chernivtsi and not to mention the local open-air museum is to forget about a piece of the soul of this beautiful city.  There is an institution on one of the outskirts of the city.  This is a memo of folk life and architecture.  It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã8.65 hectares and has nearly eight thousand exhibits.  Among them are clay products, books, folk clothes, musical instruments and other things.  Theatrical performances and fairs are regularly held here. </p><p>  And, of course, Chernivtsi, whose sights are so diverse, cannot be recognized without a visit to the national university named after Yu.  The building used to be the residence of the metropolitans of Bukovina.  The building is located on Kotsyubinsky Street, and Joseph Glavk became its architect.  The author was only 29 years old when he created this project.  The construction work was as grand as the house itself.  This is truly an amazing building, so it‚Äôs better to see it once than to read hundreds of pages of its description. </p><h2>  Born to crawl can fly </h2><p>  They say that the one who was born to crawl cannot conquer the sky.  But everything is changing, especially nowadays.  Since the advent of aircraft, anyone who is not afraid of heights is capable of flying.  Ukraine invites to soar above the clouds.  Chernivtsi have a unique airport.  From it flights are constantly made to Kiev, Kharkov, Istanbul, Odessa and Donetsk.  The modern history of the local airport begins in the early 70s of the last century.  In 1971, reconstruction was carried out here.  As a result of the work done, the throughput of the terminal increased to 200 people per hour.  And in 1974, the Chernivtsi airport was equipped with an asphalt concrete runway. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chernivtsi rest" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/469568.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fly to rest </h2><p>  Ukrainian Chernivtsi are located near the Carpathians.  And this is a direct indication that it is not just possible, but necessary to rest.  Chernivtsi (rest here is known all over the world) literally attract guests.  Indeed, mountain air is filled with healing substances, and mineral springs not only heal the body, but also charge it with energy.  There are many hotels, resorts, recreation centers and private cottages in the city, offering their customers a high level of comfort and everything necessary for the best pastime. </p><h2>  Chernivtsi called to live forever </h2><p>  Beautiful Ukraine!  Chernivtsi is like Paris, which is worth seeing and then dying ... But it is better to enjoy this land, love it and protect it.  Let the city live forever, please with its architecture, kindness and responsiveness!  This city is history, memory, memories, love ... A place designed to give joy and unforgettable sensations. </p>
