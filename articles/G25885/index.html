Is it a brawler or a revolutionary?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, it seems strange that recently the attitude to women as to the second grade was quite acceptable in a civilized society.  For many centuries, women suffered from the need to unconditionally obey men who completely did not take into account the needs of the fair sex.  Therefore, it is understandable that such circumstances provoked indignation, and at one fine moment the ladies refused to put up with this state of affairs and rose to the fight. </p><h2>  The origin of motion </h2><p>  The second half of the last century in England was marked by the emergence of a new movement - suffragism.  The term comes from the English ‚Äúsuffrage‚Äù, which in translation means ‚Äúsuffrage‚Äù.  This is exactly what women who joined the new movement fought for.  A suffragist is a woman who sought to obtain rights similar to men's.  As this usually happens, some participants in the movement looked in different directions, which led to its splits and the struggle of opposing parties. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="suffragist is" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/406228.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The movement of suffragists was divided into two directions.  Right-wing forces, including representatives of two newly formed parties, insisted on peaceful methods of conducting a revolution.  They were engaged in the creation of brochures, organized meetings, created petitions.  The center-left forces decided to work with completely different methods, which were directed against the current government. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The start of the demonstrations. </h2><p>  The meaning of the word ‚Äúsuffragist‚Äù implies adherence to the ideals of the movement, but not all participants were limited to a social position.  Very often, such demonstrations took place under loud cries, democratic slogans and with constant scandals.  During their protests, suffragists engaged in both bullying enemies and outright lawlessness.  They smashed the windows of houses, glued provocative posters and staged noisy parades. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Meaning of the word suffragist" class="if" height="465" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/406229.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Main characters </h2><p>  One of the founders of suffragism is rightfully considered Emmeline Pankhurst.  She was an educated woman who was educated in Paris and decided to put her whole life in the struggle for women's equality.  She believed that all the problems that arise in the world exist only because the power is completely in the hands of men, however, almost every suffragist thought so.  <span>This vision of the</span> status of men in society significantly influenced both Emmeline herself and her daughter Cristobal, who completely agreed with her mother. </p><p>  Flora Drummond is another famous suffragist.  She was a rather colorful lady who, during her performances, wore a white uniform with golden epaulettes and a uniform cap.  To participate in such actions, she provoked a hatred of injustice towards women. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="suffragist synonym" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/406230.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Aggressive fight </h2><p>  The suffragism movement continued to gain popularity and become more numerous.  The country continued to shake from rallies, processions and demonstrations.  Particularly active participants ended up in prison, where they went on hunger strikes in order to attract maximum attention. </p><h2>  Result </h2><p>  The work of the movement did not go unnoticed.  Already in 1907, a special committee was set up aimed at protecting women's suffrage, for which every suffragist fought.  A synonym for the activists of this movement, which is quite common today, is the "feminist."  Both sought to regulate the rights of men and women in government organizations, and one movement was a logical continuation of the other. </p><p>  Suffrageism managed to achieve certain successes, partial suffrage for women appeared already in 1918, and full suffrage in 1928. But so far many people know that the suffragist is a woman who fought for equality. </p>
