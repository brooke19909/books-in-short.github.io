    <h2>  A little about Ufa </h2><p>  Many thousands of years ago this area was already inhabited.  Even before the first streets of the city appeared.  In different places, ancient settlements were discovered, which are evidence of the life of people here in antiquity.  During the reign of Ivan the Terrible, the first wooden buildings began to appear.  After some time, a city spread out on this area, in which the fate of the Bashkir and Russian peoples was intricately intertwined.  The center and foundation of this city was the Kremlin.  At present, the thirty-three-meter Friendship Monument recalls it. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  The city is constantly growing and developing.  Several thousand people are added per year.  Accordingly, there is a need for the construction of more and more micro-districts, high-rise buildings and infrastructure.  Moreover, growth occurs naturally, and not at the expense of visitors.  The boundaries of the city are constantly expanding, and already the outskirts are densely populated.  To accommodate all residents in comfortable conditions, it is necessary to build many residential complexes.  One of these is LCD Iskra (Ufa). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Real estate company </h2><p>  At the end of 2016 was to be built LCD "Iskra" (Ufa).  The developer set this deadline in his documents.  But at present the facility is still not finished.  Although the construction did not stop even for a second.  Just such a large-scale complex required more time for construction than originally planned. </p><p>  The developer has a lot of weight and an excellent reputation in development projects of a full cycle.  The company never stops after the construction of a residential building, necessarily ennobling the territory, developing it with infrastructure. </p>

    <p>  Her motto is to be the first.  For good reason, the founders of the company chose this name ‚ÄúFirst‚Äù.  It laid the desire for a new standard of living, a new level of urban environment.  Employees of the company are not afraid to incur overpriced obligations, which they subsequently fulfill brilliantly.  The buildings they erect are distinguished by the freshness and originality of the solution and truly become adornments of the settlements in which they are built.  These are not just residential buildings - they are legendary buildings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Apartments in buildings under construction by the company meet all the requirements of a modern resident of society.  There are also loggias that allow you to enjoy the fresh air.  And even two bathrooms in a large three-room apartment.  After all, it is assumed that families with numerous residents will be settled in them. </p><h2>  LCD "Iskra" (Ufa) </h2>

    <p>  The building of the <span>residential complex is</span> modern two-section.  As mentioned above, the developer simultaneously with the construction of the main object, also builds infrastructure.  New buildings in Ufa, which have already been built or will be built by this developer, provide their residents with a unique infrastructure. </p><p>  The described <span>residential complex</span> is located in the very center of Ufa, the picturesque place "Glumilino".  About half a kilometer separates the complex from the Koshkin Forest massif.  And a little more than a kilometer must be overcome in order to enjoy the views <span>of the Ufa River.</span>  And even swim in it.  All this significantly increases the ecological situation of the district, and, therefore, the cost of a meter of living space in the residential complex "Iskra" (Ufa). </p><p>  The developer must also ennoble the adjacent territory of the complex.  And these are children's playgrounds, and walking recreation areas, and parking lots.  All this makes the purchase of an apartment in houses built by the First Trest Group of Companies very attractive investment. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility and infrastructure </h2><p>  Such a good choice of a building site provides the residents of the complex with excellent transport links.  After all, the city center will in any case be perfectly connected with its other areas by public transport.  And here is also the walking distance of the largest highways - October Avenue, Komsomolskaya Street, Salavat Yulaev Avenue. </p>

    <p>  As for the entertainment that LCD ‚ÄúIskra‚Äù (Ufa) can provide, the reviews about them are very positive and rich in variety.  This is the shopping and entertainment center "Planet" with a water park, and a cinema, and a circus, and a drama theater.  There are also a lot of hypermarkets, cafes and entertainment centers around.  There is even a racetrack. </p><p>  For study, there is also everything you need: libraries, schools, kindergartens.  Well, for those who are sick, there are nearby clinics and hospitals. </p><p>  The developer chose an original design for the facade of the building, designed to highlight the Iskra LCD (Ufa) in a number of other new buildings and decorate the city.  A panoramic glazing of windows and balconies is created in order to reflect the sun's rays, creating a play of light. </p><h2>  Characteristics of apartments </h2><p>  Apartments this residential complex, like other new buildings in Ufa, provides a variety of, for every budget and taste.  There are also one-room apartments on forty-six square meters.  There are spacious three-room apartments, the footage of which is more than ninety square meters. </p><p>  Finishing is done in draft, which allows future owners to realize all their wildest dreams of design.  But the main finishing work is still being carried out: windows are glazed, metal entrance doors are installed, a cement floor screed is made.  A central heating and sewage system is also being installed, and electrical cables are being wired.  The walls are plastered with cement, electricity meters are installed. </p><p>  Many building materials are provided by BPSK Ufa - the Bashkir Industrial-Construction Company.  This company directly in the city produces high-quality and durable building materials for roofs, walls, facades.  All products comply with international standards and pass quality control.  Cooperating with BPSK, the builder only wins, ennobling the facade with material made by this company. </p>
