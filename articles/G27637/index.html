In winter, Thailand, Vietnam and the Dominican Republic are most in demand, and with the onset of the summer season, travelers prefer the beaches of the Black and Mediterranean Seas.  Family and party hotels in Turkey, Spain, Cyprus and Greece should be booked a few months before the expected vacation due to high demand. </p><h2>  Rest without worries </h2><p>  Young people are considered a special category among tourists, but managers have long been aware by heart the most "party" hotels in Turkey.  This direction this year represents the best price-quality ratio.  The demands of young people and, for example, couples with children are completely opposite.  The former do not want to see forever capricious kids on the beach, and the latter dream of the absence of noisy music near the apartments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="party hotels turkey marmaris" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27807/866185.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An important factor in organizing youth recreation is the price, because not all students can afford the notorious ‚Äúfive stars‚Äù and ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù.  However, according to the reviews of regular ‚Äúparty people‚Äù, the best company is going to expensive hotels, which we will tell about in our review. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Antalya and Kemer </h2><p>  Without exaggeration, Antalya is considered the most famous resort, where many of the "party" hotels in Turkey are concentrated.  The city is only 12 kilometers from the airport.  Cozy coffee houses, lovely souvenir shops, attractions and, of course, a huge number of clubs and entertainment centers - it is not surprising that young people choose Antalya for a summer vacation. </p><p>  It is worth noting that this is more of a <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãresort,</span> and finding huge <span>chain hotels</span> with their own beach here is quite difficult.  However, municipal beaches are also not so bad, and if you want active entertainment, then two water parks are open for tourists: Aquapark and Aqualand. </p><p>  Kemer is considered a youth resort largely due to pebble beaches, because families with children often choose sand and convenient access to the sea. </p><h2>  In the center of events </h2><p>  The fame of Kemer‚Äôs nightclubs attracts young people like a magnet. </p>

    <p>  The legendary Inferno, Soho and Aura are famous for their theme parties and entertaining shows, as well as performances of world celebrities. </p><p>  If you want to be in the center <span>of</span> Kemer's <span>nightlife</span> , then choose one of the small city hotels.  Thus, you can save a little on accommodation, and the best discos will be within walking distance.  For those who do not want to sacrifice comfort and are used to getting everything from life, we suggest paying attention to the ‚Äúparty‚Äù 5 star hotels in Turkey. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Orange county resort </h2><p>  The architecture of the magnificent hotel, opened in 2005, will certainly appeal to young people.  Colorful tents, a huge red mill and cozy European streets - the design in the style of Amsterdam of the 16th century is associated, first of all, with freedom and rebellious spirit, therefore Orange County deservedly wins the nomination ‚ÄúTurkey's party people hotels‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most party hotels in Turkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/865860.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The ultra all-inclusive concept promises high-class service and excellent food almost all day.  A private beach and marina awaits guests on the Mediterranean coast.  The most positive reviews were collected by the animation, which works all day long: small pool parties, active games, entertainment and discos on the pier. </p><p>  In fairness, we note that not all travelers have a pleasant experience after a vacation at Orange County Resort.  Some are not happy with the small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel, while others are unhappy with the cleaning and monotonous food in the luxurious restaurant.  However, if your goal is fun, then you can completely close your eyes to many everyday nuances. </p><h2>  Asdem park </h2><p>  "Party" hotels in Turkey for youth are open all year round.  The lack of heat and a beach holiday is more than compensated by excellent animation and noisy parties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Asdem Park, as well as other party hotels in Turkey, is located near the best clubs in the eastern Mediterranean.  According to many tourists, evening shows and small discos are a great start before nightly fun in the city. </p><p>  Of the shortcomings, the hotel‚Äôs own beach is most often noted, where there is not enough space for everyone.  However, the pool always has animators who are ready at any time to return a good mood with a draw or another contest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turkey party hotels for youth" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/865864.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Young people choose Asdem Park primarily because of the ‚Äú3 stars‚Äù category and affordable prices.  Every month on the last Saturday, a colorful carnival awaits all guests. </p><p>  In addition, the hotel has a <span>special offer</span> for those lucky ones who are going to celebrate their birthday.  Making a separate pool table, cake and alcohol to choose from - there is nothing easier than arranging a surprise for the birthday person. </p><h2>  Belek </h2><p>  One of the youngest resorts, Belek, began to actively develop a little <span>more than twenty</span> years ago.  Quite quickly, this picturesque place gained popularity thanks to the magnificent pine and eucalyptus forests.  But the most important advantage is the luxurious sandy beaches that extend over twenty kilometers of the coastline. </p><p>  Tourists choose Belek for a ‚Äúlazy" vacation, because there are no attractions at the resort.  Many experts believe that the best "party" hotels in Turkey are located here. </p><h2>  Royal adam &amp; eve </h2><p>  In 2006, a huge six-story building and twenty-four small villas were built on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã100 thousand square meters.  For guests there are eight restaurants, including an unusual institution where they eat blindly. </p><p>  The interior of the rooms amazes even the most sophisticated guests.  A jacuzzi and a <span>steam bath, an</span> original room lighting system, mirrored walls and, of course, magnificent beds - it is not surprising that the fame of this unusual hotel booms throughout the country and beyond. </p><p>  Real laser shows, concerts of stars, beauty contests and theme parties on the beach and on the pier will not let you get bored.  In addition, Royal Adam &amp; Eve has a small water park and four outdoor pools, one of which is heated. </p><p>  Guests should definitely visit the spa, visit the traditional hammam and relax with a massage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="youth party hotels in turkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/865868.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Despite the kids club, family rooms and babysitting services, it is rather difficult to imagine a holiday with children here.  Like other "party" hotels in Turkey, Adam &amp; Eve is aimed at wealthy young people.  The unusual design with piquant details and the holiday atmosphere will leave only the best impressions. </p><h2>  Marmaris </h2><p>  Marmaris cannot be called exclusively a youth resort for many reasons.  Couples with children and older travelers appreciate the mild climate - even in the hot summer months there is no sweltering heat.  In addition, the sea in a cozy bay is always calm.  Is it really possible to find party hotels in Turkey here too? </p><p>  Marmaris is considered the country's most ‚Äúdancing‚Äù resort and is even called ‚ÄúTurkish Ibiza‚Äù because of the huge number of disco bars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="5 star turkey hotels" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/865872.jpg" width="415"></div>  Experienced party-goers advise against booking five-star luxury hotels, because the fun in the city itself cannot be compared even with the most talented animation.

    <p>  The resort is popular among tourists from England, Germany and the Netherlands, and the prices in the best clubs here are also at the ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù level.  Admission is free, and owners earn on the sale of alcoholic beverages. </p><p>  Three star hotels such as Club Hotel Diana or Sun Maris Beach Hotel are perfect for youth activities.  Within walking distance of the famous "bar" street.  Own beaches at economy class hotels, as a rule, are located quite far, but the municipal beach and pool are always at the guests' disposal. </p><h2>  Alanya </h2><p>  Talking about the Turkish Riviera, it is impossible not to mention Alanya. </p>

    <p>  Despite the sandy beaches, the resort is located quite far from the airport and is considered budgetary, so every year the local population is approximately doubled due to the influx of young people. </p><p>  According to the travelers themselves, the most rave hotels in Turkey are located in Alanya.  Maritim Hotel Club offers a huge selection of sports activities: windsurfing, minigolf, archery and tennis.  Club Insula is famous among tourists for its vibrant Latin Night rooftop parties and professional animators. </p>
