    <h2>  Some interesting facts </h2><p>  Plants can also help a person predict the weather.  For example, yellow acacia is a unique natural barometer; on the threshold of rain it releases a large amount of nectar and a pleasant strong aroma.  Also, by the appearance of gerberas, specialists can determine whether the weather will be sunny or cloudy. </p><p>  Another interesting fact: some plants are used in cooking.  Well-known vanilla is obtained from one type of exotic orchid.  In ancient times, entire ships with people went in search of this flower.  Only ten years ago, rich Belarusians were ready to pay a lot of money for orchids, since they were not in the state at all.  Now the flowers are in the Central Botanical Garden, everyone can come and enjoy them.  In Belarus, they learned how to grow orchids in flasks. </p><h2>  Flower collections </h2><p>  Employees of the Minsk Botanical Garden are helping to acclimatize in local conditions to new cultures imported from different parts of the world.  For this, expeditions are organized to various <span>climatic zones</span> (for example, to the Carpathians or to the Urals).  Now there are about 250 species of perennials from the Caucasus, Southern Europe and Africa, the Pamirs. </p>
