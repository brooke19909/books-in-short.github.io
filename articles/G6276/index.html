This process is simple, and the pictures and voluminous crafts are very effective.  They can decorate a postcard or make a wall panel, roll up a toy for a child, or create an interior item of a room by putting crafts on a table or shelf. </p><p>  In the article we will reveal the secret of making quilling butterflies, what materials will be needed for this, the better it is to twist the strips of paper, how to stick parts on cardboard or to each other.  After reading the material, even a novice master can easily perform a butterfly using the quilling technique. </p><h2>  Materials for work </h2><p>  To make butterfly quilling, you need to prepare a set of <span>strips for quilling</span> by choosing the necessary colors and paper thickness in the store.  To make it easier to spin the strips, it is better to purchase a hook for quilling.  If you don‚Äôt have one, then you can use a wooden stick, making a thin slit at its end.  There, the edge of the paper strip is subsequently inserted and wrapping begins.  This is convenient, although some use a rod from a plastic handle or a thin knitting needle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.uncoversquirrelhill.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="quilling kit" class="if uuid-2321648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2321648.jpg"></div><p>  To twist the strips into parts of the same size, use templates, namely, a template line with stencils of circles of different diameters.  To attach parts to cardboard or between each other, use thick PVA glue.  Depending on the image and quilling methods, a foam stand is also used, pins with a bead on the end.  You will need more scissors and a simple pencil. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Production of basic parts </h2><p>  Before making quilling butterflies for beginners, it is recommended that you first try your hand at twisting the basic elements: circles, leaves, rhombuses and squares.  Learning begins by folding paper strips into a tight wheel.  To do this, you just need to insert the edge of the strip into the slot of the hook and, pressing it with your fingers, tightly wind it around its axis.  The edge is smeared with PVA glue and attached to the last turn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.littlecircles.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="manufacture of elements in quilling" class="if uuid-2321678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2321678.jpg"></div><p>  Then you can try to make more loose circles, when the strip is first freely twisted around the hook, and then inserted into the hole on the template ruler and released.  The circle takes the diameter of the template.  The edge is glued in the same way.  The workpiece is larger and free inside. </p><p>  For the manufacture of quilling butterflies often use different lengths of "leaves".  This is a freely twisted strip made using the technology described previously.  To turn a circle into a leaf, you need to take it with your hands on one or both sides and press down the edge with your fingers, as in the photo above.  The central dense part of the twist can be shifted to the center or rearranged on the inner edge of the leaf.  Hands can be formed into any shape.  If you pin down in four places, you get a rhombus or square.  If you squeeze at three points, you get a triangle.  When you have trained in small details, you can begin to create a butterfly quilling. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, before you start working with strips, you must draw a template on paper.  So it will be easier to maintain in the craft the correct proportions of the insect or create clear edges. </p><h2>  Quilling schemes </h2><p>  If you do not know how to draw, then do not worry, because using the World Wide Web you can easily create any template.  So the butterfly can be printed on the printer by choosing the image you like.  In the photo you can see an example of such a scheme for quilling. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="scheme for quilling butterflies" class="if uuid-2326077" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2326077.jpg"></div><p>  You can print the contours of the butterfly, and inside already finish the details.  Some experienced masters do not use schemes for crafts, but act situationally.  Having created the contours of the butterfly, first place large parts inside, and then the voids are filled with small ones. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  Begin work with simple crafts that consist of several parts.  Look at the quilling butterfly in the photo below.  Step-by-step instructions will help to do the craft quickly and without complications.  First of all, the body of the insect is made, namely, they turn the circle and flatten with fingers on both sides. </p><div class="photo" data-original="keywordsuggest.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="light butterfly craft" class="if uuid-2321625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2321625.jpg"></div><p>  The long "leaf" will be the body, and the head of the butterfly is made by freely wrapping the strip in a circle.  The antennae of the insect are made manually by folding the edges of the strip, and the middle must be folded up with a tick.  Smear the end of the strip with glue and attach it by lightly pressing the hands on top. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Butterfly wings are represented by two small and two large "leaves", pressed down by fingers on one side only.  This craft can be done with the child as a postcard to the teacher or teacher for a professional holiday or March 8. </p><h2>  Little butterflies </h2><p>  In quilling, the easiest execution is folding circles.  With their help, you can make small insects.  For this work, three colors of stripes are used.  The central details of the crafts are made from a light shade.  The body of the butterfly is not curled from stripes, but from two-color paper for the printer, which is cut into long and narrow triangles.  Folding begins from the base of the figure and the sharp edge is glued to the PVA glue in the center of the body.  Attach an antennae to the end of the head, rolled up from a small piece of strips of the same color.  The head is attached over the mustache and is a tightly twisted circle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wanelo.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="strip butterflies" class="if uuid-2321605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2321605.jpg"></div><p>  The wings are made in the form of freely twisted circles of different sizes.  Each is made up of three colors.  You can twist each wing element separately and then just insert it in the right place.  And you can, having rolled up one strip, attach the next color to its edge, continuing twisting. </p><p>  Such a small craft can be used in different ways.  For example, attach it to a keychain or hang it on a bag on a carbine, stick flowers and butterflies on a quilling picture.  Having created the plot drawing, use it as part of the application on a postcard or when designing the album title page for photographs. </p><h2>  Easy craft option </h2><p>  Now we will consider stepwise quilling of a butterfly of four colors.  This is a dark purple hue for the body and antennae, raspberry, red and bright orange for the wings.  The body of the insect consists of four tightly twisted cylinders, which are glued together with PVA glue in the end parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful butterfly" class="if uuid-2321596" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2321596.jpg"></div><p>  Small hind wings are made in the form of a "leaf" of the same color.  The front large wings are composed of three strips, which are alternately glued to the edge of the previous one.  The butterfly turns out to be durable, it can be used for playing, picked up and moved. </p><h2>  Interior decoration template </h2><p>  To perform this work, you need to use a marker to draw a black body of a butterfly with antennae.  Then you need to draw the wings with a simple pencil and stick a white strip along the contour on the end part, squeezing it with your fingers in the places of bending. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="quilling butterfly" class="if uuid-2321600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2321600.jpg"></div><p>  Then begins the most laborious, but uncomplicated process of filling the void in the middle of the wings with the help of circles twisted by different standards.  First, large elements are performed, then the voids are filled with small details.  For this, different twisting forces are used - from tight to free. </p><p>  Circles on the sides are smeared with PVA glue and inserted between other elements.  Such a butterfly is located in a picture or postcard.  Both the beginning master and the child of the kindergarten preparatory group will be able to do it.  After all, the elements that make up the craft, in principle, are all the same.  Two-color circles glued from strips of different colors look beautiful. </p><h2>  Using pins </h2><p>  If you are already an experienced quilling master, then you can try to do work by pinning strips to pins.  To do this, you need a foam base and a butterfly pattern.  It is placed on the foam and punctured with dots on the contours of the picture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="polkadotparasoldesigns.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="use of quilling pins" class="if uuid-2321637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2321637.jpg"></div><p>  Then they take a strip of quilling and pull it between the pins, forming long bent petals.  Thus, you can make a beautiful flower or wings for a butterfly.  The strips are glued together with PVA glue. </p><h2>  Butterfly made on pins </h2><p>  The used pinning method was also used in the following crafts.  Such a gentle butterfly is made according to the scheme, placing the needles along the drawn contours.  Each element is made of "leaves" of strips of different colors.  The wings of the butterfly are fastened at the base of the "leaves" with PVA glue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="polkadotparasoldesigns.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts butterfly on pins" class="if uuid-2321634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2321634.jpg"></div><p>  The size of the wing components is different.  It is due to the difference in the magnitude of the details that the necessary shape is formed.  The body is made of several tightly twisted cylinders glued together along the length.  How to do a mustache, you already understood from the previous description, we will not repeat. </p><p>  The article presents several options for making quilling butterflies.  The master class is described in detail with step-by-step instructions.  Making beautiful crafts using the quilling technique is simple and fun.  If you learn how to make the simplest elements, then you can already create spectacular pictures by placing them on cardboard.  Subsequently, you can make voluminous figures not only butterflies, but floral arrangements, animal figures.  Experienced craftsmen work with strips of different thicknesses, make layer-by-layer gluing of elements, creating a three-dimensional pattern on cardboard. </p><p>  Try, learn, because even a simple picture will bring the joy of creativity and bring a lot of pleasant emotions. </p>
