    <p>  According to the reviews of our tourists, we can conclude that not everything is as beautiful as in the photographs.  Many guests of Butua Hotel 4 * in Budva complained about dirty baths, poor cleaning, although everyone noted the cleanliness of towels, which changed 2 times a week. </p><p>  There are complaints about showers, where water does not come off after bathing, and a real flood forms in the bathroom.  Comments and wishes were negotiated with the receptionist at the reception, but only the threats that they would leave the hotel forced them to take some action. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Food in Butua Hotel 4 * reviews from residents did not cause very good.  First, it must be emphasized that the hotel offers standard buffet breakfasts for a fee.  Dinner can be ordered at the reception, but you will have to eat in the restaurant of another hotel, 200 meters from the place of residence. </p><p>  Breakfast can be seen in the photo below: small plates and containers with hot dishes.  Indeed, everything looks rather poorly, although some tourists were happy with such a breakfast.  They noted that everything is fresh, tasty.  In addition to standard egg dishes (omelet, boiled, fried eggs), there are also slices (cheese and meat), yogurts, olives, muffins, tangerines, drinks (juice, tea, coffee). </p>

    <p>  But, as they say, <span>everything is relative.</span>  For experienced tourists, it is clear that for breakfast in European countries this is still a normal list of products.  After all, if the hotel was in France, then the tenants for breakfast would have received at best cheese, a croissant and coffee. </p><h2>  Excursions from the hotel </h2><p>  In Budva Budva Butua Hotel 4 * you can book excursions to the sights of Montenegro right at the hotel.  If you don‚Äôt want to spend extra on them, you can just walk along the promenade, look at the fortress and churches, but be prepared: to enter even the citadel, you need to pay 1.5 euros, go to the territory behind the walls - 2.5 euros .  But the city center can be circumvented in half an hour, and the beauty around is simply extraordinary, it is a sin not to use the services of the hotel. </p><p>  According to visitors' reviews, the most good and inexpensive excursions can be noted: </p><ul><li>  <span>Boka Kotorska Bay.</span>  The cost is 25 euros.  They take a bus to Kotor - the most beautiful city in the country + boat trip on a picturesque bay. </li><li>  Canyons  The price is 40 euros.  A trip to the north of the country, where tourists are waiting for the beautiful mountain peaks and canyons of the rivers: Tara, Moraca and Komarnitsa. </li><li>  Grand Canyons.  In addition to exploring the same beauties as in the previous version, an inspection of the Durmitor National Park, Lake of Piva and holy places is also added.  The price is 65 euros. </li></ul><p>  I would like to remind you that the prices for children for all excursion tours are half that for an adult, and if the child is sitting on his hands - generally free of charge. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  Basically, reading the reviews of vacationers, you can get a favorable impression of this hotel.  The rooms have good soundproofing, so that the rooms are always quiet and comfortable, music from bars and discos located on the coast is not heard, and this is a definite plus.  People really like the spacious rooms, soft comfortable beds, in winter the hotel is well heated. </p><p>  There are also bad reviews.  They mainly relate to cleaning and catering.  Some rooms had poorly washed bathrooms.  People did not like the food, some believe that they ordered breakfast in vain.  In the cafe next to the hotel, food is cheaper and tastier. </p><p>  Attention!  Be careful!  In one review, it was written that money was stolen from a private room at a hotel in Russia.  Every day, a small amount from the wallet disappeared, then 10, then 20 euros.  There was no reaction to the manager‚Äôs complaints.  People believe that the staff is not clean at hand.  So be careful, keep the money in a safe, or take it with you. </p>
