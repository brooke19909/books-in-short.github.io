The latter, in the region, there are more than 20 thousand.  Of these, 16,000 are fresh water bodies, 4,000 are saline.  Unfortunately, in recent years, many lakes in the Omsk region have sharply lost water levels, this leads to shallowing.  This environmental problem worries all residents of this region. </p><h2>  The Five Lakes System </h2><p>  Probably the most popular lakes in the region are the so-called Five Lakes system, to a greater extent because they are shrouded in legends.  There are water bodies on the border of two regions - Omsk and Novosibirsk.  This group includes 4 - existing and 1 - fictional: Danilovo, Linevo, Shchuchye, Urmannoe (it is also called Shaitan Lake) and Potenoe. </p><p>  According to one legend, these lakes of the Omsk region were formed due to a meteorite fall.  It is noteworthy that each of these reservoirs was formed by a separate meteorite fragment.  Also interesting is the fact that the Hidden Lake was never found.  Until now, its existence has not been officially confirmed.  The reservoir is recognized as a legend.  And another legend says that the water in the Five Lakes group is healing, and if a person bathes in all at a time, then he will be cured of various diseases.  This myth is not baseless, the waters of the lakes are really rich in silver minerals and well saturated with oxygen.  This place is popular among tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lakes of the Omsk region" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1169874.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kamyshlovsky log </h2><p>  The once existing valley of the Kamyshlovka River created a chain of salt and fresh water bodies, which were called the Kamyshlovsky Log.  The small lakes of the Omsk region, which are found here for more than 500 km, can dry out and appear back, depending on the seasonal factor.  Their composition may also be different - some of the reservoirs with fresh water, and the rest with salt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lakes of the Omsk region fishing" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1169872.jpg" width="600"></div>

Rest on the lakes of the Omsk region is very popular due to the presence of therapeutic mud.  One of such reservoirs is Lake Ulzhay.  Since 1978, it has been officially recognized as a natural monument.  The pond is shallow, its average depth is only 50 cm, but the bottom to a depth of 1-2 m has an oily substance consisting of black mud.  It is widely used to treat skin problems and diseases. </p><h2>  Ebeyty Lake (Omsk Region) </h2><p>  But the most famous was the salt <span>lake of Ebeyta,</span> which became so popular due to its healing properties.  It is located in the southwestern part of the region.  This is the largest salt lake in the area - its size is 12x13 km, and the average depth is about 1 meter.  The bottom has a silt character, which includes many salts and medicinal black mud, consisting of sodium, chloride and sulfates.  Lake Ebeyty (Omsk region) has a sandy coastline, where it is very comfortable to spend summer holidays.  Very often, mud from a reservoir is used in sanatoriums of the region for the prevention and treatment of diseases of the epidermis and musculoskeletal system.  That is why these places are quite popular among local residents and the entire population of Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on the lakes of the Omsk region" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1169871.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The rich fauna of the lakes of the Omsk region </h2><p>  Thanks to such a generous number of reservoirs in the region, fishing is widespread here.  Burbot, pike perch, peled, perch, carp, crucian carp, bream and many other species of fish ‚Äúinhabit‚Äù the lakes of the Omsk region.
