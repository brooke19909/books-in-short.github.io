However, most modern payment systems have the function of instant funds transfer online or through a special USSD-team.  To conduct a one-time replenishment of the Megafon account with a bank card, it is not at all necessary to go somewhere or stand in line.  All necessary actions can be performed using a mobile device. </p><h2>  How to replenish the Megafon account? </h2><p>  There are several different options for transferring funds to your phone‚Äôs SIM card.  All of them have their positive and negative sides.  For example, when depositing cash through the terminal, you will have to pay a few percent of the commission of the company that deals with the transaction of funds.  And to make a free transfer via the Internet is not always possible, because there may simply be no access to the Web.  What to do in this case? </p><p>  No one prohibits a one-time replenishment of a Megafon account from a bank card using ATMs.  It will be enough to insert a credit card into the device, and then select ‚ÄúCellular payment‚Äù from the available functions.  However, not all ATMs provide this service for free.  In some cases, the commission will be even greater than when depositing cash through the terminal.  So what is the best way to conduct a one-time replenishment of a Megafon account with a credit card? </p><h2>  Visiting the Megafon Salon </h2><p>  If you have cashless funds in your hands, and there is a mobile phone office nearby, then you can ask the company's employees for help to conduct a money transaction.  This method is one of the most convenient and fast.  Given the fact that Megafon has a fairly wide service base, getting to the salon will not be difficult, and its employees will be happy to help you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="akket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Salon of mobile communication &quot;Megaphone&quot;" class="if uuid-3199969" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3199969.jpg"></div><p>  What documents do I need to have with me?  Any certificate confirming the identity of the citizen is suitable (in most cases they will not even be asked).  In addition, a bank card must be present on hand, since it is from it (and not from the account) that funds will be debited.  Just dictate to the cashier the phone number that needs to be replenished, and then pay for the transaction through a special terminal. </p><h2>  ATM use </h2><p>  Thinking about how else you can replenish your Megafon account?  Payment by credit card can also be carried out using a conventional ATM or self-service terminal.  Here is a short instruction to help you take the right steps when you first recharge: </p><div class="photo" data-original="us.toluna.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern ATM" class="if uuid-3199988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3199988.jpg"></div><ol><li>  We insert the card into the device and enter the pin code. </li><li>  Select the option "Mobile Communications", which is located in the "Payments" tab. </li><li>  We use the buttons of the ATM to enter the phone number. </li><li>  We indicate the amount to replenish in rubles (pennies are not taken into account). </li><li>  We carefully check the entered data and confirm the operation. </li><li>  Click on the button ‚ÄúPrint receipt‚Äù or ‚ÄúWithout receipt‚Äù. </li><li>  We use the function ‚ÄúEnd the service‚Äù and pick up the card. </li></ol><p>  After that, you just have to wait for the SMS notification that money has arrived on the phone number.  Be sure to keep the printed receipt up to this point.  If the money does not arrive within an hour, contact the information service to find out the reasons for the delay. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Commission for replenishment via ATM </h2><p>  If a Megafon customer used a self-service terminal to replenish their number, then the money will not come in full.  As a rule, the commission depends on the policy of the store or shopping center in which the terminal is installed.  In most cases, it is from 1.5 to 8 percent.  If you do not want to lose part of the money, it is better to use an ATM. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wallpaperscraft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A man inserts a card" class="if uuid-3200002" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3200002.jpg"></div><p>  A device from absolutely any company, for example, Unicredit, is suitable.  MegaFon account replenishment from a bank card is carried out without commission, and funds are credited almost instantly.  However, be sure to keep the check until the funds are credited to the account (especially when using services from private banks). </p><h2>  Electronic payment system </h2><p>  A fairly safe method, for the implementation of which you will need access to the Internet.  It is most convenient to use a personal computer or laptop, however, if your smartphone has an application from QIWI, WebMoney or Yandex.  Money, then you can use the gadget.  Of course, a prerequisite is the presence of an account in one of the electronic wallets, but replenishing it with money is not necessary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Electronic money" class="if uuid-3200017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3200017.jpg"></div><p>  Going to the official site of the payment system, you must first log in to your account by entering your username and password.  After that, go to the ‚ÄúPayments‚Äù tab and select the ‚ÄúMobile Communications‚Äù section.  All that remains is to indicate personal data from the bank card (number, expiration date, secret code on the back), the amount of replenishment in rubles, as well as the phone number to which funds will be credited. </p><h2>  Money transfer via SMS </h2><p>  One-time replenishment of the Megafon account from a bank card can also be done using SMS, if a valid bank account is attached to the SIM card.  To do this, send a message to the toll free number: 5117. The text of the SMS must contain numbers indicating the amount of money that the client wants to transfer, as well as the word "rubles". </p><div class="photo" data-original="freespy.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Messages on the phone" class="if uuid-3200024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3200024.jpg"></div><p>  Here is a small example of a message that you want to send to number 5117: "500 rubles."  In this case, five hundred rubles will be credited to the SIM card account in a few minutes.  Sometimes an alert about the arrival of funds does not appear immediately, so do not be alarmed, but rather enter the key combination: * 100 # to check the balance. </p><h2>  Using the USSD Command </h2><p>  To replenish the Megafon account with a Sberbank credit card, you can use the special team that you will need to enter from your mobile phone number.  As in the previous case, to complete this operation, you will need to have a credit card tied to a SIM card.  Before executing the request, be sure to ensure that the bank account has enough money to replenish the number. </p><div class="photo" data-original="techrasa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="USSD team" class="if uuid-3200031" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3200031.jpg"></div><p>  We dial the key combination on the phone: * 117 * amount #, then press the call button.  However, it is impossible to transfer more than 3,000 rubles at a time.  As for the minimum amount, the threshold is limited to 50 rubles.  Despite these limitations, this method of payment has a significant advantage - the absence of a commission.  That is, if the client enters the combination: * 117 * 250 #, then 250 rubles will come to his account. </p><h2>  From the official site </h2><p>  To replenish the Megafon account via the Internet, you need to go to the official website of the company, and then register or log in to your personal account.  Usually, the phone number is used as a login, but the password will be sent via SMS if the client types the USSD command on the phone: * 105 * 00 #.  Once the password is received, you can not only recharge your mobile phone number, but also use many other useful functions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.intelligentpeople.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Man at the computer" class="if uuid-3200039" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3200039.jpg"></div><p>  To transfer funds to a SIM card, go to the ‚ÄúPayment for cellular communications‚Äù section, and then enter the recharge amount (minimum payment is 100 rubles).  You do not need to enter a phone number, as it will already be indicated on the corresponding line.  However, if you want to transfer money to another card, be sure to change it to the appropriate one.  You can also use bonus points that are awarded for using communication services for payment. </p><h2>  Commission rates and limits </h2><p>  Everyone should understand that there are certain restrictions on a one-time replenishment of a Megafon account from a bank card, which do not allow you to put too much money on a SIM card at a time.  In most cases, the maximum transfer amount varies from three (in the case of using an ATM and USSD commands) to five (when visiting a mobile phone salon) thousand rubles.  In addition, transactions per week should not exceed the amount of 10,000 rubles, and per month - 30,000 rubles.  On the official website, a one-time replenishment of an account in the amount of 100 to 10,000 rubles is allowed. </p><p>  As for the commission, it is charged only when using electronic wallets and self-service terminals.  In addition, the company allows its customers to use the Promised Payment service through their personal account.  The credit limit is recounted every month and depends on the honesty of the client, as well as his solvency (more detailed information can be found in Megafon mobile phone stores. Payment by credit card will allow you to pay off the promised payment and make additional funds to your SIM card. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="Fdc4jaRm9XY" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdc4jaRm9XY" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/6/8/6/4/16864.jpg"></div><p>  We hope our article helped you better understand what constitutes a one-time replenishment of Megafon account with a credit card.  Instructions for using the ATM will also be relevant for customers of other cellular companies.  Do not forget to print the check and keep it until the receipt of funds in the account.  You can also use other payment methods, but do not forget about limits and commissions.  In addition, before making a transfer, you must make sure that you have enough money in your bank account. </p>
