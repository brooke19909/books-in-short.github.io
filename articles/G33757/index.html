But a couple of <span>popular models</span> from this country still appeared.  In addition, the popularity of Japanese manufacturers is associated with product quality and their durability.  Therefore, there was no doubt that smartphones will be released to the conscience. </p><h2>  Japan Technology </h2><p>  Phones from Japan appeared not so long ago.  Although the country is considered a leader in high technology, the percentage of its products on the world market is not as high as manufacturers might like. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vogue.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manufacturers from Japan" class="if uuid-2787856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2787856.jpg"></div><p>  What do buyers know about Japanese companies?  Previously, VCRs from Sony were hugely popular.  This manufacturer has been on the market for a long time, so it copes with the needs of customers. </p><p>  No less popular was the company Sharp.  She also produces tape recorders and televisions.  And recently it became known thanks to the production of phones from Japan. </p><h2>  Japan manufacturers </h2><p>  Since we are talking about smartphones, here we can mention several popular manufacturers who supply their devices to stores around the world.  Of course, few become popular, but a product that is truly quality and reliable easily attracts the attention of customers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Well-known companies that sell Japanese phones today are: </p><ul><li>  Kyocera; </li><li>  Sharp </li><li>  Fujitsu; </li><li>  Panasonic </li><li>  Sony </li></ul><p>  Each company has several models that are relevant today, which are worth discussing in more detail. </p><h2>  Kyocera </h2><p>  This is a Japanese company that has been operating since 1959.  Its headquarters is in Kyoto.  Kyocera is now working with high-tech ceramics: kitchen knives, cutting tools and electronic components.  The manufacturer is also known for its cell phones in Japan and office equipment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidguys.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Japanese phones" class="if uuid-2787858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2787858.jpg"></div><p>  The company is sensitive to the environment and promotes its protection, and also focuses on improving the quality of life of society. </p><h2>  Phones Kyocera </h2><p>  Urbano V01 is one of the pretty current mobile phones in Japan.  This is an unusual model that stands out among all modern smartphones.  The model is equipped with a 5-inch display with FullHD resolution.  The main camera generates images in 13 megapixels. </p><p>  The manufacturer installed the new-fashioned Snapdragon 801 processor and 2 GB of RAM.  The smartphone‚Äôs battery has a capacity of 3 thousand mAh.  This is enough for a full day of moderate use.  The chip of the model was the protection against water and dust IP58. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Urbano L03 is a similar phone from Japan.  Outwardly, it is practically no different.  Its shape has become more arched.  The model is special in that it has the same characteristics as the previous one, but costs $ 200 less.  What it is connected with is not clear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smartphone.teru-company.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="urbano l03" class="if uuid-2788545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/2788545.jpg"></div><p>  Kyocera also has a specialized smartphone - Brigadier.  This model is aimed at those who value the reliability and security of the phone.  The smartphone is rare, because it has an artsy design, and therefore has not become popular with buyers. </p><p>  The manufacturer used sapphire crystal, which perfectly protects the 4.5-inch screen.  The phone did not receive any particularly powerful technical characteristics, but it will be enough to perform everyday tasks.  The battery capacity is 3100 mAh.  The model works with IP68 technology. </p><h2>  Sharp </h2><p>  Sharp is a leading Japanese electronics company.  The company was founded in 1912 and is located in Osaka.  The manufacturer is engaged in Japanese cell phones, video and audio systems, household appliances, information equipment. </p><p>  Also known printing and copying systems, microcircuits, electronic components and liquid crystal displays developed by this company.  The company has a division that specializes in the production of high-end equipment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sharp Phones </h2><p>  Sharp models are more popular among buyers in the CIS.  This is due to the fact that some options are sold outside of Japan, and therefore are heard.  One of these models was Aquos Crystal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aquos Phone" class="if uuid-2787862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2787862.jpg"></div><p>  These smartphones are designed with an unusual design.  It has thin frames on the left, right and top, but from below the manufacturer has left a large free area for the logo, front camera and speakers. </p><p>  A 5-inch screen and an 8 megapixel main camera are available to the buyer.  A mediocre ‚Äúfilling‚Äù is installed inside, which allows you to use the model only for everyday tasks.  But 1.5 GB of RAM is very small.  And the battery capacity of 2040 mAh is unlikely to help ‚Äúlive‚Äù the phone for half a day. </p><p>  The Aquos line does not end there.  For example, the Zeta SH-01G model looks almost the same as the previous version, but the frames around the display became wider, and the speakers moved to the top.  Also, this model has a 5.5-inch screen and can shoot video in 4K. </p><p>  Xx 304SH - another copy of previous models.  An interesting solution was the introduction of touch volume buttons on the bottom of the phone next to the front camera.  Under the 5.2-inch display, the Snapdragon 801 processor is hidden, as well as a chip for 2 GB of RAM. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gigazine.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aquos Crystal X Smartphone" class="if uuid-2787865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2787865.jpg"></div><p>  Aquos Crystal X is considered to be the real flagship in the line. This is one of the first phones from Japan that appeared on the market frameless.  The screen has a diagonal of 5.5 inches and a resolution of FullHD.  But the "filling" of the device is not the most powerful.  Inside there is only 2 GB of RAM, but the Snapdragon 801 will definitely provide speed. </p><h2>  Fujitsu </h2><p>  This is a large Japanese company that is engaged in IT and electronics manufacturing.  She is known for her servers, data storage systems, and personal systems.  The latter include laptops and tablets, zero clients, personal computers, workstations and peripherals. </p><h2>  Phones Fujitsu </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Fujitsu is considered the most popular photographic equipment, there are a couple of phone models that have not become popular in the CIS.  They are much like Sony gadgets. </p><p>  The Arrows NX F-05F has rounded bottom and sharp top corners.  Such a design decision is very unusual.  Otherwise, this phone from Japan is no different from previous models.  It still uses the processor from Snapdragon and 2 GB of RAM.  A feature of this model is a 20.7 megapixel camera. </p><h2>  Panasonic </h2><p>  This is the most popular Japanese corporation.  She is engaged in the production of household appliances and electrical goods.  Most users know about Panasonic photographic equipment, but have never heard of phones from this manufacturer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cameraphone Lumix" class="if uuid-2787868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2787868.jpg"></div><p>  Lumix DMC-CM1 - a real camera phone and the first attempt of the company to create a phone.  Its feature was the presence of a Leica lens.  Despite the ‚Äúchip‚Äù of the device, a powerful processor and 2 GB of RAM were installed inside.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer did not make sure that the phone could work for a long time and equipped a 2600 mAh battery. </p><h2>  Sony </h2><p>  And although the iPhone X is considered a <span>popular phone</span> in Japan, the Japanese also do not forget about domestic production.  Therefore, Sony Xperia with all its models are still considered very high-quality and powerful devices. </p><p>  One of the iconic models was the Z1.  Now this smartphone is many years old, so it was replaced by a new line of XZ.  The XZ1 model is equipped with powerful hardware, has 4 GB of RAM and a 5.2-inch screen.  As always, the phone works according to the IP68 standard. </p><div class="photo" data-original="techjeep.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Model Sony Xperia Z1" class="if uuid-2787871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2787871.jpg"></div><p>  Models of these smartphones have become popular in the CIS countries.  They subdued the buyer with their appearance and powerful "iron".  In addition, Sony phones were among the first to work easily in the water and not collect dust. </p><p>  The most popular was the Z line. Starting with the Sony <span>Xperia Z1, the</span> Japanese released a lot of new models that were getting better.  For some time, the popularity of these phones has subsided, so the company decided to rebrand and released the XZ line. </p><p>  New smartphones have got an updated design, a fingerprint scan button and a camera module.  Sony developers tried to leave the corporate identity, so most fans of the brand were not scared away even by the high cost of new products. </p><p>  Which phones are popular in Japan?  Of course, the Japanese love their manufacturers and often purchase smartphones from Sony or Sharp.  But, as statistics show, it was the American company Apple that was able to convince the Japanese of the quality of its products, so they definitely give preference to gadgets "with an apple." </p><h2>  About other‚Ä¶ </h2><p>  Japan is considered one of the most popular car manufacturers in the world.  Therefore, the famous Toyota remains relevant both at home and around the world.  After it, Nissan is no less popular.  This suggests the idea that <span>Japanese cars are</span> so far better than Japanese phones. </p><p>  "Japan Auto" in Murmansk is a popular store in Russia that provides spare parts for those same Japanese cars.  Therefore, if you decide to buy a brand new Nissan, you can not worry about finding parts. </p>
