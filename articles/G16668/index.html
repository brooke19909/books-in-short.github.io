At present, interruptions in the supply of hot water are often observed.  That is why it is very good to have a device that allows you to completely depend on central water supply.  The only drawback of storage boilers is the obligatory presence of pressure in the pipe with cold water.  Otherwise, in its absence, it is not possible to use hot, passing through the heating tank. </p><p>  There are various options in stores.  They differ in design, technical characteristics, control method and, of course, volume.  For example, the most popular appliances are 100 liters.  This capacity is more than enough for a family of five, provided that everyone will take only a shower.  If you want to soak in the bathroom, then the next person will need to wait about 3 hours. </p><p>  So, choosing a tank volume, many buyers can not decide on the manufacturer.  It is worth noting that there are currently a lot of them.  If there are some restrictions on cash, but you want to purchase high-quality equipment, it is recommended to pay attention to the Ariston brand.  You can buy devices of both Russian and Italian assemblies.  In 2015, it was the Ariston electric <span>storage water heater</span> (100) that became the sales leader.  Photos of several models can be found in the article.  Units designed for 100 liters are represented by a wide range.  There are devices with different types of heating elements and tank materials.  They may also vary in body shape and mounting method.  As a rule, almost all models are equipped with power control and a thermometer.  More expensive options have a digital control panel.  More details about the equipment will be discussed a little later.  In the meantime, let‚Äôs figure out what features the Ariston electric storage water heater (100 liters) has and what to look for when choosing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="storage water heater electric ariston 100 liters" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1513284.jpg" width="311"></div>

The company has been doing business for over 50 years.  The range of products includes both budget models and premium technology.  Given that Ariston Thermo Group is an Italian company, branches and service centers operate in Russia.  Therefore, even if an electric water heater ‚ÄúAriston‚Äù for 100 liters fails, there will be no problems with the repair and purchase of parts. </p><p>  All products manufactured by this company comply with modern requirements.  It is quite functional and, most importantly, energy-saving.  But it is precisely this criterion that many buyers pay attention to.  It is worth noting that when the boiler is first launched, it will take about 3-4 hours to heat the water to the maximum allowable temperature.  In this case, the cost of electricity will be no more than 10 kW.  The next switching on of the heating element will occur no earlier than after 14 hours (if hot water will not be consumed).  Many users confirm that the specifications declared by the manufacturer are quite true. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="storage water heater electric ariston 100 photos" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1513302.jpg" width="500"></div>

It is also very important to pay attention to the safety valve.  Installation of the device without it is strictly prohibited.  It is this device that helps reduce internal pressure, which, with a record increase, can even lead to an explosion. </p><h2>  Advantages of Ariston brand water heaters </h2><p>  Electric storage water heater "Ariston" (100 liters) has many significant advantages.
