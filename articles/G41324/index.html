Their history, as a rule, goes back centuries.  Many sights of <span>St. Petersburg in winter</span> are available for visiting.  In the heart of the metropolis, the Tauride Garden has found refuge - a delightful place with picturesque landscapes, hosting guests year-round. </p><h2>  The story of a beautiful garden </h2><p>  In the estate of G. A. Potemkin, a participant in the victorious battles of the 18th century, near the Horse Guards House, erected in 1783-1789, a wonderful garden was built.  It was built on the finances allocated by the count.  Subsequently, the complex at the state level is recognized as a monument in honor of the victories of Russia in the wars that broke out at the sunset of the eighteenth century. </p>

    <p>  The treasury redeems a magnificent ensemble.  And then Catherine II assigns G.A. Potemkin the title of His Serene Highness Prince of Tauride and gives him an imperial gift - a garden that has become part of his estate.  In such a miraculous way, the complex returned to its owner. </p><p>  Later, when the owner of the estate died, the house was renamed the <span>Tauride Palace,</span> and the garden was given the same name.  Thanks to the empress, who bought the estate for the second time, the memory of the favorite was immortalized, to whom she presented the land as a gift, marking victory in the battles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Organization of a garden complex </h2><p>  A beautiful complex - the Tauride Garden - was equipped with the skillful hands of the Englishman V. Gould.  A talented gardener transformed the monotonous moody landscape prevailing in the estate into a picturesque place with ponds, ponds, stone canals and beautiful hillocks, overgrown with undersized herbs, winding paths, alleys, lined with benches, and amazing panoramic landscapes. </p><p>  The ensemble was surrounded by trees, a log palisade and a moat with wooden bridges thrown over it.  A sterlet was launched into ponds in the mirror of which swans were swimming.  Peacocks walked on the lawns.  First, trees were planted around the perimeter of the estate, forming a natural fence from other urban areas.  Later, the Tauride Garden in St. Petersburg was surrounded by a fence in which a stone access bridge was mounted. </p>

    <p>  Greenhouses and greenhouses, designed by F. Volkov, planted with peaches, apricots, melons, watermelons and even pineapples.  The owners of the estate spoiled themselves and guests with fruits ripening in the garden. </p><h2>  The greenhouse of the Tauride landscape gardening ensemble </h2><p>  The greenhouse, laid in an old manor, is rightfully considered the oldest and most popular winter garden in St. Petersburg.  The grand plan of the architect and Catherine II included the creation of a real palm grove, covered with a glass dome.  True, the idea was not realized, but the flowers here were always bred in abundance.  All plants from the greenhouse located in Pushkino were transported to this place.  In 1936, the Tauride greenhouse was turned into an exhibition hall.  Now her main guests are gardeners and couples. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Flower lovers here inspect the magnificent collections, some of their samples and acquire their favorite items for their estates.  Exotic plants on sale days go to them at reasonable prices.  Often newlyweds come to the greenhouse.  They create memorable romantic photo shoots.  Stunning wedding ceremonies are organized for them.  And festive banquets are arranged under palm trees, among lush flowers. </p><h2>  Kulibin Bridge </h2><p>  The magnificent Tauride Garden in St. Petersburg impresses with the Big Pond, in which an island is organized, connected to the coastline by two bridges.  When erecting them, the craftsmen adhered to the design of the designed, but not constructed wooden bridge on the Neva. </p>

    <h2>  View slides </h2><p>  The bulk hill - the main species hill - was built on the north side of the Big Island.  It overlooks the Tauride Palace with a facade overlooking the pond.  In addition to this hill, in the garden and park complex, several more specific hillocks were poured.  They looked through the lawns with important peacocks walking around, one or another part of the princely palace and other architectural structures. </p>

    <h2>  Little Admiralty </h2><p>  The Tauride Garden in St. Petersburg had its own little Admiralty.  It was located in the gazebo, designed to store pleasure boats.  In 1815, they arranged a test of the ship "Elizabeth", which is considered the first "steamer" of Russia.  In fact, it was an ordinary boat equipped with a steam engine. </p><h2>  Opening of public access to the garden ensemble </h2><p>  Until 1861, the complex was not a city-wide facility.  Only important guests were allowed to walk on it.  There is a legend about a prince who presented a garden ensemble of seals, who for some time became an inhabitant of the Great Pond. </p><p>  By the highest command, the complex gains the status of a universal landmark of St. Petersburg.  In winter, ponds turn into solid skating rinks.  The Admiralty merchants arranged a luxurious restaurant.  This place is popular with all kinds of public organizations. </p>

    <p>  When turning right, passing 50 m to the first intersection and making a right turn, go to Furstadskaya street and follow its end (towards the increasing numbering of buildings).  The outskirts rests on Potemkinskaya street, and immediately after it begins the garden and park complex.  When turning left, go the same 50 m, make a left turn, exit onto Kirochnaya street and move to the southwest corner of the garden fence. </p><p>  The route along the quiet Furstadskaya street with a square in the middle is preferable.  It is built up with beautiful houses built in the nineteenth century.  The bustling Kirochnaya street stretches along a busy city highway. </p><h2>  Visit time </h2><p>  Amazing energy, conducive to outdoor activities, has a Tauride Garden in St. Petersburg.  Park hours: from 7:00 to 22:00.  This ensemble was the only place where nightingale trills sound in St. Petersburg. </p>
