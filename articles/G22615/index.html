This is the main component in the whole system.  Any receiver concentrates several important devices at once - it is a signal preamp, tuner and a signal switching station in one person.  All components of audio‚Äì, video systems are connected to a single center - the receiver.  It receives signals from all devices and redirects them to others.  There are a huge number of receivers, and all of them have not only different characteristics, but also different purposes.  A receiver designed <span>for car speakers is</span> simply not able to work in a more powerful home system. </p>

    <h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  There are quite a lot of manufacturers of electronic devices in the world, and it is no secret that half of them are Chinese firms.  It is not customary to save on receivers.  Buying a Chinese replica of a branded device is not worth it, although it is much cheaper.  Otherwise, there is a serious danger of being disappointed and underestimating music receivers.  Before buying, you should look at the following companies: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Yamaha </li><li>  Pioneer; </li><li>  Onkyo; </li><li>  Denon </li></ul><p>  It is worth choosing brands that are well-known in the domestic Chinese market only if there is no way to purchase a receiver from a well-known company.  Replicas and remanufactured devices are best avoided. </p><h2>  Varieties of Receivers </h2><p>  All receivers are different, and not only by characteristics, but also by purpose.  That is why, choosing a receiver, it is imperative to determine in advance its purpose.  As a rule, the first stage of selection is simple. </p><ul><li>  <em>Mobile receiver</em>  A great option for a music receiver in the car.  It is compact and can even fit in a pocket.  It is connected via the standard AUX connector, which is provided in many cars.  Unfortunately, this is where the advantages of such a device end.  Due to its size and specific purpose, it does not produce such a desirable high-quality sound. </li><li>  <em>Stationary receiver.</em>  This is a whole group of devices with a huge variation in product cost and quality.  An option for home audio or video systems, or even cinema systems.  The stationary music receiver is a rarity.  Typically, AV receivers are used. </li></ul><p>  It is equally important to understand exactly how the system will connect to the receiver.  There are not many options, but they are constantly expanding.  You can connect the receiver using: </p><ul><li>  Cable. </li><li>  Wi-fi connection. </li><li>  Via bluetooth.  Not all companies provide bluetooth.  The music receiver works without it, as some manufacturers decided and suffered losses.  Such a connection in the modern world is necessary. </li></ul><p>  Good receiver models are not so demanding to connect, because they contain a really large number of different connectors.  There are not only modern ports, but also obsolete ones.  When buying a receiver, one should not forget about decoders.  There are several options: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Dolby Digital Plus.  A modern decoder for reproducing high-quality sound and video.  First of all, it is necessary for Blue-Ray discs. </li><li>  Dolby Digital.  This decoder is required if the audio system involves playing content from a CD or DVD disc. </li><li>  Dolby Pro-Logic.  This obsolete decoder will provide high-quality work with obsolete film cassettes, however it does not work with optical discs. </li></ul><p>  The music receiver always needs calibration.  There are no universal parameters.  The configuration of the connected devices and the size of the room are different.  Of course, self-calibration is a science, but automatic comes to the rescue.  Modules for automatic calibration are usually supplied with the device itself, but they may not be available when it comes to professional equipment. </p>

    <h2>  Receiver design </h2><p>  Receivers vary in design.  Each of the designs has its advantages and disadvantages. </p><ul><li>  <em>Semiconductor receiver</em> .  The most popular and frequently used solution.  Such receivers are quite reliable and can even survive significant voltage drops. </li><li>  <em>Receiver on the lamp.</em>  This is a very expensive and impractical solution.  As a rule, this option is typical for professional models.  The music receiver on the lamps gives a more lively sound.  You can not buy cheap models of such receivers.  They are very short-lived and will be much worse than similar-priced semiconductor receivers. </li><li>  <em>Mixed receivers</em> .  An extremely rare solution for receivers.  It is found exclusively in highly specialized models. </li></ul><h2>  Music AV Receiver </h2><p>  This versatile receiver is the most popular option on the market.  Receivers intended only for music systems are very expensive professional tools that are not available to ordinary people.  The AV receiver does an excellent job of any kind.  It is not a highly specialized device and gives excellent sound, excellent synchronization and high-quality image on the TV screen.  It can be used in home theaters, separately in audio systems and even combine all this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Ample features of AV receivers </h2><p>  The capabilities of such receivers will satisfy not only an inexperienced music lover, but also a picky specialist.  This device combines a number of features: </p><ul><li>  <em>Gain.</em>  The primary signal, as a rule, is rather weak, and for its high-quality reproduction on good equipment it is necessary to amplify the signal.  The receiver eliminates the need to buy a separate device and independently amplifies the signal, thereby making the sound more saturated. </li><li>  <em>Commutation.</em>  This is a necessary property for each receiver.  The essence of switching is to combine multiple signals into one. </li><li>  <em>Decoding</em> audio tracks.  On an optical disc or any other medium, the audio file is recorded in an encoded video track.  The receiver decodes the track and plays.  The better and more expensive the receiver, the more formats it can decode.  If the format of the material cannot be decoded, it must be converted to an acceptable format, and this is far from always possible without loss of recording quality. </li></ul>

    <p>  Each receiver for a music center or home theater has all these features.  In compact car receivers, amplification may be completely absent. </p><h2>  The best receiver for a car </h2><p>  Not all cars are equipped with modern audio systems.  It often happens that the radio does not have a USB connector or even AUX.  This in itself is a pretty tangible problem.  Car receivers are always small in size.  They have a number of disadvantages, but with their help you can listen to music without radio interference and CD-ROMs.  A bluetooth music receiver is the only way to listen to high-quality sound in an old car.  Managing a playlist using your phone is very convenient, but quite dangerous in motion.  Do not also forget that bluetooth receivers, especially inexpensive models, will not give high-quality sound. </p><h2>  The best receivers at a reasonable price </h2><p>  Everyone, buying any product, wants to get the best quality at a lower price.  Such an opportunity is not always available, but fortunately, electronics manufacturers understand that not everyone can afford expensive devices.  The market is full of cheap Chinese fakes and the so-called younger models of branded devices.  Choosing something really good is hard.  At the moment, the most musical receivers from an inexpensive segment are: </p><ul><li>  Sony STR-DG520; </li><li>  Pioneer VSX-519V; </li><li>  Yamaha RX-V365. </li></ul><p>  Each of these receivers allows you to get great sound at minimal cost.  Of course, the sound will not be perfect.  However, an ordinary music lover will not hear any flaws in the sound of these models. </p><h2>  Wires are a symbol of the past </h2><p>  The use of wired receivers and docking stations in our time, the development of wireless technology, has long been outdated.  Modern manufacturers of musical equipment see a promise in improving bluetooth technologies.  Especially promising is the direction of connecting structurally wired devices to wireless. </p><p>  A musical bluetooth receiver is not only a great option for a car, but also a real find for a music lover.  With their small size and low cost, these devices can create an inexpensive audio system with good sound even in the cramped room.  The best models of such receivers on the market are: </p><ul><li>  Belkin F8Z492TT Regular; </li><li>  Belkin F8Z492TT HD; </li><li>  HomeSpot BTADP-233; </li><li>  BrightPlay Music Receiver. </li></ul><p>  Do not take the cheapest bluetooth device.  In this case, it will be most rational to purchase a receiver in the middle price range. </p><h2>  "Pioneer" - affordable quality </h2><p>  Pioneer AV Receivers are, first of all, a good choice and reliability.  The lineup of this company is very good, there is always plenty to choose from.  Despite the good reputation, you do not need to take cheap receivers from this company.  Anything cheaper than 10,000 rubles will not be able to please either the build quality or the pleasant sound.  Moreover, budget devices will have to be calibrated manually, and for the sake of listening to music you will have to tinker. </p><p>  The name of the company speaks for itself.  New models do not have outdated connectors, decoders and archaic design.  Almost all devices of this company one way or another support wireless bluetooth connection.  The Pioneer music receiver is not only stationary, but also mobile.  A truly successful model is the Pioneer SC-LX57.  This inexpensive, but very high-quality model of the receiver fully justifies the name of the company.  The clear sound of this receiver is much better than that of similar devices from competitors. </p>

    <h2>  Inexpensive receiver from Sony </h2><p>  Sony is a company familiar to everyone.  The company produces many electronic gadgets and each of them is special.  The line of music receivers at Sony is very large.  Honestly, everyone can find an affordable receiver for themselves.  By and large, the same principle works here as with other manufacturers - the more expensive the device, the better the quality.  The advantage is that even the cheapest models give a reasonably acceptable sound. </p><p>  Musical <span>bluetooth receiver</span> BM10 - a popular model.  This receiver costs no more than 4000 rubles, and also has a compact size and good characteristics.  Managing it from the phone is a pleasure.  However, it was not without drawbacks.  The fact is that bluetooth works at the same radio frequency as Wi-Fi.  This does not create any particular difficulties, but it is a drawback if the buyer prefers to watch high-resolution films through a mobile device connected to the receiver. </p>

    <h2>  Sony do not fail.  Review of BM10 </h2><p>  SONY is reliable.  This slogan is almost always justified.  Despite the low price, this receiver compares favorably with similar ones.  You can use it only with a home system, but this is not a minus at all.  The ascetic design of the receiver is suitable for any interior.  The sound is very pleasing.  Typically, any budget device can not boast of something good, but here is a completely different conversation.  The lack of digital inputs does not make the receiver worse, because it costs very little. </p><p>  There is only one drawback - poor equipment.  It has no instructions, no adapters, or even a spare cable. </p><h2>  HA100 </h2><p>  Among car enthusiasts, compact wireless receivers, which can be hidden in the glove compartment or behind the radio, are very popular.  There are many such receivers on the market, and all of them use a standard AUX connector for operation.  The most popular device that meets all the requirements is the HA100.  TP-Link music bluetooth receiver. </p><p>  The main advantages of this model are compactness, quality of materials and ease of use.  Unfortunately, high-quality sound is not about this model.  The main drawback is the low-frequency noise.  They are always present, but not everyone can hear them.  For people with sensitive hearing, this model is not suitable. </p><h2>  Review of TP-Link HA100 </h2><p>  This is a small, but very high-quality device, has a number of undeniable advantages.  First of all, it is build quality and its attractive design.  But in receivers this is not the main thing.  The best that it has is an unexpectedly pleasant sound and the absence of any wires.  It can even be hidden from prying eyes, and the signal will still be stable. </p><p>  Unfortunately, there were some flaws.  Due to the design features, this receiver cannot be placed in close proximity to the speakers.  The minimum distance is about 30 cm. This small minus can be forgiven if we recall the cost of the receiver. </p><h2>  Onkyo: not at the hearing </h2><p>  When choosing a receiver, each buyer tries to take a device of a well-known brand, completely forgetting that similar devices from other manufacturers can be no worse.  This mistake is made by people who buy the receiver for the first time. </p><p>  Onkyo creates quality equipment for audio systems and home theaters.  The model range is represented not only by budget equipment, but also professional.  The Onkyo music receiver is no worse than a device from any other brand.  Verified and well-proven receivers are: </p><ul><li>  Onkyo TX-NR636; </li><li>  Onkyo TX-NR838; </li><li>  Onkyo TX-NR1030; </li><li>  Onkyo TX-NR3030. </li></ul><p>  Each of these receivers is capable of working with the most powerful audio systems.  The high cost of the devices is offset by perfectly clear sound. </p>

    <h2>  Why buy an expensive receiver? </h2><p>  There is no and cannot be a single answer to this popular question.  An expensive receiver will be useful not only for professionals, but also for amateurs.  The enormous difference in sound quality between an expensive and a cheap device is perfectly noticeable even to an inexperienced music lover. </p><p>  Expensive equipment is much more reliable than cheap, and it is really nice to use it.  Expensive equipment makes us take a fresh look at the art and the world around us.  Listening to music or watching a movie from entertainment turns into a real hobby. </p>
