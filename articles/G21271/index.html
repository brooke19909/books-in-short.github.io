This is a great place to relax alone with yourself, for lovers who decide to spend a romantic evening, and for senior citizens.  In the afternoon, you can meet young mothers with babies in strollers.  Older children have fun frolic on trampolines and playgrounds under the supervision of parents. </p><h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  The park arose at the end of the XVIII century, when Prince Golitsyn presented part of his estate - a garden - to Moscow.  Everyone could visit it.  A hundred years later, in 1900, the gardens of the Chulkov-Rostopchin and Levashov estates were added to the park, and in 1920 the entire territory of the estate of tea-trader and gold maker N. D. Stakheev was added.  From this moment, this place was called the Garden named after May 1.  But two years later there were changes.  In 1922 it was renamed the N.E. Bauman Garden because of the proximity of the street of the same name. </p>

    <h2>  Grotto Belvedere </h2><p>  At the very beginning of its existence, the park on the orders of Prince Golitsyn was created in the best trends in park art in England, Holland and France.  However, after the revolution, as a result of vandalism, the beauty and grandeur of this garden almost disappeared.  The Belvedere decorative grotto, the pearl of Stacheev’s garden, was especially damaged.  In Soviet times, a pub and a barbecue were opened here, which were closed only in the 90s.  It was at this time that the authorities secured the grotto and restored it.  The Bauman Garden itself was recognized as an object of cultural heritage and entered into the Register of Architectural Monuments of Federal Importance.  Now its area is about 5,000 hectares. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to the Belvedere Grotto, there are many more attractions in the park.  So, in Soviet times, around the 20-30s, an open summer stage was built, on which Leonid Utesov also performed.  And to this day in Moscow there are no analogues.  Some park alleys planted with maples, lindens and poplars have been preserved from the old layout.  It was shot by the beloved film “Pokrovsky Gate”. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bauman garden how to get" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/468428.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  We go to the Bauman Garden </h2><p>  How to get to the place?  Getting here is easy enough.  The park territory is located near the metro station "Red Gate", where you can transfer to trolley bus number 24 and go straight to the garden, but a short walk will bring much more pleasure.  Her path will pass through the bridge over the railroads, past the arbitration court building.  At the end of the path you can see the massive facade of the estate of the merchant Stacheev, which is located just at the entrance to the park.  After a walk, you can relax on a bench listening to the birds singing. </p><h2>  Bauman Garden: park address </h2><p>  You can also get to the park by car.  It is enough to know the address: New Basmannaya Street, house 14, building 1. Usually, the car is left either on the street itself or in neighboring yards - where there is a place.  It should be borne in mind that leaving the car will not be easy.  Parking spaces are very few. </p><p>  Art historians note that the charm of old Moscow was preserved in the garden when, perhaps, Pushkin met with friends in it, and Chaadaev thought about the past of Russia and its fate.  It is possible that Gogol came here to think about his next creation. </p><p>  Now the Bauman Garden Park is an ideal place for a family vacation or a romantic date.  Picnics on the lawn will not leave anyone indifferent and will delight the kids growing in the stone jungle of the metropolis. </p><p>  For visitors, the Bauman Garden is open from 6 a.m.  You can walk here until 12 a.m. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Park Bauman Garden" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/468429.jpg" width="600"></div>
