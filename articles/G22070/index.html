    <p>  Everyone knows what the name of the horse <span>Alexander of Macedon was,</span> but no one has information about how he appeared with the king.  And the story itself is unknown.  But there are several legends regarding the origin of the animal.  According to one of them, Bucephalus was acquired by Alexander's father.  He bought it from a merchant for 13 talents.  King Philip had long doubted whether he needed such a purchase.  Indeed, for the money that should have been given for the horse, it was possible to maintain a company of soldiers from one and a half thousand people.  In addition, the animal had a wayward burrow.  But the future king of Macedonia decided to tame the horse, and for this the merchant will reduce the cost of the stallion.  Bucephalus was afraid of shadows, Alexander, noticing this, showed ingenuity and sent him to the sun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At first everything went quietly, the young man watched the horse, pacifying her a little.  He gave free rein to Bucephalus only when he realized that he posed no threat.  King Philip silently looked at everything that was happening.  But when Alexander, not hiding his glee, rode up to him on a horse, he could not restrain his tears.  It was at that moment that Philip uttered words that sounded like a prophecy.  Today, no one will be able to quote them, but the meaning of the phrase can be conveyed: Macedonia is small for Alexander, he must find a kingdom that suits him in character. </p><p>  Then the future Macedonian ruler was only 12 years old.  But Bucephalus, the horse of Alexander of Macedon, was even younger.  By the standards adopted for animals, the horse did not have large parameters.  Her height at the withers reached 136-146 centimeters.  But with all this, she received a nickname, which translates as "bull-headed" or "bull-headed." </p><h2>  Peacock tail horse </h2>

    <p>  Another legend describes the appearance and origin of the horse very beautifully and touchingly.  It is believed that the beloved horse of Alexander the Great possessed an ivory horn and a peacock emerald tail.  He was presented to Alexander by the Egyptian queen.  Until Bucephalus fell into the hands of its owner, he was unbroken.  Nobody could tame a wild animal, it was unusually large and felt how people were afraid of it.  That is why no one could curb him.  But Alexander was known as a brave youth who did not succumb to any fears.  When he matured, and was able to make him afraid of himself, he ordered that the horse be brought to him. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Bucephalus at the sight of his master showed humility: he poked his horn into the ground and began to wait for the orders of the king.  Macedon praised the action and named the horse by the name that is known to this day. </p><h2>  The origin of the name of the great horse </h2>

    <p>  Let's look at the name of the horse Alexander the Great and what was the reason for choosing this particular nickname.  Bucephalus is an ancient Greek name, which means ‚Äúquick-headed‚Äù.  There are several versions of why the animal received such a nickname.  Some historians claim that the horse had a large massive head, which resembled the head of a bull.  Other scientists say there is a white spot on the forehead that imitates the same head of a bull.  Behind the text of the third legend, Bucephalus was marked with a stigma in the form of a bull, since he grew up on the plains of Thessaly, and in those days all animals raised near the city of Farsala were marked with such a stigma. </p><h2>  Bucephalus at war </h2><p>  Many secrets surround the story of how the horse was called Alexander of Macedon, where he came from and how he fell into the hands of his owner.  But it is reliably known that he was the favorite of his master and took part in most of the hostilities conducted by the conqueror.  He was his friend, prop and protector. </p><p>  Alexander was so adored by his four-legged friend that he was protected from enemies and death.  So, once Macedonian, going on a campaign in Asia, he took Bucephalus with him.  But so that he would not suffer, he kept him on a leash, and during the battles he used other animals.  In one of the battles, one of the horses was killed.  This time, Alexander the Great saved his friend. </p><p>  Once, after all, the commander did not watch the horse, and he was abducted.  It happened in Persia.  Uxia, the local barbarians, stole Bucephalus.  Upon learning of this, Alexander threatened to wipe out the entire Uxian people from the face of the Earth if the horse was not returned.  Frightened by death, the thieves gave back the stolen, and Macedon himself, with joy for the successful outcome of this event, paid a ransom to the kidnappers. </p><h2>  The death of Bucephalus </h2>

    <p>  The death of the great horse was overgrown with no less legends than his life and adventures.  What was the name of the horse Alexander the Great, we found out, it remains to find out how he left this world.  There is evidence that Bucephalus died during the battle with the king of India, Por.  And other sources report the natural death of an animal in old age.  It also happened in India.  And at the place of his repose, Alexander ordered the construction of the city of the same name. </p>
