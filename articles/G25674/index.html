The platform was called Moneybux and had the address moneybox.com.  The creators of the platform positioned it as a reliable project, where you can earn good money.  To do this, it was only necessary to read letters, watch videos, register on other sites.  All this was supposed to provide a stable daily income.  And the majority believed, because many, especially novice Internet users, have no network experience;  newcomers are willing to follow the administrators of such business projects.  In addition, the level of payment for simple actions attracted many lovers of quick and easy money.

    <p>  As a rule, increased attention is focused on the main page of the site, so the developers have designed it as unobtrusive and inspiring user confidence.  The first step is to register, after which the beginner must gain access to the tasks.  But not everything is so simple: immediately after completing the first step (registration itself), a window appeared offering to activate the account and pass an anti-spam check.  To do this, it was necessary to send an SMS message with a code to a specific number.  At the same time, the cost of a text message ranged from 200 to 250 rubles (depending on the operator).  It is noteworthy that the information on the cost of this service was simply "forgotten" by the managers of the Moneybux site.  It often happened that the received code did not fit, and the newcomer was asked to send SMS again. </p><h2>  How was it proposed to earn project users? </h2><p>  Those who managed to register were redirected to the earnings search page, where they were offered to undergo training and start receiving money for simple, at first glance, actions.  So, the option ‚ÄúGet money for the survey‚Äù suggested paying remuneration for the opinions expressed.  For each completed questionnaire, the user of the site was guaranteed a payment of 200 rubles.  The most colorful heading - "Holiday Boom" - actually promised a "holiday all year round."  Various promotions were regularly covered here, where for each attracted client a reward of $ 25 was promised.  One way or another, all sections strongly motivated website visitors, as they promised good money for easy tasks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Payout in Moneybux project </h2>

    <p>  Moneybux project managers, reviews of which are given below, reported that the site works with various payment systems: Yandex-money, Qiwi, etc. But only ruble WebMoney wallet was available in the personal account.  There was also a ‚ÄúService Agreement‚Äù on the site, which regulated the relationship between the user and the site.  For example, according to the rules, the project provided both paid services and free ones, while their cost and appearance could be changed without notifying the performers.  The site had the right not to pay money if it was received as a payment for services, and the price of a daily subscription to content was 20 rubles.  True, this was reported at the very bottom in small print.  Alarmed by the lack of feedback and technical support, the familiar and necessary functions of any serious website. </p><h2>  Opinions about the Moneybux project: positive and negative reviews </h2><p>  Judging by the numerous opinions expressed on the open spaces of the network, this resource has invested quite good money in its advertising.  Many suggest that positive and sometimes enthusiastic opinions about the site were ‚Äúpaid for‚Äù by its administration.  One way or another, the Moneybux project, reviews of which are often diametrically opposed, has its adherents and opponents.  Here's what those who managed to make money on the site say: </p><ul><li>  some confirm that the project really helped to get a burdensome remote work; </li><li>  the site had a convenient interface and intuitive navigation, which is why even a novice registration was possible without much difficulty; </li><li>  It was always possible to get advice from other users; </li><li>  some were interested in becoming a member of the project. </li></ul>

    <p>  At the same time, there is an army of ardent opponents of the Moneybux project: reviews about the site of dissatisfied users urge others not to send SMS messages.  It is worth more to get acquainted with the opinions with a minus sign: </p><ul><li>  In the end, everyone came to the conclusion that the site is a peculiar way of fraud. </li><li>  Many simply took money from the phone, even when they sent SMS again, they did not receive the correct verification code. </li><li>  All claims to return the money were in vain.  The users simply had nowhere to write their complaints and complaints.  As mentioned above, there was no feedback. </li></ul><p>  The project is currently closed.  The domain name Moneybux.com no longer exists.  But the network has information that the developers of this fraud scheme simply registered a new project, deceiving newcomers who come to the network for easy money.  Now you know about the Moneybux project.  Reviews about the site are very mixed.  Therefore, be extremely careful: carefully evaluate your own abilities and remember that free cheese only happens in a mousetrap. </p>
