His middle name is the ‚ÄúBaltic Pearl‚Äù, and it fully justifies itself.  In ancient times, Klaipeda was called Memel, and it was the Prussian capital.  This fact is evidenced by many attractions.  Klaipeda (Lithuania) - a city in which during the Second World War most of the buildings and the fort were badly damaged.  Today the city is an important Lithuanian seaport, one of the largest ports of the Baltic Sea, which never freezes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Klaipeda attractions" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/475598.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Quite a bit of history </h2><p>  Klaipeda is one of the oldest cities in Lithuania.  Historical studies show that in the first century AD, the territory of this city was inhabited by the Balts - the ancestors of the Lithuanians.  In the thirteenth century, Klaipeda became an object of interest for the knights belonging to the Teutonic Order and the feudal lords of Germany.  They built a castle on the square of the modern city and became the founders of Memel.  Until 1525, this place belonged to its founders. </p>

    <p>  Then Memel at different times was in the hands of both Prussia and Sweden.  After the end of the <span>Seven Years War,</span> he returned to Prussia.  Many sights of Klaipeda, photos of which are in our article, have imprints of these times.  Memel in the early twenties of the last century found its modern owner - Lithuania.  The city received another name - Klaipeda. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General Attractions </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the city suffered great damage from World War II.  Therefore, only a few historical sights of Klaipeda have reached us.  So, in this list you can make the ruins of the castle on the <span>Curonian Spit,</span> belonging to the XVII-XVIII centuries, the quarters where there were stone warehouses, the buildings of the theater and the magistrate.  The city has Musical and Drama theaters.  Klaipeda, whose sights are not only ancient buildings, but also modern institutions, has an aquarium, the Lithuanian Maritime Museum and a dolphinarium. </p><p>  The aquarium was arranged in the building where the fort used to be.  Today this place offers its visitors performances, the main participants of which are <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãlions,</span> penguins, dolphins and seals.  At different times of the year, this institution operates at different hours.  The road to the museum will introduce guests to the ship built by Gintaras Paulenis - a local fisherman.  He was not a professional sailor, but, thanks to the old drawings of Newfoundland ships, he was able to create a landmark that is still admired to this day. </p><h2>  A bit about the museums of the city </h2>

The Maritime Museum deserves special attention.  Marine plants, animals, mammals and birds are represented here.  More than twenty thousand exhibits include a collection of corals and shells.  There is an ethnographic fisherman‚Äôs house in the museum.  It presents the life of a fishing village of 19-20 centuries.  And in the open territory the real ships and vessels rise.  On the road to the Maritime Museum is the very ship created by Paulenis.  Once he wanted to cross the <span>Baltic Sea</span> on it <span>,</span> but his dream was not destined to come true.  The Maritime Museum has a huge aquarium and dolphinarium, where specialists use dolphin therapy methods to improve the health of children with disabilities.

He settled in an amazing 19th century mansion.  Here objects gathered, with the help of which a person tried to determine the time in different eras: a fiery clock, a sundial, an hourglass, a water one, and a star one.  There are also mechanical watches manufactured at different times - from the 16th to the 19th century, modern products - electromechanical, electromagnetic, electronic and quartz time meters. </p><h2>  The main attraction of Klaipeda </h2>

Klaipeda, the sights of which, like most of its historical buildings, have experienced a lot during its life, this object is protected with special trepidation.  Prince of Lithuania Keitut in 1379 completely burned this architectural value.  But soon the castle was restored and diligently fortified.  In 1455, the building was captured by the Zemaitians, for some time it was under their control.  And five years later, the Memel Castle was rebuilt and strengthened according to new defense trends.  Such reconstructions and adversities more than once fell to the lot of this object.  During the Soviet Union, it was almost impossible to get into the castle, because this required special permission.  At the beginning of the twenty-first century, a museum was opened here.

    <h2>  From Vilnius to Klaipeda </h2><p>  The path of Klaipeda - Vilnius and Vilnius - Klaipeda will take you only three hours and twenty minutes (if you go by bus).  The traveler will have to overcome three hundred and thirteen kilometers.  You can also travel from the capital of Lithuania to the capital of attractions by car, train, minibus or fly by plane.  But, probably, the best way for such a trip is a trip by car.  This is the only way to carefully consider all the sights of such an ancient and great country as Lithuania. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Klaipeda Vilnius" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/475594.jpg" width="600"></div>
