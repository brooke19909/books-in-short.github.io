Most often used <span>in the sense of the</span> monarchical unity of several powers under the leadership of one ruler. </p><h2>  Classification of Agreements </h2><p>  The real union is the union that monarchies conclude, while at the same time adopting a single succession order to the throne.  The heir is the future monarch for all countries participating in the agreement.  Such a union - strong, reliable - can be terminated only if one of the participants changes the form of government to a republican one.  The abolition of monarchical power in one or in all member states entails the collapse of the union or a decrease in its quantitative composition. </p><p>  A personal union is an agreement that is entered into accidentally if one person becomes a monarch in several states as a result of his kinship with two or three rulers, or if necessary.  The succession procedure does not change or unify in the participating countries.  Such a union is doomed to decay.  Sooner or later, the candidate for the throne will reign in one state, and in another it may not be possible due to the nature of the law. </p><p>  Church Union - a type of agreement that is concluded between faiths.  The goals and causes of the union depend on historical circumstances. </p>

    <h2>  Union and confederation: what is the difference? </h2><p>  Often this form of association is equated with confederation.  It is worth noting that this identification is not correct. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First, a union can arise only with the participation of monarchist states.  This is its main feature.  As for the confederation, republican state formations may also join such a union. </p><p>  The existence of a union does not require close political or economic cooperation.  Allied arrangements are not binding.  The situation is different with the confederation.  By signing an agreement, its members have certain obligations to each other.  Union members do not lose <span>state sovereignty.</span>  A single monarch ruler increases his power.  After signing the union, he is the bearer of the sovereign rights of each country that is a member of the union. </p><p>  An important detail of the legal aspect of signing a confederation agreement is the existence of an agreement with the prescribed mutual obligations.  This guarantees political unity.  A union is a community that can be concluded without a treaty. </p><p>  An important feature concerns the conduct of hostilities between the parties to the agreement.  Union member states cannot fight each other, because the ruler is one, therefore, declaring war within the union, he undertakes to attack himself. </p><h2>  Political Unity and Dynastic Agreements </h2><p>  History knows many cases of the conclusion of such unions.  One of the earliest, most famous and significant - Krevskaya Union.  Lithuania and Poland are parties to the treaty.  Like many other unions, this was sealed by a dynastic marriage, which was concluded by the Polish Queen Jadwiga and the Grand Lithuanian Prince Jagiello. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The Union of 1385, signed at Krevo Castle, made certain changes to the structure of both participating countries. </p><p>  The reasons for the conclusion of the alliance are the weakening of both states and the pressure exerted on them from outside: by the Teutonic Order, Muscovy, and the Golden Horde.  Even before the Union of Krev, Lithuania signed several agreements with the Prince of Moscow and the Teutons, who were supposed to significantly influence the course of events, but were not implemented. </p><h2>  The essence of the contract in Krevo </h2><p>  According to the agreement, Jagiello became king of Poland.  This imposed a number of obligations on him: </p><ul><li>  The new ruler pledged to distribute the Latin alphabet in Lithuania. </li><li>  Jagiello was supposed to pay compensation to the Duke of Austria for violated prenuptial agreement, according to which the latter was to marry Jadwig. </li><li>  It was necessary to introduce Catholicism in Lithuania. </li><li>  Jagiello was to return to Poland the lands of the former Rus and to increase the territory of the kingdom.  The Union of Lithuania and Poland obliged him to increase the number of prisoners. </li></ul><p>  Simply put, Jagiello became the sole ruler for Lithuania and Poland, but at the same time the monetary system and the treasury, legislation, <span>customs rules</span> remained separate <span>,</span> there was a border, there were separate armies for each member state of the agreement.  The Krev Union caused disagreement on the part of the nobility of Lithuania and former Russia, but served as the basis for the union in Lublin.  The territory of Poland has increased. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Historical background of the Union of Lublin </h2><p>  Many years after the signing of the agreement, disputes between Lithuanians and the Polish gentry were held in Krevo for rights and the level of influence in the country.  In the process of increasing land ownership, the structure of the privileged estate in both countries also changed.  For two states, there were various features of the development of the feudal class: the <span>Polish gentry</span> was homogeneous, all its representatives were endowed with equal rights, and all differences were eliminated;  Lithuanian magnates - a polarized estate.  By "poles" are meant two types of nobility: </p><ul><li>  Large landowners (tycoons), who had almost unlimited rights and privileges.  They were not subject to local courts - only the trial of the Grand Duke.  In addition, they could occupy important positions in the state.  In addition to a huge amount of land, in their power were significant reserves of labor. </li><li>  Small and medium landowners.  They did not have such political and economic leverage as the first group (less land, labor, opportunities).  In addition, they often fell victim to the greed of the big magnates, because they depended on them. </li></ul><p>  For reasons of thirst for justice (or greater power and influence), representatives of the second group sought equality, which should have been among the gentry. </p><p>  But the problem was not only in the struggle of the magnates - the representatives of Poland and Lithuania could not always agree on common military campaigns, which made both states vulnerable.  The Polish elite was afraid to lose the lands of Lithuania, since Sigismund-Augustus, who was then in power, was the last representative of the Jagiellons - the change of monarchy could cause the separation of some territories. </p>

    <h2>  How did the Lithuanians and Poles agree? </h2><p>  The Union of Lublin is the first agreement between Poland and Lithuania, which was carefully planned as a constitutional act.  The main idea was the incorporation of Lithuania into Poland.  For a long time negotiations were held that were supposed to resolve all inaccuracies. </p><p>  The unification union of 1569 was to be signed during the winter Polish-Lithuanian Diet.  Negotiations were difficult, unity could not be achieved.  The reason for the crisis was the demands of the Lithuanian side: the coronation was to take place in Vilna, the ruler had to be elected only in the general Sejm, and in Lithuania only local natives should occupy the state ranks.  Poland could not accept such demands.  In addition, the Lithuanians, dissatisfied with what was happening, left the Sejm. </p><p>  But they had to return soon and continue negotiations.  There were many reasons that led Lithuania to seek support from Poland: </p><ul><li>  The country lost a lot during the Livonian War. </li><li>  Discontent of landowners was growing in the state. </li><li>  Lithuania was at war with the Moscow kingdom, in which it was not the strongest side. </li></ul><p>  To quickly ‚Äúpersuade‚Äù the Lithuanians, the <span>Polish king</span> annexed Volyn and the Podlaskie Voivodeship and threatened to take away privileges from the apostates.  Everyone gathered in Poland again.  The Lithuanian side swore allegiance to Sigismund-Augustus.  Again she began to prepare for the signing of the union.  Poland had high hopes for this agreement. </p><h2>  Agreement signing </h2>

    <p>  The Saeima resumed work in June 1569, and on the first day of July, the participants entered into an alliance.  The Union of Lublin proclaimed the formation of a single state of the Commonwealth.  The ambassadors of Lithuania and Poland solemnly signed an agreement.  After 3 days, the king further confirmed the agreement. </p><p>  However, the adoption of the union did not solve all the problems, and the Sejm continued.  Certain issues were resolved within a month after the formal signature and ratification procedure.  The task of distribution of powers was solved, a diet consisting of two chambers was created.  Union consolidated what was started by the Krevsky agreement. </p><p>  The main ideas of the union in Lublin: </p><ul><li>  The state should have a single ruler - the king, who was elected by the Sejm. </li><li>  The monetary system, the Senate and the Sejm were common to the Polish and Lithuanian territories. </li><li>  Equal rights Polish and Lithuanian gentry. </li><li>  Lithuania has retained part of the symbols of its statehood - the press, coat of arms, army, administration. </li></ul><h2>  Results of the Lublin Agreement </h2><p>  The Lithuanians managed to preserve the language, the legislative system and a number of signs of statehood.  Poland increased its influence and increased the size of its territories.  The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has been a strong adversary on the world stage for several centuries.  In addition, it was possible to spread Catholicism and create a cultural Polish community. </p><p>  The negative aspects were the proliferation of the bureaucratic apparatus and the increase in corruption.  The election of the king gave rise to an active struggle within the Sejm, which over the course of several centuries led the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to collapse. </p><p>  Negative traits are most fully manifested in matters of religion.  The <span>population of Lithuania</span> did not have the opportunity to choose faith - Catholicism was imposed almost by force.  Orthodoxy was prohibited.  Opponents of Catholicism were "outlawed" - they were deprived of all rights, were persecuted.  In the Ukrainian territories, which were under the rule of the Commonwealth, fraternal schools began to emerge. </p><p>  And at the same time, the gentry was equalized in rights, reforms were carried out in the political, legislative, economic spheres.  So the consequences of the Union of Lublin cannot be unambiguously assessed. </p>

    <h2>  Church conventions </h2><p>  The history of Christianity knows many attempts to restore the integrity of religion.  Recall that as a result of the split in 1054, Catholicism and Orthodoxy formed.  They became separate branches of Christianity.  Almost at the same time, the first attempts were made by the union - unification. </p><p>  Catholicism and Orthodoxy have different traditions and rites.  They could not reach agreement.  The main reason is the refusal of the Orthodox to submit to the Pope.  Catholics could not accept the conditions put forward by opponents: the Orthodox demanded that the Pope renounce supremacy in the <span>church hierarchy.</span> </p><p>  Over the years, Orthodoxy has weakened, and the support of Catholicism in the fight against various threats was needed.  In 1274, the Lyon Agreement was signed, aimed at a common struggle against the Tatar-Mongol, and in 1439 - the Union of Florence.  This time the alliance was directed against the Turks.  These agreements were short-lived, but the "union movement" was gaining more and more fans. </p><h2>  Background of the Brest Union </h2><p>  The Union of Brest is an agreement that has generated a new denomination and has been controversial for many centuries. </p>

    <p>  In the 16th century, the Orthodox Church could not be called a model of morality and spirituality - it was in a serious crisis.  The emergence of the patronage tradition, when the temple was actually the property of the patron tycoon, introduced many secular features to the religion.  Even bourgeoisie intervened in the affairs of the church.  This refers to fraternities - urban organizations that had the right to control even bishops.  The church has lost its influence and reputation as a defender of the rights of believers. </p><p>  The Uniate movement resumed due to the intensification of the Jesuits in Poland.  Polemic texts about the benefits of the union appear.  Their authors were preachers and philosophers - Benedict Herbest, Peter Skarga and many others. </p><p>  The Uniates became more active after the ‚Äúcalendar reform‚Äù of Gregory XIII - as a result, the religious holidays of the Orthodox and Catholics diverged in time.  This infringed on the rights of the Orthodox population living in the Commonwealth. </p><p>  As a result of the complex influence of these reasons, the Brest Union was signed. </p><h2>  Essence of the agreement </h2><p>  In 1590, a church congress was held in the city of Belz.  At it, Gideon Balaban made a call to conclude a union.  His initiative was supported by many bishops.  After 5 years, the need for union was recognized by the <span>Pope.</span> </p><p>  The Berestey Union was to be signed in 1596.  But the feud does not stop.  The congress, which had gathered to sign the treaty, split.  One part was made by fans of Orthodoxy, the other - Uniates.  The stumbling block was the need to obey the Pope.  Ultimately, only a part of the meeting signed the union.  The Orthodox clergy did not recognize the union.  The signing of the contract took place under the leadership of Metropolitan Mikhail Rogoza. </p>

    <p>  Conditions: </p><ul><li>  Uniates recognized submission to the Pope. </li><li>  The clergy had equal rights with Catholic church hierarchs. </li><li>  The dogmas of faith are Catholic, the rites are Orthodox. </li></ul><p>  Thus, the result of the attempt at unification was an even greater split.  On the basis of Orthodoxy and Catholicism, another faith appeared.  Now the Uniate was imposed by force - the Orthodox found themselves in an even worse situation than before the Berestey (Brest) agreement. </p><p>  Finally, we add: union is a factor of unification, but, as historical facts show, the union has not always benefited all parties involved. </p>
