  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Unusual animals: forest cat</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cats are associated primarily with pets, it is hard to imagine that they can survive without problems away from human housing.  However, this is a fact.  For example, a forest cat feels great in the wild, and its brethren populate northern Asia, Europe and Africa.  Most representatives of this species are listed in international and regional Red Books.  For example, the Far Eastern forest cat, similar to a mini-leopard, and the wild steppe, living in the Kazakh steppes. </p><p>  <strong>Appearance</strong> </p><p>  These are medium-sized animals, similar to their domestic counterparts.  The color of the forest cat is brownish-brown or gray, with black stripes or spots.  Average weight - from three to eight kilograms, height - about 35 cm, length - 40-70 cm, tail - about 30 cm, thick and as if chopped off at the end.  In the European part, larger representatives, for example a <span>reed cat, which</span> can weigh up to 18 kg.  African <span>wild cats</span> are usually smaller and brighter. </p><p>  <strong>Habitat</strong> </p><p>  Forest cat most often settles in places where there are many hares, small mammals and birds, nesting on the ground.  Most often these are deaf sections of <span>mixed and broad-leaved forest,</span> reed and reed beds along rivers.  In the mountains of wild cats can be found on rocky sites at an altitude of 3000 meters above sea level. </p><p>  <strong>Habits</strong> </p><p>  Like all members of the family, a <span>wild forest cat</span> predominantly leads a nocturnal lifestyle.  He can hunt during the day, preferring cloudy weather.  Favorite time for hunting - at dawn or a few hours before sunset.  A forest cat tracks the prey in an ambush, then it sneaks up inaudibly and catches its victim in a few jumps.  Outwardly, it resembles the hunt of domestic cats, but the movements of wild cats are more accurate, sharp and fast. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For one night of hunting this animal can catch and eat about a dozen rodents with a total weight of up to half a kilogram. </p><p>  Sometimes a forest cat can accidentally attack a weasel, ermine, ferret.  However, this is fraught with the fact that marten, defending themselves, can strangle their unlucky pursuer. </p><p>  In addition, <span>wild cats have</span> many natural enemies.  They are hunted by foxes, wolves, jackals.  True, catching forest cats, as well as domestic cats, is quite difficult, since they are perfectly saved on the highest branches of trees. </p><p>  Forest cat prefers loneliness.  In a flock, these animals almost never go astray. </p><p>  In the afternoon, they sleep in their den, which can become a hollow in a tree or an abandoned hole in some animal.  Mountain wild cats live in crevices of rocks or between stones. </p><p>  In the cold season, the forest cat tries to stay close to human habitation in order to get its own food.  They often climb into houses, attacking domestic chickens and ducks, but also bring benefits, exterminating harmful rodents. </p><p>  <strong>Breeding</strong> </p><p>  Under natural conditions, a forest cat actively breeds in early spring.  To do this, the male comes to the territory where the female lives, and begins to attract her attention by hissing, a low-frequency meow and howling.  Several males can wage fierce battles for their lady of heart, expelling an opponent from conquered territory. </p><p>  Forest cat pregnancy lasts 9-10 weeks.  During this time, she prepares a nest for her future offspring, lining it with feathers, down and grass.  Toward the end of spring, up to seven blind kittens are born.  Their development is similar to the development of domestic species.  At about one and a half months they already leave the mink or nest to get acquainted with the surrounding territory.  Cat-mother vigilantly watches them and always protects from danger.  In such periods, she is not afraid to attack even a fox. </p><p>  At the end of summer, kittens are ready for independent living.  They leave their family in search of their own piece of land. </p>
