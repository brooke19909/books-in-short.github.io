Guest house "Love" and other inexpensive pensions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you still think that vacationing on the Black Sea coast is expensive, we recommend that you read our article.  Of course, Sochi or Yalta are not the most budget resorts, but there are many more options for relaxing here than you could imagine.  In particular, on the shore there is a small village called Kabardinka.  Guest house "Love" is just one of many boarding houses that welcome their guests every year.  We noticed it, because we found a lot of positive reviews from grateful customers.  And since on the eve of the summer season I want to write only about the best, the choice was made. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kabardinka guest house love" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1150802.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Kabardinka</span> Village <span>: entertainment</span> and <span>leisure</span> opportunities </h2><p>  Do you want to relax on the <span>Cote d'Azur,</span> under the hot sun, so that you are surrounded by peace and quiet, and comfort and order reigned in the hotel room?  If so, then Kabardinka is waiting for you.  Guest house "Love" is one of the most popular here, and this is not surprising.  This is a real island of comfort and warmth in the midst of the bustle of fashionable Black Sea resorts.  Many who have been here once say that they had a complete feeling that they were at home, and this is not surprising.  Unlike large hotels, small pensions always try to surround guests with attention.  The hotel’s private beach will allow you to completely forget about the coast clogged with vacationers, which means that the harmony of your holiday will not be disturbed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kabardinka hotel love" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1150801.jpg" width="600"></div>

Guest House “Love” is a family-type hotel where everything is designed for a relaxing holiday and relaxation.  There are no noisy companies and discos, and time is running leisurely and measuredly.  Many of those who come here for the first time become regular visitors.  Every year, Kabardinka attracts them again and again.  Hotel "Love" is a budget option with excellent conditions. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  It’s hard to find better places.  If you rest here, then the whole Kabardinka opens in front of you.  Guest House "Love" (the price will be indicated below) is located in the center of the village.  Near the hotel there is a shop and a barbecue.  Just 15 minutes from the sea and the beach, the promenade and the entertainment center.  10 minutes from the hotel - the city center, there are shops and ATMs, a market.  Surely your children will want to visit a stunning water park.  Then welcome to Gelendzhik, you will find the "Golden Bay".  Awesome water park, which is only 15 minutes by shuttle bus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kabardinka guest house love Price" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1150793.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  You will be surprised how comfortable conditions Kabardinka meets you.  Guest houses here can compete with the best resorts in the country.  All numbers (2, 3 and 4-seater) are equipped with conveniences.  This is a shower and toilet, washbasin.  Each room has a refrigerator and TV, free Wi-Fi is available.  The hotel has a kitchen where you can cook your own food, but there are so many different cafes and canteens around that few people take this opportunity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kabardinka guest houses" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1150804.jpg" width="600"></div>

Judge for yourself: for 10 days of relaxation in a magnificent hotel you will give 6,100 rubles for a quadruple room, or 7,800 rubles for a triple room, or 7,500 for a double room (per person).  You pay when booking a ticket immediately for the entire time.  Check-in at 12:00, and check-out at 8:00 on the day of departure.  The price includes accommodation and insurance.  In addition, you will need to pay for the road, you can get here by train or bus. </p><h2>  Other cheap pensions in Kabardinka </h2><p>  Despite the fact that “Love” is considered one of the best hotels, it is far from the only one.  I would like to recommend the guest house “Prague”.  It has a very favorable location and access to a pebble beach, which is usually not too crowded.  All rooms in the hotel are made in modern European design.  It is also attractive that there is a cozy courtyard around the hotel, where your children can safely play.  The cost of rest in a standard triple room is 1100 rubles.  Payment is per room per day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="inexpensive vacation in kabardinka" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1150805.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Guest house "Snow White" </h2><p>  Only 7 minutes from the sea is this cozy hotel.  It is equipped with modern rooms with all amenities, an excellent kitchen, and in the courtyard there are two excellent playgrounds where kids will have fun playing all their free time.  The direction of the hotel is first of all a family vacation, therefore smoking and drinking alcohol are prohibited here.  For noisy youth companies, there are other hotels where music is booming and groovy discos are held.  Here the rest is more measured.  The cost of living in a two-room suite is from 2000 rubles per day (price per room).  At the same time, the number is designed for 5 seats, so it is suitable even for a large family. </p><h2>  Guest House "Acropolis" </h2><p>  Located in the center of the resort town, which means it has all the advantages of the hotels described above.  Only 5 minutes separates it from the city beach, that is, from the windows you can hear the surf.  The choice of vacationers offers economy class rooms and suites.  All the amenities in the rooms, a constant supply of cold and hot water.  Just a minute away you are separated from dining rooms and cafes, restaurants, parks.  And most of all, the magnificent huge arbor, drowning in flowers and vines, attracts attention.  In its shadow is a cozy courtyard.  The cost of renting rooms starts from 750 rubles per person per day. </p><p>  About Kabardinka you can talk endlessly.  This is a magnificent resort town, which is notable for low prices and excellent service.  Here you can have a great time with the whole family, enjoy the peace and quiet, the sea and the sun. </p>
