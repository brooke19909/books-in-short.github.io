  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Political fragmentation of Russia: background, consequences</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the twelfth century, Kievan Rus collapsed into separate, independent principalities, but formally a single state still continued to exist until the period of the Tatar-Mongol invasion.  The time from the 12th to the 16th centuries is considered to be a period of political <span>fragmentation (feudal) of</span> Russia. </p><p>  <strong>Political fragmentation of Russia: prerequisites</strong> </p><p>  There is still a debate among modern historians about what has become the true reason for the division of a single strong state into several smaller and more fragmented ones.  It is believed that the emergence of local boyars played a paramount role in the historical process.  The princes, ruling certain Russian lands, no longer wanted to share their income with the Prince of Kiev, but the local boyars, as never before, needed strong local power, so it actively supported their position. </p><p>  In addition, at the turn of the 11-12th centuries, a system of production of consumer goods was formed, the structural unit of which became a separate patrimony.  Over time, such estates, available in different parts of the country, begin to produce products only for their own consumption, but not for sale.  As a result, the exchange of goods between the lands of a single state practically ceases.  Each territory under the control of an individual prince becomes fully autonomous and has the possibility of a prosperous existence without the support of neighboring lands. </p><p>  <span>A sedentary lifestyle, the</span> development of arable farming led to an increase in the power of local warriors.  Gradually vigilantes turn into landowners who are interested in making their possessions completely independent of state laws.  In this regard, a system of so-called immunities is being developed, according to which the boyar-landowners received complete independence from the Grand Duke, became full owners of their possessions, had the right to establish certain laws on their territory.  Hence the conclusion suggests itself that the political fragmentation of Russia was a consequence of the development of private land ownership and the transition of combatants to a settled way of life.  By the middle of the 12th century, on the basis of a single state that existed several decades ago, about fifteen independent principalities took shape.  The number of lands independent of Kiev is growing at an enormous rate, and by the <span>14th century</span> reaches two hundred and fifty.  The largest state formations of this period of time are the <span>Novgorod Republic, the</span> Galicia-Volyn, Vladimir-Suzdal principalities.  Each such principality is completely independent and independent of others, has its own monetary unit, a separate army, etc.  Relations between the heads of all lands are regulated on the basis of agreements and traditions.  <span>Civil wars,</span> if any, are very rare, at the heart of them is the desire to expand their lands at the expense of the territories of the neighboring principality. </p><p>  <strong>Political fragmentation of Russia: consequences</strong> </p><p>  The main consequences of the political fragmentation of Kievan Rus were: <strong><br></strong> </p><ul><li>  the development of new lands for growing grain, the development of peasant farming; </li><li>  strengthening the power of the church, its influence on the cultural life of the country; </li><li>  folding a clear system of feudal hierarchy. </li></ul><p>  The development of agriculture, the rapid growth of cities, the entry of individual <span>Russian principalities</span> into the foreign policy arena, the development of architecture, and chronicles ‚Äî these are the consequences of the feudal fragmentation of Russia.  In addition, the complete political disintegration of the state did not take place.  The power of the Kiev princes has always existed, albeit very ghostly.  The Orthodox faith throughout the entire period of fragmentation united the people of all Russian principalities, the leadership of the entire church organization was in the hands of the Kiev Metropolitan.  Before the external danger, the Kiev prince acted as a single defender of the Russian state.  The political fragmentation of Russia became an important stage in the development of the state on the path to its future centralization, political and economic take-off. </p>
