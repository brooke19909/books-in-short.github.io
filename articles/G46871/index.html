In the twentieth century, the tower was completely restored.  Today it houses an ethnological gallery.  A trip to the ancient docks of a shipyard is also fascinating.  Docks go deep underground - 40 meters.  They could hide a number of ships. <br><br>  Almost all travelers are attracted to the caves known throughout the resort: Damlatas, Fosforla Magara, Kizlar Magarasi.

As souvenirs to friends, you can bring colored pumpkins (a sign of Alanya) or handmade products, which are abundantly presented in local shops and design studios. <br><br>  It is no coincidence that Alanya is so adored by many travelers.

    <p>  More than one review of the hotel indicates that this is a worthy place to stay in Alanya.  The hotel complex is located on the first line of the beach.  To get to the sea, you need to overcome only 200 meters.  During this short journey you can enjoy the picturesque scenery.  The hotel's beach is equipped according to all conditions of comfort, there are umbrellas, deck chairs and towels.  All this is free, or rather included in the room price. </p><p>  Of course, one of the main advantages of the Grand Kaptan Hotel 5 * hotel is the beach.  But far from the whole spectrum of water entertainment is presented here. </p><p>  Guests can visit the water park, on the territory of the hotel complex there are several pools with water slides.  The administration also took care of the children by creating special children's pools, the water in which is always warm and constantly filtered. </p><h2>  Service Reviews </h2>
