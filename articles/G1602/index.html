  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Agritourism is rural tourism: types and forms, routes, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Agritourism is a type of tourism that involves relaxing in the wilderness, away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  Tourists are invited to alternate difficult peasant labor and a relaxing outdoor recreation.  Agrotourism is not a synonym for downshifting, because downshifting is a renunciation of all the benefits of civilization, and agritourists can use all the necessary amenities (TV, phone, Internet).  Consider this popular area in more detail in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vtv.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Agritourism in Russia" class="if uuid-2486093" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66686/2486093.jpg"></div><h2>  The benefits of agritourism </h2><p>  To retire in silence in perfect harmony with nature is the dream of any person who is tired of the fast pace of urban life.  You can at least temporarily forget about work, daily duties, public transport, traffic jams, crowds, queues. </p><p>  Many agritourists are attracted by the opportunity to get in touch with the life, culture, folklore and traditions of their country, which are still preserved in the villages. </p><p>  In countries such as Spain and Italy, lovers of rural tourism are happy to help locals do winegrowing.  And in Poland, agro-tourists take care of horses and take part in horseback riding.  In Germany, farmers offer guests to stay in the role of shepherds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The emergence and development of agritourism </h2><p>  Today agritourism is a dynamically developing kind of tourism.  It originates at the beginning of the XIX century, but only last 60 years has become popular. </p><p>  In France, the world's first agrotourism association was even created.  Ten years ago, a similar organization was created in Italy.  Now in many European countries there are associations of agritourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="redscarabtravelandmedia.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="agritourism is" class="if uuid-2486071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66686/2486071.jpg"></div><h2>  Development reasons </h2><p>  The reasons for the development of rural tourism are social and economic factors.  For the economy, agritourism is important as additional income and support for farmers who, with the development of large cities, have lost their attractiveness and, consequently, income.  Now, in this way, farmers got the opportunity to earn money. </p><p>  Those tourists who refuse the idea of ​​spending their holidays in a hotel by the sea, but want active and non-traditional relaxation, often choose rural tourism.  Not for everyone, a vacation is a beach, shopping and noisy parties.  Many people, tired of life in the metropolis, crave just to relax in nature in peace and quiet, breathe fresh air and eat natural products. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The essence of agritourism </h2><p>  Agritourism - rest in the village, suggesting the possibility of working in the garden or in the garden.  Naturally, the agritourist is not obliged to engage in peasant labor if he himself does not want to.  But precisely thanks to such activities, he will be able to feel complete unity with nature and escape from urban worries and obsessions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.co.cr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rural tourism" class="if uuid-2486115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66686/2486115.jpg"></div><h2>  About features of agritourism </h2><p>  In addition to rest and work, rural tourists are offered natural fresh products.  Contrary to the current misconception that the agritourist must give up the benefits of civilization and eat what he collects, the agritourist is offered a comfortable rest in very good conditions, the Internet, and local restaurants. </p><h2>  Agritourism in Russia </h2><p>  The direction was most developed in European countries: Spain, Italy, Poland, Norway, Germany and Belarus. </p><p>  In Russia, agritourism is still in its infancy.  This is due to the fact that the creation of comfortable living conditions, the creation of farmsteads and agro-hotels, the restoration of old buildings require tremendous costs.  But despite this, in some regions of our country conditions have been created for agritourism.  Those farms that are located near large, densely populated cities are in great demand. </p><p>  The Crimean region of the Krasnodar Territory is known for its winery with the name "Lefkadia Valley".  A trip to Lefkadia is a great example of agritourism.  This is a favorite place for Russian agritourists.  Here they can join the intricacies of viticulture and winemaking, as well as treat themselves to artisanal cheese, hunt and fish.  Tourists participate in a variety of thematic events, such as collecting lavender.  Lavender tours take place in the last month of summer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lido-hotel.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="agritourism examples" class="if uuid-2486135" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66686/2486135.jpg"></div><h2>  Russian gastronomic tours </h2><p>  A particularly popular form of agritourism is a gastronomic tour.  These are tastings, master classes, as well as excursions to farms.  In Russia, there are several wonderful farms that are highly rated by agritourists. </p><p>  One of them is Bogdarnya, which is located in the Vladimir region.  It is a complete complex: a hotel, restaurants, a shop, stables and farms.  Here they are engaged in the production of yogurt, cheeses (gouda, Philadelphia, ricotta), they breed bulls, guided by Dutch technology. </p><p>  Zaoksky district of the Tula region has everything you need for a healthy family vacation: farms, country hotels, old estates, village restaurants and workshops.  Mark and Leo is Russia's first Lokavorsky restaurant.  Lockery is eating only locally grown foods.  A visit to the restaurant is recommended to be combined with excursions to the estate estates, museums, a workshop on baking bread, tasting craft beer, as well as fishing and horseback riding. </p><p>  Compound "Lukino" is also located in the Tula region.  They are engaged in the production of meat and poultry, growing vegetables, making dairy products and canned goods.  The farm has a mini-hotel and a wonderful home restaurant. </p><p>  In the Tver region, agritourists prefer to visit the cheese factory Pietro Mazzi.  They cook cheese, guided by old recipes, prepare Italian delicacies, engage in sheep farming, conduct excursions for tourists, combining acquaintance with the farm and tasting.  The farm has a shop and an inn. </p><h2>  In Belarus </h2><p>  In Belarus, agritourism is a field that has gained popularity.  In this country there are about a thousand farmsteads!  Belarusian rural tourism began its development in 2004. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="agritourism reviews" class="if uuid-2486142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66686/2486142.jpg"></div><p>  The most popular Belarusian farmstead is Komarovo, located in the village of Komarovo.  Park, bathhouse, pancake steadily attract people.  Tourists leaving feedback on agritourism in the village of Komarovo are pleased with the local nature, entertainment and service. </p><h2>  Features of agritourism in Spain </h2><p>  In European countries, revenues from this area significantly replenish the state treasury.  Therefore, the authorities see the point in its development.  In Spain, cozy farmhouses are ready to receive visitors, and old estates have become rural hotels.  The friendly hosts offer guests food, overnight, acquaintance with original local folklore and historical events, participation in various festivals and festivities.  Rural residents are happy to tell legends, tales and beliefs, conduct tours of the sights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="viaggi.nanopress.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="types of agritourism" class="if uuid-2486124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66686/2486124.jpg"></div><h2>  In France </h2><p>  France is one of the first countries in the world to develop rural tourism.  The result is impressive.  The income from agritourism here amounts to billions of dollars. </p><p>  In addition to overnight stays and food, French farmers offer agro-tourists an interesting program that includes such activities as fishing, an excursion to the wine cellars or a cheese factory, trips to nearby castles, and fascinating horseback riding.  Agritourists will not have to be bored.  They will have a rich rest and a lot of unforgettable impressions. </p>
