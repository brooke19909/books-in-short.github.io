Russia, also a member of the coalition of anti-German powers, earlier, in 1918, entered into a <span>separate peace</span> with Germany (according to the Brest Peace Treaty), therefore, it did not participate either in the Paris Peace Conference or in the signing of the Versailles Treaty.  It is for this reason that Russia, which suffered huge human <span>losses in the First World War,</span> not only did not receive any compensation (indemnity), but also lost part of its original territory (some regions of Ukraine and Belarus).

    <p>  Treaty of Versailles </p><p>  The main provision of the Treaty of Versailles is the unconditional recognition <span>of Germany</span> ‚Äôs <span>guilt</span> in "causing war."  In other words, Germany was fully responsible for fueling the global European conflict.  The result was unprecedented sanctions.  The total indemnities paid by the German side to the victorious powers amounted to 132 million marks in gold (in 1919 prices). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="terms of the Versailles peace treaty" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10411/7000.jpg" width="400"></div>  The last payments were made in 2010, so Germany was fully able to pay off the ‚Äúdebts‚Äù of the First World War only after 92 years.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Germany suffered very painful territorial losses.  All <span>German colonies</span> were divided between the countries of the Entente (anti-German coalition).  Part of the original continental German lands was also lost: Lorraine and Alsace went to France, East Prussia to Poland, Gdansk (Danzig) was recognized as a free city. </p><p>  The Treaty of Versailles contained detailed requirements aimed at demilitarizing Germany and preventing the re-ignition of a military conflict.  The German army was significantly reduced (up to 100,000).  The German military industry actually had to cease to exist.  In addition, the requirement for the demilitarization of the Rhine zone was separately spelled out - Germany was forbidden to concentrate troops and military equipment there.  The Treaty of Versailles included a clause on the creation of the League of Nations, an international organization similar in function to the modern UN. </p><p>  The influence of the Treaty of Versailles on German economy and society </p>

    <p>  The terms of the Versailles Peace Treaty were unreasonably harsh and harsh, <span>the German economy</span> could not withstand them.  The direct consequence of the fulfillment of the draconian requirements of the treaty was the complete destruction of <span>German industry, the</span> total impoverishment of the population and the monstrous hyperinflation. </p><p>  In addition, the offensive peace agreement touched such a sensitive, albeit immaterial substance, as national identity.  The Germans felt not only ruined and robbed, but also wounded, unjustly punished and offended.  German society readily accepted the most extreme nationalist and revanchist ideas;  this is one of the reasons that the country, just 20 years ago with grief in half, ending one global military conflict, easily got involved in the next.  But the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, which was supposed to prevent potential conflicts, not only did not fulfill its purpose, but also to some extent contributed to the fomentation of World War II. </p>
