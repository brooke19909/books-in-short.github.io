    <p>  This is a country of extraordinary beauty.  Its diverse natural landscapes, extraordinary snow-white slopes of the Alpine mountains, magnificent sandy beaches, pristine lakes are simply amazing. </p><p>  This is a museum country.  In every city there are as many attractions as there are not in some countries.  Venice is an amazing <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãon the water,</span> Milan is a recognized center of world fashion, and of course, the Eternal City is Rome.  This is a country from which I do not want to leave, but when I leave, I want to return as soon as possible. </p><p>  However, amazing cities are far from all of Italy.  No less beautiful are its islands.  Our compatriots are well known for Ischia, Sardinia, Elba, Capri, and of course, Sicily.  Each island is beautiful in its own way, but today's talk will be about Sicily. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  It is the largest <span>island in Italy.</span>  Even in its location, Sicily is unique.  The map shows that it is located between Africa and Europe, washed by the Ionian, Tyrrhenian and Mediterranean Seas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  From the history of the island </h2><p>  The extremely favorable position on the Mediterranean routes has led to numerous conquests of the island over many years. </p><p>  This is a very ancient region, and in its history left a trace of the culture of many peoples.  At first it was conquered by the Greeks, later by the Vandals, Normans, Arabs, Byzantines.  The conquerors changed, but a particle of their spirit remained on the island.  This is evidenced by various monuments of architecture and art. </p><h2>  Cities of Sicily </h2><p>  The capital of the island is magnificent Palermo.  The Phoenicians used to call him Zyz, which means "Flower."  And today Palermo is the personification of love for culture, art and history.  Tourists from all over the world come here to walk along elegant streets and squares, walk through numerous shops and boutiques, visit unique cathedrals, world famous theaters and museums.  This city can not leave anyone indifferent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sicily on the map" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/457669.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the suburbs of the capital is the town of Corleone.  It is known for its ancient St. Martin's Cathedral, built in the distant 1382, and the three-nave church, which preserved the organ of the seventeenth century and the font of the fifteenth century.  No less than these historical sights of tourists are attracted to the bar located near the Cathedral, because it contains photographs from the filming of the legendary film ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main resort cities of Sicily are Taormina, which belongs to the administrative center of Messina, and Cefalu (province of Palermo).  The main reason for the popularity of these cities is the luxurious beaches and first-class hotels. </p><p>  Taormina is famous for its medieval palaces, squares, churches.  Sicily, whose sights are truly unique, is proud of the Roman Odeon, which is located behind the Church of St. Caterina and the Greek amphitheater, located on Mount Tauro in this city.  I would like to draw your attention to the stunning views of the sea and the famous Etna volcano from this place. </p><p>  At the foot of it is another very beautiful city - Catania.  In 1669, it was almost completely flooded with lava after a <span>volcanic eruption.</span>  The most powerful earthquake of 1693 finally destroyed Catania.  Despite all the troubles, local residents were able to rebuild their city.  They used frozen lava as a building material.  Today it is a modern city that attracts tourists with its attractions - an amphitheater, Roman theater, Odeon and others. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Every year, millions of tourists come to Italy.  Many of them are attracted to Sicily.  Excursions around the island are conducted by many travel agencies.  But if you arrived on the island on your own, and not as part of an organized group, then you can book a tour with an individual Russian-speaking guide.  He organizes trips to interesting places that are somewhat removed from the "trodden" hiking trails.  It is possible to organize individual shopping tours, etc. For this you need to contact the INWIP association, which will provide you with a highly professional guide. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cities of sicily" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/457668.jpg" width="550"></div>

As you already know, the largest island in Italy is Sicily.  Attractions are in each of its provinces, in any locality. </p><h2>  Royal Norman Palace </h2><p>  In Sicilian Palermo has its own main attraction - the residence of the kings.  If you look at it from the west side, you will see a real fortress, and if from the south - a typical building made in the Renaissance style.  At one time, the Norman Palace housed the royal residence.  In addition, in Palermo you can see the Cathedral of the Assumption of Our Lady.  By decree of King William the Second, it was built in the twelfth century.  Today in his exposition are sarcophagi of emperors and kings of the Norman dynasty.  In Palermo you can see the famous exhibition of mummies - the Catacombs of Capuchins. </p><h2>  Messina - Attractions </h2><p>  In this city is the oldest cathedral of which Sicily is proud.  Sights of the XII century are represented by the Duma Cathedral, designed in the Norman style.  On the bell tower you can see the largest <span>astronomical clock of the</span> eighteenth century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sicily tours" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/457667.jpg" width="468"></div>

    <h2>  Province of Agrigento </h2><p>  Here you can see a unique park - the Valley of the Temples.  On its territory are the tomb of Theron, Temple of Hercules, Temple of Concord, Temple of Hera.

In the fourteenth century, the Parliament of Sicily sat in this building. </p><p>  The small town of Catania is known all over the world thanks to the largest volcano in Europe - Etna.

    <h2>  Volcano in sicily </h2><p>  A certain part of tourists coming to this famous Italian island arrive with their own eyes to see the legendary volcano Etna. </p><p>  The ancient Greeks were firmly convinced that the forge of God Hephaestus was located in the vent of the volcano.  That is why he was called Aitna, which translates as "fiery mountain." </p><p>  Its height is three thousand five hundred and fifty meters, its area is one thousand two hundred and fifty square meters.  The eruptions formed more than four hundred craters.  Once every three months, an eruption of lava occurs. </p><p>  By car, you can climb to a height of one thousand nine hundred meters and see the extinct Sylvester crater. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sicily Attractions Map" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/457665.jpg" width="550"></div>

This is perhaps one of the most popular resorts of Sicily, which is located on the slopes of Mount Tauro. </p><p>  You can see the villa Del Casale.  Its appearance dates back to the fourth century BC.  and today is protected by UNESCO. </p><p>  Of course, many tourists will be interested in shopping at the Sicilian Village outlet.
