What does ornithology do?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the ranking of the most <span>interesting professions,</span> undoubtedly, the work of an ornithologist should be present.  Ornithologist - who is it?  What does he do?  What does the science of ornithology study?  We are sure to find answers to all these questions. </p><h2>  What kind of science is ornithology </h2><p>  Ornithology is one of the branches of zoology that studies birds.  The object of study of this science is the physiology of birds, their morphology, systematics, and their distribution over territories.  In simple words, ornithology is the science of birds. </p><p>  The first ornithological studies were carried out in the fourth century <span>BC.</span>  The founder of the doctrine of birds is considered to be the ancient Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle.  It was in his writings that the anatomical structure of birds and their simplest classification were first described. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bird watcher who is it" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31700/746724.jpg" width="532"></div>

    <p>  The activities of ornithologists are very diverse.  Research on this science includes: </p><ul><li>  quantification of bird populations; </li><li>  determination of their varieties based on physiological characteristics; </li><li>  classifications (taxonomy); </li><li>  study of the geography of settlements of different species of birds; </li><li>  determination of migratory routes of migratory birds; </li><li>  organization of work to protect rare and endangered species of birds and increase their populations. </li></ul><h2>  Ornithologist - who is it? </h2><p>  As we were able to notice, ornithology is a natural science based entirely on communication with nature.  From the definition of the <span>subject of science,</span> it is easy to guess that an ornithologist studies birds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The work of an ornithologist is associated with constant observation.  People in this profession study birds in different environments.  It can be natural conditions - forests, meadow expanses, groves, where birds live in close proximity to nature.  Ornithological studies also concern birds that have adapted to life in large cities, where they are forced to change their natural habits in order to exist in symbiosis with humans and their metabolic products. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="an ornithologist studies" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31700/746721.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The results of the works of the ornithologist allow us to learn more about the nature around us, to see how amazing and diverse the fauna of the Earth is.  The conducted research should give us new knowledge, surprise, and also motivate to preserve and protect life on our planet. </p><p>  Among the workers of this science there is also an ornithologist.  Who is it is not difficult to guess.  This is a specialist in the treatment of birds - both birds living in the wild, and those that are kept at home. </p><h2>  What qualities should people in this profession </h2><p>  In ornithology, as in any profession, you need to have certain personal characteristics that help to achieve high results.  A good ornithologist - who is he, what qualities does he have?  It: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  congenital observation </li><li>  attentiveness; </li><li>  perseverance; </li><li>  ability to concentrate on details; </li><li>  ability to analyze. </li></ul><p>  Perhaps the most important quality that any ornithologist should have is <span>love for nature,</span> especially for birds.  Only a person who is sincerely interested in the life of birds will enjoy research, draw the right conclusions, and maybe even new scientific discoveries. </p><p>  The ornithologist profession is one of the specific ones.  You cannot be a good ornithologist and at the same time dislike your work.  Only one who is confident in his choice of profession and is ready to devote his life to studying birds will certainly achieve success in ornithology. </p><h2>  Where do ornithologists work? </h2><p>  Ornithological workers can find jobs in institutions such as: </p><ul><li>  scientific research institute; </li><li>  agricultural sector; </li><li>  zoos, nature reserves; </li><li>  higher education institutions specializing in the study of natural sciences. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ornithology bird science" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31700/746725.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  At a time when there is underfunding in the scientific field, it is sometimes difficult for ornithologists to find work in their specialty, and they are forced to work in related industries. </p><h2>  Why is James Bond here </h2><p>  James Bond is a well-known ornithologist from Philadelphia.  He studied the Caribbean fauna, and in 1936 his book The Birds of the West Indies was published.  The scientific works published by him became fundamental in the field of ornithology. </p><p>  The fact that the popular super-spy, the hero of twenty-five films bears the same name, is by no means a coincidence.  The author of spy detectives, <span>Jan Fleming,</span> studied birds and, choosing a nickname for the main character of his novel, borrowed the name of the author of one of the books on ornithology, thus glorifying him. </p><h2>  Public Ornithology </h2><p>  It's hard to argue that bird watching is an interesting activity.  In this regard, there is such a thing as amateur ornithology.  This publicly accessible, fascinating activity has been chosen by many science lovers as their hobby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="profession ornithologist" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31700/746723.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is easy to observe birds simply from the window of your apartment using binoculars.  You can see even more by going for a walk in the city park.  Sometimes fans of ornithology organize joint trips out of town to observe birds.  To record the results of such artisanal studies, cameras and video cameras are used.
