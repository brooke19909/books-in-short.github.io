And cross-stitch daisies will look amazing in any interior. </p><div class="photo" data-original="papatube.weebly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The scheme of embroidery daisies and rose hips" class="if uuid-2869943" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107989/2869943.jpg"></div><h2>  Are embroidered daisies suitable for a picture? </h2><p>  A bouquet of flowers is well suited to the living room.  With such decoration in any weather, the room will seem more comfortable.  Simple and unobtrusive flowers, without excessive pomp and bright colors perfectly complement the room and give a special charm.  Entering the room, people will feel at home.

The first embroideries appeared before our era.  It's amazing how long people started doing this.  In those ancient times, embroidered with wool and even hair.  But years passed, humanity developed, and embroidery did not stand still.  Gradually, the primitive embroidery techniques became thinner and more beautiful.  And nobody used hair instead of threads.  Each area has its own patterns, and even certain colors. </p><p>  There were no <span>patterns</span> for embroidery then, and <span>patterns of embroidery of daisies with a cross</span> and even more so.  All patterns and ornaments were invented by ourselves.  For example, in China and Japan, it was popular to embroider gold on the finest silk fabrics, but the motifs were mostly natural.  In Europe, biblical motifs were often embroidered with woolen threads on hemp fabrics. </p><h2>  Where did you use embroidery before? </h2><p>  The technique of embroidery also changed over time, from chaotic stitches we now see a counting cross.  The cross is not just a figure for embroidery.  Earlier, and now, he was considered a talisman.  That is why patterns, ornaments and charms were often embroidered with a cross.  Tablecloths, towels, napkins, curtains were decorated with such embroideries.  Also decorated with petticoats and shirts.  Each pattern mattered.  Usually this is a protection against evil, an evil eye.  A blessing or pattern to give strength and courage.  On wedding towels embroidered a blessing for the young and a wish for a happy life.  Now, ornaments are embroidered only on shirts, but embroidered paintings are more popular in everyday life. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where to find patterns for embroidery </h2><p>  <span>Patterns for embroidering daisies with a cross are</span> best looked for by topic.  Each such scheme is unique.  In the modern world they are made using special programs on a computer.  For lovers of very original paintings, it‚Äôs easy to create your own: just take a picture of your bouquet of daisies, upload a photo to the program, and at the exit you will get a cross stitch pattern of daisies, but not someone else‚Äôs, namely from your author‚Äôs photo.  No one else will have such a picture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vishivashka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch pattern daisies" class="if uuid-2870061" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107989/2870061.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, if such difficulties are not for you, then you can buy a set for embroidery, it will have fabric for embroidery (canvas), mouline thread and of course a counted pattern for embroidering daisies with a cross.  In sets, schemes are colored and with symbols.  Each color and shade has its own symbol.  Judging by the reviews, color schemes are more convenient and eyes do not get tired when embroidering.  There are also small schemes, for those who are just starting to embroider.  They are very light in execution. </p><h2>  How to make embroidered paintings? </h2><p>  A properly designed picture <strong>is</strong> no less important than the embroidery itself.  There are some very important rules in the design: </p><ol><li>  The frame should never overshadow the picture itself.  She should only emphasize.  Since daisies are light flowers, the frame should in no case be black or very dark. </li><li>  First of all, it‚Äôs worth choosing a frame for an embroidered picture, and not for a sofa, cornice or curtains. </li><li>  It is important to choose a frame that matches the color or shades of the picture.  Compatibility is one of the most important rules in everything.  If the embroidery depicts white daisies on a green background, then the frame should have details with the same colors. </li><li>  Frame and picture size.  The balance is important here, small embroidery in a huge frame will not look good. </li><li>  Each picture needs its own frame.  Dressing all the pictures in a room in the same frames is not a good idea. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="vishivashka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Patterns for embroidery daisies cross" class="if uuid-2870065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107989/2870065.jpg"></div><p>  In general, it does not matter at all where to get the scheme: do it yourself, buy, order or download for free on the Internet.  It does not really matter where the threads will be bought (in an ordinary store near the house, on the market, or ordered via the Internet).  Canvas for paintings can also be bought in various places.  Most importantly, do-it-yourself paintings will bring warmth to the house and good mood, a piece of soul, causing not only positive emotions, but also pride in yourself and your work. </p>
