    <h2>  black Jack </h2><p>  It is necessary to briefly dwell on the milestones in the biography of the famous American military leader.  A native <span>of Missouri.</span>  Born September 13, 1860.  His father managed to give his son a good education, and the guy before entering West Point managed to work not only on a family farm, but also as a teacher.  However, a military career attracted a young man more. </p><p>  Enrollment at the West Point Military Academy in 1882 was crucial not only in the life of one person, but also in the fate of an entire nation.  Teachers noted the unprecedented zeal and diligence of the cadet - perhaps, it spoke of the blood of German ancestors.  Be that as it may, he graduated from this famous educational institution and was assigned to serve in the infamous 6th Cavalry Regiment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Indians of the Sioux and Apache tribes defended their independence in an unequal struggle against the greedy white colonizers who staged the genocide of the indigenous population.  The command noticed the participant in punitive operations and promoted to the rank of first lieutenant, which corresponded to the rank of lieutenant in the Russian army.  Along with the promotion, a transfer to the 10th Cavalry Regiment followed, consisting mostly of African Americans.  The treatment of the privates was harsh - hence the nickname Black Jack stuck. </p>

    <h2>  10th <span>Cavalry Regiment</span> in the Spanish-American War </h2><p>  The Cubans rebelled against their Spanish exploiters.  The American government suddenly flamed up with a desire to help the Cubans - too serious were the interests at the frontiers of American business. </p><p>  Most US wars began with provocations.  The Main cruiser exploded on February 15, 1898, and judging by the reports of Russian military intelligence, not as a result of a mine.  The explosion literally split the Main in two - that is, it was fired from inside the ship.  Nevertheless, American newspapers presented everything to their citizens in the right light.  Boiling with righteous anger, society demanded to punish the "vile Spaniards", and therefore the troops were sent, which included the future General Pershing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Despite the fact that the 10th Cavalry Regiment performed well in the famous battles at El Caney and Kettle Hill, the overall picture for the US Armed Forces was deplorable.  The Americans simply did not expect the catastrophic losses that they received during the hostilities.  Tropical diseases also pretty squandered personnel.  The stupid paradox of that war was that the Americans were ready to give up, but they were overtaken by the temperamental Spaniards.  They got the 1st place in the race "who will have time to capitulate first." </p>

    <h2>  Philippines and pork skins.  Stupid fiction and forgery of historical facts </h2><p>  Recently, the legend of the events in the Philippines has become increasingly resonant, and General Pershing and the terrorists are mentioned.  Rather, one anecdote that roams the World Wide Web and referenced by the president of "the most educated and reading nation on earth" Donald Trump.  The saddest thing is that the same episode, which supposedly took place in history, is mentioned by another ‚Äúfamous historian and anti-terrorism expert‚Äù Vladimir Pozner.  And this is already alarming. </p><p>  The bottom line is as follows.  General Pershing.  Philippines.  Pork skins in which the rebels were wrapped, and bullets soaked in the blood of this animal.  What's the point?  This, according to the American president and some who share these crazy ideas, is a universal way of combating world terrorism.  It is enough to study ‚Äúhow General Pershing fought against terrorists‚Äù and to adopt this ‚Äúpriceless and useful‚Äù experience. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The argument is not in favor of "pork skins" </h2><p>  It is necessary to return to history and give a few facts.  First you need to remember that the Americans supported the uprising in the Philippines against the Spanish exploiters.  On May 1, 1898, the US fleet defeated the Spaniards, and it would seem time to begin to rebuild the peaceful life of the Filipino people, who lost about 200,000 people.  But the US government again showed its unique vision of the world, and for the Philippines it was time for new bloody and cruel trials. </p><p>  Despite all the attempts of local rebels, the Khuramendatos, to protect their land from invaders, their forces were suppressed by 1902.  They were replaced by Amoki.  These bloodthirsty and merciless terrorists committed their crimes, not even trying to give them a religious ideology. </p><p>  In fairness, it should be noted that General Tasper Bliss proposed wrapping the huramendatos in pork skins.  However, Pershing did not agree with him.  He was an educated person and understood the absurdity of such proposals and measures.  But the myth of General Pershing, the Philippines and pork skins, which has no basis and no serious historical evidence, has been established in modern times. </p><h2>  Personal tragedy in the life of an American commander </h2><p>  John Joseph Pershing entered into marriage at the age of 45 with the daughter of Congressman Helen Francis Warren in 1905.  Behind there were military campaigns in the Philippines and participation in the suppression of the ‚ÄúBoxer Rebellion‚Äù.  Captain Pershing was in good standing with the command and had fame and popularity in American society.  It is no accident that President Roosevelt promoted him to <span>brigadier general</span> in 1906, which caused a grumbling at numerous ill-wishers.  He was a wonderful family man, but his nature longed for action, so the restless officer was constantly eager for the thick of things, for war. </p>

    <p>  So, he returned to the Philippines and again mated with local rebels, successfully bringing the US army to victory over the partisans in 1913.  Ahead was expected to return home, but the plans were not destined to come true. </p><p>  An uprising flared in Mexico.  The Americans again decided to intervene in the internal affairs of a sovereign state, and the troops of the illustrious General Pershing were put to shame.  The Mexicans, commanded by <span>Pancho Villa,</span> defeated the 13th Cavalry Regiment.  The Americans, suffering one defeat after another in minor skirmishes, even gave Villa instructions on how to wage war using ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù methods, which amused the Mexicans a lot. </p><p>  What has General Pershing been doing all this time?  He fought on two fronts: political and military.  The Mexican government threatened war if the Americans didn‚Äôt get out.  On top of that, the US Army looked comical and only dishonored a nation that despised everything ‚Äúnon-American.‚Äù </p>

    <p>  But worst of all, it was the death of his wife and three daughters in a fire in 1915.  Only the son survived.  This tragedy forever left a mark in the soul of the old soldier. </p><h2>  Personal experience in world war General Pershing </h2><p>  The Americans have long been preparing for the upcoming war with Germany.  So long that they entered it three months before its full completion.  He headed the millionth contingent of Pershing.  But here, there were some excesses from the American side. </p><p>  US <span>forces</span> did not have modern weapons, and the allies (France and Britain) had to share.  Naturally, such an untrained and unprepared army, which until recently had been disgraced in the fight against Mexican rebels, suffered huge and unjustified losses. </p><p>  America‚Äôs prestige fell in the eyes of the Allies, but this did not stop Pershing from becoming the U.S. Army General and head of the <span>General Staff.</span>  He retired in 1924.  He released the memoirs ‚ÄúMy Experience in World War II‚Äù and received the prestigious Pulitzer Prize.  His life journey was completed on July 15, 1948. </p>

    <h2>  Mark on history </h2><p>  In Nevada, there is Pershing County, named after the American commander.  The US military named him a tank and a medium-range missile.  To this can be added the medal of the "Occupation Army in Germany."  On the obverse is a portrait of General Pershing.  The famous breeder Lemoine bred the lilac variety General Pershing.  A photo of this wonderful plant is the most recognizable, due to its frequent use in various photo shoots. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  General Pershing stood at the origins of the creation of the modern mechanized army of the United States.  Having burned himself during his operation in Mexico, he attached great importance to the loyalty of local authorities during campaigns on their territory.  His name is overgrown with an incredible amount of myths and legends that political leaders and some fairly well-known media characters shamelessly use for cheap populism.  One thing is indisputable: General Pershing is a soldier who honestly performed his military duty, whose victories adorned the poor military history of the United States. </p>
