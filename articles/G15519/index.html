The smartphone debuted in the spring of 2016.  Today it is the simplest model in the line of mobile devices.  The reason for this was the weak hardware, which we have yet to familiarize ourselves with.  Who should use this model?  Only undemanding users.  Most often, Huawei Y3 II is purchased as a second phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei lua l21 specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2077437.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Before you consider the characteristics of Huawei LUA-L21, you need to find out what it looks like.  Unfortunately, the design did not cause any emotions in the buyers.  The simplest plastic case, which is framed by a silver frame.  The surface of the back side remotely resembles metal.  The dimensions are small - 134x68x9.9 mm.  Everything, as for such dimensions, is impressive - 150 g. The assortment contains five color options: Gold, Roze Gold, Black, White and Blue. </p><p>  The assembly is the most disturbing.  There is absolutely no stiffness.  The plastic is quite thin, so when pressed, you can feel how the lid bends. </p><h2>  Screen and cameras </h2><p>  What is the best way to describe the characteristics of the Huawei LUA-L21?  The instruction that comes with the phone!  It is in it that you need to look in order to find information about the battery, processor, and other elements.  However, we are still interested in the screen.  Huawei Y3 II is for lovers of small devices.  It uses a 4.5-inch display.  If the size is still nothing, then the resolution will definitely disappoint many.  Maximum screen capabilities - 854 √ó 438 px.  Here, the manufacturer did not provide anti-reflective and oleophobic coatings.  The matrix also can not boast of high performance.  It is made using TFT technology.  What is this talking about?  On the street in sunny weather it will be quite problematic to interact with a smartphone, since the information is practically not visible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Huawei LUA-L21, the characteristics of the cameras are rather mediocre.  To dream that with the help of a 5 or 2 megapixel sensor you can take a high-quality picture is silly.  Normal photos are obtained only on the street in clear weather.  In order to avoid numerous glare and highlights, you must be a real wizard.  Alas, this model is definitely not suitable as a camera phone. </p><p>  What about the front camera?  By and large, nothing.  A two-megapixel matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãonly enough for video communication. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone huawei lua l21 specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2077438.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hardware equipment </h2><p>  What are the characteristics of hardware in the Huawei LUA-L21?  The ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the smartphone was a modest chipset of the MediaTek trademark.  Buyers should understand that this model will not work as a game.  The MT6582M processor, operating at a frequency of 1300 MHz, will not pull serious toys.  A problem may also occur when launching "heavy" applications.  The reason for such restrictions is the small amount of RAM - only one gigabyte.  Native memory in the device is also a minimum.  For everything about all the developers have provided storage for 8 GB.  It is worth considering that no more than half is free.  You can expand the memory to 32 GB by installing a USB flash drive, however, you can save only music, pictures, photos, videos on it.  All application files will be automatically transferred to the phone‚Äôs memory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The smartphone is running Android 5.1.  Not without, of course, without a shell.  The phone has an EMUI 3.1 Lite interface developed by Huawei. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei lua l21 specifications manual" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2077440.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Huawei LUA-L21: battery specifications and reviews </h2><p>  For autonomy in the Huawei Y3 II meets the lithium-polymer battery with a capacity of 2100 mAh.  It is removable, so if you wish, the user can carry a spare battery with him in case the main one is discharged.  Record indicators from this model should not be expected.  Everything is within the budget class.  For example, watching a video for four hours will use up all of its battery life.  If you reduce the time of the active screen to 2.5 hours, you can expect about 18 hours of work, and during this period you can use the Internet, connecting via Wi-Fi. </p><p>  The smartphone has a special program that optimizes power consumption.  With its help, the operation of applications is controlled, so autonomy increases significantly.  During testing, the device was able to work on a single charge for 4 hours with an active screen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei lua l21 specifications reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2077441.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Having considered the characteristics of Huawei LUA-L21, we can say that this model is suitable only for novice users.  Its indisputable advantages are its low price (about 6,000 rubles) and compact dimensions.  Due to the size of the gadget, you can carry it in your shirt or trouser pocket, and it will also not take up much space in your purse.  As for the rest, it is difficult to imagine that such a modest smartphone in all respects will appeal to most buyers.  Its most significant disadvantages are weak speakers, a low camera resolution, a mediocre screen, and a poor-quality case. </p>
