    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Shekvetili is located in the administrative district of Guria, in the resort region of Ozurgeti, between the city of Kobuleti and the village of Ureki, on the Black Sea.  The name of this place is translated from Georgian as ‚Äúordered‚Äù.  Indeed, when you come to rest in Georgia, in Shekvetili, and walk among the green alleys, neat houses, thickets of <span>Pitsunda pines,</span> it seems that everything here is made to order - the village seemed to have left the picture of a fairy tale book.  That is why Shekvetili at first sight falls in love with travelers. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The history of the village dates back to the 17th century.  Then at this place was a trading post in Western Georgia.  At the beginning of the 19th century, the Russian army placed a border post here.  During the Crimean War there was a fortified garrison, where about two thousand soldiers served. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shekvetili georgia reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/2184735.jpg"></div>

The rest, and there were not more than thirty of them, were able to escape into the forest and escape.  After that, the garrison was abandoned for a long time, and then gradually began to take root in people.  In the 20th century, a cozy village arose with well-groomed beaches and beautiful Georgian nature.  Now in a quiet, cozy place it already does not remind of aggressive battles and wars. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  More than three kilometers stretches the coastline of Shekvetili.  The Georgian village is known for healing magnetic sand, which has a beneficial effect on the body.  The fact is that the local sand contains a lot of magnetite, which, when heated and in contact with human skin, can improve blood circulation and enhance metabolism.  Tourists resting on the beaches of Shekvetili note a number of features, namely: the dark color of sand;  low occupancy;  Shallow depth (you can swim even during strong waves);  gentle entry into the water;  the presence of coniferous forest, which saturates the air with medicinal substances, thirty meters from the coast. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  A favorable climate is another advantage of Shekvetili.  Georgia generally has a mild climate, but here it is unique and inimitable due to the mixing of sea air and air descending from the Bakhmaro mountain range, which in combination with pine forest coniferous fluids gives the effect of oxygen enrichment with a large amount of ozone.  People who visited the village say that they seemed to have both a rest on the sea and in the mountains at the same time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in Georgia shekvetili" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/2184730.jpg"></div>
