In this city, various social events are regularly held, which bring together not only the entire Italian elite, but also Hollywood world stars.  Milan is rightfully the main capital of finance, business, media and fashion. </p><p>  The city has a favorable location in northern Italy, in the Lombardy region, which contributes to the prosperity of tourism.  Literally a few kilometers from the city, there are beautiful lakes and mountain landscapes.  The population here is small by European standards, but active city life attracts and draws many Italians to its side.  It is in Milan that one can get a quality education and prestigious well-paid job. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunset from the roof of the cathedral" class="if uuid-2290049" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2290049.jpg"></div><p>  As we have said, tourism is an integral part of this city, but what is there, all of Italy.  Many are willing to give large sums in order to come and stay for the night in this epicenter of urban life.  Let's take a closer look at all the delights of a holiday in Milan and its environs. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The history of this wonderful city dates back to the 6th century BC, when its territory acted as a settlement of the Etruscans.  Further, in 222 BC, the city was subjugated by the Romans.  Later it became the capital of the Roman province of Cisalypina, and from 286 Milan became the capital of the Western Roman Empire and the residence of emperors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  Before talking about vacations in Milan and numerous reviews of tourists, you should go to the main attractions, which, as a rule, are the main reason for visiting a city. </p><p>  The main <span>attraction of Milan</span> and its heart is the Cathedral of Santa Maria Nascente, but the most publicized was called Duomo di Milano.  This cathedral is made entirely in the Gothic style of white marble and strikes the eye of visitors at first sight.  The Cathedral of Santa Maria Nascente is located in the central part of the city, next to the famous gallery of Victor Emmanuel II. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flixbus.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Duomo Cathedral" class="if uuid-2290044" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2290044.jpg"></div><p>  The interior of the cathedral is no less amazing.  High ceilings, elegant arches and columns give the impression of lightness and airiness.  It is always worth remembering that you can get inside the cathedral only in clothing that meets the standards of decency.  In addition, for tourists, the entrance to the roof of the cathedral is open, from where you can take a delightful shot in memory. </p><h2>  Sforzesco Castle </h2><p>  If you are tired of Art Nouveau or modern business centers, then in Milan there are a couple of old castles for you.  The most famous and visited at the moment is the castle of the Dukes of Sforze.  The walls of this building are saturated with history, Leonardo da Vinci himself took part in its decoration.  Unfortunately, the results of his work have not survived to the present day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today, the doors of Sforzesco Castle are open to visitors, its halls contain unique paintings and statues of internationally recognized masters.  The decoration of the collection is an unfinished sculpture by Michelangelo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.milanocard.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sforzesco Castle" class="if uuid-2290053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2290053.jpg"></div><p>  If you are an admirer of the old style, then the ‚ÄúEgyptian Hall‚Äù is best for you.  It stores various sarcophagi, ancient medical devices, gold jewelry and even mummies of the pharaohs.  The territory of the museum is divided into several zones, tickets to which are distributed both free of charge and for 15 euros. </p><p>  The castle has a beautiful garden, accessible to visitors.  Here you can take a walk, relax from the bustle and enjoy the picturesque views. </p><h2>  Leonardo da Vinci Museum </h2><p>  The world-famous museum of science and technology, named after an outstanding artist and inventor.  Inside this museum a variety of mechanisms are collected.  Of particular interest is the composition dedicated to Leonardo da Vinci.  To the presentation of tourists there are preserved manuscripts, outline schemes and even mock-ups of aircraft.  Definitely, this place will appeal not only to adults who are interested in history, but also to children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The entrance ticket to the museum is 10 euros, in addition, special discounts are available for children and senior citizens, as well as students. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vivaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leonardo da Vinci Museum" class="if uuid-2290054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2290054.jpg"></div><h2>  Milan Art Gallery </h2><p>  Who, if not Italy, should occupy a leading position in the number of architectural values, art monuments and art galleries?  In Milan, you will be amazed not only by the exhibits displayed, but also by the buildings in which they are contained.  Must-visit are the Brera and Ambrosiana Gallery.  In them, each visitor will find something special and interesting for himself. </p><p>  Special attention deserves a collection of jewelry from the illegitimate daughter of Pope Alexander VI. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ambasciatorihotel.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panoramic city view" class="if uuid-2290043" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2290043.jpg"></div><h2>  Santa Maria delle Grazie </h2><p>  The life and work of Leonardo Da Vinci go hand in hand with Milan, so it is in the capital of fashion and business relations that you can get acquainted with the works of the famous master.  One of these works, or rather the fresco "The Last Supper", is stored on the territory of the small church of Santa Maria delle Grazie. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the legendary fresco cannot be called an original, since it had to be corrected several times in view of spontaneous destruction from old age and exposure to dampness. </p><p>  In order to get into the refectory and see with your own eyes the work of the great master, you must pre-register via the Internet. </p><h2>  Areas </h2><p>  Tourists planning a vacation in Milan for the first time should familiarize themselves with the main housing-friendly areas.  Reviews are advised to choose areas located in the central part of the city.  Great options for a relaxing holiday in Milan are: the Old Town, Fashion Square, Navigli District, University and Center. </p><p>  The average nightly scene at the hotel is shown in the photograph below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelask.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Estimated cost of housing in different areas of Milan" class="if uuid-2290065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2290065.jpg"></div><h2>  Milan.  Sea holiday </h2><p>  Everyone has heard about the famous lakes in the province of Lombardy, but not everyone knows if there is a sea nearby.  For many tourists, especially those traveling in the summer, there is a need for a beach holiday in Milan.  But here is one problem.  Let's get it right. </p><p>  The nearest coast from Milan is about 150 km, but this distance can be covered by high-speed train, following the route Milan - Genoa.  Trains in this direction leave regularly from Milan Central Station.  So if you want to go from Milan for a day to the Ligurian coast, wander along the promenade and breathe fresh air, then it is worth paying attention to Genoa.  According to reviews, the city itself is also of considerable interest; it is rich in historical monuments and picturesque views. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.captaincruise.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Genoa coast" class="if uuid-2290067" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2290067.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to stay in Milan? </h2><p>  Milan can definitely boast of its wide selection of different hotels.  In all areas of the city you can find affordable housing, it all depends on the preferences of tourists.  For those whose budget is not designed for regular trips to cafes and restaurants, specialized sites such as airbnb can offer a rented apartment or room with all the necessary kitchen utensils.  This type of accommodation can significantly reduce your spending in the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="siviaggia.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Skyscrapers of Milan" class="if uuid-2290058" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2290058.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing a home should focus on your future plans.  You should also choose hotels in Milan for families with children, if you are traveling as a family.  If the main purpose of the trip is to visit the sights and city art monuments, reviews are advised to settle near the center.  Also, many tourists arrive or, on the contrary, leave the city with the help of a second airport in the vicinity of Bergamo.  In this case, they are tied to the main railway station of Milan.  Good reviews in these areas were received by the hotels Michelangelo Hotel Milan 4 *, Mokinba Hotel Cristallo 3 *, Soperga Hotel 3 *, Starhotels Rosa Grand 4 * or Rio Hotel Milan 3 *. </p><h2>  Cost of rest </h2><p>  How much will a vacation in Milan in Italy cost?  This question is asked by many travelers.  Staying in the world capital of fashion, where on every corner you can find banners with the products of such well-known brands as Gucci or Armani, can be very frightening at first.  But do not be scared in vain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.in-lombardia.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Streets of Milan" class="if uuid-2290056" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2290056.jpg"></div><p>  The most important rule during any trip is to make currency exchange in Russia.  Of course, prices in Milan for any product are slightly higher than in the southern part of the country, but nevertheless adequate.  For small savings, reviews are recommended to buy in supermarkets or visit a cafe at the time of ‚Äúhappy hours‚Äù, when the prices for the menu are slightly reduced.  Many city museums are open to visitors in the morning for free.  According to numerous reviews of tourists about holidays in Milan, we can confidently say that this city is able to surprise. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If you have been to Italy, but have not visited Milan, you can assume that you have lost a piece of yourself.  Of course, this city is able to fall in love with itself from the first minutes and forever remain in your heart.  Many mistakenly believe that one day is enough for a tour of the city, but no.  There is definitely something to see for a whole week ahead.  Do not forget to share your reviews about holidays in Milan!  Good luck </p>
