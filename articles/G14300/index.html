In this article we will tell you about the conditions of rest at this base and the impressions of people who have been there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation center Dubrava Nugush" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/1908345.jpg" width="600"></div>
