    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tourists have always been attracted by ancient and mysterious Greece.  Crete (Bali and other resorts) every year receives numerous travelers from around the world.  Here, not only those who wish to soak up the gentle sun, but also those who want to plunge into the atmosphere of national Greek flavor, can relax. </p><p>  Numerous small and large bays are characteristic of the island of Crete.  <span>Bali, reviews</span> of which are only the most admired, has four of them, in which sandy beaches are located.  The largest and most open bay is located near the highway.  In windy weather there are strong waves.  The second is much smaller and calmer.  The third bay is the busiest.  It has a small pier, where you can always see the boats of fishermen, and here come the tourist "pirate schooners" - small boats making excursions along the coast. </p><p>  The calmest and quietest bay is to the right of the main beach.  There are never waves here.  It is called Karavostasi, or Evita.  This is the most secluded place in the village.  Here is one hotel and two taverns. </p><p>  Like the entire island of Crete, Bali has many souvenir shops and two supermarkets.  There are a huge number of large and very small taverns, which became famous not only for their magnificent and original cuisine, but also for huge portions. </p><p>  Lovers of an active lifestyle will be able to visit the Melidoni Cave, the entrance to which is two hundred and thirty meters above sea level.  The main hall of its very impressive size is 44x55 meters.  The ceiling height ranges from 10 to 25 meters.  The stalactites hanging from it are illuminated by multi-colored lights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crete bali reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/218995.jpg" width="600"></div>
