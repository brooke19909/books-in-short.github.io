    <p>  Kirish is another resort town that can be found in Turkey.  It is very difficult to call this place a city, because the infrastructure is not very developed there, and in the evenings Kirish turns into a quiet and calm seaside paradise.  People often come here to take a break from the hustle and bustle of big cities.  However, despite the fact that you will not find noisy clubs and large luxurious restaurants here, in the town next to Kemer there are several very decent hotels where you can always stay if you have such a desire.  One is the Solim Inn Hotel 3 *, ready to impress guests with its service and proximity to the sea. </p><h2>  Building's facade </h2><p>  The hotel was built almost 20 years ago, in 1996.  Since then, it has been restored several times to be competitive in comparison with other hotels located in Kirish.  If at first the colors of the building were red and white, then after the last restoration the management of Solim Inn Hotel 3 * Kemer decided to use more comfortable beige shades.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is a little over 6500 square meters.  Moreover, the building occupies only about its third.  The rest belongs to the pool, as well as to numerous outbuildings in the form of bars, restaurants and shops.  The structure of the hotel is made in a U-shaped manner.  This allows visitors to relax comfortably by the pool, without fear of prying eyes from nearby buildings.  Upon arrival at the hotel guests are greeted by a colorful sign with its name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Solim Inn Hotel 3 * (Kemer Kiris) is located in the immediate vicinity of a fairly large city called Kemer.  One could say that Kirish is its suburbs, if not for the huge rock, which became the border of two resort towns.  The closest place where there is an airport is Antalya.  The easiest way to get to the resort <span>town of Turkey</span> is by plane.  If you fly from Moscow, the ticket price can vary from 300 to 400 US dollars depending on the carrier company, as well as on how early the ticket was booked.  Between Antalya and Kirish 62 km.  You can get there by bus.  To do this, go to the bus station and wait for the flight to the desired city.  A shuttle service is also available directly from the airport to the hotel.  This is a very convenient option, since most tourists are not eager to spend time waiting for the bus after the flight.  If you go by taxi, then the Solim Inn Hotel 3 * can be reached in just 40-45 minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="solim inn hotel 3 kemer" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/593554.jpg" width="500"></div>
