Living in the city center is hard now.  These are eternal traffic jams, air saturated with exhaust gases, huge crowds of people hurrying about their business.  Therefore, many residents, both indigenous and newcomers, choose housing outside the city.  For this purpose, Butovo Park residential complex is perfect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD &quot;Butovo Park&quot;" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/1816794.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  The residential complex is conveniently located right at the Warsaw and Rastorguevsky highways in the direction of Podolsk.  About three kilometers separates the complex from the Moscow Ring Road and the Skobelevsky Street metro station.  Thus, the address of the residential complex ‚ÄúButovo Park‚Äù is the Warsaw highway, houses from 1 to 31. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD &quot;Butovo Park&quot; apartments" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/1816793.jpg" width="542"></div>

    <p>  You can get to the complex quickly using your own vehicles.  Travel time from the Moscow Ring Road will take several minutes.  Turning nowhere is not necessary, since the complex is adjacent to the highway.  Those who do not have a car at their disposal can also be calm.  In this direction there are many public transport: buses and taxis.  You can also take the train from the Kursk station and in 45 minutes be already in place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  What will the Butovo Park residential complex be when the construction is fully completed?  The entire project is designed for the construction of 79 panel and monolithic-brick buildings of various storeys: from 9 to 25. Such a large-scale construction will allow commissioning of 1.4 million square meters of housing.  Moreover, the construction is provided for in three stages, each of which is a new quarter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD &quot;Butovo Park&quot; address" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/1816792.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Butovo Park 1 </h2><p>  This quarter of Butovo Park residential complex provides for the construction of residential buildings in an amount of 23. Initially, the project was conceived as an economy class, but with the passage of construction, the parameters undergo changes and are already approaching the business class.  Here residential buildings (floors from 17 to 25) are being built, forming an enclosed space.  Facades of buildings are finished with bright facing materials.  Between houses, the developer ennobles the territory, makes access roads more convenient and thought out.  The buildings included in this part of the residential complex have already been commissioned, and buyers of apartments have settled in them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Butovo Park reviews" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/1816790.jpg" width="600"></div>

Residential buildings are being built with different numbers of floors: from 9 to 25 floors.  And ultimately they will give 200 thousand square meters of living space.  Apartments in the Butovo Park residential complex will also be different in size.  The smallest in this line of construction are expected from 38 square meters.  The largest will reach 79 square meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD &quot;Butovo Park&quot; index" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1818397.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Butovo Park 3 </h2><p>  The last stage of construction is a mixed development consisting of panel and monolithic-brick houses with floors from 13 to 25. In total, it is envisaged that forty-one houses will be erected.  All buildings are located approximately on the same territory, close to each other, within the intended land.  In this part of the development of the apartment, Butovo Park residential complex apartments are provided to buyers with a full finish, which can significantly save on building materials and the need to immediately make repairs.  As for the construction time, in this case, the developer postponed the end to the current year. </p><h2>  Infrastructure: internal and external </h2><p>  It is impossible to come up with a better place than the one chosen by the developer to host such a large-scale residential development project.  The index at Butovo Park housing estate, as well as the registration with its residents, will be urban, although in fact they will live outside the city, where the air is cleaner and there are less traffic jams.  Such a successful layout was made possible thanks to the assistance of the ABV Group architectural bureau. </p><p>  The residential complex is located between the <span>Butovo forest</span> and the Podolsky forestry, which adds to it positive reviews.  LCD "Butovo Park" is a real find for those who want to break out of the stone "jungle" of the metropolis. </p><p>  When the construction of the complex is completed, it will be able to boast of having all the necessary facilities for social infrastructure.  This will include six kindergartens, four schools, a clinic.  In addition, there will be cultural and educational centers, fitness centers, a temple and other necessary institutions that modern society cannot do without. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD &quot;Butovo Park&quot; postal code" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/1816787.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The proximity of the complex to the Butovo microdistrict gives its residents the full right to use all its developed infrastructure.  These are hypermarkets, shopping centers, and the construction market "Kashirsky Dvor". </p><p>  As for the internal infrastructure, here the customer has provided for the owners of their own vehicles the construction of several overground parking lots and underground parking lots.  The entire territory of the complex will be ennobled, landscaped.  An artificial lake will be built.  In the yards equip children's playgrounds and sports grounds, places for adults to relax, walking alleys. </p><p>  Each entrance of the apartment building is equipped with two elevators: freight and passenger.  There are also designated areas for the concierge and for storing bicycles, prams.  Entrances are equipped with ramps and handrails necessary for the movement of people with limited mobility.  As in almost all new buildings, the first floors of modern buildings are given for non-residential premises, which will accommodate retail and office facilities. </p><h2>  Reviews about the complex </h2><p>  Those who have already been able to settle in the built houses leave various reviews on the Internet, including about the Butovo Park postal code, about the transport accessibility of the complex to the city, and about the infrastructure of the complex.  Proximity to the city makes it possible to quickly get to work and not stand in multi-kilometer traffic jams.  Also quickly in the evening you can get home from work.  Only a few kilometers separate the complex from the Moscow Ring Road. </p><p>  As for the quality of decoration of apartments and the level of construction, there are no special complaints from buyers of apartments to the developer.  There are minor misunderstandings that arise with the management company, but all of them are quite simple and easy to resolve. </p><p>  Almost all residents are satisfied with the developed infrastructure, excellent access roads to the complex and the ennobled courtyard, which makes it pleasant to walk after a working day. </p><p>  Apartment reviews are also mostly positive.  Buyers are satisfied with their layout, quality of finish, general condition.  The developer met all the expectations of its shareholders and provided them with what was promised in the project documentation. </p><p>  If we consider the location of the residential complex from an environmental point of view, it is difficult to imagine a better place for its construction.  As mentioned above, the complex is completely surrounded by forest.  This gives its residents the opportunity to enjoy the fresh air and feel as if they are in country houses alone with nature.  This is especially felt when, after a busy day in the bustle of a huge city, people fall into the silence and tranquility of almost suburban life. </p>
