  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Types of Democracy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Democracy is a political system in which the exercise of political power is exercised by a majority of citizens who freely express their will.  Aristotle regarded it as the rule of poor citizens in his own interests.  Plato defined the term ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù as follows: the power of an envious poor.  In ancient times, it was considered the worst form of government in the state.  This was due to the fact that, due to low human culture, this <span>form of government</span> sooner or later passes into the <span>power of the crowd.</span> </p><p>  After the Great <span>Revolution in France,</span> democracy began to be seen as some kind of <span>social system</span> that rejects elitism and monarchy.  Since that time, a huge number of theories have been formed about this system of social structure. </p><p>  In the X VIII - XIX centuries, democracy was considered a regime guaranteeing a complex of political and social freedoms and rights.  These, in particular, included the right of unions, assemblies, freedom of opinion, conscience, correspondence, movement, as well as participation in solving important political issues.  In addition, under this regime, a person was guaranteed natural rights to housing, security, life, work, rest and so on.  The rule of law and the emerging <span>civil society</span> have become critical conditions for the development of democracy. </p><p>  Western political scientists of our time do not consider democracy as the <span>power of the people,</span> which determines the direction of the current policy in the state.  In their opinion, this regime is a system of government that reckons with the will of the people, which, in turn, is expressed when choosing the ruling elite. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In accordance with the method of citizen participation in government, as well as how and who exactly performs the functions of power, the following types of democracy are distinguished: representative and direct. </p><p>  Direct is called such a system of government, in which citizens are directly involved in the development, preparation, discussion, and decision-making.  This form of participation was characteristic of ancient democracy.  Today, it is permissible only in small communities, settlements, enterprises, etc.  This form is used, as a rule, for solving problems that do not require special qualifications. </p><p>  <span>Representative democracy</span> is considered the main type of people's participation in modern governance systems.  The essence of this form is the indirect participation of subjects in the solution of certain state issues.  This participation is realized through the selection by citizens of representatives who are called to express the interests of the people and to issue orders and enact laws on their behalf.  This form is necessary in the framework of the existence of large-scale <span>social systems,</span> as well as at a certain level of complexity of decisions. </p><p>  Researchers also identify types of democracy that correspond to one or another period in the history of mankind.  There are five types in total. </p><p>  The first is community democracy.  The tribe held the election of leaders, the council of elders. </p><p>  The second type is dynastic democracy.  It was formed with the advent of the first Egyptian state.  Despite the fact that the supreme rulers, who handed down power at that time, they could rule the state not only in their own, but also in the interests of the people. </p><p>  It should be noted that these types of democracy were the most ancient forms of realizing the will of the people. </p><p>  The third type is the Greek system.  Today it is more often called the "western". </p><p>  The fourth type is formal democracy. </p><p>  These types of democracy (formal and Greek) have no external differences.  However, the fourth type is characterized by the absence of a struggle for power. </p><p>  The fifth type is one-party democracy.  In this form, the direction of the country's policy on development is carried out not in accordance with the choice of the people during direct elections, but on the basis of the struggle within one party. </p>
