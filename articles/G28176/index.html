  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The formation of the Old Russian state</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  According to some researchers, the formation of the Old Russian state was the result of the unification of East Slavic tribes.  However, disputes arose between many historians on the issue of power formation.  This is due to the emerging about 200 years ago of the so-called "Norman theory." </p><p>  In the oldest annals, the year 862 is mentioned as the time of the <span>calling of the Varangian princes</span> with Rurik dominating them in the Slavic lands.  This need arose in connection with the spread of internal strife.  Inhabitants of Scandinavia (reigning Vikings) are called in some sources "northern people" - the Normans. </p><p>  Discussions about their calling began in the 18th century after the founding of the Academy of Sciences and the transformations of Peter 1. At that time, Schletser, Miller and Bayer, who were invited to serve in the St. Petersburg Academy, became the founders of the assumption about how the formation of the Old Russian State took place.  "Norman theory" suggested that the Scandinavians introduced statehood.  Thus, the power was formed not by the Slavs, but by the Varangian princes.  At the same time, another ‚Äúanti-Norman assumption‚Äù began to spread.  Its founders, Lomonosov and Trediakovsky, argued that the formation of the Old Russian state was the merit of the Slavs. </p><p>  To one degree or another, most historians in the 19th century were supporters of the assumption of the formation of a Varangian power.  However, historical science of the 20th century subjected the Norman theory to serious criticism.  As a result, today most of the scholars of history do not deny some influence of the Normans on the formation of Russian statehood, but the degree of this influence is not exaggerated. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the <span>East Slavic tribes, the</span> leaders were called princes.  The family tree of the kings and princes of the state was conducted from the prince of the Vikings Rurik. </p><p>  After the death of Rurik, who reigned in Novgorod, the Vikings came to the Dnieper.  The first real ruler of <span>Ancient Russia</span> was Oleg.  Reliable information has been preserved about him.  Oleg began to unite the lands of <span>Slavic tribes.</span>  In 882, he captured Kiev, killed Dir and Askold who reigned in it.  Having made the capital of the city, Oleg called her "the mother of Russian cities."  Thus, the formation of the Old Russian state Kievan Rus took place. </p><p>  During the reign of Oleg led several successful battles with the powerful Byzantium, twice he went on campaigns to Constantinople.  As a result of this activity, in 907 and 911, Russia concluded favorable peace agreements. </p><p>  The formation of the Old Russian State continued even after Igor ascended the throne after Oleg.  According to some sources, he was the son of Rurik.  During the reign of Igor, the inclusion of various tribal formations into Kievan Rus continued.  So, he contributed to the emergence of Russian settlements on the Taman Peninsula, subjugated the street.  In addition, Igor very actively continued Oleg's foreign policy activities.  After military campaigns against Byzantium, he concluded a mutually beneficial agreement with her in 944.  One of the first <span>princes, Igor</span> encountered a Turkic folk group - the Pechenegs. </p><p>  The first ruler, known history, was Olga, the widow of Prince Igor.  The Princess managed to maintain power not only over Kiev, but over all of Russia.  During the reign of Olga tributary duties were strictly regulated. </p><p>  The formation of the Old Russian state continued until the very reign of Yaroslav (1019-1054).  This ruler received the nickname "Wise."  Yaroslav united almost all Old Russian lands with his power.  The prince adopted the ‚ÄúRussian Truth‚Äù the first legislative code.  During his reign, the power reached its highest power. </p>
