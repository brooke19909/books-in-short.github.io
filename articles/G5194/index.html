    <p>  Any kind of headphones is a TRS connector (through which they connect to devices), a cable and two cups with ear pads.  The latter are made of various materials, but most often silicone, which is soft and comfortable.  In on-ear headphones, there is another detail - this is a bow, or headband, which covers the head from above or on the back of the head.  All models differ in the way they are mounted on the head, which are four: </p><ol><li>  Classical.  Headphones are fixed with elastic, darkened arches connecting the cups.  By the way, the arches themselves are also different: the most reliable are self-adjusting, they are a construction of arcs and ribbons;  sliding arms are easy to use;  molded plastic temples do not need to be set up, as it is enough to move the cups themselves. </li><li>  Mount on the back of the head.  Some types of headphones are equipped with an elastic arm that connects the cups, only doing this on the back of the head.  This design transfers the mechanical load on the ears, so it is important when choosing to focus on the weight of the cups themselves. </li><li>  Mount on the ears.  Headphones of this model are attached to the ears with clips or earhooks. </li><li>  Without fastening.  These models are just foam ear pads that are located in the auricle. </li></ol><h2>  How to connect? </h2>

    <p>  Some types of headphones have a two-way connection - these are plug-in and intra-channel.  With this method, the common wire that comes from the plug is divided into two, and they are led to the cups.  Users note that such headphones are not the most comfortable, as they often fall out of your ears, and wires that are long enough are constantly twisted and tangled. </p><p>  There are various types of headphone jacks.  There are two of them: 6.3 mm and 3.5 mm.  In most models, the second connector, but the first is often found, so it is better to choose universal headphones that can support both types of connectors. </p><h2>  Plug-in, vacuum or overhead? </h2><p>  Modern types of headphones - this is a variety in design and product design.  And this serves as a guarantee that each buyer will find what he likes and is comfortable for him.  When choosing, you need to understand that the earbuds are inserted into the ear, while the on-ear models are adjacent to the ear.  The degree of fit is different thanks to the ear pads, soft cushions, which ensure comfortable listening.  Note that the <span>monitor headphones</span> are complemented by circum-aural-ear pads, which exclude the spread of sound to the outside, and on overhead models, supra-aural ear pads, which fit snugly to the ear but do not completely encircle it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Plug-in models, otherwise called liners, are very convenient due to their compactness.  In addition, they most often have an attractive design.  For example, a stylish solution is headphones in the form of macaroon or other sweets that emphasize the flirty image.  But in terms of sound quality and sound insulation, ear pads on vacuum headphones are much better than on-ear headphones.  We also note that the sound in vacuum headphones is much cleaner, so no noise from the outside will stop you from listening to your favorite music. </p><p>  The difference between plug-in and patch models is the size of the emitter membrane.  In vacuum models, it is small, up to 12 mm, while on-ear headphones have a large membrane - from 30 mm or more, which affects the improvement of sound performance. </p><h2>  For phone </h2>

    <p>  Where do we most often listen to music or an audiobook?  Right, on the road.  And it is very important that the headphones are good, do not miss sounds from the outside and sit comfortably in your ear.  Depending on the design, the following types of headphones for the phone are distinguished: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Inserts: this is the most popular option, most often such models come complete with the device itself.  They are cheap, but the sound quality and sound insulation level are not the best. </li><li>  Plug-in: they are called "droplets," or "gags."  They sit well in the ears, close them tightly, which affects the improvement of sound insulation. </li><li>  Overhead: for the phone this is not the best option, since they are too large, it is inconvenient to carry them with you in your bag. </li></ul><p>  Depending on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãuse, all headphones are either audiophile or special.  The first are designed to ensure that the sound reproduction will be at a high level, and special models are made for people with hearing impairments. </p><h2>  Location and quality </h2><p>  When buying headphones, we strive to ensure that they are comfortable, that the sound is good, and the cord is not tangled.  Many models, including headphones in the form of laces or cat ears, seem beautiful, but in reality they are not the most functional.  When choosing, it is worthwhile to navigate where the music will be listened to - indoors or out.  In addition, the portable player itself plays an important role: the better it is, the better the sound will be. </p>

    <p>  Some headphone models are not quite suitable for those who listen to music for a long time.  So, on-ear headphones begin to cause discomfort after an hour, as there is pressure on both the head and ears.  In addition, overhead models are best worn at home.  Compact earbuds are suitable for the outdoor version, in addition they are equipped with ear pads of different sizes.  Consider the features of each type of headphones in more detail. </p><h2>  Plug-in: modern and compact </h2><p>  If you are for convenience and small size, then you will like the in-ear headphones.  How are they good?  Firstly, they are compact, so they fit easily even in your pocket.  Secondly, you can choose the size of ear pads, which will ensure their comfortable wearing.  Thirdly, they are diverse in design.  For example, someone will choose classic and laconic models from Sony, and someone will like the original headphones in the form of lightning. </p>

    <p>  On the other hand, due to the design features of plug-in models, acoustic properties are greatly lost.  In addition, not everyone likes when a foreign body is located inside the ears.

    <p>  Vacuum earphones are ideal for everyday use.  They attract with ease, good acoustic characteristics.  Thanks to the silicone ear cushions that fit tightly in your ear, the earbuds don't fall out even when moving.  Light weight and compact size allow you to store headphones in your bag and pocket.  Good sound insulation is another advantage that distinguishes these varieties.  And the sound quality is also pleasing - it is powerful and voluminous, and therefore you can listen to your favorite music in excellent quality.  Popular models of vacuum headphones are created by the brands Sony, AKG, Sennheiser, Beyerdynamic - with efficiency they attract an affordable price. </p><h2>  Overhead: Great Sound </h2><p>  On-ear headphones come in different sizes, but they all have good sound, comfort and a stylish design.  These models can be open and closed, but the models of the second variety are popular.  Users choose headphones in which the membrane contact with the ear is much better, so you can listen to high-quality tracks of any style - from rock to hip-hop. </p><p>  You can use such headphones everywhere, but because of the size, many prefer to choose them for home.  The compromise option is semi-closed headphones, in which the cups are left open, but the holes are closed with a special grill or fine mesh.  Popular on-ear headphones manufactured by AKG, JBL, Harman Kardon Soho, Denon <strong>.</strong> </p><h2>  Monitor: best for computer </h2>
