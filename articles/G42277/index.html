It is located on the Dead Donets River.  Historians and geographers are still arguing about which river in those days was called Tanais - Seversky Donets, Don or Dead Donets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tanais museum reserve" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/844893.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tanais was founded in the 3rd century <span>BC by</span> Greek merchants.  They came from the Bosporus kingdom, located in eastern Crimea.  He became the northernmost Greek city.  An important strategic role was assigned to him - control of the entire northern Black Sea coast. </p><p>  Tanais was surrounded on all sides by a variety of tribes - from the Scythians to the Sarmatians.  This left an imprint on his culture and lifestyle of citizens.  Today we can say with confidence that our own, special culture has formed here. </p><p>  Through Tanais, trade was conducted between Europe and Asia.  It was the border of the <span>ancient world, the</span> main point of exchange of goods between the barbarian tribes and the Greeks. </p><h2>  First excavation </h2><p>  The ancient city of Tanais was first discovered in 1823 by Colonel I. A. Stempkovsky - correspondent of the Paris Academy.  The very first excavations were led by P.M. Leontyev, a professor at Moscow University, and later this work was headed by Professor V. G. Tizengauzen.  Since 1870 (almost 50 years), the monument has not been protected. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tanais ancient city" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/844590.jpg" width="336"></div>

Four years later, this territory was declared protected.  Soon Tanais became known to the general public.  The Museum-Reserve was opened in 1961.  Since then, everyone can see the ancient city with their own eyes, observe the excavations, get acquainted with the discovered artifacts. </p><h2>  Archaeological Museum-Reserve "Tanais" </h2><p>  This hospitable southern city has many attractions that are of cultural and historical value.  Almost all tourists arriving in Rostov, "Tanais" must visit.  It is located 30 kilometers from the Don capital, where the stately Don flows into the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  The unique <span>open-air museum</span> occupies a vast territory - more than three thousand hectares.  Here visitors are given the opportunity to see a complex of interesting cultural monuments and the history of different peoples, from the Paleolithic era to the XIX century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tanais ancient city" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/845542.jpg" width="487"></div>

    <p>  Tanais is a museum reserve located in the western part of the Nedvigovka farm.  Here you can see the territory free from buildings, which is surrounded on three sides by a deep moat.  Going closer, you will see that in different parts of this territory you can see the remains of defensive towers, houses, walls that create entire streets.  This is Tanais, an ancient city that scientists have been studying for many decades.  Today the museum is open for tourists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Exposition </h2><p>  ‚ÄúTanais‚Äù is a museum-reserve, the main part of the exposition of which is located in the open air - these are the quarters of the ancient city found during excavations.  A wide street is visible in the center of the settlement, which crossed the city from north to south.  From it, as, incidentally, in our modern cities, lanes diverge, which limit the city quarters, combined into several estates. </p><p>  Interestingly, the stone pavement of all the yards sloped towards a huge tank, into which rain water probably flowed.  Thus, the townspeople stored water in case of drought. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt=", archaeological museum reserve tanais" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/845540.jpg" width="508"></div>

    <p>  From all sides the city was protected by defensive walls, archaeologists managed to almost completely clear the western section with the remains of the towers.  Such a construction once again confirms how powerful Tanais was. </p><h2>  Necropolis </h2><p>  A necropolis is located on the western, eastern, and northern sides in the settlement, in which archaeologists of the Lower Don expedition discovered more than a thousand soil burials and barrows.  Over a long history, the city was inhabited by a rather motley, from an ethnic point of view, population.  This is confirmed by a variety of funeral rites. </p><h2>  Archaeological finds </h2><p>  Everyone who comes to Tanais (Rostov Region) can visit the museum with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 200 square meters.  It consists of several rooms.  They can be found with numerous materials collected during the archaeological excavations of Tanais.

A unique design was installed here - a <span>holographic pyramid.</span>  This is a completely new direction in museum business.  Such a device is a volume projector for any image.  That's why all the pictures in the pyramid become voluminous. </p><p>  Museum scientists in collaboration with designers invited from the capital prepared an interesting program for museum visitors that demonstrates what women were like in Greco-Sarmatian times.  You can see how they dressed, what hairstyles they had, in the smallest details to consider their jewelry.  You can see this holographic miracle in the building of the historical costume museum.  We will talk about him below. </p><h2>  Museum of historical costume </h2><p>  Here is a huge collection of historical costume.  ‚ÄúTanais‚Äù is a museum-reserve where ancient clothes, shoes and hats worn by representatives of the Bosporus, Scythian and Sarmatian cultures are represented.
