    <h2>  Travel to Khakassia </h2><p>  In the southern part of Siberia, in the valley of the Yenisei and Abakan rivers, the Republic of Khakassia is located.  This mountain taiga region is rich in water, forest and <span>mineral resources.</span>  Sixty-one percent of the republic’s territory is forest.  In Khakassia, there are more than three hundred and twenty small and large rivers and more than a thousand lakes.  By its nature, this region will delight and surprise even an experienced traveler, accustomed to the exotic of overseas countries.  Both lovers of archaeological, cultural and natural monuments, as well as those who urgently need to improve their health in the healing lakes of Khakassia, come here with pleasure.  And in these taiga forests, unique medicinal plants grow, which are very popular not only among the inhabitants of the region, but also far beyond its borders. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Those travelers who want to conquer <span>Mount Sayan</span> can easily meet deer, elk, roe deer, reindeer, Altai ular.  And to the great surprise of the tourist, it will be possible to observe animals closely, because for them meeting a person is even more rare.  Traveling through the forests of Khakassia, you will come across the pristine nature of Siberia.  You can complement the experience by visiting archaeological sites, ancient settlements and barrows. </p><h2>  Salt lakes of Khakassia </h2><p>  Well, those who prefer less active relaxation will also find a place for themselves to their liking.  A vacation spent on one of the <span>salt lakes of</span> Khakassia will forever remain in your memory as one of the best.  And you will certainly want to come back here again.  Many recreation centers in Khakassia are located on the banks of rivers and lakes.  Therefore, you can not only heal in the salty mineral springs, but also enjoy fishing to the fullest.  And before some recreation centers are considered, the lakes of Khakassia need a little presentation.  Here is some of them. </p><p>  As already mentioned, in the republic there are a huge number of reservoirs.  In twenty-four of them, the mineralization level is more than ten grams per cubic decimeter.  <span>Tus Lake</span> is the most saline lake in Khakassia and is located ten kilometers from Bele.  Salty brine in this reservoir is not inferior to the waters of the Dead Sea. </p><p>  Utichye is a lake surrounded on all sides by mountains.  And mud and water from it have been used for balneological procedures since the middle of the last century.  <span>Itkul Lake is</span> forbidden to swim and fish, as the water serves as a drinking spring for the <span>resort of Shira.</span>  Lake Shunet is located in a hollow between the mountains.  The water is salty, but in moderation.  This pond is famous for its healing mud.  Ulukgol is a natural ornithological reserve.  Water from this reservoir treats skin diseases and cellulite. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Holidays on the Red, or, as it is also called, Iodine, lake can be compared with a rest on the sea.  A lot of iodine is dissolved in its waters, and the air around it is filled with its vapors.  The listed lakes are a small fraction of the entire water wealth of the region. </p>
