The country is ideal for a budget holiday.  Compatriots love her for the clear sea, sandy beaches and decent service.  The entire Black Sea coast is built up with tourist complexes of various categories.  There are also chic five-star hotels, and four-star hotels are more modest for tourists.  Tourists who want to save money often stop at the huge Slavyanski ("Slavic") 3 * complex (Sunny Beach).  Is this hotel suitable for a budget holiday? </p><h2>  The nuances of rest in Bulgaria </h2><p>  The tourist season in Bulgaria traditionally begins in early May.  In winter, beach hotels do not work here, because the weather at this time is cold and is not suitable for swimming.  The season ends with the advent of autumn, namely at the end of September.  Most tourists come to rest in July or August.  Those who do not like crowded beaches and intense heat can visit the country in early September.  The sea temperature will be lower than in the summer months, but it is still suitable for swimming during the day. </p><p>  In addition to a beach holiday, this country is famous for health resorts offering a variety of wellness treatments.  These include <span>mud wraps,</span> treatment with sea and mineral water.  Water lovers should visit the numerous water parks of the country.  Bulgaria can offer tourists an interesting excursion program.  Many ancient and Byzantine monuments have been preserved here.  And the country is famous for its picturesque nature.  Connoisseurs of beautiful landscapes will surely like the Rila and Pirin national reserves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  The tourist complex Slavyanski Hotel 3 * is located directly on the beach of the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria.  To reach the sea, tourists need to cover a distance of only 50 meters.  The beach and the hotel are separated by a small pedestrian road, along which guests love to stroll in the evenings.  The hotel is part of the famous Sunny Beach resort, which is considered the most environmentally friendly vacation spot in Bulgaria.  The sea here is not too deep, so here you can relax with the children.  The resort has many playgrounds and pools for them.  Children's discos and competitions are constantly held.

The price for a room here is quite consistent with the quality of the services provided, but you should not hope for a luxurious reception.  This place is designed for a quiet holiday away from the hustle and bustle, so lovers of vibrant nightlife should choose another hotel.  "Slavic" is perfect for couples with young children, as well as for older people. </p>
