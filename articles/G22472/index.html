This outfit needs to be supplemented with active bracelets, the one ‚Äúweighted‚Äù with a necklace, and that dress made of crepe chiffon - add lightness with a long <span>gold chain.</span>  Surely, many girls in jewelry boxes are gathering dust that were worn only a couple of times, and then they lost their liking, there was no suitable clothing ... And there is very little favorite jewelry - its collection is limited to a couple of pendants.  Then, for example, a soutache necklace can perfectly join their company.  Each girl will find something for herself in the world of soutache, even one that is used to asceticism in jewelry.  So, what are soutache jewelery?  Let's figure it out! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="soutache decorations" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/439468.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Where did it come from </h2><p>  The very word "soutache" gives something oriental, spicy.  Indeed, many jewelry came to us from the east - we know the desire of the women there for beauty.  But this technique was born in exquisite France, during the time of high snow-white wigs, corsets for <span>hornet's waists</span> and magnificent skirts.  Women's costumes were decorated with soutache ribbons.  Then the find in fashion sailed to the Netherlands, where it was interpreted in its own way.  And, finally, after long wanderings, soutache ornaments were brought to Russia.  True, men also had the right to wear such accessories.  In the end, the southeast ornaments began to be forgotten, to recede into the past ... And only recently have the Israeli designers found a new life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Souture jewelry master class" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/439469.jpg" width="236"></div>

Their basis is a twisted, interwoven ribbon for soutache and beads, as well as all kinds of stones (fakes, semi-precious and even real precious minerals and artificial materials).  Soutache tape is an elastic thin shiny lacing, similar to a dragon tail braid.  The tape can be twisted into a spiral, bent by eights, braid stones and beads, intertwined with other shoelaces and so on.  Such jewelry is usually obtained voluminous and looks rich with a good choice of stones and lace.  It is also worth remembering that the first time a masterpiece may not work - you need skill.  Therefore, train as much as possible, and soon you will get really neat delicate jewelry. </p><h2>  Soutache jewelry: a master class for needlewomen.  How to get started? </h2><p>  You can find a lot of them, but you should always remember a few rules.  In the center of the composition is often a large stone.  So, to sheathe it, first glue it on felt.  Then we begin to sheathe it with a ribbon, piercing it exactly in the middle.  When the first round is completed, round it with a bead.  Then cut the lace and cauterize it.  The ends are important to fasten on the back of the felt.  It should be laces and ribbons of much greater length than this element requires.  Do not be afraid to twist the suture tape.  The main thing - always fasten on felt and cauterize the ends.  Complement the decoration with beads - these are not only decor elements, but also a way to tie ribbons together.  When the composition is completed, glue a felt lining on the felt so that it covers all the ends, and on it - a leather blank a little larger in size. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="southeast decoration schemes" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/439470.jpg" width="500"></div>

Because you can find something weightless, magical, bewitching, but you can stumble on a lurid and tasteless.  And you can even the most elegant decoration, and the most beautiful outfit to spoil the wrong choice.  So what to wear with soutache jewelry?  Necklaces made in this technique visually enlarge the chest, so this can be a useful decoration, and vice versa.  The more modest the pattern of the dress, the more effective the southeast jewelry will look.  Try putting them in <span>a casual style:</span> wear with shirts and jeans.  A very tightly buttoned shirt with a necklace under the throat looks very nice.  Play with color combinations: say, black ribbon, green and purple stones;  or white lace, raspberry and blue cabochons. </p><h2>  Souture embroidery - decorating your clothes </h2><p>  Here you should remember everything that has been said about jewelry from the soutache in general.  If you have not yet achieved perfection in the manufacture of necklaces, bracelets, beads and pendants - do not risk doing this on your favorite blouse, because this technique is more complicated than simple soutache jewelry.  Schemes - filigree patterns - are applied to the fabric, and then flashed with soutache tapes with absolute accuracy.  There are several options.  The first is to cover the entire surface of the product with embroidery.  Then you need a simple pattern and a minimum of ribbon colors.  It will look concise and at the same time expensive.  The second is to embroider a collar.  Now collars are very fashionable, which in themselves are decorations.  So here you can give free rein to imagination.  With proper strict design, such a blouse will not be embarrassing to wear in the office.  You can also embroider something like a necklace directly on the dress.  If you have problems with the figure, then you should not get carried away with large forms of soutache embroidery, as they will visually increase all the problem areas.  And an unsuccessful drawing or its location will also not add to your attractiveness - only age.  What is good for embroidered embroidery is that you can save your favorite thing if any defects appear on it or if it is simply fed up. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Southeast jewelry technique" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/439472.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How much is this beauty? </h2><p>  Of course, handmade jewelry is priceless, because it is unique.  All materials can be purchased at very decent prices.  But craftsmen‚Äôs crafts bought in their professional workshops or on the Internet, made to order, will cost you a pretty penny.  Since this is painstaking hard work, soutache jewelry will cost you in the amount of three thousand rubles.  However, the impression made is worth it. </p>
