The advantages of this technique are that the toe is prone to accuracy, the heel is tied back, but the appearance has similar outlines to the classic square heel. </p><h2>  The initial process in detail </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.shinyhappyworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="toe knitting socks" class="if uuid-3157476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/3157476.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting socks from the toe involves 5 stocking knitting needles, you will also need one extra to knit the heel.  However, it is not so important.  For the manufacture of a product of size 42, 100 grams of thin wool was spent on a man.  Knitting needles should be thin, as the knitting will differ in density. </p><h2>  How to create socks: master class </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.winwickmum.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting sock with toe" class="if uuid-3157478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/3157478.jpg"></div><p>  It is necessary to make a sample in advance and determine the density of the product.  After conducting an individual set of loops, the number of rows when creating the product.  To start knitting socks with a toe, you need to crochet a chain of 12 loops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can also take a knitting needle, throw a loop on it from the hook, insert the tip of the spoke into the half-loop of the chain in turn.  After you need to grab the thread and pull the loop on the spoke.  On each side of the chain there should be 12 stitches on the spoke and from the back of the chain on the second knitting needle also need to collect 12 stitches.  You can apply the method of knitting socks with a toe on two knitting needles.  More about it later. </p><p>  The first row is knitted in a circle thanks to the front loops, while the loops must be divided into 4 knitting needles of 6. </p><h2>  How to tie a toe of a product </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mylifemadecrafty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting with a toe with a boomerang heel" class="if uuid-3157488" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/3157488.jpg"></div><p>  From the second row, it is necessary to start adding on the sides after the first loop of the first knitting needle, before the last on the second, after the first on the third and before the end loop on the fourth knitting needle.  It is necessary to add loops from broaches, for this purpose, with the right knitting needle, grab the thread between the loops, put it on the left knitting needle and knit the front one behind the far wall.  The loops should be added through the row, until the moment when the toe is not equal to the width of the entire foot.  For the male product, 20 rows were knitted, and the number of stitches on each knitting needle was increased to 16, in total there will be 64 on 4 knitting needles. </p><h2>  The main part of the product </h2><p>  After that, you need to knit the product without additions, up to lifting the foot.  Next, a lifting wedge is created.  Through the row, additions should be made on the sides after the first chain on the third needle and before the last chain on the fourth.  After 16 rows on these needles, the number of loops will increase to 24, a total of 16. On the third and fourth needles, the sole of the product is made, and the toe of the toe and heel are knitted.  To create a heel, you should divide the loops on three and fourth knitting needles into three equal parts, 6 each, transfer them to a variety of knitting needles to make it comfortable to knit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Heel making </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.loveknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="double knit toe" class="if uuid-3157495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/3157495.jpg"></div><p>  We proceed to the next stage.  Knitting socks from a toe with a heel boomerang is an easy technique.  At the beginning of the process, you need to knit on the central 16 loops a pattern in reverse as well as in straight rows.  At the same time use the front surface.  The first edge loop is always removed so that the border appears in a chain.  For the heel, the number of rows corresponds to the number of loops on the spoke (multiply by 2 or equal to 32 rows). </p><p>  After completing the last row of the section, you need to dial the loops on the sides, the knitting needle should be inserted behind the edge loops, and, pulling the loop, you should dial 16. If the set goes on the wrong side, then you need to dial the loops as if knitting the loop from the inside, and on the front side of the loop must type as facial.  Having gathered loops on one side, the heel needs to be knitted in the opposite direction.  After the loops in the center, dial them on the second side of the side, and also take 16 loops on the spoke. </p><p>  After 48 heel stitches are knitted in reverse or straight rows, the center should be tied, the first hem is removed without fail, and the last is knitted together with the loop on the side. </p><p>  On the front side, two loops must be knitted together with the front loop with a broach; for this purpose, the last loop of the heel must be re-lifted to the right knitting needle without knitting after.  The first from the side you need to knit the front, after the left knitting needle you need to pick up the untied and throw it on the second.  On the wrong side, a pair of loops knit together on the wrong side.  In all rows, one loop will begin to decrease, then from one side, then from the other.  In total, 32 rows should be knit so that there are exclusively heel loops. </p><h2>  Cuff Creation </h2><p>  After making the heel, knitting a sock with a toe with knitting needles (all four) is done, you need to make eight decreases on the sides in all rows to narrow the ankle.  After this, four rows should be knitted with the help of the front surface, the cuff should be a 4x4 elastic band of 30 rows.  To finish knitting socks from the toe, close the loops of elastic.  Another sock is made according to a similar plan. </p><h2>  Multi-spoke manufacturing </h2><div class="photo" data-original="forum.knittinghelp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting socks" class="if uuid-3157499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/3157499.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting socks from the toe thanks to open loops is as follows.  The density of the process, for example, 18 loops - this is equal to 10 cm. We collect 20, 10 for each spoke.  It is necessary to knit a circle, then add along the edge, at the beginning of the row and at the end.  The further circle is created without additions, you need to knit a toe with alternating circles with and without addition until there are 18 loops each. </p><p>  When all the loops are created, they need to be transferred to one spoke and the process should be continued, based on the double hollow gum method.  Next, just knit the length of the toe up to the heel.  After we again transfer the loops to the knitting needle and continue to take the height of the elastic band about 70 mm.  Knitting ends with a 2x2 elastic band.  When closing the loops, they should be pulled harder so that the elastic does not tighten, otherwise the product will be difficult to put on your leg. </p>
