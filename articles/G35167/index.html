Finishing options in new buildings</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The popularity of new buildings in Russia is due to many factors, including ensuring the current level of organization of local infrastructure, the use of more high-tech building materials and municipal equipment.  However, far from always the benefits of the new time can be used immediately after the commissioning of the object.  In most cases, the first owners are faced with the issues of bringing the area into an optimal condition for life. </p><p>  In this regard, the pre-finishing of the apartment in the new building plays an important role.  What it is?  In essence, these are basic finishing measures in the new housing area, which are a transitional stage between the completion of capital construction and the final decorative design.  At the same time, developers in some cases completely save future residents from the hassle of repair.  It depends on the finishing option, which is implemented after the main construction work. </p>

    <h2>  Turnkey apartments </h2><p>  At first glance, this is the best option, because in this case, the newly-made owner completely eliminates the need for repairs.  In other words, the apartment provides plumbing, decorative coatings, heating systems and even furniture with objects of designer furniture.  Such objects are fully prepared for life, which is their great advantage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Typically, turnkey apartments are commissioned to customers in luxury complexes, where <span>individual approach to each client is of</span> particular importance <span>.</span>  In the economy class segment, the share of offers ready for life is about 5%.  This is due to the fact that the developers of this niche often simply do not have the financial ability to implement finishing work, not to mention the guarantee of their professional performance.  This requires new resources, usually not related to the production of capital construction. </p>

    <h2>  Fine finish </h2><p>  This is a close option to the previous finish, but with the only difference being that the owner will not find furniture in the apartment.  And in this context, it is important to note a significant aspect.  It determines what the final finish of an apartment in a new building can be.  What is this from the perspective of the future user?  This is the state of housing that he receives immediately after the transfer of the property from the developer.  At the same time, it has long been practiced to develop special projects of the same finish, design furnishings and furniture. </p><p>  Finishing is lacking in the sense that some people may be involved in basic wall and ceiling designs, while others may be involved in furniture.  That is, two diverse projects will turn out.  Again, such nuances are relevant in the categories of business class and luxury housing.  Although in the middle segments, there is an increasing interest of potential customers in finishing, which saves the owner from dirty work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Finishing Finish </h2><p>  This is the most common format, which, by the way, often suits not only the developers themselves, but also the buyers.  Reducing the cost of purchase, the possibility of individual planning and self-expression - those are the advantages that pre-finishing the apartment in a new building gives.  What does this mean in practice? </p><p>  The rooms will have empty walls, ceilings and floors.  Such surfaces do not require additional leveling or processing - they are completely ready for decorative design.  That is, the buyer will have to independently organize wallpapering, laying a laminate or other coating, paintwork and cosmetic improvements.  As for engineering support and electrical engineering, the installation of this infrastructure is not threatened by the owners.  Like apartments in new buildings with finishing finishing, such facilities receive both plumbing and heating systems. </p>

    <h2>  Rough finish </h2><p>  In this case, only utility networks will be provided.  I mean heating with radiators, water supply and electricity.  The rest may require not only decorative finishing of the surfaces, but also their basic preparation in the form of applying a primer, putty, plaster or floor logs.  Of course, an apartment with a rough finish is much cheaper than the previous options.  But it will be more demanding for further repairs.  For example, if the wallpaper can be glued on its own with due experience, then the organization of the leveling screed will be of high quality only if it is done by the hands of a specialist. </p>

    <h2>  Options without finishing </h2><p>  This is the most radical option for transferring housing to the owner, since it imposes a high share of responsibility on him.  In particular, the tenant will have to provide the apartment with a heating system, other communal systems, including plumbing.  In some cases, it is required to conduct light from the shield, and install windows.  This condition of the apartment in the future will require huge investments.  But the plus is that the owner will be able at his discretion to control the progress of work, planning his own budget. </p>

    <h2>  With or without trim - which is better? </h2><p>  Despite all the hassles associated with fine-tuning the repair work in apartments without finishing, experts still recommend precisely such options as optimal.  The fact is that developers often save on building materials during finishing work, as a result of which they implement frankly budgetary decisions.  In addition, the decoration itself also takes time. </p><p>  Therefore, if the question is how to move in faster, then remember that several months will be spent on repairs by the hands of the builder.  How can apartments in new buildings with decoration and furniture be beneficial?  Of course, this is an opportunity to quickly move in or rent out housing.  That is, if a purely utilitarian use of real estate is planned without regard to its aesthetic advantages, this option may well be justified. </p><h2>  Price issue </h2><p>  As practice shows, the difference in prices for most real estate buyers remains the main factor in the preference for a particular type of finish.  So, the difference between the condition of the apartment without finishing and with finishing design can reach 30% of the total cost.  Obviously, as the quality of work improves, it decreases to 5-3%, as is the case with the pre-clean state. </p><p>  Today, the cost of apartments in new buildings without finishing is on average 1-1.5 million rubles.  This applies to the initial segment of one- and two-room facilities.  If we talk about similar options with full design up to the furniture, then the price tags rise by 300-400 thousand. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It would be wrong to expect that the real estate market will offer the whole list of finishing options with a wide range of objects of various kinds.  It is important not to forget what determines the pre-finishing of an apartment in a new building - what is it, from the point of view of the builder?  This is an opportunity to complete the facility as quickly as possible with minimal repair costs. </p><p>  Accordingly, it is not always profitable for him to carry out quality work, investing new resources in this event.  In addition, customers themselves are increasingly gravitating not to standard design solutions in decoration, but to the realization of their own ideas.  Therefore, it is the pre-finishing that is the most common and optimal solution for both sides. </p>
