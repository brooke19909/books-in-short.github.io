It is replete with resorts and historical sites.  It welcomes noisy youth companies and families traveling with young children.  On the Greek islands are concentrated luxury hotels and budget options. </p><p>  The first tourists come to these parts in May.  The swimming season ends in September.  The mild climate of the islands provides for relaxation in the off-season.  The weather is still warm during this period, but the water in the sea can be cool. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cashmereclutch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Family holiday" class="if uuid-2347456" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2347456.jpg"></div><p>  The best hotels in Greece for families with children are in Corfu, Rhodes, Zakynthos and Halkidiki.  Some are serviced on an all-inclusive basis.  Many hotels have their own beaches, recreation areas, sports fields and outdoor pools. </p><h2>  Is it worth saving? </h2><p>  Going to Greece with children, you need to keep in mind that local food may not be suitable for kids.  Therefore, you do not need to refuse the restaurant service that local hotels offer.  Usually their menu is balanced and checked by thousands of guests.  Plus, meals in eateries on the coast or in the city center can cost a pretty penny. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Good family hotels do more than just breakfast.  They organize lunch and evening meals according to the "Buffet" system.  Choosing such a hotel, you will always be sure that the child will not remain hungry, and his diet will be varied.  The menu of hotels in Greece abounds with dishes of fresh vegetables and fruits grown on the islands. </p><h2>  How to choose a hotel? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bellavitatravels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Traveling with children" class="if uuid-2347455" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2347455.jpg"></div><p>  Experienced tourists who travel with the whole family believe that choosing a good hotel is not so difficult.  You need to carefully read reviews, not only about the hotel that interests you, but also about the area in which it is located.  Do not neglect negative comments.  There is some truth in them, which is better to be prepared for. </p><p>  If in doubt, choose a <span>network hotel.</span>  Usually a well-known brand is the guarantor of quality service.  Before booking, please read the map carefully.  Pay attention to the location of playgrounds, children's and family cafes, parks, grocery stores and shopping galleries. </p><p>  Experienced tourists are advised to exclude objects that are adjacent to popular attractions or are located near the train station.  Usually in such places it is noisy and crowded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Optimal options </h2><p>  The rating of the best hotels in Greece for families with children, according to our compatriots, is headed by the following hotels: </p><ul><li>  Vincenzo Family Rooms; </li><li>  Aristy Mountain Resort; </li><li>  "Grande Britan"; </li><li>  "Grotta"; </li><li>  Fedrides Delphi; </li><li>  "AVA"; </li><li>  King George </li><li>  "Aroma Daryos Eco"; </li><li>  Lilyum Villas; </li><li>  Negroponte Resort Eretria; </li><li>  "Antique"; </li><li>  ‚ÄúTheater Hotel Odyssey‚Äù; </li><li>  Pension Marianna; </li><li>  "Dayos Luxury Livin"; </li><li>  "Casa Vita." </li></ul><h2>  Vincenzo Family Rooms </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Complex &quot;Vincenzo Family&quot;" class="if uuid-2347454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2347454.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel is located in Tinos.
