    <h2>  BetOnMarkets Features </h2><p>  For trading to be successful, it is better to first pay attention to the BetOnMarkets review.  Binary options suggest a serious attitude to work.  Therefore, you should outline an action plan for yourself.  It might look like this: </p><ol><li>  Refill.  For this, a small amount is enough, for example, $ 5.  This allows you to test yourself, and only after that start earning.  The lowest value of the option is 1 dollar.  This avoids investing significant amounts in a single attempt. </li><li>  Verify account.  This must be done so that you can withdraw funds in excess of the set value.  The fact is that from an unconfirmed account, the system allows you to withdraw 10 thousand in any currency.  The limit is limited to this value. </li><li>  Equally important is the fact that the company cooperates with reliable and reputable banks.  Among them are International Bank Wire and Lockal Bank Transfer, which allow you to withdraw up to 100 thousand dollars. </li><li>  Choose your favorite tool and strategy from those offered by the broker.  Therefore, each client prefers the most attractive trading methods.  A wide range of assets is available for work.  It represents goods, stocks, currency pairs, indices. </li></ol><p>  Of no less importance is the loading speed of the charts.  The effectiveness of trade depends on the quality of images and materials.  Even with the Internet at a slow speed, fast downloads occur.  This allows users to watch out for the most important details. </p>
