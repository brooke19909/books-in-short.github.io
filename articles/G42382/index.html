In area, it is approximately equal to the territory of Finland or Poland.  Looking at the map, it is difficult to imagine that the territory of this elongated country is more than three hundred thousand square kilometers.  If you drive along its coast, you can see that the distances between cities here are more in line with Siberian standards than European ones.  The extreme eastern regions extend to the northwestern borders of our country. </p>

    <p>  In the extreme east is the tiny city of Kirkenes (Norway), which we will go to today.  More than 2500 km separates it from Oslo, and the distance to Murmansk is only 230 km.  For this reason, our compatriots are frequent guests in the Kingdom of Norway. </p><h2>  City of Kirkenes </h2><p>  It is the largest port and extreme city on Earth.  Note that the city of Kirkenes (Norway) is located on the border with Russia.  The population is small - only three thousand people, and most of them are Russians.  The sights of the city clearly indicate that Russia played an important role in the history of Kirkenes.  We will talk about this a bit later. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  The location of the city undoubtedly affects its climate.  From late November to early January in Kirkenes a polar night.  At this time, the daylight hours are no more than two hours.  In July, the sun practically does not go beyond the horizon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Monthly average temperatures range from -11.5 ¬∞ C (January) to + 12.6 ¬∞ C (July).  About 450 mm of precipitation falls annually.  The lowest recorded temperature was -41 ¬∞ C;  the highest is 32.7 ¬∞ C. </p><h2>  Kirkenes (Norway): History </h2><p>  This northern city and the territories adjacent to it were for a long time in Norwegian-Russian joint use, until 1826.  It was this year that the demarcation of the borders that exist today was carried out.  Modern Kirkenes (Norway) got its name in 1862.  It is translated from Norwegian as the Cape Church.  Prior to this, the city was called Pisselvnes. </p><p>  During the war with Germany (1941-1945), Kirkenes (Norway) was occupied by Nazi troops.  He was subjected to terrible, destructive bombing.  Historians argue that the only fascists bombed only Malta.  And only in 1944 did the Soviet Army liberate the village. </p><h2>  Things to do in Kirkenes, Norway </h2><p>  I must say that there are not many memorable places in this town.  However, they are all very significant for the townspeople, since most of them are connected with the most terrible war in the history of mankind.  Let's get to know them in more detail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Andersgrott bomb shelter </h2><p>  The construction of the bomb shelter was started by the Norwegian architect Anders Elvebach in 1941.  Shelter was later named in his honor.  In 1990, it became available to visitors. </p>

    <p>  After the occupation of the city in 1940, German troops were concentrated on the northern frontier.  This region was the most fortified in Europe, so more than three hundred air raids were made on the city.  In Kirkenes, 1 015 times an air alert was announced, after devastating raids only 230 houses survived. </p><p>  The Andersgrott catacombs had two exits and could shelter from 400 to 600 people in their dungeons.  Thanks to this construction, the lives of many people were saved.  Visitors to the bomb shelter are given the opportunity not only to walk through the underground tunnels, but also to watch a very truthful documentary about military operations in this city, based on archival documents.  The film is voiced in Norwegian and duplicated in German and English. </p><h2>  Museum of Frontier Lands </h2><p>  Kirkenes (Norway), whose photo you see in this article, has another interesting monument.  This museum is located in a picturesque area around the city.  Its main exposition is dedicated to the most destructive and bloody war in history. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Some halls introduce visitors to the museum with ancient Sami culture, history and nature, bordering the Russian Federation.  The museum presents a panorama demonstrating how the Norwegian partisan transmits data on the movements of the Nazi fleet from the observation post to Soviet troops.  Here, in a place of honor next to the <span>flag of Norway,</span> is the banner of the Soviet Union in memory of the heroic liberation of the city. </p><p>  But the main exhibit of the museum is the Soviet aircraft Il-2.  He was shot down in 1944 over the territory of Norway and fell into the lake.  In the postwar years, it was raised and restored.  The image of the legendary plane is the hallmark of the city. </p><h2>  Russemonumentet </h2><p>  It should be noted that Kirkenes (Norway) is distinguished by a very careful attitude of local residents to the monuments dedicated to the events of the Second World War.  This memorial is dedicated to the Soviet soldiers-liberators in gratitude to the people of Norway for the liberation of Kirkines in 1944.  The well-known Russian monument outside the city, as the locals call it, was erected on the square of Royal Amundsen almost immediately after the great Victory.  The author of the composition was Stinius Fredriksen, the pedestal of the sculpture was designed by Goodolf Blackstad.  In the process of creating the monument, its initial image was somewhat changed: the coat of arms of the Third Reich was removed from it. </p>
