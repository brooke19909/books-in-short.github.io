This is one of the largest flat reservoirs in the country - Novosibirsk.  Often it is called the "Ob Sea".  This definition is due not only to its size.  Recreation facilities on the Ob Sea for several decades were for residents of the largest industrial and scientific center a quite acceptable alternative to the popular resorts of the far Black Sea, from which Novosibirsk is separated by a significant geographical distance.  The idea that you can reach your own "sea" very quickly was pleasant to the residents of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation facilities on the Ob Sea" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/293868.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Novosibirsk, the Ob Sea.</strong>  <strong>Recreation facilities</strong> </p><p>  The reservoir was finally formed in its current shape by 1959, after the completion of the construction of the dam of the <span>Novosibirsk hydroelectric station.</span>  It was intended to rotate turbines of a hydroelectric power station and provide the region with electric power.  And, of course, to ensure uninterrupted water supply to more than a million cities located a little lower along the river.  Recreation facilities on the Ob Sea arose a little later.  The reservoir has a very large recreational potential.  It is due to the natural features of the reservoir, stretching from north to south along the Ob River for more than 220 kilometers.  The width of the reservoir ranges from 2 to 23 kilometers, and it really looks like the sea with its vast water surface.  The coast here for a considerable extent is covered with dense coniferous and mixed vegetation, there are many bays, backwaters and islands of different sizes and shapes.  Recreation facilities on the Ob Sea were located very well for vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novosibirsk Ob Sea recreation" class="if" height="273" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/293870.jpg" width="497"></div>  Siberian nature has its own characteristic visual expressiveness, which is generously represented along the entire coast of the Ob.  Over time, these places become one of the most popular destinations.  For tourists from the central regions of the country and abroad, local realities turned out to be attractive - Siberian ethnographic and natural exotics, the Ob Sea, recreation centers.  Photos of these shores are already habitually adorned with advertising materials from travel agencies inviting the public to Siberia for a vacation.  And staying in these places is attractive both in terms of natural climatic factors and price parameters.  There is good ecology, the entire industry of the region is concentrated much north, downstream of the Ob. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ob Sea recreation photo" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/293871.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Recreation facilities on the Ob Sea - what to choose?</strong> </p><p>  The tourist infrastructure on the Novosibirsk reservoir has been built quite well in recent years.  Those planning a visit to its shores have a wide choice.  Among the most popular tourist sites are the following: "Khmelevka" in the <span>Karakan forest, a</span> convenient quiet place for family vacations and fishing;  "Balush", a tourist base located in a coniferous forest ten minutes walk from the coastline;  "Brigantine", a place farther from the regional center, which is popular among lovers of sailing and water-motor sports. </p>
